			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Vasiliy Grigoriyevich Samokhvalov, </F> prominent lawyer and one of the authors of the Law on Television  and Radio Broadcasting, by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro"  program -- live]    [Text] [Lomakin] I now propose that television viewers join  our discussion in which we will talk about something that is  probably of great interest and that will be very important next  year, something that concerns everyone -- about television and  radio broadcasting. My guest is Vasiliy Grigoriyevich  Samokhvalov, a prominent lawyer and one of the authors of the  Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting, which has not yet been  adopted....    [Samokhvalov, interrupting] Unfortunately.    [Lomakin] Yes, it is only on paper so far. We will talk  about some of the president's latest edicts concerning  television and radio broadcasting. So, a Russian Federal  Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting has been  established. Has a Gosteleradio [State Committee for Television  and Radio Broadcasting] been revived?    [Samokhvalov] I would not say so. After all, the Ministry of  Information and the Press has been reorganized. Two services  have been established on its base which, depending on how they  organize their work, will either justify their existence or be  reorganized once again. But according to the plan and the text  of these edicts, very important functions have been vested in  these services. This includes support for state and nonstate  television, registration of television companies and mass media,  and so forth.    [Lomakin] You know, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, I think that the  viewers are absolutely uninterested in all these  behind-the-scenes affairs of ours, even in our journalistic and  editorial affairs. I mean, such things as the furniture we use  and the equipment we work with. Only one thing about this edict  concerns them: Will television be better? Will their favorite  programs disappear or remain? Will they move to other channels  or broadcast times, and so forth?    [Samokhvalov] We must understand one thing, that a great  deal  depends on the normative or legislative basis of television. It  is much the same with health laws, for instance. Sooner or  later they will have an influence on our health. Will we get  free medical treatment or we will get good or bad medical  treatment? This also goes for television. These edicts create  a certain legal space which gives domestic television an  opportunity to work better. I think that if the new Federal  Assembly adopts the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting  which reflects the necessary articles, then television will be  able to work better, and consequently this will be borne out in  its programs and television will be directed more toward the  interests of our esteemed television viewers.    [Lomakin] Now take a look, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, at what an  interesting thing we get -- a certain idea lies behind the  framework of the edict that one television channel will remain a  state channel, and the second channel will be privatized,  auctioned off, and will carry independent television company  programming. Yet we are already running into contradictions  with our television viewers. We are trying to put a lot of  advertising into our programming, and this irritates the  television viewers. They do not like this, yet we survive from  advertising. How will the state channel differ from the  nonstate channel?    [Samokhvalov] There are some existing norms. For instance,  the Law on Mass Media determines that advertising must not total  more than 25 percent of the broadcast time of television  programming. A separate draft law is being prepared on  advertisements in the mass media. I think that this is  precisely where problems of placing advertisements in feature  films and other television programs will be dealt with in  greater detail. In other words, this requires normative and  legislative regulation.    [Lomakin] Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, let us switch from  television to the very, very latest problems. The fact of the  matter is that as far as we know, the Russian Press House is  supposedly being transferred for use by the Federal Assembly.  In other words, the journalists will be kicked out of it and  the newspapers will be kicked out. So, do journalists have any  rights, in general, or not? I am curious.    [Samokhvalov] Journalists? I feel very sorry for you because  you are the anchorman of one of the more interesting programs  and you should know your rights. Of course, you also have  responsibilities, according to Article 47, to find and request  information, visit various organizations, take notes, and so  forth. All of these rights exist, and they are in effect. There  are journalists' responsibilities, and I think that the Law on  Television will permit a more specific determination of the  rights of television journalists, for instance, or radio  journalists.    [Lomakin] What about the Russian Press House? That is the  issue I was leading up to. Let us look at that issue. Who will  get the Russian Press House? If the Federal Assembly gets it --  and I understand that this could be justified -- where will the  newspapers and the journalists go?    [Samokhvalov] Where will they go? I think that there must be  an administrative building available in Moscow. Just take a  look. Only recently the Ministry of Security was eliminated.  This means a complex of buildings on Dzerzhinskiy Square.    [Lomakin] But you know that the time between the publication  of the edict on the elimination of the ministry and the vacating  of the buildings may amount to several years. I think that this  is what will happen.    [Samokhvalov] The Ministry of Information and the Press has  also been eliminated. It occupied a building in the very center  where the editorial offices of the newspapers NOVOYE VREMYA,  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, NOVYY MIR, and so forth traditionally have  been located. I think that the journalists could very easily  move into the premises of the eliminated departments. I think  that this problem is a little far-fetched.    [Lomakin] Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, thank you. We do not have  much time left, so I must say that I am satisfied only by one  thing, and that is the fact that television journalists will  probably not have to vacate this building next year.    [Samokhvalov] I hope not. I would also like to express my  hope that you will more actively defend the rights of television  viewers on the basis of a knowledge of your own rights as  journalists. I hope that next year this building will not come  under fire, either from weapons or public opinion. I count on  the formation of public councils at state television and radio  companies which will ensure mutual links between state  television and television viewers. I wish you every success.    [Lomakin] Thank you, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich. I hope that we  will work together with you because journalists need  professional lawyers like never before. Our guest was Vasiliy  Grigoriyevich Samokhvalov, head of one of the independent  information agencies known as ROSSIYSKOYE PRAVO [Russian Law].  Thank you.    [Samokhvalov] All the best.</p>

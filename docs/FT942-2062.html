			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: EDP falls to Pounds 2.06m at midway Electronic Data Processing, the computing services company, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 2.06m for the half year to March 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 7.35m to Pounds 7.18m. The company attributed the fall to continuing pressure on hardware prices, tough trading conditions and reduced interest income of Pounds 251,000 (Pounds 300,000). Cash balances at March 31 were Pounds 12.6m, and the company is seeking to acquire compatible software businesses. Mr Michael Heller, chairman, said takeover discussions were taking place but were dependent on a more 'realistic' attitude to pricing on the part of the vendors. Earnings per share dipped to 5.12p (6p), but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.667p.</p>

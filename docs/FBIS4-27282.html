			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Tuesday [31 May] his ministry is ready to issue  additional revenue estimates on a planned tax reform if it is  requested to do so.    His comments came amid mounting criticism of a report issued  last Friday by the ministry which presents net revenue estimates  for fiscal 2000 after ongoing 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts and an  increase in the consumption tax to between 7 percent and 10  percent in April 1997.    The consumption tax is currently levied at 3 percent.    The estimates were just mechanical calculations for the  government's Tax Commission to promote "quantitative," instead  of simply abstract, discussions, Fujii told a news conference  after a morning cabinet meeting.    "If requested to offer additional estimates, we must  consider  doing so," he said, noting the report does not include any  policy implications from the ministry.    Against this backdrop, Fujii said the report omitted all  items that need policy decisions such as correction of unfair  tax systems and administrative reform.    The report, submitted at the request to the Tax Commission  and the ruling coalition parties, drew the criticism that it  failed to include a tax hike to under 7 percent, a natural tax  revenue increase, or possible effects of fiscal and  administrative overhauls.    It also met criticism by setting conditions for redemption  of  stopgap bonds in 10 years and financing an expected increase in  welfare spending entirely by way of the tax hike. The stopgap  bonds are to fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and  the hike.    After reviewing the report Friday, the ruling coalition  government asked the ministry for further estimates, including a  consumption tax hike of between 4 percent and 6 percent, a  "natural" revenue increase, and a 20-year maturity for the  stopgap bonds, a ministry official said.    Some members of the advisory panel to the prime minister  also  urged the ministry at a meeting last Friday to brief them on  estimates for a consumption tax hike to 6 percent, panel members  said.    Referring to the delayed official signing of a merger by  three second-tier regional banks, Fujii said that it stemmed  from "clerical problems," adding there will no change in the  merger planned for January, 1995.    Kita-Nippon Bank, Tokuyo City Bank, and Shokusan Bank said  Monday they will postpone the signing slated for Tuesday because  of a backlog in paper work.    But labor unions have voiced strong opposition to the move,  posing a threat to the planned January merger.    This would be a big blow for the Finance Ministry, which is  positively backing such a merger to revitalize the banking  industry.    Fujii said, "we believe the merger will benefit the region's  economy."</p>

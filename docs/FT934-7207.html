			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (3): He liked it so much, he wears the company - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the high-profile world of luxury goods / Joe Kanoui JOE KANOUI adores luxury goods. 'If I were in the nail manufacturing business, I would be rich because I would not buy so many of my products,' he says wistfully. 'But they are so beautiful]' It is just as well. Kanoui is chairman of the new Vendome luxury goods group formed in August by putting together the luxury goods interests of Richemont, the Swiss holding company based on the South African Rupert family's Rothmans tobacco fortune. The main components of Vendome are the legendary Cartier jewellery maker, which has been rebuilt in the past two decades by Kanoui himself, and the Dunhill tobacco and leather products company. Kanoui, a French merchant banker by training, wears and carries goods made by all the group's subsidiaries with enthusiasm, even a Dunhill pillbox 'now that I am getting older.' He decamped from Paris to Geneva in the late 1960s to set up his own business. He soon found himself faced with the opportunity to reunite the Paris, London and New York outlets of the venerable Louis Cartier jewellery maker, which were under separate ownership. It took him and his financial partners, who included the Rupert family, six years to complete the restructuring, establishing a headquarters in Geneva and concentrating the production back in Paris. He has headed Cartier ever since, broadening its range to leather goods and accessories and enlarging its retail network from 10 to 100 owned shops around the world. Sales last year topped Pounds 700m. Throughout the 1980s, both Rothmans and Cartier continued to expand their luxury goods lines, adding such well known names as Piaget and Baume &amp; Mercier (watches), Montblanc (pens), Chloe and Karl Lagerfeld (women's fashions) and Hackett and Sulka (men's clothing). Along the way, Kanoui has evolved something of a theory of luxury goods. He attributes their popularity to 'man's basic need to affirm his identity, to distinguish himself from others,' and cites the early and strong demand of the Japanese for famous brand goods. But, one objects, when so many Japanese women carry a Louis Vuitton bag, where is the distinction? 'If you make something for all, it no longer has luxury,' he replies without hesitation. 'Above all, you must avoid thinking that expensive things are necessarily luxurious. Caviar, for example, is not a luxury good, merely an expensive consumable.' In his view, a genuine luxury product must be instantly recognisable, like a Dunhill lighter or a Mont Blanc pen, and it must be authentic, rooted in history, like the bejewelled Cartier panthers. Obviously, luxury goods must be of the highest quality, made to endure. He claims to have a watch his grandfather bought from Louis Cartier himself - and it still works. 'I hate throwaway things, like matches,' he says. He recalls Cartier eight years ago making a key case for a Rolls-Royce car owner. It was fashioned in the shape of the car, with diamonds for headlights, rubies for rear lights, and sapphires for door handles. 'It probably cost as much as the car, but it will turn up in Sotheby auctions long after the car has disappeared.'</p>

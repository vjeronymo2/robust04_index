			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / ECC to hold payout after demerger: English China Clays falls to Pounds 88.1m while construction side Camas rises to Pounds 16.6m English China Clays promised the total payout to shareholders would be at least maintained at the 20p 1993 dividend after the demerger of its construction materials division this summer. The new company will be called Camas and is expected to have a market value of between Pounds 250m and Pounds 300m. It will pay a 3.75p 1994 final dividend. ECC yesterday set out the capital structure and board of Camas, and details of the timetable for the split, mooted last summer. Shares will be given to ECC shareholders on a one-for-one basis. The news accompanied results for 1993, which showed group pre-tax profits down from Pounds 100.2m to Pounds 88.1m. The Camas business lifted operating profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.9m before one-off costs. The split will leave ECC to concentrate on its minerals and speciality chemicals business, with a continuing cash flow from sales of its housing land bank. Camas operates in Europe - largely in the UK - and in the US, integrating quarrying, coated stone, concrete products and road surfacing activities. Mr Andrew Teare, ECC's chief executive, said the demerger would enable both businesses to grow in international markets, and separate businesses that 'had bugger all to do with each other'. Camas had net debt of about Pounds 67m at the end of 1993, adjusting for this month's Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21.5m) acquisition of Kost Brothers in the US, but borrowings will be Pounds 25m higher at the demerger which is a seasonal peak. Capital employed in Camas was Pounds 278.8m at the year end, and it generated cash during the year of Pounds 31.9m. Once demerged it will bear a Pounds 1m annual cost of being an independent group. The continuing ECC business will have debt of around Pounds 200m and shareholders' funds Pounds 520m to Pounds 530m, Mr Patrick Drayton, ECC finance director said, giving gearing slightly higher than the 33.8 per cent at the end of 1993. The total cost of the demerger exercise would be around Pounds 4m. Camas is to be chaired by Mr Maurice Warren, chairman of Dalgety and South Western Electricity. Mr Alan Shearer, managing director of the division, will be chief executive, and Mr David Tidmarsh will join from Foster Yeoman, the private aggregates group, as managing director. The demerger is due to become effective on June 1, after a special meeting on May 31, with shares going to holders on the register on May 27. Lex, Page 26 Details, Page 30</p>

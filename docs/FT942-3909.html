			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Councils divided on local government review Councils in several counties are bitterly divided over the local government review on the eve of the announcement of the first final proposals from the Local Government Commission. Proposals to reorganise councils in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent and Oxfordshire will be announced today with Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Lancashire following by the end of the week. The commission will then launch a public consultation in an attempt to find consensus on whether boundaries should be redrawn and on whether the current two-tier system of counties and districts should be replaced by all-purpose 'unitary' authorities. But councils in several of the counties affected are bitterly divided over the review while the commission appears to be at loggerheads with the government. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has said he wants unitary solutions to emerge in most cases, but the commission is expected to recommend keeping two tiers for most of Hampshire and Kent. In all the other counties involved the commission will recommend unitary authorities to be created by merging existing district councils. Sir John Banham, commission chairman, said last week that the level of support for unitary councils in the shires was 'very low indeed', and said he did not want to see a 'Balkanisation of local government'. Backbench Conservative MPs from Kent and Hampshire have announced support for the two-tier status quo, while Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has said that he prefers the status quo in his home county of Oxfordshire. All proposals to reorganise counties must be passed by parliament. Lobbyists for county councils believe their best chance to force concessions from the government comes this month, after it has been weakened by results in parliamentary by-elections and the European elections.</p>

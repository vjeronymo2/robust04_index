Japanese and European Commission trade officials set the  level of Japanese auto exports to the trading bloc in 1994 at  984,000 vehicles, up slightly from 980,000 for 1993, the  officials said. The negotiations were based on a 1991 accord  between the two sides to monitor Japanese car exports to the EU  until the end of 1999, after which all EU restrictions on car  imports will be lifted.    In the talks in late February, the European Commission  forecast no growth in European demand for cars this year, while  Japan is looking for a slight increase.    The levels set for 1993 had to be renegotiated in September  after demand in the EU markets sank more than expected. The  1993 target represents a drop of 18.5 0.000000rom the previous year.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Fund managers 'fail to disclose full fees' THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds is urging regulators to make fund managers disclose full costs to their clients. According to Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the association's investment committee, the association will soon write to Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry. The letter will ask whether Imro considers the extent to which full disclosure of fees and charges is made when deciding whether a fund manager is 'fit and proper' to carry out investment business. Yesterday the association, the trade body for the pensions industry, unveiled the results of a year-long study on fees and indirect charges which concludes that practices in the industry allow managers to profit without their clients' knowledge. While fund managers typically charge their clients a 'headline' fee equal to between 0.15 and 0.25 per cent of assets under management, there are other charges which are not easily evident, the association says. These include additional management fees for investments in unit trusts, custody charges and failure to pay competitive interest rates on cash balances or on balances arising from settlement failures. The association says it has been unable to determine the extent of fund managers' revenues earned from hidden fees. However, Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said his firm had conducted its own study and concluded that, on average, fund managers earn nearly twice as much from clients as the 'headline' charge to the client indicates. Mr Fitzpatrick said the Bacon and Woodrow study probably underestimated the actual remuneration because it could not accurately quantify the additional fees earned by fund managers who arranged foreign exchange and securities transactions through their own affiliates. 'We found that trustees and clients did not know what their manager was up to and their consultant could not help them,' said Mr John McLaughlan, investment director at United Friendly Insurance and chairman of the NAPF group that wrote the report. In particular, the group singled out property investment, saying clients are in the dark about how much they are paying. Because fee structures are unclear and because they are largely transaction-driven, they could encourage property fund managers to buy and sell portfolios for no other reason than to generate income, the group added.</p>

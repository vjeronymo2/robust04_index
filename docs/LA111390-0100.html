			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BISHOPS CALL ON BUSH TO AVOID WAR  </P> <P> The nation's Roman Catholic bishops Monday overwhelmingly endorsed a statement  urging the Bush Administration to avoid war in the Persian Gulf, except as a  last resort, and to use restraint to prevent civilian casualties if diplomatic  efforts fail.  </P> <P> In approving the statement drafted by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony by  a vote of 249 to 15, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops became one of  the first major U.S. groups to challenge the Bush Administration's policy in  the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Mahony stressed the "just war" doctrine -- enunciated in pastoral letters by  the bishops in 1983 and 1986 -- which says that the use of force must be "a  final and last resort." He added at a news conference, "It would be our  judgment that today we are not at that moment."  </P> <P> The group also agreed to make the gulf crisis a special focus of its annual  fall meeting, which opened Monday. However, a move to debate the issue in a  public session was narrowly headed off by more conservative bishops, who opted  instead for a closed discussion Wednesday.  </P> <P> The statement urging the Administration to "stay the course of persistent,  peaceful and determined pressure against Iraq" was sent by Mahony last week as  an open letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  </P> <P> It noted the "just war" doctrine and said that if war becomes inevitable, "the  military means used must be commensurate with the evil to be overcome and must  be directed at the aggressors, not innocent people." This means that any war  would have to be limited, the statement said, and it rules out tactics that  "could clearly target civilian lives."  </P> <P> Any military action should also be sanctioned by international assent and by  Congress, the statement added.  </P> <P> Presenting the letter for formal approval Monday, Mahony said it was written  expressly with a view to influencing Administration policy. It was dispatched  to Baker before Bush's announcement last week of a buildup of forces in the  gulf -- action that Mahony called "a significant new ingredient" for debate.  </P> <P> Mahony's stated judgment that the gulf crisis does not yet justify military  force was echoed by Thomas J. Gumbleton, auxiliary bishop of Detroit. "It is  very clear that the conditions of a 'just war' are not fulfilled in this  instance," he said during debate.  </P> <P> Gumbleton last week had said he would ask the bishops to sign a statement  asking Catholic soldiers to become "selective conscientious objectors" and  actively resist offensive deployment.  </P> <P> Mahony several times noted with approval Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offer  for a "deep dialogue." But despite Hussein's call for dialogue Sunday, on  Monday the Iraqi leader seemed to reject an emergency summit proposed by  Morocco's King Hassan, saying that talks might be used as a cover for an  "American-Zionist" attack on Iraq.  </P> <P> The bishops' agreement to push for further debate -- a move that could result  in an even stronger statement against U.S. policy in the gulf -- seemed to be  spearheaded by several of the same bishops who have been most strongly opposed  to accepting any ethical basis for maintaining a nuclear deterrent.  </P> <P> Leading the move were Gumbleton, Bishops Francis T. Hurley of Anchorage,  Alaska, John F. Kinney of Bismarck, N.D., and Michael H. Kenney of Juneau,  Alaska. Kenney, in debate, declared himself "appalled" that the Persian Gulf  crisis was virtually ignored by most candidates in last week's elections.  </P> <P> Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, a more conservative voice, led a countermove to  keep the discussion off the public agenda of the conference and place it  instead in Wednesday's closed-door executive session. The proposal barely  passed by a 126-118 vote.  </P> <P> Mahony, speaking to reporters, made it plain that he voted against Cardinal  Law's move to close the discussion. He added: "I am going to encourage a public  statement of some kind which will (help stimulate) public debate before we  leave here."  </P></p>

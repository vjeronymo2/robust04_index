			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / People: Yamaichi International (Europe) The appointment of James Hogarth as head of the capital markets group at Yamaichi International (Europe), the London-based European arm of the Japanese securities house, is further evidence that Japanese financial institutions are committed to their policy of appointing more non-Japanese employees to senior management positions. More than half of the upper echelons at Yamaichi is now non-Japanese. The same ratio is also evident at Nomura International, the leading Japanese securities house and one of the first to adopt this policy of 'localisation'. Hogarth, who joined Yamaichi as a graduate, has worked in the corporate finance department for over seven years and at the ripe old age of 29, is one of Yamaichi's youngest executive directors. He takes over from Masaaki Fujimoto who recently returned to Tokyo to become head of the European section of Yamaichi Securities' international finance department.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO launches damage limitation exercise - The Kuwaitis' efforts to rebuild their tarnished image in Spain THE Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) may be poised to take advantage of falling share prices to increase its positions in some of its Spanish industrial investments. This would offset some of the damage being done to its image as a long-term investor in Spain by the collapse of its large chemicals affiliate, Ercros. An emergency meeting in Kuwait yesterday between the KIO management and the Kuwaiti government, triggered by a growing row in Spain over the Ercros crisis, decided to appoint Peat Marwick to investigate allegations of mismanagement in KIO's Spanish empire and instructed KIO to seek advice about how to 'safeguard and develop Kuwaiti investments in Spain'. It also sought to protect Kuwait's reputation as an international investor. The meeting coincides with suggestions in Madrid that the KIO could increase its stake in the foods group, Ebro, in which it already has a 40.2 per cent stake, and that it may be reconsidering its decision not to help rescue Ercros, whose holding company and fertiliser operations filed for protection from creditors last week. Peat Marwick is to report on its findings by November. While KIO battles to regain the confidence of Spanish bankers and ministers who are angry with its refusal to pump fresh capital into Ercros, the Kuwaiti agency is also being advised by Salomon Brothers on what to do with the rest of its portfolio in Spain, which includes Ebro, the Prima property group and the papermaker, Torras Papel. KIO's management is understood to be keen to make good promises made to the government that it intended to stay in Spain, but worries over the way Ercros appears to have been abandoned to its fate have led to sharp falls in the prices of shares in Ebro and Prima in Madrid. Stock in Ebro, which KIO and its Spanish managers have built up into one of the world's leading producers of long-grained rice, was trading yesterday at Pta1,500, up strongly but still half their 1992 high, on remarks by Mr Pedro Solbes, the agriculture minister, that KIO officials had told him they might increase their position in the company. Any further purchases by KIO might put the Kuwaitis into direct conflict with Mr Javier de la Rosa, KIO's former adviser in Spain who has built up a personal stake of about 20 per cent in Ebro this year. But the most interesting prospect for KIO is Prima, whose shares have come under heavy selling pressure and are now quoted in Madrid at around Pta1,800 each, down from Pta3,950 in March. At one point in 1991, they were trading at Pta7,890. In 1988, Grupo Torras, KIO's holding company in Spain, issued a Pounds 100m Eurobond, redeemable at 125 per cent in August next year, that was originally convertible into Torras shares. In 1990, however, KIO bought Torras off the stock market and the convertibility of the bond was transferred to Prima and a cash payment. By pushing Ercros into receivership, KIO may have triggered one of the default clauses in the bond. Ironically, if bond holders want it redeemed now instead of in 1988, KIO could save itself some Pounds 36m as it is redeemable this year at 102 per cent and it would also escape two coupon payments before a put option becomes available next year. That saving could be used to buy more of Prima's stock. Analysts agree in Madrid that while Prima, like most property companies, is suffering from falling property prices, its office portfolio in Madrid and Barcelona remains one of the most attractive in Spain. Last weekend, the KIO said it 'would be happy' to redeem the bond if holders wanted it to. Salomon Brothers, the National Bank of Kuwait, Creditanstalt, the Swiss Banking Corporation, James Capel and a Monaco-based broker are understood to hold most of the bonds, either on their own accounts or for clients. Even without a default on the bond - which might unnecessarily damage KIO's international investment reputation - the Ercros crisis has significantly cheapened some of KIO's more attractive assets in Spain, opening up an opportunity for it to demonstrate its commitment to the country. Nevertheless, Mr Ali Rashid al-Bader, KIO president, badly wants to be rid of Ercros, which owes Dollars 15bn. In order to do so without putting 10,500 Spaniards out of work, he is pressing hard to find buyers for all of the Ercros divisions. Freeport MacMaRon, the US commodities group which earlier this year agreed to lead a joint venture into which Ercros would place its mining and fertiliser businesses, has a team working with Manufacturers Hanover bank in Madrid to find ways of taking full control of the divisions and of securing assistance from governments in regions affected by Ercros plant closures. A number of European chemicals companies, most notably Hoechst, are said to be interested in taking over Erkimia, the Ercros chemicals division, in Catalonia. While the Spanish regional administrations try to secure the Ercros jobs in their regions, both KIO and the Spanish government remain adamant they will not pump more money into the group. Following yesterday's meetings, Mr Al Bader may be forced to feed the group small amounts of money over the summer to prevent plants closing. If he is unable to find buyers, KIO faces the distasteful prospect of an outright Ercros bankruptcy.</p>

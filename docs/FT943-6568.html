			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Business irked by orders from on high: Japan's 'iron triangle' has developed a jarring note Just over a year ago, when Japan's Liberal Democratic party lost its hold on government for the first time in 38 years, it seemed that the iron triangle between politicians, bureaucrats and business might crumble with it. The new, younger government that succeeded the LDP raised the banner of reform and offered corporate Japan the hope, along with the fear, of less government and bureaucratic meddling in corporate affairs. But just as Japanese business was beginning to enjoy the idea of freedom, the LDP is back in the seat of government and a ministerial mandate on employment practices at Japan Air Lines has dropped like a bomb to demonstrate that old practices do indeed die hard. Earlier this month Mr Shizuka Kamei, an old-time LDP politician and current minister of transport, forced Japan Air Lines to reconsider plans to hire stewardesses on a short-term contract basis. The plan, an attempt to cut costs, had already been approved by the very ministry Mr Kamei heads. Yet the minister put a halt to JAL's scheme, which other airlines had also been considering. Mr Kamei cited safety concerns and the importance of lifetime employment, and suggested that such a move would upset Japan's much vaunted practice of harmony and equality in the workplace. But business leaders, many of whom have expressed shock at Mr Kamei's handling of the affair, sense a more sinister motive. Japanese business executives have jumped on the minister's attempts to impose his views on what they believe should be a matter for private business to decide. The days of government meddling in business affairs, they fear, are far from over. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren, the Federation of Employers' Associations, criticised the minister's actions sharply, triggering an unusually vitriolic exchange of insults between the two. The controversy is such that opposition parties are preparing to grill the government on the issue when the Diet reconvenes next month. The degree of indignation expressed by normally discreet Japanese business leaders indicates that few of them accept Mr Kamei's argument that introducing contract workers into a team of full-time staff would upset team harmony and jeopardise aircraft safety. For one thing, as JAL quietly points out, the Japanese airline has been employing foreign stewardesses on contracts at lower pay than Japanese staff for more than 20 years. Nobody has ever complained and a recent report by the Civil Aviation Council recommends cost-cutting measures, including hiring of foreign - that is, lower paid - staff. Secondly, if safety were a serious concern, as Mr Kamei suggests, would this affect Japan Asia Airlines, which has already hired contract stewardesses? But not a word of complaint has come from the transport ministry on that issue. Neither is the sanctity of job security a convincing argument for business leaders, many painfully aware of the need to cut labour costs to remain competitive. For a company like JAL to deny lifetime employment to its Japanese stewardesses, may come as a shock to the generations of women for whom the airline stewardess was the epitome of modern, high-flying, career woman. Yet nobody in Japan would claim that lifetime employment was ever taken for granted other than at the largest companies. The majority of Japanese employees have no guarantee of lifetime employment. Instead, many see the minister's actions as a relic of the bad old days when politicians and bureaucrats could more or less impose their will on businesses in return for protection and a lucrative contract. As the opening up of Japan's markets to outside competition and the declining influence of the public sector have whittled away the benefits to business of this past relationship, government interference has become an inconvenience. 'The minister's actions go against the spirit of deregulation and of administrative reforms which are being implemented in October,' said an official of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business organisation. The high-handed approach of the transport minister is particularly unsettling to the Japanese business community, which has increasingly come to embrace the view that deregulation and freedom from the shackles of bureaucratic guidance are crucial to revitalising the country's economy. Officials at telecommunications companies, for example, frequently complain that Japan's slow start in the race to build an information superhighway is largely the result of bureaucratic red tape that hinders growth of new businesses.</p>

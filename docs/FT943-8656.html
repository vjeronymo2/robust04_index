			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Argos advances 16% to Pounds 15.3m - Market share rises but sales growth slows in last two months Argos, the catalogue retailer, said yesterday it had been hit hard by tax increases in April, but was still able to produce a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the first half from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 15.3m. Turnover for the 24 weeks to June 18 improved by 13 per cent, from Pounds 366m to Pounds 412.9m. Mr Mike Smith, group chief executive, said like-for-like sales had grown by 9 per cent in the first four months but had fallen to 1.3 per cent in May and June resulting in overall growth of 6.7 per cent. He said the slower growth after April was due partly to stronger comparative figures and to catalogues being in short supply after heavy demand early in the year, which had signalled an upturn in consumer confidence. Mr Smith added that the tax increases had made customers more cautious, spending less on consumer durables and more on items such as food and clothing, and occasional luxuries such as holidays and cars. However, in spite of the slowdown in sales growth and lower average ticket prices, Argos had increased market share in most product areas. While increasing its price competitiveness, Argos had held the reduction in its gross margin to 0.2 percentage points. Like-for-like sales had improved in the last two weeks since the publication of the autumn-winter catalogue, and Mr Smith said he was optimistic about prospects for the second half. An aggressive store opening programme also contributed to the increase in total turnover. Cost controls and the introduction of new systems helped Argos achieve a 19 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 9.7m). Net interest received increased from Pounds 3.42m to Pounds 3.65m. Three superstores and seven traditional stores were opened during the period with a further 13 being refurbished. A total of 32 new stores should be opened during the year, taking the chain to 348. Capital spending this year will be about Pounds 41m (Pounds 29m). However, Mr Smith said this was likely to be the peak of the opening programme, with future openings projected at 25 a year, and annual expenditure between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m. Argos expects to achieve this while continuing to add to its net cash, which averaged Pounds 146.3m in the first half. Mr Smith said the company was examining a number of options, including electronic home shopping and mail order, for future investment, but no decisions had been made. Earnings per share increased from 2.93p to 3.37p, and the interim dividend increased by almost 13 per cent from 2.35p to 2.65p. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MISSING OFFICER FOUND IN VICTORVILLE;  </P> <P> MYSTERY: MASSIVE HUNT CONDUCTED FOR BELL GARDENS POLICEMAN AFTER HE MISSES ROLL  CALL. HE IS SPOTTED WALKING DOWN STREET 12 HOURS LATER.  </P> <P> Mounted police and other officers searched Friday for a veteran Bell Gardens  police officer who was last seen walking toward the Mojave Desert after driving  himself to Victorville in a city patrol car.  </P> <P> Officer David Larimore, 35, came in early to work Friday morning, changed into  his dark blue uniform, hopped into his patrol car and left, Bell Gardens Police  Chief William Donohoe said.  </P> <P> He missed a 7 a.m. roll call, which surprised his colleagues. When they were  unable to reach the 11-year veteran on his radio by 8 a.m., they reported him  missing to surrounding law enforcement agencies. Long Beach police were asked  to check his Long Beach residence.  </P> <P> His white car, bearing a Bell Gardens police insignia, was found abandoned  shortly before noon in a vacant lot in the desert town of Victorville, more  than 100 miles away. The doors were locked. Inside were his keys, uniform  shirt, police identification, driver's license and gun, Victorville police  reported.  </P> <P> One caller, who had heard radio broadcasts about the missing officer, told  Victorville police he had seen a man wearing uniform-style pants and a white  T-shirt walking away from the car and toward the dry bed of the Mojave River.  </P> <P> Larimore's disappearance stunned his fellow officers and his wife, Donohoe  said.  </P> <P> Donohoe said none of his 50 colleagues or other friends who were interviewed  Friday recalled any erratic behavior, problems or depression that might explain  the disappearance.  </P> <P> "It's as much of a mystery to them as it is to us. . . . We are hopeful it is  something that can be explained," Donohoe said.  </P> <P> In Victorville, local police officers went door to door Friday afternoon  questioning business owners and residents. But no one matching Larimore's  description had been seen, community service officer Denise Garland said.  </P> <P> In the afternoon, 30 members of mounted posses from nearby law enforcement  agencies began scouring thea riverbed area.  </P> <P> The search was expected to continue until nightfall and then resume this  morning, Garland said. It would not have taken Larimore long to get out into  rough terrain, she Garland said, because Victorville is surrounded by desert  and mountains.  </P> <P> During the daytime, the cool weather would have worked in Larimore's favor,  said San Bernardino crime prevention officer Deborah Reagan, but at night  temperatures were expected to drop below 50 degrees.  </P> <P> "Somebody out there on foot is going to get very cold," Garland said.  </P> <P> However, Reagan said the San Bernardino sheriff's office has extensive  experience recovering lost people -- often hunters and motorcyclists from Los  Angeles, whom they call "flatlanders."  </P> <P> "The desert can be real strange at times, especially to flatlanders," she said.  "But we usually find them pretty fast."  </P></p>

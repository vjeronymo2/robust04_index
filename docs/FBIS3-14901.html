Palchevskiy; place and date  not given: "Andrzej Bortnowski: `My Task Is To Strengthen  Friendship Between Our Armies'"]    [Excerpt] [Palchevskiy] During World War II, Belarus and  Poland suffered heavy losses in population and material  resources. We are now preparing to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of Belarus' liberation from German fascist invaders  and the 50th anniversary of the victory of Soviet people during  the Great Patriotic War. Is Poland going to celebrate these  events, too? Do Poles remember being liberated by the Soviet  Army?    [Bortnowski] Yes, our nations suffered very heavy losses  during that war. The memory of the fallen is sacred. Poles,  undoubtedly, have not forgotten from where the deliverance from  fascism came. In Poland, there are graves of Belarusians who  fought for the liberation of Poland, while in Belarus are the  graves of Poles who fought our common enemy. Our nations are  fraternal, and Belarusian-Polish brotherhood in arms has been  sealed by blood. This cannot be forgotten.    With regard to the current day, the ties between our Armies  are strengthening and mutual contacts are becoming permanent and  multifaceted. As of recently, for example, working meetings  have been held between the defense ministers of both our  countries, as well as meetings between military delegations on  various levels, including border troops from your 28th Army  Corps and our Warsaw Military District.    [Palchevskiy] Not long ago, Poland was a member of the  Warsaw Pact, but now it strives to join NATO. What is the  reason? Such a step is surely designed to incite anxiety among  Poland's neighbors to the east.    [Bortnowski] With regard to the anxieties of our eastern  neighbors, it may be said with full certainty: Poland wants to  live with its all neighbors in peace and friendship. With  regard to military and political reorientation, it can be  attributed to the change of the world's general situation. In  addition, it belongs to the competence of politicians, not  servicemen. The leadership of any country, while taking care of  its security, has to adopt definite resolutions. That is all I  can say.    [Palchevskiy] Colonel, due to well-known circumstances, the  prestige of military service in our republic has suffered a  decline over recent years. What is the situation in Poland?    [Bortnowski] Military service in Poland is very prestigious  -- it is distinguished and well-paid. The prestige of the Army  rose considerably after the 1980's and the installation of the  new state leadership. [passage omitted]</p>

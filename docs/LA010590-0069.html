			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL TO ADVISE REINER ON CHILD SUPPORT ISSUE  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has established a panel to advise him  on ways to improve child support collections from "delinquent dads," attorney  Gloria Allred announced Thursday after meeting with Reiner for an hour.  </P> <P> The panel will include Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Thompson and other members  of the office along with Allred and members of the Women's Equal Rights Legal  Defense and Education Fund, an activist group. Allred said Reiner was receptive  to other ideas she presented, including airing on local cable television  stations the names and last known addresses of parents who have failed to pay  child support.  </P> <P> Allred, who was evicted from Reiner's outer office several years ago after he  refused to discuss the issue with her, said she did not promise to support  Reiner in his announced bid for state attorney general this year in return for  establishing the child support panel.  </P></p>

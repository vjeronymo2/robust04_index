They were met at the airport by Chairman of the C.C.  [Central  Committee], the Korean Christians Federation Kang Yong-sop;  Chairman of the C.C., the Korean Catholics Association Chang  Chae-chol, and other religionists.    Rev. Billy Graham published a statement on his arrival at  the  airport.    Recalling his first visit to the DPRK in April 1992, he  related the goals of his visit this time.    He said:    "First, I want to renew my friendship with the many people I  met during my previous trip, and to make new friends as well.    "Friendship is one of the most precious things in this  world.  I have learned that friendship is more important than wealth,  or fame, or power.    "The second reason I wanted to return to the DPRK is to have  fellowship with my fellow Christian believers here, and to  witness the progress of your churches.    "Christians often serve as a bridge between different  societies. That bridge brought me here two years ago, and I  believe as a result of that visit the bridge between us is  stronger now than it was then.    "During my time here I especially am looking forward to  visiting three commemorative sites. The first is the historic  birthplace of President Kim Il-song just outside Pyongyang. In  addition I am pleased to be able to view the museum at Kim  Il-song University honoring secretary Kim Chong-il. It also  will be a privilege to visit the site at Chilgol where President  Kim Il-song's mother was born.    "The third reason I have wanted to come here at this time is  to express my unswerving commitment to peace and good will  between our two nations. I am aware that I come at a  particularly complex time in our relationships, and perhaps in  some small way this visit will contribute to a new atmosphere of  mutual respect and good will and understanding."</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Sugar breaks into higher ground: A SERIES of bullish developments this week enabled the world sugar market to break free of the strait-jacket that had been confining prices for some time. Having traded mostly between 8 cents and 8.5 cents a lb since last autumn the prompt March futures position at New York's Cocoa, Sugar and Coffee Exchange leapt in mid-week to 9 cents, a level last seen on November 2, and moved on to a five-month high of 9.53 cents before edging back yesterday afternoon. Market sentiment has hardened in recent weeks as analysts' assessments of the likely sugar supply surplus in the 1992-93 season have been reduced. London trader ED &amp; F. Man now expects supply to exceed demand by some 1.5m tonnes (about 1.3 per cent of annual production), compared with the 3.4m tonnes it was forecasting earlier. And this week C. Czarnikow, another London trade house, which in November was forecasting an 830,000-tonnes surplus, this week adjusted this to a 370,000-tonne deficit (after allowing for 'unrecorded disappearance' of 600,000 tonnes ). However, the factor that changed firmness into strength this week was talk circulating among traders that Cuba had been forced to buy 100,000 tonnes of sugar from Thailand to enable it to honour supply commitments to China and other Asian countries. Cuban sugar minister Mr Juan Herrera warned earlier this month that lack of basic inputs had 'caused delays in the start-up of a significant number of mills'. Also supporting the market were: a surprise announcement of a 160,000-tonne Kenyan buying tender for next Monday; a 14,000-tonne Moroccan buying tender; talk of Cuban sales to Mexico and of a 100,000-tonnes sale to Indonesia; and a cut in Thailand's harvest forecast from 49.15m tonnes of cane to 43m tonnes. 'There have been several important changes in the statistical outlook for the 1992-93 crop cycle with adjustments to the supply side of the balance predominating,' said Czarnikow in the February 17 issue of its Sugar Review. 'Production for the season has fallen by some 1.32m tonnes since our world forecasts in November and is now expected to slip below last season's output by some 1.87m tonnes.' The trade house now estimates world sugar production at 114.57m tonnes, compared with 115.89m in November, and consumption at 114.51m tonnes, compared with 114.46m tonnes. Cocoa prices put in another steady performance as producers and consumers prepared for next week's International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) negotiations in Geneva. In late trading yesterday the New York market's May position was quoted at Dollars 932 a tonne, up Dollars 7 on the week. In London, however, that firmness was obscured by the dollar's decline against sterling and the London Futures and Options Exchange's May cocoa contract ended Pounds 3 down on the week at Pounds 734 a tonne. The Geneva meeting will mark the fourth and final attempt to agree a price-stabilisation pact to replace the moribund one that expires on September 30. Delegates were moving towards agreement at the last session, in November, that efforts to steady the market should be based on the withholding of between 330,000 and 380,000 tonnes of surplus beans from the market. But they remained far apart on how that was to be financed and on what price range was to be defended. The existing ICCA, agreed in 1986, ceased to operate as a market support pact early in 1988, when its buffer stock reached the 250,000-tonnes ceiling. All but one of the London Metal Exchange's contracts finished down on the week, the biggest fall being in copper, which closed yesterday at Pounds 1,551.25 a tonne for three months delivery, down Pounds 30.50 on the week. But, as with cocoa's fall, the culprit was the sterling rally, but for which the price would have been modestly higher. Dealers said the copper market was supported by concern over production stoppages in Mexico and Papua New Guinea and the expectation of Chinese buying on any dip to Dollars 2,220 a tonne, about Dollars 7 below the dollar equivalent of yesterday's close. But the market remained trapped in a narrow range, they added, with overhead resistance expected at Dollars 2,231 a tonne. After most of an early fall had been recovered in mid-week the aluminium market ended on the downbeat, with the cash position closing yesterday at Dollars 1,204.50 a tonne, down Dollars 4 on the day and Dollars 7.75 on the week. The market had been steady in the morning, underpinned by talk of further production cuts following Alumax's announcement on Thursday that it was reducing output by about 36,000 tonnes a year at its Mount Holly smelter. Fears that the Bonneville Power Administration restrictions could increase energy costs for some US smelters were also providing support. But prices again ran into overhead resistance and fell away during the afternoon. Among the precious metals platinum and palladium prices reversed last week's gains as confidence was rocked by nervousness about US economic policy and a report that Japanese car makers were to cut imports of the metals, both of which are used in exhaust catalysts. Dollar weakness helped gold to mount another assault on the upper end of its recent Dollars 327-Dollars 332 a troy ounce trading range on Tuesday. Once again it was repelled, as was a fresh attempt yesterday.  -----------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS      (As at Thursday's close)  ----------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium  +2,100 to 1,650,550 Copper     unchgd at   319,425 Lead         -650 to   234,425 Nickel     +1,176 to    82,164 Zinc       +7,600 to   546,600 Tin           +15 to    17,135  -----------------------------------</p>

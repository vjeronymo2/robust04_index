			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Observer: Chocolate chipped The cookies are not crumbling John Major's way these days. As if the British prime minister hasn't enough troubles, he may this week discover that one of the Conservative party's biggest supporters has had enough. The board of United Biscuits, donor of more than Pounds 1m in the past 25 years, meets on Wednesday to decide what to give in 1994. The expected figure is - zero. In the wings, sadly shaking his head, will be Lord Laing, UB's life president, who stepped down from the board in 1990 after 18 years as chairman. Laing long championed the party's cause, being rewarded for his pains with the job of joint Tory party treasurer between 1988-1993. UB has in any case been scaling-back, reducing to Pounds 40,000 its 1993 donation from Pounds 130,000 in 1991 and 1992. Unless the company's non-executives - including former Tory minister Lord Prior, as well as Lady Howe, wife of Lord Howe - kick up a fuss, the zero figure will be nodded through.</p>

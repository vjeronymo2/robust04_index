			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Burmah Castrol By today's equity market standards, Burmah Castrol is doing just about everything right. The strength of its lubricant business has helped lift profits during recession; rigorous cost-cutting has limited the damage in chemicals; sterling's devaluation should boost profits in 1993 despite dull trading conditions. That puts the company in that exclusive group which can afford to continue increasing its dividends. It is easy in all the excitement to miss the other message from yesterday's results - that the Foseco acquisition still has not fulfilled its purpose. The rationale was always to get away from Burmah's traditional heavy reliance on lubricants. Instead they still provide just over 60 per cent of operating profits. Chemicals last year were flat even after the use of Pounds 10m in acquisition provisions to restructuring costs. The deteriorating market in Germany, particularly for metallurgical chemicals, will be a further drag this year. The Foseco businesses may start to come right in 1994, but by then Burmah will also have finally unwound its LNG transport risk provision. This has been providing a Pounds 7m tax-free contribution to earnings. Without it, the company will have to run hard to stand still. It is now clear Foseco was bought far too early in the cycle. While it waits for a return, Burmah will have to rely on its marketing magic in lubricants. Its record in this area is impressive, but its greatest strength is in the consumer market rather than the industrial sector where Foseco's strengths lie. It is no comfort that management went into Foseco precisely because it was afraid that one day it would slip up in lubricants.</p>

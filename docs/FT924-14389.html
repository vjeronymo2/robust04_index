			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Move to end power plant stoppage UNION officials will meet shop stewards this morning in an attempt to resolve an unofficial walkout by more than 2,000 workers that has halted construction of the Enron gas-fired power plant, Teeside. The workers - employed by the main contractor, Wimpey, and nearly 20 subcontractors - walked out on Monday in a protest over safety standards. Enron Power Corporation said the safety issues had been addressed, but the workers refused to return until Monday unless they received full payment for the hours they had lost. The company had offered them 10 hours' money each. Enron has warned that they are in breach of agreements and are risking dismissal. Teesside officials of the main unions involved will today urge the workers to return to work immediately. Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power station operator in England and Wales, intends to be viewed 'as a private sector investment' for its next programme of station construction after 1994, Mr John Collier, its chairman, said yesterday.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Rio will be ready, the Brazilians promise WITH LESS than two months before its opening, the Earth Summit seems in danger of turning into a circus. Work has only just started on converting the Riocentro exhibition centre in Rio de Janeiro into a suitable venue for the two-week event, which is intended to be the world's biggest ever gathering of government leaders and heads of state. So far, four phone boxes appear to be the only facilities for press and delegates. A pile of rubble represents what is to be the main entrance. In the past month, Brazil's foreign minister has resigned and its eccentric but internationally respected environment minister sacked. The summit organiser is waiting to see if his resignation will be accepted and one of his main assistants has quit. So far behind are preparations that when the Islamic world asked for the conference to be delayed to accommodate a religious holiday, many suspected the Brazilians put them up to it. Although 95 countries have so far confirmed that they will be present, US President George Bush's continued snubbing of the affair is likely to result in last-minute cancellations. The later date means that Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is unlikely to be at the heads of government meeting at the end of the summit because it clashes with the trooping of the colour to mark the Queen's 40th year on throne. Mr Flavio Perri, conference co-ordinator, insists all will be well. He promises to be drinking champagne to toast the centre's completion on May 25, the date he is due to hand Riocentro over to the United Nations. Mr Perri admits that allocating accommodation for the estimated 12,000 official delegates was 'a complete nightmare'. Everyone so far has applied for the handful of five-star hotels. The Germans and Canadians are no longer speaking after a wrangle over the same hotel. The British delegates are understood to have used less than gentlemanly tactics to get the rooms they wanted. Locally-based diplomats and the Brazilian organisers are barely speaking. 'I doubt I'll survive this,' says Mr Perri. 'Either someone will assassinate me or I'll die from the strain.' Meanwhile, a cholera epidemic has finally reached Brazil's north-east and threatens to hit Rio in time for the big event. But one of the biggest threats to the event is Rio's notorious crime rate. Even with new weapons for the occasion, the Rio police will be less well equipped than the city's drug-trafficking and kidnap gangs. If Mr Bush decides after all to attend, he will stay in Braslia, the capital, because nowhere in Rio is considered safe enough. No security scheme has yet been elaborated but the army, navy and air force are all being called in to patrol the streets and French police have been giving lessons in security learnt from the 1989 revolution bicentennial. Street children who make their living from petty crime have been cleared from the streets near where delegates will stay and moved to the city centre. A road has been built from the airport to bypass the worst parts of the city. But carnival fever is in the air. Rio residents are awaiting a jamboree. The main conference days have been declared an official city holiday, taxi drivers are looking forward to booming trade, and local entrepreneurs are preparing packets of authentic Copacabana sand to sell as souvenirs.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Observer: End of mission? One of the first things on Bill Clinton's agenda, now that he is safely ensconced in the White House, is to decide what to do with America's overseas ambassadors. There are 162 of them who, unless told otherwise, must be out of their embassies within six weeks. All of the politically appointed envoys will almost certainly be made redundant. While the 127 who are career diplomats may lose their embassies, however, they will not be out of a job. One of the 127 is America's highly popular ambassador to the UK, Ray Seitz, whose future is arousing intense interest among Brits. John Major, nervous about any Clinton backlash following his party's support for President Bush's re-election campaign, has not concealed his hopes that Seitz will be reappointed. Many others of all political colours share that view. Has Britain erred by lobbying too aggressively for Seitz? History suggests he won't keep the job. One has to go back to the early years of this century to find a US ambassador in London surviving a change of president. Whitelaw Reed served Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Taft. But they were both Republicans - only John Hay, who served Presidents Cleveland and McKinley in the 1890s, withstood a change of presidential party. Seitz may survive because he is the first non-political figure to hold the job. If he doesn't, the danger for Major is that it will be seen as another blow for the 'special relationship'.</p>

Illar Hallaste, a member of the Constitutional  Commission, told ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency] that the aim of  the law was to develop the idea of how and under what  circumstances the president is to fulfill his constitutional  duties. Most controversial so far has been the clause about  presidential decrees, should the Riigikogu for some reason find  it impossible to convene. According to Hallaste, the  preliminary version of the draft law on presidency contained a  clause allowing the president to issue decrees in the case of  state of emergency or state of war. According to the adopted  law, the president can issue decrees whenever the Riigikogu is  convened for an extraordinary session but is irresolute, and the  prime minister has notified the president of this being the case  of urgent state requirements, Hallaste explained. He hopes that  this solution is satisfactory to the president as well.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointing result to Bank of England Pounds 3bn auction THE UK government bond market tumbled on disappointment over the results of the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn gilt auction. The auction of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 was covered only 1.77 times by bids totalling Pounds 5.3bn, with foreign demand failing to reach the levels expected. The average yield was 6.98 per cent with a tail - the difference between the average and maximum yield - of 1 basis point. Optimism ahead of the auction had been such that forecasts of cover had ranged as high as three times, although the low end of the range was 1.5 times. With overseas investors building up exposure to the strengthening pound ahead of the auction, some economists believed the optimism on demand overdone, particularly in view of the cash-flow squeeze on institutions. The yield curve steepened as prices fell by more than a point on gilts with maturities over 15 years. The June gilt future fell through a key support level of 104.31 to touch a low of 104.20. Rising concern about inflation was one of the factors making the long end vulnerable. THE German government bond market opened at a high level in anticipation of the Bundesbank cutting the repo rate. It rose a little more when the cut surpassed expectations, but profit-taking led the market down thereafter. The repo was cut from 8.09 per cent to 7.75 per cent, 10 to 15 basis points less than typical forecasts. The June bund contract opened at 95.52 and hit 95.60 after the repo news came through. It ended at 95.07 after falling through the 95 barrier. Volume was heavy with 100,000 contracts traded. As the cost of funding comes down at the short end of the market, the yield curve is normalising. One of the factors turning it more positive is a looming supply of 10-year bonds as public sector debt levels grow. FRANCE also took further steps towards a positively sloping yield curve. Yields on two-year stock have fallen below those on five years as investor interest concentrates on the short end of the market. Conditions seemed favourable for further cuts in French interest rates with overnight money quoted at 8.70 per cent, 30 basis points below the middle level between the two official rates. THE dollar's rally against the yen helped push the Japanese government bond market down further. The June futures contract opened a point lower in Tokyo, at 107.90, in response to the weakening of the yen against the dollar and to the fall in US Treasury prices. By the close in Tokyo, another 30 basis points had been shed from the futures contract to give 107.60 and the low of 107.48 breached the 107.50 support level. The No 145 cash bond due 2002 opened at a higher yield of 4.335 per cent and weakened to 4.42 per cent at the close. The yen's decline joined the buoyant Nikkei stock market index, which again closed above 20,000, in removing last week's twin drivers of the bond market. Concern about economic recovery was stirred up by Tuesday's sharp improvement in the index of leading economic indicators. Nervousness was amplified, however, by the onset of the Golden Week holidays, which start today and will create a bit of a vacuum until the end of next week. US TREASURY prices were mixed in light trading yesterday after a successful auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 102 19/32 , yielding 6.915 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 100, to yield 3.859 per cent. Although prices firmed overnight after Tokyo funds bought Treasuries with the dollars they had acquired from the Japanese central bank, which had intervened in the foreign exchange markets to help buoy the US currency against the soaring yen, there was no follow-through when trading opened in New York. Following Tuesday's disappointing two-year auction, which left dealers holding much of the new inventory, the market was apprehensive ahead of the Dollars 11bn five-year sale. Dealers feared that the lack of demand which sunk the two-year auction would do the same for the five-year. Some analysts noted, however, that the decline in prices that followed Tuesday's auction could help spur demand for the five-year sale. This analysis subsequently proved right. Demand for the issue was strong, although the success of the auction failed to lift longer-dated prices.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (7): Underground connections - Alice Rawsthorn examines developments in continental Europe FOR more than a decade President Francois Mitterrand's governments have unveiled Les Grands Plans for everything from architectural monuments to modernising France's airline industry. But none of his schemes has backfired quite so noisily as Le Plan Cable. Ten years ago, when the French government unveiled its ambitious plans for developing the cable television system, it painted a rosy picture of technological progress and wider cultural choice with at least 1.25m households subscribing to cable by the end of this year. Le Plan Cable is running well below expectations with just over 800,000 French homes connected to cable. There is no shortage of scapegoats. There have been damaging disputes over technology. Canal Plus, the dynamic pay-TV station, has coaxed subscribers away from cable. The television market is so over-crowded that La Cinq, one of the terrestrial channels, filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. But the fact remains that, so far, President Mitterrand's Le Plan Cable has been a flop. Over the border in Belgium, the picture is very, very different. At a time when France's fledgling cable system is struggling to establish itself, the Belgians are tussling with the opposite problem of adapting to life in a mature market. Belgium has the highest penetration level of cable television in western Europe with 88 per cent of all households plugged into a network. The penetration level is still rising, but very slowly. The Belgian operators are now concentrating on upgrading their existing systems from 300MHz to 450MHz formats so that they can carry more channels, thereby boosting their revenue. The contrast between the condition of the French and Belgian cable systems could not be more marked, but it is indicative of the broader picture across the rest of Western Europe. There are now around 70m 'cable homes' in the region, which means nearly half of all households are connected to cable television. The latest study by CIT, the London-based communications research consultancy, suggests that the number of wired homes in western Europe had reached 67.9m by the beginning of this year, an increase of 8 per cent over the same period in 1991. But the level of penetration varies from country to country - from Belgium with 88 per cent to Italy, Spain and Portugal where cable usage is still negligible. After Belgium, the most mature market is the Netherlands, where 5m households are connected. Dutch operators, like their Belgian counterparts, are investing heavily in upgrading their systems to 20- or 30-channel formats. Germany is the largest market with more than 10m homes, just under a third of households, subscribing to cable. However, the German market, which began expanding at about the same time as the French market in the early 1980s, is still growing rapidly. The number of cable homes rose from 8.1m at the beginning of 1991 to 9.8m by the start of this year, according to CIT's research. Most subscribers are concentrated in the old German lander, where more than half of all households are connected to cable. DBP Telekom, the telecommunications group which has led the development of cable in Germany, is adopting a similarly ambitious approach to cabling the new lander. Telekom's target is to increase the number of homes in these areas with access to cable from 183,000 to more than 800,000 in the course of this year. Meanwhile, the French government has desperately been trying to breathe new life into its flagging cable system. Earlier this year it launched a new Plan Cable offering special price-cutting incentives to new subscribers and abolishing the law whereby private landlords could prevent their tenants from installing cable. France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications group which has provided cable technology to private sector operators, has slashed its leasing fees. However, the cable system is still struggling and, in spite of the operators' promotional efforts, the 'churn' rate of people cancelling their subscriptions is still uncomfortably high. Sweden is also trying to revitalise its system, which covers 1.8m homes, by relaxing controls. The Swedish cable market was deregulated at the start of this year. Operators no longer need to be licensed by Kabelnamnden, the regulatory authority, and the ban on local channels accepting advertising has been abolished. Meanwhile, Spain is starting to establish a legal cable service. Pirate community video systems surfaced all over southern and eastern Spain in the 1980s and are now thought to cover more than 1m households. The government is finalising proposals for an official system of localised independent networks and 'super networks' which will encompass several towns. Spain is seen as one of the main growth markets for cable, as are Italy, Portugal and Greece, where the governments have been less active at tabling legislation, but are likely to accelerate their efforts over the long term. However, these southern European markets may be slow to take off and, in the short term, CIT expects Germany, France and the UK to provide much of the cable industry's growth in the mid and late 1990s. It forecasts steady growth for the western European market throughout the decade with the number of cable homes rising from 26.4m to 44.7m, or from 18 per cent to 27 per cent of all households. In spite of this expansion, the market is expected to remain confused and fragmented. The structure of the cable industry varies so much from country to country that pan-European channels, notably MTV, the pop video station, and the Screensport sports service, still face an administrative minefield of negotiating different deals in each market. This scenario is unlikely to change, however quickly the market expands.</p>

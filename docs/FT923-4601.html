With the property market in its current straitened circumstances, analysts and marketmakers have been very nervous about investing. There are also concerns about over-capacity and falling prices, although analysts believe that volumes have held up surprisingly well. Over the year to Thursday of this week, the FT-Actuaries Building Materials Index had fallen by 23.26 per cent; the Property sector by comparison, had dropped by 36.64 per cent.</p>

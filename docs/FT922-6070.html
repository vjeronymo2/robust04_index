			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Cadbury Schweppes to move its headquarters CADBURY Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks maker, is to move its group headquarters to Berkeley Square in London's Mayfair. The letting of a 51,500 sq ft building, reportedly at Pounds 55 a sq ft, is thought to be the most valuable deal signed in the West End since the property market went into steep decline in late 1990. 'The demand for good buildings has definitely come back in the West End,' said Mr Geoff Marsh of Applied Property Research, a research group. Several potential tenants were looking for property in the area as a result of a revival of confidence after the general election and a feeling that rents would not fall any further, he said. He did not expect other parts of London to see a similar revival. Cadbury has signed a 25-year lease for the newly refurbished building in the north-east corner of Berkeley Square. At present, the company is based in Connaught Place, west London. The Berkeley Square building belongs to Randsworth Trust, a subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, which went into administrative receivership earlier this year. It has been on the market, at an asking rent of Pounds 70 per sq ft, for about a year. Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property adviser, estimates that 7.5m sq ft of offices are available in the West End, giving an availability rate of 14 per cent for the area.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India enchanted by mushroom magic - Output could grow by 800% in three years The dark brown morel mushrooms that grow wild in the coniferous hill forests of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir were until recently a delicacy reserved to the local tribes - because only they could tell the poisonous from the edible ones. But Delhi traders have now changed all that. Realising the tremendous export potential of this delicious fungus they have persuaded the state governments to auction sections of forest land to them, so that they can reap the morels with the help of the tribesmen and export them to the US, Switzerland, Germany and France. These traders are not alone in eyeing the fast-expanding global market for mushrooms. Keen to encourage agri-businesses, the Indian government is in the process of clearing over 20 joint ventures between Indian and foreign companies to cultivate mushrooms in India, primarily for the export market. The government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board has received investment proposals worth over Rs290bn (Pounds 6.25bn) for the food processing industry, many of them for mushroom cultivation. Large foreign agri-business companies, including the Dutch giants, Dalsam Veciep, Haegens, and Genssen Kessel, Monterey Mushrooms of the US, and Turatti of Italy have already found Indian partners to set up mushroom cultivations and canning facilities at locations across the country. India, the world's second-largest producer of vegetables (after China) and fruit (after Brazil), has only recently realised the tremendous export potential of the mushroom. Mushroom cultivation last year accounted for only 3,500 of the 45m tonnes of vegetables produced, but the government says output will increase to over 30,000 tonnes in the next three years. Increased exports would then yield at least Rs1bn annually. The government expects at least 12 of the proposed projects to be set up in the next three years, each producing between 3,000 and 4,000 tonnes a year. Almost all India's existing mushroom farmers run small-scale units, growing the white button, oyster and paddystraw varieties. Although mushroom farming is comparatively new in India investors are being attracted by abundant and cheap labour - mushrooms have to be picked and sorted by hand. Compost like chicken manure and paddystraw, which is an essential requirement for mushroom cultivation, is also easily available. Most companies will cultivate white button mushrooms, which have a world market share of nearly 40 per cent. Though hilly areas provide the best climate for button mushrooms, more and more growers prefer using greenhouses in urban areas, to facilitate transport and distribution. Mushrooms are highly perishable, and the domestic market for them is negligible. 'We are very keen to invite foreign investment in this area because improved technology and state-of-the-art processing machinery could make India an important mushroom centre,' says an official in the government's ministry of food processing industries. 'Few mushroom farmers can afford the Rs200,000 it takes to set up a greenhouse unit,' he adds. As part of its efforts to boost mushroom exports, the Indian government has approached the European Union for a quota, to save the additional customs duty levied on third-world countries without a quota. 'Our mushroom exports have been so negligible, we did not need a quota,' the official says. 'But we soon will, unless the quota system is abolished altogether.' Foreign investors, some of whom have applied for permission to set up as many as five plants in different locations, say that the quality of the mushrooms available in the Indian market needs to be improved to be able to compete in the world market. Planting material and processing equipment for freeze-drying, dehydrating, pickling and deep-freezing will have to be imported. 'The largest names in the business will soon be here, but we have to ensure that with them comes the technology and research and development input it takes to make Indian mushrooms global,' says Mr CK Basu, an official in the food processing industries ministry.</p>

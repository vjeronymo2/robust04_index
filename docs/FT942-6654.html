			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: How to sell a goldfield - Clive Fewins visits a company which presents other people's sales pitches Paul Bridgland recruited the fifth, and latest, member of his staff in a computer shop in Guildford, Surrey on a Saturday morning. Bridgland was looking at games software with his nine-year-old son when he was struck by the manner and the knowledge of the young man who served them. He took Andrew Scott into a corner and offered the 18-year-old a job in his business presentation company. 'It may seem a rather bizarre way of recruiting staff but the three others arrived in similarly unusual ways,' said Bridgland, 35, managing director of Guildford-based Creation Station. 'I am not a gambler but I certainly would call myself an opportunist.' Bridgland and his right-hand man Guy Taylor were the people behind the worldwide presentation that preceded the recent successful flotation of the Dollars 440m Ghana-based Ashanti Goldfields share offer. James Capel, which acted as 'global bookrunners' for the launch, and Morgan Grenfell, financial adviser to Ashanti, chose Creation Station for the job. 'I like to think it was our record over 5 1/2 years that gained us the contract, but I'm sure it was also the highly individual talents of our small team,' said Bridgland. The team has no graduates among its ranks. But at its head is a man who, after an involuntary exit from public school, joined and quit the army, travelled all over Europe, worked as a steward for Laker Airways for three years, became a painter and decorator, sold audio-visual equipment for six months, then retrained (he loathed his TOPS course) in computer programming. After this Bridgland decided his fate lay in selling. First he sold insurance, then video presentations for another company before founding Creation Station at the age of 29. Taylor's cv is not as exotic, but it is nevertheless interesting. In his 33 years he has trained at art college, been a ship's photographer, a deckhand in Australia, a photoprocessing salesman and worked on the production side in an advertising agency. The Ashanti Goldfields launch was worth Pounds 50,000 to Creation Station. Of that, Pounds 20,000 went on hiring teams of sub-contractors to handle the European presentation, but the company still managed to make a 20 per cent profit on the worldwide roadshow. Bridgland and Taylor each spent three weeks on the wing 'leap frogging' each other on the tour of 16 locations from Sydney to Denver. In each city one of the two supervised the technical side of the presentation. The roadshow went without a hitch, earning Creation Station valuable kudos in a business which relies on reputation. 'We certainly had not handled a job approaching that size before, and it will probably be quite a long time before we gain another one quite as big,' said Bridgland. 'Nevertheless we are optimistic about more business from some big names such as Rank Xerox, Rowenta Domestic Appliances, and a major pharmaceutical company. 'We have sold and installed two of our complete VideoShow systems for two major companies. They now use the equipment for presentations to their clients and retain us as advisers.' Business was not always so good. Two years ago Bridgland - who is the first to admit he has no financial skills - was in a crisis. He was paying off a Pounds 10,000 start-up loan he had negotiated with Midland Bank when he started Creation Station in November 1988, and wanted to update their VideoShow presentation equipment to keep ahead of the competition. The problem, as ever, was cashflow. 'Things were not desperate but they were certainly uncomfortably tight,' Bridgland said. 'We had resorted to factoring to try and bring the money in and that was another expense we could have done without.' Bridgland resolved the crisis in typical fashion: grasping at an opportunity. At a family gathering he bumped into a cousin he had not seen for eight years - Richard Samson, who runs two garages in the south of England. He became company secretary and spends one day a fortnight at Creation Station, controls the books, chases creditors, and deals with the bank. 'Richard is brilliant,' Bridgland said. 'His arrival marked a turning point in the company.' Since then expansion has been constant, with new staff being added at strategic intervals. While Bridgland and Taylor were away on the Ashanti Goldfields exercise creative director Andy Morrison was away on a job in America and for more than three weeks Sharon Griffin, 23, who had been with the company only nine months, kept it running with the help of Richard Samson. 'Overall our policy is one of specialisation, not diversification,' said Bridgland. 'Creation Station has a small menu of seductive items rather than a huge selection of mediocre dishes.' Turnover peaked at Pounds 300,000 last year, though net profit, at just over Pounds 25,000, was down, due to purchasing of equipment. Constant updating of both hardware and software has been absolutely vital, says Bridgland. The latest purchases are the four Pentium 90 pcs with 17 inch monitors Bridgland has just bought at a total cost of Pounds 14,000. 'They are extremely fast,' Bridgland said. 'They mean we can show a whole range of major designs rapidly to the client who is visiting us and may have an hour before moving on to see what the competition has to offer.' At Creation Station, Morrison tries to put as much effort into these demonstrations to potential clients as the team does into the presentations that are their products. The emphasis is on the adaptability and cost-effectiveness of the VideoShow graphics. 'Clients are always impressed by the speed and cheapness with which our system will take printed material and scan it into a presentation,' Bridgland said. 'We also have a wealth of royalty-free stock origination material immediately available on CD-Rom. 'The ability to update fast at the last minute is often vital for presentations in the financial field such as the Ashanti Goldfields exercise, where figures are changing all the time. 'By going for presentations for city-based companies and institu- tions I think we have uncovered a rich market. Two years ago this electronics graphics approach would have been far too modern for many city gents. But things are changing. We are talking to several more City-based clients such as NatWest Investments and Merrill Lynch and are very optimistic that we now have credibility in the financial community. 'There are just two potential hurdles. One is being too specialist, so we have taken on the distributorship of EasyShow software, which should earn the company about Pounds 75,000 a year. The other is avoiding the temptation to move to a plush suite in town after a good performance like the Ashanti Goldfields operation. You can easily do that, then hit a quiet spell and suddenly face huge problems. The other fear is of a big presentation going wrong. We haven't had one yet but there is always the possibility.'

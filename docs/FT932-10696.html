			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Leading Article: The ratchet moves up BY OVERWHELMINGLY rejecting the Vance-Owen peace plan, the Bosnian Serb parliament has taken a fateful decision which will either be swiftly reversed or hasten international military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Either way, a new chapter has been opened in the crisis over the former Yugoslavia which will be more testing for western powers than the previous one of faltering mediation and a hamstrung humanitarian relief effort. Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, spoke clearly and correctly yesterday about the immediate risks. One is that western governments, under mounting domestic pressure to stop the fighting, will lurch rapidly into a half-baked military strategy consisting solely of air strikes against the Serbs' supply lines, in the process endangering the lives of the thousands of troops already deployed under United Nations colours in the shattered republic. Worse, the alliance that has thus far held on the Bosnian issue between the US, Britain, France and Russia could come under increasing strain if Washington is tempted to go it alone, either in military action or in other measures to redress the balance of power on the ground between the Serb aggressors and the mainly Moslem aggressees. It is thus of some comfort that all external parties have been careful to emphasise the importance of maintaining a united front as they grope for ways of further stepping-up the pressure on the Serbs. It is also possible, just possible, that yesterday's parliament decision in Pale may have opened up a rift within the Serbian camp that will help channel concerted western pressure to a productive end. In rejecting Vance-Owen, the Bosnian Serbs have delivered a rebuff not just to the international community but to their long-time mentor, arms supplier and source of succour, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. His calls for acceptance of a settlement have come perilously late in the day. To judge by his past record, they may be a wholly insincere attempt to fend off economic sanctions and military threats. But the important fact is that, under duress, he made them. In doing so, he may have calculated - as he did last year in helping to halt the carnage in eastern Croatia - that his political survival will be best served by trying to pull his allies back from confrontation. It is now for the west and for Russia to take him at his word and force him to bring the Bosnian Serbs to heel. More than rhetoric will be required. Mr Milosevic will have to impose on the Bosnian Serbs what the west is trying to impose on him: an economic and military blockade, and complete political isolation. Nor should the UN be satisfied with a promise to do so. It should insist on placing monitors on the borders of Serbia and Montenegro with Bosnia to ensure that arms or other supplies do not continue to flow. All the while, it should maintain the full array of sanctions on Belgrade, and continue to prepare credible and politically coherent military options: a substantial international peacekeeping force if the Bosnian Serbs agree to Vance-Owen; if not, intervention on the ground to halt their advance and protect such Moslem communities as remain. It is now up to Mr Milosevic which course prevails.</p>

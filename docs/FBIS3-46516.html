			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has become clear that the Nodong-I ballistic  missiles being produced by the DPRK (North Korea) are mobile.  This was revealed by an international military source on 23  December. If these missiles are operationally deployed in the  conditon of being able to be moved around, most likely it will  become difficult for Japan to intercept them when they are fired  at this country or for the U.S. armed forces to attack the  missiles in case of contigencies. The source predicted that the  Nodong-I missiles will be operationally deployed next year.    According to the Defense Agency, North Korea succeeded in  test-firing a Nodong-I missile into the Sea of Japan in late  May. At that time, missiles were launched from a fixed  launching pad on the coast facing the Sea of Japan. As such, it  was thought that changing missile launching positions would be  difficult. But the analysis of information carried out by Japan  and the United States has revealed that the missiles can use  mobile launching platforms as well. Because the missiles are so  large, however, it is said that they cannot be launched from a  sea vessel.    The Defense Agency at present assumes the range of the  Nodong-I to be about 1,000 km, and it has made public the  results of its analysis which indicate that all of Japan, with  the exception of only part of Hokkaido, lies within this range.    Even when the Nodong-I missiles become mobile, their range  will not change much, but because they will not use fixed  missile bases, it is thought that it will be difficult to  predict from where the missiles will be launched.    Furthermore, because North Korea is proceeding to place its  military facilities underground, a top Defense Agency official  said, "It will become difficult for the U.S. Armed Forces to  attack the missile facilities even if they want to."</p>

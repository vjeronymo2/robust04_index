			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / South African Bonds: Reform sparks interest among investors MR F. W. DE KLERK, the South African president, appeared to gain few concessions from the dozen top bankers he met in London last month. However, the gradual reform of South African society is rekindling interest among international investors in the country's bond markets. At present, buying remains limited and confined mainly to retail investors looking for high-yielding assets. 'We saw a lot of financial institutions taking positions in the market in the early 1980s but now interest is mostly confined to retail client and retail trusts,' said Ms Marilyn Visser, head of gilt sales at Simpson McKie stockbrokers in Johannesburg. But, expressions of interest were sufficient for Credit Suisse to include a selection of rand-denominated bonds on its list of recommended bonds for the first time last week. Many of the investors committing funds to the South African market are betting on a convergence of the financial rand (in which international financial flows are transacted) and the commercial rand. The financial rand was re-introduced in 1986 precisely to attract overseas capital into the domestic economy. Overseas investors buy government bonds at the financial rand exchange rate, but coupon payments are paid at the commercial rate. The 20 per cent discount of financial rand (currently at around R3.35 against the dollar) against the commercial rand (currently at R2.78) has the effect of boosting yields. For example, Republic of South Africa bond issue No. 153 maturing 2010, currently yields 15.65 per cent to a South African resident, but 18.8 per cent to a non-resident. With inflation running at about 14 per cent, real yields would not be attractive but for this dual exchange rate. Moreover, if the financial rand continues to appreciate, international investors make a healthy capital gain. The differential between the two currencies was as high as 50 per cent in late 1986 but closed in the last year as foreign investment began to return to South Africa. The government expects the differential to continue to narrow and hopes to abolish the financial rand within three to five years. But this narrowing of the dual exchange rates may not necessarily come in a direction which benefits overseas investors. Rather than a further appreciation of the financial rand, some analysts are expecting a depreciation of the commercial rand. 'High inflation, the pursuit of growth and a weaker gold price will cause the commercial rand to fall towards the financial rand exchange rate,' argues Mr Richard Grey, bond market analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'While the nature of political risk has changed in South Africa, the economic risks are still substantial.' The gold price is important to the exchange rate because the commodity accounts for almost half of South Africa's annual R42bn exports. These underlying risks have held back recent market performance. After an encouraging start to the year, prices have fallen as inflationary pressures in the economy have re-emerged and the political outlook has deteriorated.</p>

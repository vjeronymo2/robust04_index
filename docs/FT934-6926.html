			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Korean Air defiant over helicopters: Assembly of Black Hawks Korean Air yesterday said it would not comply with a government order to transfer the equipment and technology for assembling engines for the American UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter to Samsung Aerospace. The Korean Defence Ministry announced yesterday that Samsung Aerospace would become the sole engine manufacturer for a second order of 57 Black Hawk helicopters. Korean Air was appointed by Seoul in 1990 to assemble the first 81 UH-60 helicopters and engines bought by the country's armed forces. South Korea's main airline, which has ambitions of developing aerospace manufacturing, argued that the transfer of the licensed technology cannot be done without the approval of General Electric of the US, the engine's original manufacturer. Korean defence officials said, however, they foresaw no problem from GE in trans-ferring the license to Samsung. Korean Air also claimed the change would disrupt its current production of the UH-60 engines. Samsung already provides some key UH-60 engine components to Korean Air, which is part of the Hanjin business group. The Defence Ministry explained that the measure would save almost Won10bn (Pounds 8m) by concentrating both the manufacture of engine parts and engine assembly under Samsung. The decision comes at a critical point as South Korea's aerospace companies, which also include Hyundai Precision and Daewoo Heavy Industries, are seeking foreign technology to expand their activity into civilian aviation and achieve the government's goal of transforming South Korea into one of the world's 10 biggest aircraft manufacturers. The Korean aerospace industry now largely consists of assembling US military aircraft under license and supplying components for foreign-built passenger jets.</p>

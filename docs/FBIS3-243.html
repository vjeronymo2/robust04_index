But it  appears that many irreconcilable differences remain, on the  appointment of army chiefs, governors of the provinces and  diplomatic representatives, and control of the Central Bank.    A particularly lively debate is promised on Article 76 of  the  proposed constitution which lays down the procedure for  appointing the prime minister.    The UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress] wants Mr.  Tshisekedi, who was elected by the national conference, to be  confirmed in his position without a vote, while President  Mobutu's supporters would like to be able to choose other  candidates. It is this which has produced the candidacy of Mr.  Kengo Wa Dondo, leader of the Union of Democratic Independents  and former prime minister, who is known for his previous firm  government. Paradoxically, his candidacy divides Mr. Mobutu's  supporters at least as much as it does the Tshisekedi camp, as  they fear that a political expert will be even more skilled at  thwarting any maneuvering, imposing his authority, and  guaranteeing a transition outside the president's control.    Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo seems all the more dangerous to the  Mobutu  presidency as he apparently has no very long term political  ambitions and would be prepared to stake his reputation on a  proper management of the transitional period.    The West is continuing to carefully watch the Zairian  crisis,  but it seems that pressure on Mobutu to agree to power sharing  has yet to produce results. Meanwhile, France has granted, "on  humanitarian grounds," a temporary visa to the president's wife  so that she can visit one of her children who is seriously ill  in Paris.</p>

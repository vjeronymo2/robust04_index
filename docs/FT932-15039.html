			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Banacci up 24% after revaluation CITY Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial institution, lifted its results to 858m new pesos (Dollars 277m) for the first quarter, a 24 per cent increase on the first quarter of 1992. The results include a 183m peso revaluation of subsidiary assets. Excluding the revaluation, profits were 675m pesos, a 12.5 per cent increase on 1992. Banamex, the recently-privatised bank and the group's largest subsidiary, contributed 570m pesos to profits, a 14 per cent increase on the first quarter last year. Mexican banks, unlike other Mexican companies, do not adjust results for inflation, which in March was 10.4 per cent on an annual rate. Mr Jorge Hierro, director of investor relations at Banamex, attributed the profits increase to the growth in the bank's loan portfolio of 29 per cent and in retail loans of 62 per cent. In addition, it improved margins and benefited from cost controls. Accival, the group's brokerage, had profits of 41m pesos, a 19.5 per cent return on equity, against the bank's return on equity of 26.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on meeting of UCP-CPSU Political Executive Committee </F> in Moscow]    [Text] The progress of the report and election campaign in  the Moscow municipal organization of the CPRF [Communist Party  of the Russian Federation] was discussed at the latest meeting  of the Political Executive Committee.    Members of the Political Executive Committee attended 12  rayon party conferences. In most cases the communists favored  the unity of party ranks and expressed the wish that the  all-Russian party conference pass a resolution on permanent  membership in the UCP-CPSU. In Dzerzhinskiy Rayon, however,  delegates supporting the UCP-CPSU were kept out of the party  conference. In Proletarskiy Rayon the conference rejected the  previously approved plan for UCP-CPSU membership, as a result of  which the three largest primary party organizations announced  their withdrawal from this rayon organization of the CPRF.    An initiating group made up of members of the CPRF gorkom,  including two members of the UCP-CPSU Council, is organizing a  parallel municipal party conference. They have invited delegates  from CPSU organizations which did not join any of the active  communist parties in Russia and from the CPSU party  organizations which do belong to the CPRF but do not agree with  its leaders' views and are not certain that the all-Russian  party conference will settle the issue of CPRF membership in the  UCP-CPSU in a positive manner.    The UCP-CPSU Political Executive Committee feels that the  withdrawal of CPSU organizations from the CPRF and the  organization of a parallel municipal conference are inadvisable.  This will fragment communist forces again and can benefit only  the anti-people regime. The communists agree on the main  goal--restoration of a single Union state, a soviet government,  and the socialist pattern of development. Existing ideological  and organizational disagreements can be settled at an all-party  conference in accordance with the CPRF Charter. Today, however,  communists must concentrate on work in labor collectives,  discussion and finalization of CPRF policy-planning documents,  and the choice of delegates to the all-Russian party conference  from among comrades agreeing with the resolutions of the 29th  CPSU Congress and the UCP-CPSU Program and Charter and favoring  the CPRF's full membership in the UCP-CPSU.    The preparations for the 124th anniversary of V.I. Lenin's  birth were discussed at the meeting. The Political Executive  Committee advised all parties and movements regarding Leninism  as their ideological foundation to commemorate this important  date with joint ceremonial gatherings and rallies and a weekend  tour of places of significance in Lenin's life and the monuments  to the leader of the world proletariat.    A statement was adopted on the results of E. Shevardnadze's  meetings with the leaders of the United States, United Nations,  and NATO and the resulting escalation of tension in the Caucasus.</p>

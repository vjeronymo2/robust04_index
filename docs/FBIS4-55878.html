			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 22 May (TANJUG) -- Kiro Gligorov, president  of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM], and Albanian President Sali Berisha met today at the  official Albanian residence near the town of Podgradec on Lake  Ohrid in southern Macedonia and held talks on bilateral  relations and the current situation in the Balkans. According  to Macedonian radio, this was an unofficial visit, during which  President Gligorov accepted an invitation to visit Albania  officially in the near future. The two presidents held talks in  private for half an hour and were later joined by their aides.    After the talks, Gligorov and Berisha gave statements  describing the talks as positive, which, though unofficial,  enabled an exchange of opinions on all questions of interest to  both states. Both presidents said that a great deal of mutual  understanding was shown during the talks and that they agreed to  resume dialogue.    According to the Albanian president, they agreed to  establish  a Tirana-Skopje air link and gradually to relax the regime of  visas and passports. Albania expressed readiness to provide  special facilities for Macedonia to store 1.5 million tonnes of  fuel and 1 million tonnes of other commodities in Albanian  ports. Berisha expressed satisfaction over the adoption of the  Macedonian law on the population census adopted last week and  praised the government in Skopje for enabling the FLAKA E  VELEZEREMIT daily to be published in Macedonia in Albanian. He  also expressed support for the increased television and radio  broadcasts in Macedonia in the Albanian language and for the  opening of the teacher-training college in Skopje which uses  Albanian as one of the official languages. Berisha voiced  particular satisfaction over the participation of the ethnic  Albanian party--the Party for Democratic Prosperity--in the  coalition government.    Gligorov stressed the open and friendly atmosphere in  today's  talks and said that both sides had an obligation to create  conditions for ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and ethnic  Macedonians in Albania to feel at home. The Macedonian  president particularly stressed the importance of future  population censuses, which would soon give precise figures on  the number of Albanians and Macedonians in both countries.    After the talks the two presidents and their wives briefly  visited Ohrid and, according to Macedonian radio, took leave of  each other with satisfaction.</p>

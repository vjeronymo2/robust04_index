			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: LET'S HOPE CHILDREN'S TV ACT WILL VANQUISH NINJA TURTLES  </P> <P> Imagine what a different experience television would be for adults if the only  programs offered were situation comedies and action-adventure shows. No evening  news, no "60 Minutes," no music, culture, or drama -- only endless episodes  built around laugh  </P> <P> tracks and good-versus-evil fantasy themes. In such a world, television would  no doubt be criticized for a lack of diversity and an overall failure to  realize its potential.  </P> <P> Now adjust the focus of this picture to programming for children. You can  forget about the need for imagination. The range of children's programs  provided by commercial television over the years has been little more than  sitcoms and action-adventure formats, albeit mostly packaged in a genre better  known as cartoons.  </P> <P> With the exception of occasional specials to aid their conscience, most  stations offer no serious dramatic programs for children, no news or  information shows, no series to stimulate children's curiosity about nature,  science or the arts -- in short, no diversity, just "mind candy."  </P> <P> The Children's Television Act just approved by Congress is meant to remedy this  situation, as well as reverse the increasing commercialization of children's  TV. But will it work? Can this regulation really accomplish meaningful change?  </P> <P> A principal element of the bill is a requirement that stations serve the  educational and informational needs of children through their overall  programming, including content specifically designed for children.  </P> <P> These last few words, specifically designed for children, are the key to the  legislation's value. Simply requiring stations to serve children's needs  through their "overall programming" would accomplish nothing new. Every  broadcaster airing reruns of "The Cosby Show" or "Family Ties" could claim  these shows have educational value for children, teaching them important social  and moral lessons, and thus fulfill their obligation under the law.  </P> <P> While such family-oriented programs indeed have merit, they don't address  children's special needs and interests. Neither are they tailored to be readily  comprehensible to young viewers, who may miss subtle elements in adult-oriented  plots. Relying on them to serve the needs of our youth would be like  constructing a building for a children's library, then filling it with books  intended for adults.  </P> <P> What new content are we likely to see under the new law, assuming President  Bush doesn't veto it? I anticipate more reality-based programs, including some  children's news shows.  </P> <P> Educational game shows are a possibility. Any program premise to facilitate  visits to distant lands and cultures would be attractive. Perhaps it's wishful  thinking, but wouldn't it be terrific to see an important historical  documentary like "The Civil War" translated into a form youngsters could  understand?  </P> <P> Commercial television's Achilles heel is that it treats all viewers the same,  while children have special needs and limits in their comprehension abilities.  Children's Television Workshop, which produces "Sesame Street," carefully  researches each episode to ensure its appeal and comprehensibility to  particular age ranges. This technique is expensive but effective and provides  an excellent model for commercial TV to emulate.  </P> <P> The act leaves the choice of content up to the good-faith judgment of each  broadcaster. That leaves lots of room for creativity and diversity, as well as  abuse. Not much will be accomplished if stations claim that "He-Man" or "G.I.  Joe" are educational.  </P> <P> The act also limits the amount of commercials during children's programs. Basic  fairness requires that a consumer be able to weigh the fact that advertising  claims and appeals may be biased and exaggerated. Young children inherently  lack the reasoning abilities to make these judgments and thus are particularly  vulnerable to commercial persuasion.  </P> <P> The major oversight of the legislation is that the new limits on advertising  during children's programming (12 minutes per hour on weekdays, 10.5 on  weekends) apply solely to traditional forms of advertising: the 15-, 30- or  60-second spot.  </P> <P> The thorny problem that won't go away is advertising that masquerades as  programming, or the so-called program-length commercial.  </P> <P> By avoiding the topic of program-length commercials, the Children's Television  Act creates a strange paradox. The breaks between programs may contain no more  than 10.5 to 12 minutes of commercials per hour. In contrast, the programs  themselves are virtually unlimited advertisements.  </P> <P> This concern is hardly an idle one. "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" was taken  from an existing comic-book series and packaged as part of a mass-merchandising  campaign from its earliest stages of development. "Super Mario Brothers 3" on  Saturday morning is obviously a video-game promotion, even including the  product's most recent version number in the program title to ensure that young  consumers aren't confused about what to buy.  </P> <P> By most accounts, about half of all children's programs currently have direct  product tie-ins. You can almost hear the toy manufacturers laughing behind  Congress' back. Why worry about limits on 30-second ads when 30-minute versions  work just fine?  </P> <P> Except for this omission, the Children's Television Act is a very sound  approach to improving kids' TV. History teaches us that broadcasters simply  will not air educational programs when they can avoid it. That decision is  based on simple economics. But even today, broadcasting remains more than a  business. It is a trusteeship, licensed to serve the public interest. This bill  should help to better tap TV's potential to benefit the nation's children.  </P> <P> See letters to Counterpunch, F4.  </P></p>

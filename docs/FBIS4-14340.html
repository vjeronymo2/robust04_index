			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Perspectives" feature] </F>   [Text] The foreign secretary of Britain and foreign  minister of Northern Ireland [titles as heard], Douglas Hurd and  Dick Spring, met on April the 25th in Dublin, capital of  Ireland, in the context of the Northern Ireland peace talks  aimed at examining the means and ways for breaking the  deadlocked talks.    After four months since the signing of Ireland-Britain peace  initiative this is the first time ever that the two countries'  senior officials have launched a fresh effort for overcoming the  existing obstacles. Britain, which is one of the old parties to  the Northern Ireland dispute, through setting certain  preconditions for the participation of Sinn Fein, the political  wing of the Irish Republican Army, at their peace talks has  resulted in prompting this army to view their future peace talks  with pessimism, thus continuing its armed struggles [sentence as  received].    Britain, through setting a precondition for the Irish  Republican Army for putting an end to the armed struggles  without determining any obligation for London in connection with  the withdrawal of its forces, has drawn these talks to a  stalemate.    Political observers believe the presence of 12,000 British  troops as well as a 7,000 strong Ulster police in Northern  Ireland, which are considered as major opposition forces  antagonizing the IRA, are regarded as major obstacles to the  continuation of the peace talks process.    The British Government, contrary to its claims, based on its  interests in resolving the Northern Ireland dispute, still  insists on certain stands which are typical of the continuation  of Britain's dominance in Northern Ireland.    The British Government has hinted at the issue of self-rule  for Northern Ireland in its plan for peace initiative which  means that London refuses to accept the right to sovereignty for  Northern Ireland and is attempting to keep Northern Ireland as a  region under British dominance. Meanwhile, the Protestant  majority residing in Northern Ireland, that enjoys all-out  support and protection of Britain, is yet another obstacle to  the process of peace talks. In order to overcome it, Britain  has to adopt a stance taking into consideration the existing  realities.    Assuredly the British Government is no longer able to resort  to the past methods to suppress the IRA and seek to exercise  military power for the materialization of its political  objectives.    In the meantime, one should note that the IRA, in turn, now  does not see continuation of the armed struggle to be enough for  achieving its goals. That is because the Conservative and Labor  Governments in Britain have demonstrated that they have made  themselves invulnerable to the blows of the army and will  neutralize the effects of such measures and the government's  political decisions. With regard to the fact that the two sides  have obtained great experiences during more than two decades of  struggle, and also in view of the difficulties faced by each  side, it appears that one can assess the future of these talks  optimistically through the presentation of peaceful views by  each side.</p>

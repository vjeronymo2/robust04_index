			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Schroders The most striking figure in Schroders' maiden set of interim results was not the growth in group profits or even the nearly doubled contribution from fund management; it was the 21 per cent rise in shareholders' funds to Pounds 740m over the past year. Given the group's high quality of earnings and high level of retention, the trend is likely to continue. The return on capital remains healthy and the company increased the dividend by another 50 per cent. But that rise is partly intended to reduce the disparity between the interim and final dividends. Even if the final dividend was also increased by 50 per cent, the total would still be covered five times by earnings. While the acquisition of the remaining shares in Wertheim was a sensible use of capital, it leaves the group with fire power to direct elsewhere. Its eagerness to gain full control of Wertheim's securities business raises the question of whether that capital might be used to build up a domestic distribution arm in London. If Schroders' decision not to operate as an integrated house in London has been vindicated so far, there are tentative signs that the world is changing. Kleinwort Benson certainly believes its advisory business is benefiting from its strength in distribution and analysis, and it is perhaps significant that its fee and commission income grew almost twice as fast as Schroders' in the first half. Schroders still believes it has no need to be integrated in the UK and that most of its clients prefer using independent advisers and brokers. Of course, if Cazenove were ever to come on the market it might be a different matter.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Serbs accused of Bosnia flights LORD OWEN, the international mediator, yesterday accused Bosnian Serb forces of violating the United Nations resolution banning flights over Bosnia-Hercegovina. During a visit to Belgrade with Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, Lord Owen said: 'The Bosnian Serbs are in default. They have not agreed to observers on the airfield in Banja Luka (the Bosnian Serb military headquarters in the north-west) and they are still flying helicopters. We are going to have to nail them down.' The international mediators yesterday met Mr Dobrica Cosic, the federal Yugoslav president, and Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister, who have supported the plan for Bosnian forces to hand over their aircraft to the Yugoslav army. After talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Mr Vance said he would meet Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and General Zivota Panic, the army chief of staff, to work out the hand-over of 23 aircraft to Yugoslav air-bases, which would be under UN supervision. The visit came as Serb forces claimed to have routed Moslem and Croat defenders of Jajce, in central Bosnia. Bosnian army commanders yesterday denied the town had fallen. The loss of Jajce would be another severe setback for the Moslems, Bosnia's biggest ethnic group. The fighting highlights how difficult it will be to gain compliance with the new Bosnian constitution published by Lord Owen and Mr Vance in Geneva yesterday. Aimed at preventing the division of Bosnia, it calls for the central government to control foreign, trade and defence policies but gives wide powers to seven to 10 new regional governments. It proposes extensive international involvement in the internal affairs of a future Bosnian state, especially to enforce human rights. There would also be international supervision of the melding of the three Bosnian forces into a single national army. The central government would have representatives from the four communities (Serb, Croat, Moslem and 'other'). Parliament would have a lower house elected by proportional representation and an upper house appointed by the provincial governments, in both cases broadly reflecting the ethnic balance in Bosnia.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK acts to halt gold VAT fraud UK AUTHORITIES are taking action to stop the so-called 'missing trader' fraud which involves gold bullion and coins and is costing about Pounds 50m a year in lost tax. Traders have been importing or smuggling gold from countries where the tax is low and then selling it in the UK inclusive of 17.5 per cent value added tax. They then disappear with the VAT instead of paying it to the Customs and Excise. Moreover, traders who buy the gold remain entitled to reclaim the VAT they have paid. Scope for this fraud has increased with the introduction of the European single market. Luxembourg has no tax on gold bullion and coins, while the Belgium's rate is only 1 per cent. In the UK arrangements come into force next month whereby the seller of gold bullion or coins will issue the usual VAT invoice but the buyer will pay the tax directly to Customs and Excise. The most notorious recent gold VAT fraud case lasted ten months and ended in October with the conviction of three people who had conspired to cheat the taxman of Pounds 5m. The prosecution showed how a gang of highly organised smugglers took Pounds 35m of gold bullion from Luxembourg to the UK using specially-adapted cars - when one of the defendants was stopped her vehicle was found to have 50 kg of gold in the bumper supports and behind the horn. The smugglers linked with jewellers in London who reclaimed the VAT on the gold and they split the proceeds. This is not the first time the UK authorities have had to deal with gold VAT fraud on a massive scale. In 1979, when UK exchange controls were ended, VAT was charged on bullion bars but not on gold coins. Fraudsters made a killing by melting down coins, turning them into crude bars and claiming the VAT when the bars were sold. To prevent this fraud, in 1982 VAT was imposed on gold coins, a move which virtually killed off UK interest in this form of investment. Customs and Excise points out that the changes to take place next month apply only to sales of gold between VAT registered traders. Tax on non-business supplies of gold will continue to be charged and collected in the normal way by the seller. There is no change to the arrangements for supplies on the London Bullion Market, which are zero-rated.</p>

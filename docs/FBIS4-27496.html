			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  staged an exercise of surprise strikes at the strategic depth of  the northern half of Korea in the sky above Yongwol and Tanyang  of South Korea on May 31 with the massive mobilization of  formations of overseas-based assault planes and pursuit-assault  planes and flying corps of their airforce stationed in South  Korea and the puppet airforce of South Korea, according to  military sources.    On the same day, they staged an operation of airlifting a  large military strength and combat equipment to their Air Force  bases in South Korea with Pacific-based large transport planes.    Meanwhile, that day, 105 mm artillery groups of the puppet  army in Chorwon and Yanggu Counties, South Korean Kangwon  Province, fired some 50 shells into an area near the  demilitarized zone along the Military Demarcation Line and  heavily armed bandits of the puppet army in Paju and Yonchon  Counties, Kyonggi Province, fired hundreds of large calibre  machinegun bullets, coming in attack toward the Military  Demarcation Line.</p>

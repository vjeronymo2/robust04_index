			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 28 (AFP) -- Bernard Tapie, France's  debt-ridden tycoon and left-wing politician, said he would  defend himself in parliament here Tuesday afternoon [28 June] in  a debate on whether his parliamentary immunity should be lifted.    The state-owned Credit Lyonnais is seeking security for $220  million of debts owed it by Tapie and earlier this month moved  against his four-master luxury yacht, the Phocea, the world's  biggest sailing boat and the symbol of the tycoon's financial  and political success.    Bankers seized the 13-million-dollar yacht owned by Bernard  Tapie on June 1.    Tapie, an MP for Marseille, told AFP he wanted to keep his  National Assembly seat and would therefore reject all  accusations in parliament.    He was to give a news conference at the National Assembly,  the French lower house, before the parliament debate.    The Credit Lyonnais' subsidiary, SDBO, won a court ruling to  block movement and use of Tapie's 74-metre (240-feet) vessel  from Marseille after it decided to call in Tapie's debts  alleging he had failed to honour the terms of a debt  rescheduling agreement.    The yacht remains Tapie's formal property until the bank's  dispute with the 51-year-old politician has been resolved, but  the seizure means he cannot dispose of it. The yacht is  estimated to be worth between 70 and 90 million francs ($11.6  and 15 million).    Tapie, a former minister close to socialist President  Francois Mitterrand, also won a seat in the European Parliament  at the head of a centre-left list of candidates on June 12.    Tapie's popularity has not been affected by an array of  embezzlement charges against him involving companies in his  Groupe Bernard Tapie, the Olympique Marseille football club  accounts, and the Phocea.</p>

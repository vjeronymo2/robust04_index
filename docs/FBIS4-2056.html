			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] Navy plans to complete  its modernization of its ancient fleet by 2001 to meet the  military threat from Mainland China. The Navy document  presented to lawmakers envisions a seven-year plan to modernize  the Navy by building new ships in Taiwan and buying more  advanced vessels from abroad.    The document says Mainland China now has 2,640 ships and is  planning to build aircraft carriers. The naval document says  three Taiwan-made 4,200-ton anti-submarine missile frigates  built with U.S. technologies have been launched and five more  will go into service by 2001. They are to replace some of the  24 destroyers bought from the United States some 40 years ago.  In 1991, Taiwan signed a contract to buy six 1,200-ton  Lafayette frigates from France and to build 10 similar vessels  on its own with French technologies. In addition, the Navy  plans to build 12 500-ton petrol boats to strengthen Taiwan's  coast guard.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has rejected the  prime minister's accusations that the opposition members rejoice  at the sight of the spilled blood of terror victims. Speaking  to our correspondent this morning, he said Labor had promised  that through the peace process, it would remove terror from  within the boundaries of the Green Line. According to him,  since the State of Israel was founded, the state of security has  not been as unstable as it is now. He added that he supports  the closure but, according to him, the government has been  pulling Israel Army soldiers out of certain places in the  territories and replacing them with the terrorists' army. Such  acts are stupid and dangerous to the citizens of Israel,  Netanyahu said.</p>

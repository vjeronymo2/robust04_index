			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (16): College will seek university status For a county, there is no substitute for having the kudos of a university, and Gloucestershire lacks one. But, all being well, by the start of the academic year in 1994, it will have. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education, which already has degree-awarding status, is preparing its application. To qualify, the college has to satisfy the Higher Education Quality Council that it meets the criteria for awarding research degrees and has sufficient numbers of research degree students. It will decide before Christmas on the timing of its bid. Mr David Soutter, assistant director, finance, says: 'We will only apply once we are confident we are going to get it. We want to be absolutely sure in our own minds that we meet all the criteria, and then we will put forward a firm application. If a bid is made early in 1994, we could be a university by the start of the academic year.' The college is recruiting staff with research-degree supervision experience, and providing facilities. 'We also have to demonstrate a research culture, which means having appropriate programmes for development of our own staff,' says Mr Soutter. 'As of today, we have some 40-plus research degree students and over 30 part-time, and that's a significant increase on this time last year. It represents a shift in the balance of our student population to an increasing emphasis on post-graduate research and post-graduate students.' The college was formed in 1990, as the result of a merger between the College of St Paul &amp; St Mary and the higher education courses of Gloucestershire College of Arts &amp; Technology. Now, it has 5,200 full-time students, just under 2,000 part-time and another 1,000 on leisure or continuing education courses. About 20 per cent of the total are mature students, and more than half are female. Between 30 and 40 per cent of the students come from within the county. The college has strong links with industry, although some business people consider it weak on the engineering and science side. But Mr Soutter says: 'There is not a strong demand for us to produce graduates in technological and engineering subjects. The reality is that the major employers are not recruiting large numbers of these graduates.' The areas where the college regards itself as strong are in business management, computing, media, arts, fashion and design, and in all aspects of the environment and landscape. 'There is a very good fit with the economic areas of strength in the county,' says Mr Soutter. 'We are also strong in English and history; that fits well with the strong historical sense in the Cotswold area.' The college, which regards itself as a national leader in school-based teacher training, has a vocational bias. Mr Soutter explains: 'Even in our academic subjects, it's an important part of our modular degree structure that we develop transferable skills for all students, so that they are able to adapt quickly to their chosen field.' As part of its expansion, the college is midway through a Pounds 30m building programme in Cheltenham, funded out of asset sales and Pounds 8m of borrowings. Two new premises were opened this year, one for hotel and catering management, and another for work in landscape architecture. A media centre is to be opened by Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, next Thursday. A multi-purpose complex including 21 lecture rooms and a student union will open next October. The college has a Church of England ethos, reflecting the history of the College of St Paul &amp; St Mary, which was founded in 1847 by religious leaders to train teachers. 'We very much try to have that ethos as part of the college's mission and strategy,' says Mr Soutter. 'It is reflected in the range of courses and is why, for example, we are strong in teacher training and religious education. 'It is why we attach a lot of importance in our modular degree structure to the right of the individual to have control over his or her course. It's why there is a strong emphasis on support mechanisms for students, such as counselling. And we try to make ourselves accessible to the whole community, rather than just being education for the privileged.' The college is in the process of launching a sponsorship and development campaign. Mr Soutter says: 'We are receiving very strong support in getting that off the ground from businesses, although clearly what they are looking for is being associated with a university. We expect those links to come through as the college moves towards university status.' One undecided matter is what it should then be called, although 'University of Gloucestershire' or 'of the Cotswolds' are obvious possibilities. The final decision will rest with the Privy Council.</p>

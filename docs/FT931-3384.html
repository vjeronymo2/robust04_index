			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin in ferment as Nikkei rises again SHARE prices fluctuated on technical activity, but the Nikkei average finally registered its seventh consecutive gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 48.66 higher at 18,086.18. It fell to the day's low of 17,957.16 in the morning and rose to the session's high of 18,169.16 in the afternoon, before fluctuating on arbitrage trading. Volume fell to 350m shares from Friday's 771m. Advances led declines by 680 to 347, with 136 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 2.66 at 1,353.60 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.15 to 1,081.14. Activity was led by individual speculators and dealers, while most institutional investors remained on the sidelines. Traders said some US pension funds were looking to increase their weightings in Japanese shares, but that European investors, who have foreign exchange profits on their holdings, were reducing their allocations. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said share prices could ease during the second quarter of this year, and that there was little need for hasty buy decisions. 'The market will correct after the fiscal year-end, with 16,000 at the lowest end of the range,' he added. Short term trading centred around companies related to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and the Japan Rail Group. NTT took a breather, retreating Y7,000 to Y803,000 on profit-taking. Iwatsu Electric, which has close business ties with NTT, was the day's most active issue, forging ahead Y43 to Y538. Nippon Express appreciated Y6 to Y825. The company is considered a JR-related stock, due to its land holdings around JR railway stations. Nabco, a Kobe Steel affiliate which makes automobile and railway brakes, climbed Y80 to Y570 on a report that it had developed a new air-brake system with JR researchers. High-technology shares were lower on profit-taking by individual investors. Hitachi dipped Y4 to Y753, Toshiba Y12 to Y606 and NEC Y12 to Y767. Kyowa Hakko Kogyo surged by its daily limit of Y101 to Y1,100 on reports of its development of an anti-cancer agent. In Osaka, the OSE average was up 156.35 to 19,076.15 in volume of 45m shares. The index rose above the 19,000 mark for the first time since December 25 last year. Roundup EVENTS OF the weekend, and last week, had a powerful impact in the region. HONG KONG dropped a further 5.1 per cent on China's angry reaction to Governor Chris Patten's decision to proceed with democratic reform. The Hang Seng index finished at 5,854.61, down 315.79 but up from a day's low of 5,792.18. However, London over-the-counter trading was more positive, indicating an improvement in the index of about 100 points. Turnover stayed high, totalling HKDollars 5.23bn, although down from Friday's HKDollars 5.32bn. HSBC finished HKDollars 1.50 down at HKDollars 64.50. After the market closed, the group reported a 68 per cent jump in 1992 net profits, but shares in its Hang Seng Bank unit lost HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 62.50. HSBC closed later in London HKDollars 1.80 better at HKDollars 66.30. AUSTRALIA subsided on Labor's election win and falls on overseas markets, the All Ordinaries index ending 35.1 off at 1,626.4 after a day's low of 1,614.0. Labor's promise of a reduction in company tax and indications that it will cut interest rates helped to mollify investors. Bank shares were sold as hopes of mergers were dashed by the coalition's election loss. ANZ fell 32 cents to ADollars 3.26, Westpac 11 cents to ADollars 3.09 and NAB 8 cents to ADollars 8.47. Among retailers, Coles dropped 15 cents to ADollars 4.55 and Foodland receded 15 cents to ADollars 6.75. Investors had hoped that a coalition government would benefit retailers by scrapping payroll tax and exempting food from its goods and services tax. NEW ZEALAND shed 1.4 per cent on Labor's surprise win in Australia, the NZSE-40 index closing at 1,567.04, down 21.58. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index, hurt by Hong Kong and poorer than expected results posted by Singapore's key DBS Bank, slipped 22.07 to 1,630.81. MANILA lost 1.5 per cent in reaction to a PLDT slide on Wall Street, the composite index ending 23.03 lower at 1,471.65. PLDT fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 3/8 in New York on Friday. SEOUL rose for the third straight session, the composite index closing 10.89 higher at 645.73 on renewed hopes that the government may set aside an announcement which would phase out widespread clandestine trading. TAIWAN put on 2.1 per cent in thin trading, the weighted index ending 93.16 better at 4,507.00. BOMBAY resumed trading for one hour after last Friday's bomb blast caused extensive damage to the stock exchange building. The BSE index finished at 2,416.28, a rise of 86.19 from Thursday's close.</p>

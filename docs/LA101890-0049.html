			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MUST BE FREE TO ATTACK IRAQ, BAKER SAYS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III insisted Wednesday that the Bush  Administration must be free to attack Iraq without getting specific approval  from Capitol Hill, although he promised to consult frequently with  congressional leaders over U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "Our chances of settling (the gulf crisis) without resort to the use of force  will be much improved if the opposition knows that we have got (military power)  there and that we would not be reluctant to use it," Baker told the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee.  </P> <P> But most members of the committee, long one of the most dovish in Congress,  made it clear that they oppose the use of military power except in response to  new aggression from Iraq.  </P> <P> Going far beyond the requirements of the Vietnam-era War Powers Resolution,  several lawmakers said the Administration should not consider offensive action  without asking Congress for a formal declaration of war.  </P> <P> Committee members also expressed alarm at the prospect that President Bush  might initiate combat during the 10-week congressional recess expected to begin  later this month.  </P> <P> "I, for one, am not giving advance approval for any unilateral U.S. military  action," said Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.).  </P> <P> In an interview released Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de  Cuellar also discussed the military option. The German weekly magazine Stern  quoted him as saying that if U.N.-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq do  not work, military action "would be perfectly legitimate" -- should the U.N.  Security Council so decide.  </P> <P> Baker told the Senate committee that the Administration is prepared to keep  congressional leaders informed probably in secret. But he said it would be a  big mistake to stage the sort of full-scale debate that would be required  before Congress could be expected to authorize military action. That sort of  discussion would tip off Iraqi President Saddam Hussein about U.S. operational  plans, he added.  </P> <P> "You are not going to surprise Saddam Hussein; you are going to surprise the  American people," Sen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.) said. "I understand about  operational security. I don't want to know where or when, but I want to know  if."  </P> <P> Baker responded: "If we have a big, long debate up here about whether -- we're  going to have to talk about where and if and what with and who with."  </P> <P> He also said the Administration objects to creating a special congressional  committee to oversee the Administration's gulf policy during the recess on  Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> "It's pretty hard for me to say that the President would not, under any  circumstances, take any action or do anything that he, as commander in chief,  felt was necessary to protect American citizens, for instance, without first  having some sort of consultation procedure or process formally in place," Baker  said.  </P> <P> "It's hard for you to give us a blank check," he said. "We know that. But we  can't give you one either."  </P> <P> At the same time, Baker said the Administration may soon return to the U.N.  Security Council to seek authorization for the use of force. But he said that  such a move would involve stand-by approval only -- in effect, the sort of  blank check he conceded that the Administration cannot get from Congress.  </P> <P> "We would be looking for authority to move in the future, if necessary," he  said.  </P> <P> However, he said, Washington would resist any effort to put under U.N. command  the multinational force in the gulf. He said that, although 25 nations have  committed units to the force, the U.S. contingent is by far the largest.  </P> <P> "We are very concerned about putting the lives of our American men and women  over there in the hands of someone other than an American military commander,"  Baker said.  </P> <P> On related topics:  </P> <P> Baker acknowledged that the run-up in the price of oil since the start of the  crisis has resulted in windfall profits to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf  oil producers far in excess of the amount that they have agreed to contribute  to the U.S.-sponsored coalition against Iraq. But he said he will seek  additional "burden-sharing" payments if the crisis continues into 1991.  </P> <P> He said that if Hussein withdraws peacefully from Kuwait and thus keeps his  formidable army intact, the Administration will ask the U.N. Security Council  to continue the arms embargo against Iraq and to impose tough new sanctions  intended to prevent Baghdad from developing nuclear weapons or expanding its  arsenal of chemical arms.  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / German Social Democrats threaten to derail government plans Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday threatened to derail government plans to tighten up the country's liberal asylum laws, Reuter reports from Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic-led coalition and the Social Democrats agreed only last week to cut the huge influx of refugees. German leaders also fear chaos in Russia could send waves of refugees west. Foreign minister Klaus Kinkel has insisted Moscow fulfil its pledge to establish a Volga homeland for ethnic Germans banished further east during the second world war.</p>

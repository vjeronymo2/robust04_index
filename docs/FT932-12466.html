			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Preparing to rebuild on more substantial foundations - The past and future strategies of Tarmac, which has incurred the biggest loss recorded in the UK construction industry THE RISE and fall of Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group, is of epic proportions. The company 14 years ago generated annual pre-tax profits of just Pounds 26.5m. A decade later, in 1988, it made a record Pounds 393m pre-tax. Yesterday, it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 350m, the biggest recorded by a Britsh construction company. The reasons for the jagged performance derive from Tarmac's strategy, led by Sir Eric Pountain, then chairman and chief executive, of concentrating investment in the 1980s in the vibrant UK and US economies. Investment in continental Europe, favoured by UK building material rivals like RMC, Redland and Steetley (now part of Redland), was largely ignored - partly because Tarmac had burnt its fingers in Germany in the late 1970s. 'It was the reason I got the job of chief executive,' Sir Eric used to joke. It left the group badly exposed when UK and US construction markets collapsed in the late 1980s. Diversification into 'non-core' areas like waste management proved no substitute for the kind of successful German businesses which have buttressed results from Redland and RMC. Tarmac's policy of allowing its operating divisions a high degree of autonomy over investment decisions also meant that central management was slow to reign back housing land purchases and investment in commercial property joint ventures when property markets went into recession. Group borrowings have risen steeply as property values have fallen. Provisions last year against housing land and commercial property joint ventures totalled almost Pounds 220m. Mr Neville Simms, appointed chief executive 14 months ago and formerly head of the contracting division, has been charged with restructuring the business and repairing Tarmac's debt-laden balance sheet. Sir Eric remains non-executive chairman. At the end of last year net debt - including Tarmac's share of off-balance sheet finance of Pounds 100m and Pounds 99.3m of auction market preferred stock - stood at Pounds 677m. This was equivalent to 73 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 924m. Tarmac aims to reduce debt by about Pounds 200m this year through disposals, savings and by further squeezing working capital. Mr Simms' strategy is to concentrate on the three core businesses of housebuilding, construction and quarry products, continue to reduce overheads where he can and reduce debts by selling peripheral operations, such as Econowaste, the waste disposal business. Most of the restructuring has been completed or already announced. A total withdrawal from commercial property development should be completed within two years. Capital employed in housebuilding this year is expected to decline to an average of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m, representing less than a quarter of total group capital employed in 1993. This compares with peak housing expenditure of approaching Pounds 1bn in the late 1980s accounting for more than half the group's capital employed. On the building material front, dry stone manufacturing capacity has been cut by 17 per cent; ready mixed concrete capacity by 15 per cent. Black top manufacturing capacity has reduced by 5 per cent. Brick capacity has been cut by 37 per cent, from 270m bricks a year to 170m. Concrete block plants also have been closed reducing capacity by 15 per cent. Last year Tarmac reduced the number of workers it employs by 4,300. A further 900 jobs have gone in the first three months of this year. In the US it intends to concentrate on the east coast where 'recovery prospects' are greater. Non-core US businesses, some expensively acquired in the 1980s, have been sold. About Pounds 150m has been raised from disposals since last June. The group hopes to raise a similar amount from sales this year. There has been disappointment, however, at the time taken to find a buyer for Econowaste. Mr Simms says there has been a marked change in management style, with much greater central control over investment strategy, since his promotion. It has been accompanied by what looks suspiciously like a palace revolution, with Mr Bryan Baker, deputy chairman, Mr Anthony Collins, head of property, Mr Jack Mawdsley, head of quarry products and Mr Derrick Sims, head of the building materials division, retiring or leaving during the past year. Mr Sam Pickstock, head of the housing division, has proved more permanent. This has surprised some analysts who blame him for failing to keep a tighter grip on the UK housing operations when the market turned down. It has not prevented Tarmac's new chief executive from restructuring the housebuilding business through the closure of four of the 20 operating units in southern England and the Midlands with the loss of more than 250 jobs. The aim is to take Pounds 100m of working capital out the business this year reducing the number of homes sold in the UK from 8,000 to 7,000. The timing of Mr Simms' appointment as chief executive has meant that the work of curing the group's ills began somewhat later than in rival companies. The reaction from analysts yesterday was that Tarmac had still to complete what others had already achieved. There was also some questioning whether it was correct to be reducing capital employed in housing just as the market seemed to be recovering. SG Warburg, the group's broker, expressed it best: 'Although the jury remains out, much of what Tarmac hopes to achieve in the 1990s and the methods by which it will be achieved are already in place. However, to move more positively as yet demands a degree of faith in management and growth strategies and philosophies which has yet to be earned or established.'</p>

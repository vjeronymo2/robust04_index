			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "Trade Unionists Have Come Up With Their </F> Own Constitutional Draft--Constitution by Solidarity"]    [Text] In accordance with the principles of a  constitutional draft prepared on the initiative of Solidarity,  the president of the country would be authorized in special  cases to declare martial law or a state of emergency during  which some human and civil rights could be suspended, as well as  some laws, such as the budget law, tax laws, and laws concerning  monetary and credit policies. If the National Commission of  Solidarity decides today to adopt the draft, Solidarity, in line  with a new law on the proceedings for the preparation and  adoption of a constitution, will have to collect 500,000  signatures under the draft before the trade union submits it to  the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission.    The draft puts emphasis on the country's democratic nature  and on the chief position in the nation, which is the source of  all power. The draft also stresses the role of work as the basis  for the country's development, and also the role of the right of  ownership and a right to inheritance, as well as the economy's  free market nature. The draft envisages a division of power  between three branches and says that exercising power takes  place through representatives, a referendum, and a citizens'  legislative initiative that would be supported by votes of at  least 200,000 voters.    The president would be the head of state and would perform  the role of an umpire between the Sejm and the government. He  would order parliamentary elections, and he would enjoy the  right to veto laws that have been adopted. Such vetoes could be  overruled by the Sejm with a three-fifths majority (according to  the Small Constitution, the Sejm can overrule a presidential  veto with a two-thirds majority.) The draft also says the  president could be brought to justice by the Supreme Court  performing the function of a Tribunal of State, based on a Sejm  resolution adopted by a three-fifths qualified majority.  (According to the Small Constitution, the president may be  brought to justice by a resolution of the National Assembly  adopted by a majority of at least two-thirds of votes of the  total number of members of the National Assembly, on a motion of  at least one-fourth of the total number of the total number of  members of the Assembly).    The trade union's constitutional draft guarantees the right  to education to everyone, but only public schools are listed as  free of charge. The draft also says everybody has a right to  health protection, while the public authorities create the right  conditions, making it possible to implement the right in  practice.</p>

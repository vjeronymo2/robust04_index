			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOVIC WON'T RUN AGAINST DORNAN, 2 DEMOCRATS SAY  </P> <P> After two months of anxious speculation and growing national attention,  anti-war activist and Hollywood celebrity Ron Kovic told Democratic associates  Tuesday that he will not run for Congress against Rep. Robert K. Dornan this  year, two of the associates said.  </P> <P> But Kovic, whose life story is chronicled in the movie, "Born on the Fourth of  July," seemed to be avoiding public attention Tuesday as the media and  Washington political officials sought confirmation of reports of his decision.  </P> <P> The 43-year-old author declined to comment to a Times photographer who found  him at an outdoor pay telephone in Hermosa Beach. Later, he told a reporter who  found him in the same area window shopping at an antique store that his plans  for running go "back and forth."  </P> <P> "I don't want to make any statement right now," Kovic said. "In fact, I'm  trying to get some peace and quiet right now to think about it."  </P> <P> But two of Kovic's associates said he was unequivocal when telling them of his  decision.  </P> <P> "I asked him what should I tell (reporters) . . . and he said, 'Tell them I'm  not running.' That was the extent of it. He did not elaborate," said Tim  Carpenter, an Orange County Democratic activist who was helping prepare a Kovic  campaign.  </P> <P> Sidney Galanty, a Democratic political consultant in Los Angeles and friend of  Kovic's, said Kovic told him Tuesday that he would not run. "I'm really  disappointed," Galanty said. "It would have been a great campaign."  </P> <P> The deadline for Kovic to enter the race is Friday and speculation about his  decision grew after he returned last Friday from a two-week European film tour.  </P> <P> Without Kovic, Democratic officials said Friday they have no candidate in  position to challenge Dornan.  </P> <P> Dornan said Tuesday that he would not be surprised if Kovic did not run.  </P> <P> The congressman, however, has been campaigning against Kovic "and the Hollywood  Left." In January, Dornan sent out a campaign letter that included a picture of  Kovic burning a draft card.  </P></p>

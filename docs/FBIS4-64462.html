			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "MiG To Pay Debts in Bonn"] </F>   [Text] Russia wants to sell 200 combat planes of the  MiG-29 type (NATO code "Fulcrum") to the Defense Ministry at a  unit price of only 20 million marks [DM], including spare parts.  FOCUS learned this from Manfred Opel, defense policy expert of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag group.    The price demanded for these planes could be deducted by  Bonn  from Moscow's considerable debt account, the former general  says. Opel: "Otherwise we will never get the money back we lent  them!"    The offer by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was  received by the Finance Ministry two weeks ago and is currently  being examined as to its profitability.    If the deal goes through, the Bundeswehr, which is being  torpedoed by Theo Waigel's red pen, will fly with a total of 224  "Fulcrum" planes. At the moment, 24 planes of this type -- 20  combat jets and four training planes -- out of the legacy of  Honecker's National People's Army are being used.    The further use of the second-hand jets from the East is  sensible in the view of Opel and other security policy experts:  "The extremely efficient MiG-29 can be used -- even though only  as a transition solution -- as a substitute for the F-4F Phantom  interceptor." The U.S. oldie will be finally taken out of  service in 2002 despite expensive equipment. And the  acquisition of its successor, the Eurofighter 2000, is still  extremely uncertain.    Insiders now ask themselves: Will the Russian combat plane,  which was repeatedly discussed as an alternative to the  Eurofighter after unification, now be able to win over the often  disputed high-tech plane of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa)?    After all, the unit price of Eurofighter 2000 is estimated  at  more than DM100 million. In addition, there are the costs for  armament. Given 140 planned combat planes, this is an  additional blow to the scarce funds of Bonn's national defense  politicians.</p>

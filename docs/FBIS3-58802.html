			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 19 (AFP) -- The European Community  agreed here Wednesday [19 January] on the distribution of  ECU13.948 billion (about 15.4 billion dollars) to help fight  unemployment in the 12-nation Community over six years to 1999.    The biggest beneficiary was Britain, which is to get  ECU3.377  billion (3.7 billion dollars), followed by France (ECU3.203  billion -- 3.5 billion dollars) and Germany (ECU1.942 billion --  2.14 billion dollars).    The money comes in addition to the ECU141 billion (155  billion dollars) which the EC will spend on economic development  in the poorest parts of the EC -- known as Objective 1 areas --  between 1994 and 1999.    Objective 1 areas include pockets of depression throughout  the EC plus most of Spain and all of Ireland, Greece and  Portugal. The money divided up on Wednesday will go to other  areas in the EC.    It is earmarked to fight long-term unemployment by helping  young people adapt to the labour market along with others long  excluded from the workplace, and to help workers adapt to  industrial change.    According to the latest official figures, unemployment in  the  EC is running at over 10.7 percent and is expected to peak at  11.5 percent in mid-1995.</p>

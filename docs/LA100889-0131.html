			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SHE DIES IN PARIS AT 81;  </P> <P> LAVISH TRIBUTES POUR IN FOR FILM STAR BETTE DAVIS  </P> <P> Lavish tributes flowed Saturday in a worldwide eulogy for Bette Davis, the  tempestuous actress whose fiery talent and celebrated toughness made her one of  Hollywood's most acclaimed and enduring stars.  </P> <P> Davis, whose career spanned a half-century of American film, died Friday night  of cancer in a suburban Paris hospital. She was 81.  </P> <P> The two-time Academy Award winner, who began her career on the stage and later  made the transition from movies to television, was in Europe to receive an  award when she was admitted to a private hospital on the outskirts of the  French capital.  </P> <P> The news of Davis' death touched off an avalanche of praise from fellow actors  and movie fans who called her a legendary figure in the entertainment industry.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, himself a one-time actor who appeared with  Davis in the 1939 film "Dark Victory," described her as one of the "true  greats" of the motion picture business.  </P> <P> "She gave us some of the most memorable moments in the history of film and  touched us in a way few others have. For Bette, acting was more than a  profession, it was an art," Reagan said Saturday in a statement.  </P> <P> "What a loss," echoed actress Olivia de Havilland, who worked with Davis in  four films, including the 1964 "Hush . . . Hush Sweet Charlotte."  </P> <P> "She was a remarkable person to work with, highly professional, innovative,  brilliant and quick," said De Havilland, who lives in Paris. "She was very  well-disciplined. I thought she had some marvelous personal qualities, and I  was very fond of her."  </P> <P> During her career, the staccato-voiced Davis made 86 movies, won two Academy  Awards as best actress and was nominated for eight more. Her last movie was the  1987 "Whales of August," a film she made despite being in failing health after  suffering two strokes and a bout with breast cancer.  </P> <P> When Davis arrived in Europe three weeks ago to receive an award at the San  Sebastian Film Festival in northern Spain, news accounts said the actress gave  a bravura performance at a news conference. Immaculate in a black dress and  wide-brimmed hat, Davis even joked about her imminent death.  </P> <P> "If they had waited a little longer," she said of the festival award, "I would  not have been able to be here to receive it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dies in American Hospital  </P> <P> Before returning home, however, Davis fell ill and was taken to the American  Hospital in the Paris suburb of Neuilly. Her death was reported Saturday in a  terse statement.  </P> <P> "During a trip to Western Europe, the health of Miss Davis deteriorated," said  hospital spokesman Philippe Duprat. "She was admitted at the hospital on Oct.  3. She died last night as a consequence of her illness."  </P> <P> Her attorney, Harold Schiff, said in Paris that his client had died of cancer.  And in France, where her work is adored, Davis' death was front-page news.  </P> <P> In its Saturday afternoon editions, the newspaper Le Monde reported  breathlessly that the "impossible has happened" and that "the screen bitch with  the too-big eyes, the ambitious devourer of Hollywood, the she-wolf" was dead.  </P> <P> "One doesn't cry for Bette Davis," the newspaper continued reverently, "one  salutes her."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greatest Salute  </P> <P> In 1977, Davis received what may have been her greatest salute. Still spunky  and working at 69, she became the first woman to receive the Life Achievement  Award of the American Film Institute.  </P> <P> "I suppose . . . they decided, 'Let's give it to a dame,' " she said with  waspish delight upon receiving the honor.  </P> <P> Some dame.  </P> <P> Davis played them all, from the bitchy Southern belle in "Jezebel," which won  her a second Oscar in 1938, to the dying heroine of "Dark Victory" a year  later, to the frumpy Bronx housewife in "The Catered Affair" in 1956.  </P> <P> But for many, she would forever be Margo Channing, the past-her-prime actress  of the 1950 film, "All About Eve," her 61st movie, with that line that glistens  in the memory: "Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Always in Control  </P> <P> Whatever the role, Davis was herself always in control, refining emotion with  intelligence. But the persona was better than the sum of her parts. More than  beauty, she had style, wit and a fierce, unrelenting independence.  </P> <P> Those penetrating blue eyes, the page-boy hairdo with the sharp slash of bangs,  the ability to use a cigarette like a weapon or a scepter, and the flinty voice  -- these became her trademarks.  </P> <P> The breeding invariably showed, whether on screen in throwing aside a mink  coat, or off, when she fought tigress-like with studio heads and directors, for  good roles. In an era when studio executives behaved like Big Daddies, she  achieved her own liberation..  </P> <P> "If you don't dare to be hated," she told Playboy magazine in a lengthy  interview in 1982, "you're never going to get there. Never!"  </P> <P> For Davis, her reputation was of an intense perfectionist who battled studio  moguls and movie directors, survived mediocre films and spurned the glamour  image that Hollywood often demanded of its actresses.  </P> <P> Instead, Davis relied on her craft and unflinching confidence to build a career  playing roles from spirited heroines to tough-talking villains.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Tremendous Role Model'  </P> <P> "She once said to me, 'The thing about us, we're character actresses.' She  wasn't a great beauty, and she knew that," fellow actress Angela Lansbury said  Saturday. "She was a tremendous role model for me. She simply encouraged my  aspirations as also not (being) a great beauty."  </P> <P> Despite four marriages -- and romances with some rather distinguished men in  between -- Davis owned up in later years to being lonely.  </P> <P> "To be a woman all by yourself is absurd," she said in 1982 when she was 74. "I  didn't intend to become one of those prim New England women who are afraid of  sex, didn't want to reach my present age and not have experienced everything .  . . had a full life. Now I'm a virgin again but I guess I did all right for a  little Yankee girl."  </P> <P> Beneath the toughness there was vulnerability. She felt "All About Eve" saved  her life, "professionally and personally. When I made it I had been hit by a  truck, the same truck that hit Margo Channing . . . that I was 40. And I know  Margo felt every one of those years hitting her."  </P> <P> In her heyday -- from the mid-1930s to the close of World War II -- Davis was  the highest paid woman in America. She was called "the first lady of the  screen" and the "fourth Warner brother" and she was a regular on Oscar night.  She was nominated as best actress in 1939 ("Dark Victory"), 1940 ("The  Letter"), 1941 ("The Little Foxes"), 1942 ("Now, Voyager"), 1944 ("Mr.  Skeffington"), as well as in 1950 ("All About Eve"), 1952 ("The Star"), and  1962 ("Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?").  </P> <P> </P> <P> Had Some Regrets  </P> <P> Despite numerous triumphs, she had some regrets -- the missed Oscars and roles.  She had wanted her first Oscar for the part of Mildred, the cruel waitress in  Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" (1934) but instead won it as a  consolation the following year for "Dangerous" in which she played a  not-so-nice actress.  </P> <P> She wanted one for playing Judith Traherne, the dying heroine in "Dark Victory"  who falls in love with her doctor, but 1939 was the year of "Gone With the  Wind," and she had won her second Oscar only the year before. Her lifelong  regret was that she could have been Scarlett O'Hara but refused the role in a  dispute with her boss, Jack L. Warner.  </P> <P> Davis would have killed, she said, to have gotten the lead in "Who's Afraid of  Virginia Woolf?" or to have been Anna in "The King and I."  </P> <P> When she returned to Broadway after 22 years in 1952, it was for "Two's  Company," and then, more notably, "The Night of the Iguana" in 1961.  </P> <P> In the 1970s, she turned to television and garnered showcase roles, more than  holding her own with a newer generation of actresses. She won an Emmy in 1979  for "Strangers," playing the mother of an estranged daughter (Gena Rowlands)  who has come home to die.  </P> <P> </P> <P> She Had Endured  </P> <P> By then everyone knew Davis was more than a mere survivor. She had endured.  </P> <P> In her last years she combined her two personal worlds. She lived in a large  condominium in West Hollywood which, except for its wide-screen view of Los  Angeles, could have passed for a cottage in Maine. She was surrounded by  artifacts of her movie years, as well by pottery, pewter and porcelain. As her  adopted son Michael W. Merrill once said, her heart really belonged to New  England, where she began.  </P> <P> Bette Davis was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis on April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Mass.  She was named for her mother, whom Bette in later years called Ruthie. Her  daughter would later say that Ruthie was her dominating influence, at least  through a first marriage.  </P> <P> Her father, Harlow Morrell Davis, had been a patent attorney. The parents were  divorced when Bette was 7. She had a younger sister, Barbara.  </P> <P> Despite the rigidity of a strict New England upbringing, hers was a relatively  happy and comfortable childhood, and she wrote of "those biting cold white days  when Bobby and I would slide down the hill behind our house on our backsides  without our sleds . . . the kitchen shiny and busy and expectant with custards  and fruit pies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wonderful Cook  </P> <P> In later years her kitchen became her solace, her refuge, and she was  remembered by her friends as a wonderful cook.  </P> <P> She and her sister were sent off to boarding school while her mother worked as  a photographer. At 16, Bette entered the prestigious Cushing Academy in  Ashburnham, Mass., where, after participating in school theatricals, she  decided to become an actress.  </P> <P> After graduation in 1926, she was taken by her mother to New York where she met  Eva LaGalliene, then a reigning stage presence. LaGalliene was unimpressed. She  told the aspiring actress that her attitude toward the theater was "not  sincere. You are a frivolous little girl."  </P> <P> Trying to negate that judgment, Davis enrolled at a dramatic academy in New  York and also worked briefly in Rochester in a play called "Broadway." The  director was George Cukor, soon to become another Hollywood legend. He fired  her.  </P> <P> From the Cukor company Davis went to the Provincetown Players, an off-Broadway  company in Greenwich Village. There in 1929 at age 21 she had a starring role  in "The Earth Between," a drama, improbable for those days, about incest on a  Nebraska farm. Brooks Atkinson wrote in the New York Times: "Miss Davis, who is  making her first professional appearance, is an entrancing creature who plays  in a soft, unassertive role."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coveted Ibsen Role  </P> <P> Next she sought the coveted role of Hedvig in Ibsen's "The Wild Duck." Davis  failed to get the part and was relegated to the role of usherette. But she  persisted and during the next two years, she was in more than half a dozen  plays.  </P> <P> In 1930, Hollywood beckoned. Universal became her first Hollywood studio. In a  little over a year she made a half-dozen forgettable movies -- three for  Universal, three for other studios to which she was loaned out -- but nothing  really worked for her. The studio moguls decided she had "the sex appeal of a  string bean."  </P> <P> Davis might have returned to the stage for good had not George Arliss, a  leading actor of the period, telephoned. He was to be the lead in "The Man Who  Played God," and he wanted her to co-star. He had seen her on stage and liked  her work. On the strength of that 1932 movie Warner's signed her to an 11-year  contract.  </P> <P> In the next two years -- until "Of Human Bondage" -- she did 14 movies but only  a few gave her the chance to display her talents. It was then that she began  her fight for good scripts, good parts and a good cast. For, as she later  wrote, she realized early on that she needed good people to play against.  </P> <P> Indeed, she got the "Bondage" role because she persuaded a bright young  director named Pandro S. Berman, who was working for RKO, to take her on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moved Into Front Rank  </P> <P> With "Bondage" and "Dangerous," her first Oscar, she moved into the front rank  of Hollywood actresses, but she was never of them. At first, directors wanted  to make her over, even to change her name. Bettina Dawes was suggested; Davis  resisted. "I refuse to be called 'Between the Drawers' all my life," she said.  </P> <P> At 5 feet, 3 inches and 112 pounds, she was certainly not a long-stemmed blonde  bombshell beauty, although in the beginning they lightened her hair. Davis had  a more subtle sexuality. Of the Crawfords and the Shearers and the Dietrichs,  she wrote: "Part of me envied them. They were so beautiful. I knew it was  possible, with my ambitions for acting rather than for glamour, that I might  never equal their popularity. But I was I."  </P> <P> She also noted that over the years she drew more people into movie houses "than  all the sexpots put together."  </P> <P> Davis was married four times -- to Hamilton O. Nelson, Jr., a prep school  sweetheart, in 1932; to Arthur Farnsworth, who ran a New England inn, in 1938;  to William Grant Sherry, a former prize fighter-turned-Laguna Beach artist in  1945, and to actor Gary Merrill in 1950.  </P> <P> She had three children from those marriages, including a daughter, Barbara  Davis or B.D., who was born in 1947.  </P> <P> Davis' other two children were adopted. Daughter Margot was discovered to be  severely brain damaged and had to be sent to an Upstate New York institution  for the mentally retarded. Later, there was a prolonged custody battle with  Merrill over their adopted son, Michael.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Mother Goddam'  </P> <P> Through it all was her craft. Work was her "steadiest friend." In interviews,  in her frank 1962 autobiography "The Lonely Life" and in the biography she  co-authored in 1974 called "Mother Goddam" (a sobriquet for one of her  characters that she took as her own), that was her theme.  </P> <P> "My passions were all gathered together like fingers that made a fist," she  wrote in 1962. "Drive is considered aggression today; I knew it then as  purpose."  </P> <P> For more than a decade, from the time she received her first Oscar, she fought,  even scratched for good parts. Consider that "Of Human Bondage" was her 22nd  role, "Dangerous" her 28th and "Jezebel" her 36th.  </P> <P> After "Dangerous," when she was again being offered what she felt were  minor-league roles, she accepted an offer from an English film director and  Warner's smacked her with an injunction. She had "no right to strike" a studio,  or to be a free agent, as baseball players were to become many years later.  </P> <P> There followed a long legal battle that Davis lost -- "It was Bette against  Goliath," she opined dramatically. But in a real sense, she won the war because  Warner's brought her back to better roles. In 1939, all four of her movies were  critical and box office successes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breaks With Warners  </P> <P> In 1948, she broke with Warners for good. During the next decade, she appeared  in 10 films but her career appeared to be faltering. Davis, however, revived it  with a couple of popular horror films including 1962's "Whatever Happened to  Baby Jane?" where she played a demented one-time child star.  </P> <P> Altogether Davis made nine movies in the 1960s and five in the 1970s, as well  as starting a new career in television. One of her last TV movies was "Right of  Way" made for Home Box Office, in which she co-starred with James Stewart --  the first time these movie greats had played together.  </P> <P> "She seemed to me to be an ideal motion picture actress," Stewart recalled  Saturday, calling Davis "this wonderful, wonderful talent."  </P> <P> Yet, there was always a touch of the irreverent, the unexpected, about Bette  Davis.  </P> <P> She became the first woman president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and  Sciences in 1942 and thereafter insisted that she had played a prime role in  the naming of the little statuette given out each year for film achievements.  </P> <P> "The rear end of it looked like my first husband's, Ham Nelson's, bare behind."  Nelson's middle name was Oscar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Story Is Pure Davis  </P> <P> If the story was apocryphal it was also pure Davis.  </P> <P> She shunned Hollywood parties. She twitted her own movies calling the horror  film "Baby Jane" "pretty funny."  </P> <P> "I suppose the dead birds with mayonnaise were kind of unattractive. And the  dead rat."  </P> <P> She also chided the male ego which she felt "with few exceptions . . . was  elephantine to start with. Add to it a movie contract and it soars through  space into eternal orbit around itself."  </P> <P> But mostly she had the capacity to laugh at herself. One night at a one-woman  appearance in London someone in the audience rudely called out: "Is that your  real hair, Miss Davis?"  </P> <P> Without missing a beat, Davis, who was wearing a wig that day, called back:  "Yes it is. And these are my real eyes, my real teeth and my real tits."  </P> <P> But the icy irreverence could also thaw.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hollywood Canteen  </P> <P> In 1942, she helped organize the Hollywood Canteen, which became a refuge for  servicemen stationed in Southern California.  </P> <P> An animal lover, she was founder and president of the Tailwaggers Club, which  looked after stray dogs. A resident of Laguna in the late 1950s, she  participated in the Laguna Festival of the Arts. As with other volunteer  residents, she did the grunt work, sticking numbers on the backs of seats.  </P> <P> But first, as always, she served her talent. Into the so-called retirement  years she was still perusing scripts, still demanding that her name be placed  above the title. She did the TV talk show circuit, ever entertainingly blunt.  </P> <P> When she was nearly 75, a TV producer approached her for an appearance on  something he was preparing called "The Golden Years of Hollywood." Davis,  probably as representative of those times as anyone, declined.  </P> <P> As she told a close friend over dinner: "There is no such thing as 'the golden  years.' Why look back?"  </P> <P> The golden years, Bette Davis told her friend, were in the present. And she  still had work to do.  </P> <P> Times Staff writer Rone Tempest contributed to this story from Paris.  </P></p>

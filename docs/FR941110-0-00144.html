			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters disagreed that facilities be furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a separate summary of all level 1&hyph;1 deficiencies rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than receiving notice of them on the official deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement. They believed that it would be confusing to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a facility's deficiencies recorded, in parts, between two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate documents, as well as harder to track repeat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies at the next standard survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters made specific recommendations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required remedies for various levels of severity and scope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some suggested that HCFA or the State only impose a plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction at the lower scope and severity levels, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other commenters wanted HCFA to mandate civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties and other remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many consumer advocates expressed concern that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed scope and severity scales did not represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent of the Congress to make resident rights and physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment requirements equivalent to quality of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. They contend that the way the scales are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently written, resident rights and physical environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies would never rise above severity level 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters believe that the scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scales should be predicated on a statistical analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability and suggest that this could be done by health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care professionals who could factor into the scales the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predisposition of a given individual to a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incident. Many commenters asked that the ambiguous terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used within the level descriptions be defined, for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how many cases constitute ``in a number of cases.'' One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter suggested that a numerical or percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination be made to clarify the terms, for example, 1&hyph;3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances = isolated, or less than 17 percent occurrences = isolated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that the scope scale include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only three levels, combining the proposed levels 3 and 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because there was no distinction for the remedies. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter observed that the scope scale level descriptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were written in terms of the number of times that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors made a particular observation, and contended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while this approach may be appropriate for certain types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems, it is not for others. For example, when surveying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for life safety code compliance, what scope would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to a total sprinkler system failure? This problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a single observation, but it is one that affects every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident in the facility. This commenter, therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that if we are to accurately reflect the extent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deficiency, then scope should be based on the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents who are affected by the deficient practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall, many commenters feared that the scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scales, as proposed, give the enforcing agency virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlimited discretion in selecting remedies. They contended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed scheme does not limit imposition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most onerous remedies only to the most serious deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and they, therefore, suggest that a prescriptive approach be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for correlating deficiencies and remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Historically, the enforcement system was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on a hierarchical set of requirements called  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of participation, standards, and elements. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of participation included groups of standards, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards were made up of separate elements. Enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was based on the level of the requirement for which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency was cited. For example, condition-level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies in a SNF resulted in the initiation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination procedures or a denial of payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions. However, if only standard-level deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were found, only a plan of correction was required. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Congress has expressly eliminated the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hierarchical requirements in nursing homes, we needed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organized way to determine how serious a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies are, as well as a consistent approach to guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcing agencies in making enforcement decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

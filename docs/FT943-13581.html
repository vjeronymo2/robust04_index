			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Stay secure on safety - A look at costly new product regulations Before the summer is out, new product safety regulations will impose onerous and costly obligations on unsuspecting British businesses selling products to consumers. The lack of awareness of among businesses reflects the minimal publicity given by the Department of Trade and Industry to the regulations. Their The impact of the regulations will be exacerbated by the absence of a transitional period. Although they are still in draft, and therefore subject to change before being passed they pass into law, businesses must anticipate should be ready for their impending arrival. The regulations, which implement the European Community's (correct, have to call it this because of its legal status) general product safety directive, They significantly extend 'the general safety requirement' which was introduced by in the Consumer Protection Act. They create a criminal offence of placing on the market a product which is not 'a safe product'. But, However, as has been the case with other commercial law directives made by the European Council of Ministers, the drafting of the directive is poor and the language vague. The regulations will be superimposed on to existing product safety legislation, thereby creating a complex web of legislation covering the same subject but in different terms. Only products intended for - or likely to be used by - consumers are covered. by the Regulations. A consumer is someone acting otherwise than in the course of a commercial activity, such as a business or trade. Goods used exclusively in the course of a trade or business (such as production equipment and capital goods) are therefore excluded. from these Regulations. However, products which are used mainly in the course of a trade or business, but which might be used by a consumer for private use, are covered. by the regulations. The regulations place obligations on 'producers' and 'distributors'. In each case, the nomenclature is misleading. A wide definition is given to the term 'producer'. It includes the manufacturer of the product within the European Union or someone who presents himself as the producer by affixing to the product his name, trademark or other distinctive mark (for example, retailers selling producers products under their own label). If the manufacturer is outside the EU, ropean Union, his the representative or importer will be treated as the producer. The definition goes on to also includes any other professional in the supply chain, insofar as his activities affect the product's safety properties. of the product. However, no there is no definition is given as to who is a of 'professional'. Any person who reconditions the product will also be a producer. The same problem arises in respect of a distributor. This means any professional in the supply chain whose activity does not affect the product's safety. No guidance is given by the regulations as to what constitutes the supply chain. It clearly includes manufacturers, importers, own-branders, wholesalers, distributors, retailers and leasing companies. It could extend to transporters, packers and warehousers. The general safety requirement is that no producer will place a product on the market unless it is a safe product. For this purpose, a safe product is one which, under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, does not present any risk, or only the minimum risks considered as acceptable and consistent with a high level of protection and the safety and health of persons. Risk is to be assessed on the basis of a number of factors, including: The product's characteristics, including its composition, packaging and instructions for assembly and maintenance. The product's effect on other products. The product's presentation, labelling, instructions for use and disposal, and other information provided by the producer. The categories of consumers who would be at serious risk when using the product. Particular consideration is to be given to children. The producer must provide consumers with certain information to enable them to assess the risks inherent in a product throughout its period of use. This could be, for example, through the use of warnings. The withdrawal of a product from the market could be the end result. This obligation is a continuous. one. In turn, a producer must ensure that he is informed of the risks that the products might present. Post-marketing surveillance departments will have to be established. The regulations give non-exhaustive examples of the steps a producer might take. These include marking a product so that it can be identified, sample testing of marketed products, investigating complaints, and keeping distributors informed of such monitoring. The regulations also impose duties on distributors. By definition, a distributors is are not able to influence the safety of the product. His Their duties are: To help ensure compliance with the general safety requirement. Not to supply products to any person that he they know, or should have presumed on the basis of information which he they had and as a professionals, are dangerous products. To be involved in the monitoring of the safety of products placed on the market, the distributors must pass on information on the products and co-operate in action taken to avoid risks. Where the safety of a product is already governed by specific EC law, the regulations will not apply. This is subject to a proviso: if EC sectoral directives do not cover every aspect of safety, the regulations will still apply to those aspects not covered. This can be expected to cause difficulty to businesses and has been criticised by the Institute of Directors. There are criminal penalties for breaking the regulations. An offence under the regulations can result in a maximum of three months' imprisonment or a maximum fine of Pounds 5,000 or both. It will be a defence to show that the defendant took all reasonable steps and exercised all due diligence to avoid committing an offence. Local weights and measures authorities will enforce the regulations. They have the power to inspect goods and enter business premises, to require production of business records, to seize and detain goods and records, to require the opening of any container or vending machine and, if refused, to break it open. The regulations impose an onerous duty on both producers and distributors to become involved in actively and continuously monitoring the safety of products. Relying simply on measures taken and procedures adopted to comply with the Consumer Protection Act will be insufficient. Producers must adopt proactive, rather than reactive, procedures. in their business operations. The regulations dictate that producers and distributors review their arrangements with suppliers and customers. In each case, suppliers will need to include provisions in their agreements requiring the other party to participate in product safety monitoring and marking procedures. This will enable information to be obtained. But obligations cannot stop there. The other party should be contractually obliged to provide information to customers and be required to participate in product recall campaigns, as well as investigating complaints. At the same time, buyers should included provisions protecting them from any failure by a supplier higher up the chain to comply with the regulations. Penalties for offences may be avoided or reduced if these courses are followed. They may also provide some contractual relief if claims are made by consumers., whether under the Consumer Protection Act or otherwise.

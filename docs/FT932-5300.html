			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: A better criterion for audit exemption Sir, As a director of a small limited company I welcome the removal of the audit requirement in principle ('Third time lucky' June 2). However, a different exemption criterion would seem to be desirable. In our case the accounts are computerised and audit fees are only about 0.7 per cent of turnover; the time required for meetings and dealing with minor queries is of greater importance. Moreover, the audit process involves other formalities such as bank letters; these cost Pounds 17-Pounds 20 each and merely repeat information already provided on statements. Unfortunately we would not benefit from the Department of Trade and Industry proposal as our turnover is above the VAT threshold. The exemption would be more effective if framed to cover the majority of limited companies which obtain no advantage from the audit requirement. Better targeting could be achieved by director certification subject to unanimous approval by shareholders. Where credit rating agencies, banks or other creditors need audited accounts it would not be in the interests of directors or shareholders to claim the exemption. An arrangement of this type would also have the advantage that companies below the VAT limit (or any other arbitrary threshold) would not be entitled to automatic exemption. The decision would be taken after weighing the costs and benefits of an audit to the individual business. L D McClements, Meconsult, 3 Chimera Wood, Helen's Bay, Bangor, County Down</p>

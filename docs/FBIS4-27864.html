			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yu Chong-ha, ROK permanent representative to </F> the United Nations, by Kim Cha-ung at the UN Headquarters in New  York on 3 June -- first two paragraphs are TONG-A ILBO  introduction]    [Text] Permanent Representative Yu Chong-ha revealed on the  afternoon of 3 June: "Currently, the ROK Government's firm  position is that it is inevitable to implement sanctions against  North Korea through the UN Security Council [UNSC]." He also  said: "During the meeting among the ROK, the United States, and  Japan scheduled for 3, 4 June in Washington, the three countries  will settle the level and types of sanctions against North Korea  and the demands to make on North Korea. From early next week,  coordination of various views regarding the draft of the  resolution provided by the United States will be carried out on  a full scale among the permanent members of the UNSC."    Following is an interview with Permanent Representative Yu  Chong-ha:    [Kim Cha-ung] At the 3 June UNSC meeting, Hans Blix,  secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency,  revealed: "We could not find any technical or safety reasons  for North Korea to replace the fuel rods at its atomic reactor."  Does this mean that North Korea intentionally started to  replace the fuel rods?    [Yu Chong-ha] Yes. This means that North Korea replaced the  fuel rods not because of the technical and safety reasons they  were insisting on, but for political purposes. North Korea  intentionally removed the evidence that could have determined  that it has diverted nuclear material.    [Kim] Other than measuring the fuel rods, are there any  other  ways to find out whether North Korea has diverted nuclear  material?    [Yu] There is no certain evidence that North Korea diverted  nuclear material by examining the fuel rods. If nuclear waste  was examined, we could have had a partial knowledge of whether  the nuclear material was diverted, but the information is not  complete. Now, the way to find out about North Korea's nuclear  activities through the fuel rods has disappeared.    [Kim] Does our government firmly support sanctions against  North Korea?    [Yu] Currently, our government's firm position is that the  move toward sanctions is inevitable. The ROK, the United  States, and Japan are discussing in Washington the pace and  method of the sanctions and what demands they will make on North  Korea.    [Kim] What do you think will be the content of the  sanctions?    [Yu] In general, there are three kinds of resolutions for  sanctions at the UNSC--a resolution of warning, a resolution for  sanctions in stages, and an overall resolution for sanctions.  One of them will be applied to North Korea.    [Kim] When do you think that a resolution on North Korea  will  be adopted?    [Yu] It will not be adopted in just one or two days. If you  look at previous cases, it takes two to three weeks from the  time the permanent members of the UNSC start to discuss this  matter and the time a decision is made. Some permanent members  say that "This is not a time-pressing issue now." The  opportunity for a later measurement of the fuel rods has been  lost, but since the discharged fuel rods are under the  surveillance of the inspection team, permanent members point out  that it is not a time sensitive issue.    [Kim] It is important to see how China will react to the  resolution against North Korea. What is the attitude of the  permanent members, including China, regarding this matter?    [Yu] I had contact with related ambassadors. China is still  adhering to the position of "opposing sanctions," which has been  its position in the past. However, China seemed to sense the  ROK point of view that there is no other way than to take  sanctions. France and Great Britain feel strongly about taking  sanctions. Russia proposed an eight-party meeting in an effort  to seek other ways to resolve this issue rather than taking  sanctions.</p>

There is no intention of "forcing the European Union  countries out of the process of settlement," he said at  Thursday's briefing in Moscow. "We simply want to utilize the  political weight and prestige of the UN Security Council to  bring this affair (settlement: Interfax) to an end. It's not  our fault that not all the European countries involved in this  process are members of the UN Security Council," Russia's deputy  foreign minister said.    Earlier on Thursday, Churkin said, he spoke with U.S.  Ambassador Thomas Pickering about the new Russian initiative.  According to him, the attitudes taken by the two countries have  much in common. Nevertheless, he added, "neither Russia nor its  European partners should look back at Washington all the time in  their efforts to settle the crisis in Bosnia."    "As for the reaction of European countries, there is an  impression that a session of the UN Security Council scares them  more than the consequences of the war in Bosnia do," Churkin  added.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Over-supply and over-stocking apply through much of the wool market. In Australia there is the official stockpile of nearly 4 million bales, practically a full season's output, which overhangs the market even though disposals ara currently at a standstill. Resistance to present low prices , in real terms the lowest on record, is causing Australian growers to withdraw their wool and this involves a privately held and financed backlog which again overhangs the market. Processors in major consumer countries in Europe and the Far East are often heavily stocked also.</p>

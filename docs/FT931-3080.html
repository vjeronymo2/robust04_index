			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Arts: Sarah Walker and Sara Fulgoni - Two mezzo recitals The post-war British singers who proved themselves the equals in recital of any in Europe are gradually handing over to the younger generation. What they achieved looks secure. Students today are often prepared to sing in most of the main European languages and to go and do so throughout Europe, too. Over the weekend two British mezzos at different points in their careers showed what they can do at the Wigmore Hall. For Sarah Walker the occasion marked 25 years on the London concert platform. She gave two recitals, of which I saw the first on Thursday - a happy evening, if not as frivolous as the programme may have suggested. Its cover showed a cartoon with the singer as a fairy and her expert accompanist, Roger Vignoles, as a pixie sitting on a toadstool. Not to be outdone by any younger rivals, she sang in Italian, German, French, English and Czech during the course of the evening. Her German, in particular, was scrupulously clear. A substantial group of Schumann songs, which comprised the Mary Stuart Lieder and a few favourites including a sensitive 'Der Nussbaum', was immaculately prepared, but it is difficult to say that they went to the heart. On either side were a vivid account of Haydn's 'Arianna a Naxos' and some rather camp Poulenc. But the best was Britten's A Charm of Lullabies, for nobody could catch better their sentiment or the malevolent gleam in the nanny's eye for the penultimate song. Wholehearted singing in Dvorak's Gypsy Songs followed. Then came bouquets, a birthday cake topped by an iced prima donna and the encores, including one about fairies at the bottom of the garden. From the programme cover we should have guessed. On Monday the Wigmore Hall played host to a mezzo at the outset of her career. Sara Fulgoni has already attracted attention in operatic productions at the Royal Northern College of Music and here she was appearing as winner of the 1991 Edward Boyle Music Award. For one so young the voice is remarkable. Like the royal velvet red dress that the tall Miss Fulgoni wore so elegantly, it has a fullness, a richly luminous texture. The sheer amount of tone, generously produced, was more than Gordon Crosse's Voice from the Tomb called for; the loneliness, the frightening inner silence of Stevie Smith's poetry was largely left unprobed. It was a clever idea, though, to move from these poems about birds and frogs to Poulenc's Le Bestiaire and Chabrier's rosy pigs and big fat turkeys, all done in decent French with some aplomb. Most promising was Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder, as the voice seems generally happiest singing out in grand style. At first the phrasing was on the short side; but from the third song it started to stretch out with a truly Wagnerian span. Steven Maughan, the singer's otherwise effective accompanist, might have done still more there to keep up with his singer's vocal opulence. That, in itself, says much for Miss Fulgoni's exceptional prowess.</p>

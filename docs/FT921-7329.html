			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Injunction granted against new drink THE High Court yesterday ordered the relabelling of Stone's Original Pale Cream, a drink launched in Tesco stores late last year. Spain's sherry producers complained that the drink's label, which described it as 'a select blend of premium British sherry and fine fortified wines from Spain' had been deliberately designed to confuse consumers. They were granted a temporary injunction against the drink's producer, Matthew Clark and Sons, of Leeds, which also makes Stone's Original Green Ginger Wine. The company denied any attempt to cash in on the sherry name, arguing that the label merely described its contents.</p>

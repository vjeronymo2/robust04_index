			<p>BFN     [Text] The following is the text of the Government's  response to Sinn Fein:    Five months have passed since the British and Irish  Governments published their Joint Declaration.    The Joint Declaration was framed as a balanced set of  principles, fairly addressing the concerns and aspirations of  both traditions in Northern Ireland. It demonstrated that, in  their approach to Northern Ireland's future, the governments of  the United Kingdom and of the Republic of Ireland stand on  common ground.    The Declaration underlined the principle that the future of  Northern Ireland must be founded on consent. If offered the  people of Ireland, North and South respectively, the basis to  agree that their differences could be negotiated and resolved  exclusively by peaceful political means.    The Declaration looked to the full participation in politics  of "democratically mandated parties which established a  commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown  that they abide by the democratic process".    To join the political dialogue with the two governments,  parties were not required to accept the Joint Declaration. They  were required only to declare and demonstrate a permanent end to  violence, and to abide by the democratic process.    Since its adoption, the Joint Declaration has attracted very  wide support thoughout Ireland and far beyond. More than ever,  the people of Northern Ireland want to live in peace and to  resolve their problems democratically and by negotiation.    Yet paramilitary and sectarian violence continues. They see  no justification for this. The Joint Declaration shows that  there is none. It is against this background that we are today  publishing the questions from Sinn Fein, passed to us by the  Irish Government, within this statement.    We have always sought to ensure that our position on the  Joint Declaration is clearly understood by all. As both  Governments have repeatedly emphasised, the terms of the  Declaration are not open to negotiation. Nor will we enter into  questions about future arrangements in Ireland which can  properly be decided only through negotiations involving  democratic parties dedicated exclusively to peaceful political  means.    Both Governments are anxious to see such negotiations take  place on a comprehensive basis, as set out in the Declaration.    Our comments on this document are as follows.    As will readily be seen, the questions which have been  passed  to us range much more widely than seeking elucidation of the  text of the Joint Declaration, though some can be dealt with by  reference to it.    The questions can be considered under these headings:    (i) Questions involving an explanation of the text of the  Joint Declaration; (ii) Questions which appear to seek to  reopen the negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration;    (iii) Questions concerning the British Government's policy  in  respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any  uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration, are  answered by reference to it.    (iv) Questions not arising directly from the text of the  Joint Declaration but concerning procedures consequent on a  cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for  subsequent substantive political dialogue.    (v) Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of  the Joint Declaration but raising substantive questions of wider  Government policy, or questions which would arise in a process  of substantive political dialogue following a cessation of  violence.    (vi) Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially  covering the same ground.    These headings are dealt with in turn. There were 20  questions in the (Sinn Fein) paper passed (to us) by the Irish  Government, and the question numbers which follow are those from  that paper.    I. Questions Involving an Explanation of the Text of the  Joint Declaration.    Q. 4 The British Government says, in the Downing Street  Declaration, "that they will uphold the democratic wishes of a  great number of the people of Northern Ireland." What is the  British Government's precise definition of "a greater number of  the people of Northern Ireland" and how would this be measured  in practical terms?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern  Ireland would be determined by a numerical majority of those  validly voting in a poll fairly and explicitly organised for  this purpose. Provision for such a poll is made in section 1 of  the Northern Ireland Constitution Act: 1973.    II. Questions which appear to seek to reopen the  negotiations which led to the Joint Declaration.    Q.2 Given that the document put to you in June 1993 was  welcomed by the IRA leadership which commented, on October 3,  1993, that it "could form the basis for peace", could you  clarify the differences, if any, between this document and the  Downing Street Declaration?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   This question, referring to a document put to us by the  Irish  Government, does not arise from any uncertainty about the text  of the Joint Declaration which was the product of detailed and  extensive discussions between the two Governments.    These discussions were largely directed towards ensuring  that  the Declaration was clear and unambiguous in its treatment of  the key principles to which both Governments are committed --  including consent, agreement, and parity of esteem and equity of  treatment for both parts of the community in Northern Ireland.    Therefore the only text that bears our name and on which we  can comment is that which was issued on 15 December, 1993, by  the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister  Albert Reynolds] .    III. Questions concerning the British Government's policy  in respect of Northern Ireland which, far from arising from any  uncertainty about the text of the Joint Declaration are answered  by reference to it.    Q.1 The long-term political objectives of the two  Governments are of crucial importance if we are to move out of  the conflict situation caused by the present failed political  structures.    The Taoiseach has clearly stated the long-term objectives of  the Irish Government in the search for a lasting settlement. It  is essential that the British Government displays the same  honesty and frankness in outlining its long-term attitude  towards the Irish people.    What are the British Government's long-term interests and  objectives in relation to Ireland?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration already spells out the  British Government's objectives and interests in relation to  Ireland -- in terms which speak for themselves. In particular,  it states that the British Government's "primary interest is to  see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement  among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work  together with the Irish Government to achieve such an agreement,  which will embrace the totality of relationships."    Q.3 The British and Irish Governments have said that the  political structures cannot be predetermined, now or in the  future. How do you reconcile this with your adherence to the  partition of Ireland and the maintenance of the union?    Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration makes it clear that the  British Government "will uphold the democratic wish of a greater  number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether  they prefer to support the Union or a sovereign united Ireland."    Further, the Government reaffirm as a binding obligation  that  they will introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to  any measure of agreement on future relationships in Ireland  which the people living there, North and South, may themselves  freely determine without external impediment. These statements  confirm that in political dialogue no outcome is either  predetermined or ruled out.    In relation to partition, both Governments are guided by the  reality of the present situation and the principle of consent.  This is reflected in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement,  and in paragraph 7 of the Declaration:    "Both Governments accept that Irish unity would be achieved  only by those who favour this outcome persuading those who do  not, peacefully and without coercion or violence, and that, if  in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland are  so persuaded, both Governments will support and give legislative  effect to their wish."    Q.7 Given the British Government's statement in the Downing  Street Declaration that it is for the Irish people to exercise  our right to self-determination, what is the basis for the  British Government's qualification of this right in Paragraph 4  of the Downing Street Declaration?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The British Government's position on self-determination in  paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration -- that it is to be  exercised "on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently  given, North and South..." -- is entirely consistent with that  of the Irish Government set out in Paragraph 5 of the Joint  Declaration in which the Taoiseach: "accepts, on behalf of the  Irish Government, that the democratic right of  self-determination by the people of Ireland as a whole must be  achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and  consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland and  must, consistent with justice and equity, respect the democratic  dignity and civil rights and religious liberties of both  communities."    IV. Questions not arising directly from the text of the  Joint Declaration, but concerning procedures consequent on a  cessation of violence, including questions about the agenda for  subsequent substantive political dialogue.    Q.8 In the Downing Street Declaration the British Government  gives a commitment to allow the Irish people to freely determine  our future without external impediment or interference, to  encourage, facilitate and enable agreement on this basis and to  introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to this  agreement. Does this mean that the Government of Ireland Act,  Section 75 of which states "the supreme authority of the  parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain unaffected and  undiminished over all persons, and things in (Northern) Ireland  and every part thereof," would be needed as part of an overall  agreement?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The content of an overall agreement will depend on the  outcome of negotiations within the talks process. The British  Government have confirmed that they wil introduce the necessary  legislation to give effect to any measures of the agreement in  future relationships which the people of Ireland may freely  determine on the basis set out in paragraph 4 of the Joint  Declaration. The implications for the Government of Ireland Act  would depend on the nature and content of any such agreement.    Q.11 Given the commitment by the two governments that  everything will be on the table for negotiation:    (a) Will the union between Ireland and Britain be on the  agenda for negotiation?    (b) Will the Government of Ireland Act be on the agenda for  negotiation?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The 26 March 1991 statement, outlining the basis for the  three stranded talks, said that "in order to ensure a full  airing of the issues, it will be open to each of the parties to  raise any aspect of these relationships, including  constitutional issues, or any other matter which it considers  relevant". No political objective could properly be excluded  from discussion in the talks process.    Q.13 Does the British Government accept that while the  consent of a majority of the people of the six county state to  constitutional change, as referred to in the Downing Street  Declaration, may be desirable it is not a legal requirement in  international law?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   Both Governments make clear in the Joint Declaration that  any  change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland would be  subject to the consent of a majority of its people as set out in  the Anglo-Irish Agreement, itself an international instrument  registered at the United Nations.    Q.14 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration  to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation does the  British Government accept that the present structures and  arrangements do not represent a balanced constitutional  accommodation? [no comment on Q.14 as received]    Q.15 Given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration  to work towards a balanced constitutional accommodation, what  constitutional options does the British Government see as being  consistent with this objective?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   In paragraph 1 of the Joint Declaration both Governments  recognise an "absence of a lasting and satisfactory settlement  of relationships between the peoples of both islands...".  Constitutional issues are among those eligible to be addressed  in the talks process.    Q.17 The Taoiseach has said that political parties need not  accept every phrase or word in the Downing Street Declaration.  In fact the DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] have rejected the  Declaration in total and the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party] have  said that it has run its course.    (a) Does the rejection of the Declaration by a political  party exclude that party from involvement in talks on the  development of new political arrangements?    (b) Do parties which are opposed to aspects of the Downing  Street Declaration have the right to dissent from it and yet be  engaged in talks on the development of new political  arrangements?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The Declaration is an agreed position between the two  Governments. It does not depend for its validity on the  attitude of other parties, who are free to determine their own  views on it, and to represent those views in future negotiations.    Acceptance of the Joint Declaration is not a precondition  for  entering the talks process. What IS required is a permanent end  to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence. The two  Governments say in the Joint Declaration that "...in these  circumstances, democratically mandated parties which establish a  commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown  that they abide by the democratic process, are free to  participate fully in democratic politics and to join in dialogue  in due course between the Governments and the political parties  on the way ahead."  <H5>  Q.18 Exploratory Dialogue </H5>   Sinn Fein, as a matter of policy, advocates inclusive  dialogue without preconditions. We do not accept the imposition  of preconditions on our party or on any other party. However,  in the interests of clarity we wish to explore the British  Government position on these matters as outlined in the Downing  Street Declaration.    (a) The British Government has called upon Sinn Fein to  renounce violence. What does this involve?    (b) Patrick Mayhew is reported as saying that a permanent  cessation of violence "is the way in which full recognition can  be accorded to the mandate which Sinn Fein candidates are  accorded at the polls" (Irish Times, Thursday, 14/4/94). How  does the British Government reconcile its refusal to recognise  our democratic mandate with its stated commitment to democratic  principles?    (c) The British Prime Minister has referred to a period of  decontamination for Sinn Fein. What does this mean?    (d) What would be the purpose of the exploratory dialogue  between Sinn Fein and the British Government?    (e) How long would this exploratory dialogue last?    (f) Within this process, when would negotiations about the  future constitutional and political shape of Ireland take place?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The position of both Governments is set out clearly in  Paragraph 10 of the Joint Declaration. There has to be a  permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary  violence. In these circumstances "democratically mandated  parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful  methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic  process, are free to participate fully in democratic politics  and to join in dialogue in due course between the Governments  and the political parties on the way ahead."    For Sinn Fein and the IRA this would involve a public and  permanent renunciation of violence as a means of achieving  political ends, and commitment to peaceful and democratic means  alone.    Within three months, as has already been publicly made  clear, the British Government would in these circumstances begin  exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. The purposes of such  dialogue would be:    (i) to explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to  be admitted to an inclusive political talks process to which the  British Government is committed but without anticipating the  negotiations within that process;    (ii) to exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a  period to play the same part as the current constitutional  parties in the public life of Northern Ireland;    (iii) to examine the practical consequences of the ending of  violence.    The reason for the time lapse between a permanent cessation  of violence and exploratory dialogue is to enable the commitment  to exclusively peaceful and democractic methods to be fully  demonstrated.    The British Government accept the validity of all electoral  mandates, including that of Sinn Fein; and, being committed to  the democratic process, endorses the freedom of voters to choose  their elected representatives. There is no inconsistency  between this and requiring that all who join in political  dialogue should demonstrate a commitment to exclusively peaceful  methods and to the democratic process. Democracy and violence  cannot be reconciled.    Q.20 The Downing Street Declaration is described as "the  starting point of a peace process designed to culminate in a  political settlement." What are the subsequent steps which the  British Government envisages as part of a process of dialogue,  reconciliation and demilitarisation leading to peace and a  political settlement?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   Paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Joint Declaration and associated  statements (see comment on Question 18 above) spell out what  will happen when there is a permanent cessation of violence.  The exploratory dialogue leading to Sinn Fein's involvement in  the political talks process would then begin. A lasting and  general peace would render military operations in support of the  police no longer necessary.    If the Joint Declaration is "the starting point of a peace  process," the next step is for the violence to end for good.    V. Questions not arising from any obscurity in the text of  the Joint Declaration, but raising substantive questions of  wider Government policy, or questions which would arise in a  process of substantive political dialogue following a cessation  of violence.    Q.5 The British Government has said that it has "no selfish  strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland." Would it  not be more in accord with democratic principles for the British  Government to base its Irish policy on the objective of ending  the union?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   The Joint Declaration makes it clear that the British  Government is committed to upholding the principle of consent.    Q.6 The British Government has said that its primary  interest is to see agreement reached between all the Irish  people.    (a) Given the continued intransigent attitude of the  Unionist  leadership, how, in real terms, is such an agreement to be  reached, particularly if the unionist leadership refuses to  engage in the search for agreement?    (b) What is the framework which the British Government  intends to create for the achievement of agreement. [no graf (c)  as received]    (d) Does the British Government accept that, given the  weight  of nationalist opinion throughout Ireland in opposition to  partition, that substantial movement on constitutional issues by  the British Government and the Unionist Parties will be required  if democratic agreement is to be reached?    e) How is agreement to be measured in practical terms and at  what stage does the withholding or absence of agreement on the  part of one section of the Irish people become a veto over  change?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   In Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration, the British  Government commits itself to working together with the Irish  Government to achieve peace, stability and reconciliation  established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the  island and to "encourage, facilitate and enable the achievement  of such agreement...". No organisation has a veto over that  process, whether by withdrawing from it or by refusing to  renounce violence. The two Governments will continue to seek  agreement between themselves and the main constitutional parties  in Northern Ireland on the basis of the agreed statement of 26  March 1991 -- focusing on the three main relationships which are  those within Northern Ireland, among the people of the island of  Ireland and between the two Governments. A keynote of the Joint  Declaration is that any new arrangements must be founded on  consent. It would be wrong to attempt to anticipate the outcome  of the discussions or to set an artificial time limit on the  achievement of agreement on issues of fundamental importance to  the people of these islands. Other issues raised in this  question are properly the concern of participants in the process  of political dialogue.    Q.16 The Taoiseach has said that Unionists possess a veto  only in regard to whether to belong to a sovereign United  Ireland or the UK, that they do not possess a veto over the  policy of the two governments or over interim measures which may  be adopted. Is this also the position for the British  Government?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   No group or organisation has a veto over the policy of a  democratically elected Government. The policy of both  Governments, set out in the Joint Declaration, is however,  founded firmly on the principles of democracy, agreement and  consent.    Q.19 (a) Given the declared opposition of both Governments  to coercion, how will the coercion of Northern nationalists  into the six county state be addressed in real terms?    (b) How will the denial of nationalist rights be redressed  in real terms?    (c) When will repressive legislation be ended?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   This question is based on assumptions which have no  foundation in reality. The Government's approach is reflected  by paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration which includes the  statement that:    "The role of the British Government will be to encourage,  facilitate and enable the achievement of... agreement over a  period through a process of dialogue and co-operation based on  full respect for the rights and identities of both traditions in  Ireland."    It is the clearly declared aim of both Governments that ALL  new arrangements agreed in the course of political dialogue  should be based on consent. An end to violence would open the  way for a comprehensive reassessment of existing provisions  against terrorism, many of which would become irrelevant and  obsolete in a climate of peace.    VI. Questions repeating earlier questions or essentially  covering the same ground.    Q.9 How does the British Government reconcile its stated  objective of maintaining the union with its declared lack of  strategic or economic interest in Ireland?    Q.10 Given the British Government's declared lack of  "selfish  strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland," what is the  British Government's political interest in "Northern Ireland"?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   These points are covered in comment on questions 1 and 8.    Q.12 Given the statement by the British Government in the  Downing Street Declaration that "it is for the people of the  island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts  respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on  the basis of consent,"    (a) Is the continued operation of the Government of Ireland  Act subject to agreement on this basis?    (b) Is the continued existence of the union subject to  agreement on this basis?  <H5>  Comment </H5>   There is nothing to add to the comments given above.  Paragraph 4 of the Joint Declaration could not spell out more  clearly the position in relation to the Union.  <H5>  The Question for Sinn Fein </H5>   Sinn Fein have asked their questions. But the most  fundamental question being asked by the people of these islands  is for them to answer. Democracy and violence cannot be  reconciled. Sinn Fein must choose. They know what they have to  do if they are effectively to fulfil their democratic mandate.  The democratic path leads to a meaningful role in the political  process: a process in which, as has been explained, all issues  are open for discussion and negotiation. The alternative is  isolation -- standing on the outside while those committed to  democracy shape the agreement, structures and institutions that  will determine the relationships between the peoples of these  islands.    Sinn Fein claim a commitment to the principle of self-  determination. That means abiding by the will of the people.  The vast majority of people in Ireland, North and South and of  both traditions, demand an end to violence now. Their wishes  could not be clearer. There is no conceivable justification for  continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for  a textual explanation of the Joint Declaration.    Sinn Fein ask what comes next. Certainly no further playing  for time. If the Joint Declaration is "the starting point of a  peace process", the next step is for violence to end for good.</p>

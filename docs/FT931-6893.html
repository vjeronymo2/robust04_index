			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (6): Inheritance tax may be avoidable - Estate Planning Pounds 150,000 - before any tax at all is payable, and many might feel this is sufficiently generous. The best measures to mitigate the inheritance tax burden for your heirs tend to involve placing a lot of trust in them, which some parents might not be prepared to do. Two or three years ago there was a spate of IHT 'plans', as the tax seemed likely to catch more people. Now, as house prices - the main constituent of most estates - fall while the threshold for paying the tax increases, many are slipping back out of the IHT net. The longer lives secured by modern medicine are also taking their toll on the value of estates left at death, particularly when a few years are spent in expensive residential care. There may be more point in ensuring that you have enough money to pay for this care during your lifetime, than in limiting the IHT payable on whatever estate is left. However, those who want to take action against IHT can take heart from the fact that it is a very easy tax to avoid. The basic allowances are as follows: You can leave as much as you like to your spouse - all bequests to a marriage partner are outside the IHT net, and all other allowances are in addition to this. The threshold before IHT is payable on an estate is Pounds 150,000. No tax will be payable if Pounds 150,000 is left to an heir and the rest of the estate is left to a spouse. Over and above these, 'potentially exempt transfers' can be made. These are gifts made to heirs (or anyone else) during the donor's lifetime. If the donor survives for seven years, no IHT will be payable on these. If death intervenes within seven years, then there could be an IHT liability - this tapers off, depending on how long the donor survives. On top of these provisions, there are annual exemptions: A gift of up to Pounds 3,000 can be given each year to an individual, completely free of IHT liability. This can only be carried forward by one tax year, so those who have not made such a gift for IHT purposes before can give a maximum of Pounds 6,000 in the first tax year. A limitless number of 'small gifts' of up to Pounds 250 per tax year can also be given away. If you had 20 people to whom you wanted to make gifts, you could therefore give Pounds 5,000 completely free of IHT. Once all these exemptions have been accounted for, heirs will have to pay 40 per cent of any excess in tax. From an estate of Pounds 1m where no action had been taken, therefore, Pounds 340,000 would be payable in tax (40 per cent of Pounds 850,000). If you do not want your heirs to be burdened with this there are two broad ways to proceed - either by using life assurance policies, or through trusts. The route of least resistance is to insure your life for the amount of IHT which you expect your heirs to have to pay. If you take out a whole-of-life policy, written in trust, your heirs are at least guaranteed not to have to be out of pocket. However, life insurance for the elderly is not cheap, so this could make quite a dent in the value of the estate. A variation on this is to give your money away as a potentially exempt transfer, and then take out a seven-year term insurance policy. If you die within the seven-year time limit, therefore, your heirs' tax liability will be covered. However, the life insurers will pay nothing if you survive more than seven years. Still another possibility is to buy a whole-of-life policy, along with an annuity. All money paid into an annuity is automatically outside your estate, as it officially belongs to the life company, and the annuity income payments can then be used to pay the premiums for the whole-of-life policy. Taking this route could, however, be over-generous to a salesman paid by commission only. A more complicated route to estate-planning, which involves paying less in life insurance commission, involves setting up a trust. Inheritance tax-planning trusts are typically 'gift and loan', where some money is given to the trust but a larger proportion is only loaned. Profits made by the trust on the money loaned to it should be immune from IHT, although the precise limits are controversial.</p>

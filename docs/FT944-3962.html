			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GEC advances 6% to Pounds 378m - Increasing turnover and operating margins please City General Electric Company, the defence and electronics company, yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profit from Pounds 360m to Pounds 378m on turnover up by 10 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn, against Pounds 4.39bn. The interim dividend is increased to 2.95p (2.81p) from earnings per share of 8.8p (8.2p). However, the profits increase for the six months to September 30 masked a much better performance from most operating companies. The City was pleased that turnover and operating margins were increasing, and that the company was not reliant on cost-cutting for improved profits. Lord Weinstock, managing director, also said that the company would continue to pursue its bid for VSEL, the submarine maker, with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Analysts said that the profits showed the productivity benefits of previous rationalisation were feeding through now that the US and UK economies were recovering. Operating profits were up by 14 per cent at Pounds 296m (Pounds 260m) and only a decline in interest income from Pounds 81m to Pounds 70m held back the pre-tax improvement. There was a particularly strong performance from Gilbarco, the US petrol pumps business, and profits in its division doubled to Pounds 30m. A mixture of underlying growth in the US petrol market and changes in environmental legislation, forcing the replacement of old equipment, were responsible. GPT, the telecommunications joint venture with Siemens, also showed improved profits on last year's depressed levels. Analysts expect figures for the year to be modestly ahead of the Pounds 120m achieved last time. Equipment orders from cable tv companies expanding into the UK market, along with software orders for BT and improved exports were responsible for the improvement. GEC Alsthom, the power and transport joint venture, saw turnover grow by 22 per cent but operating profits were only up by 8 per cent. GEC's forward order book was down from Pounds 13bn to Pounds 12bn a year ago, largely due to a fall in GEC Alsthom's orders. GEC, however, attributed the fall to timing differences and said that the figure took no account of the Korean high-speed train contract which had since been signed, or of the deal announced this week to supply trains and maintainance for the Northern underground line in London. The company expects its order book to return to last year's levels by the end of March. GEC-Marconi, the defence and electronics subsidiary, had flat profits on a maintained turnover. Lord Weinstock said that conditions remained very tough in defence. However, profits should improve once the production phase of Eurofighter's radar and flight control systems come on stream.

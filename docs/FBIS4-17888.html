			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Svetlana Ivanova] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 27 TASS -- Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin gave a short news conference at the end  of his one-day visit to St. Petersburg on Wednesday.    Before leaving by plane for Tel-Aviv, Rabin expressed hope  that fulfilment of the bilateral agreements signed earlier in  Moscow will contribute to developing cooperation between the two  countries.    The Israeli prime minister met with deputy head of St.  Petersburg administration Aleksey Kudrin. The exchange of ideas  proved useful for the Russian party, because Israel earlier used  to tackle the problems which Russia faces now. These include  controlling the inflation, privatization (especially,  privatization of housing construction) and developing the  agro-industrial complex.    Asked to comment on his decision to fly aboard an ordinary  Israeli plane together with 170 emigrants from Kiev and 25 from  St. Petersburg, rather than aboard a chartered one, like he did  when he arrived in Russia, Rabin said he wanted to share -- if  only for once -- the sentiments of those who had made the hard  choice to leave their birth-places for ever.</p>

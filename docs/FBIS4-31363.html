			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Decision of the Federal Government"] </F>   [Text] Belgrade -- In its meeting yesterday the Federal  Government adopted a decision to sell 50 million dinars worth of  federal commodity reserves in May and June. That sum is to be  used to cover the federal budget deficit during this period.  This move was not possible earlier, since the necessary legal  basis was created only in the last session of the Assembly, Dr.  Radoje Kontic, federal prime minister, informed newsmen.    The deficit in the federal treasury has remained unchanged,  but in practice this means that foreign-exchange reserves will  be used to cover 335 million dinars of the federal state's  deficit and the sale of some commodity reserves, another 180  million dinars.    It was explained to newsmen that 23 million dinars will be  realized from the sale of farm products, about 5 million from  energy products, and 17 million from the sale of industrial raw  materials.</p>

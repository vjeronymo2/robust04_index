			<p>BFN     [Text] The "Defense Policy Council" (chaired by Asahi  Breweries Ltd. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi), a private advisory  body to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, held a meeting at the prime  minister's official residence on the morning of 25 May, and  exchanged views on the international situation after the end of  the Cold War. It was confirmed that "it is necessary to prevent  regional disputes and proliferation of mass destruction arms  because there are isolated and unpredictable dangers in various  places." Taking such a situation into consideration, the  council agreed that "Japan should take positive actions to  resolve international problems," and decided to make this view  the framework of a report to be submitted to the prime minister.    With regard to the Asian and Pacific situation, the  participants cited the following as important issues: 1) while  the economy in this region is steadily developing, its security  system is immature; 2) interests of the major military powers,  such as the United States, Russia, and China, are entangled.  The council decided to state in the report its view that  Japan's defense capability "will become an increasingly  important component for the security environment of the Asian  and Pacific region."</p>

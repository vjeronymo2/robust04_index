			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  embarks on state visits to Japan and China Thursday [24 March]  to hold summits on bilateral and regional issues and seek  cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem.    He will be in Tokyo from Thursday to Saturday, meeting  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for private and  expanded summits. He stops in Shanghai on Saturday and arrives  in Beijing on Sunday. His schedule there includes talks with  President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng.    Building economic links was to top the agenda until last  week, when North Korea's nuclear program created an  unanticipated crisis.    The U.N. Security Council is poised to adopt a resolution on  Pyongyang early next week, and securing Beijing's tacit approval  is a must before the international community can take unified  action.    Kim and his wife will call on Japanese Emperor Akihito on  the  afternoon of his arrival and then have a private summit with  Hosokawa.    The two leaders will look at ways to build forward-looking  relations after agreeing last summer to close the book on a past  stained by Japanese colonial rule over Korea from 1910-45.    The South Korean president addresses the Japanese Diet on  Friday and is to receive an honorary doctorate from Waseda  University.    He meets Hosokawa again on Saturday before leaving for  Shanghai, this time accompanied by his cabinet ministers.    In Shanghai, Kim will tour the complex that used to house  the  Korean Government-in-exile during the Japanese colonial years.    He starts his Beijing itinerary Monday morning in a summit  with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, where he will likely ask  Beijing to intervene in the North Korean nuclear standoff.    Kim will also address bilateral trade issues at the summit.    He plans to speak at Beijing University on new Seoul-Beijing  relations and tour South Korea's exclusive industrial complex in  Tianjin before returning home on March 30.</p>

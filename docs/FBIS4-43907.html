			<p>BFN     [Text] Halle -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  Chairman Rudolf Scharping has sworn his party in for a change of  power at the Bundestag elections in October. "We want to win.  I am not counting on a place, but on victory," Scharping said  in his policy statement at the special party conference in Halle  on Wednesday [22 June].    The Social Democrats are prepared to take on government  responsibility again. To achieve this aim, the SPD will have to  make an effort during the next few months. "The change will not  come about automatically; it has to be fought for." After the  disappointing results of the European elections, all Social  Democrats must realize that they have to fight with even more  clarity and determination. "You cannot look ahead if you hang  your head," he told the 500 delegates in Halle.    Scharping said that directions will be decided at the  Bundestag election. "The decision will be whether wariness,  lack of solidarity, and irresponsibility will keep spreading  like mildew, or whether the opportunity for change is used to  return to reason and tolerance." Scharping accused the Federal  Government of having changed the social climate through  selfishness and recklessness. A strong Social Democratic force  is also necessary to ward off nationalism and right-wing  extremism, Scharping said.    He said he is sure that Chancellor Kohl's policy of "going  on  the same way as ever" cannot be sustained until October. A big  majority in unified Germany wants to see a change toward new  politics. This is only possible with an SPD-led government.  Instead of a coalition debate, the SPD has to conduct a reform  debate. "We will counteract conservative restoration with a  policy of reforms. To achieve this, we are looking for wide  alliances with all groups of our society."    He cannot promise that a government led by him will  immediately solve all problems, said Scharping, who is to be  elected candidate for chancellor at the end of the one-day party  conference. "But we promise that we will give the people  courage again, we will strengthen the feeling of solidarity, and  open politics to reforms." An SPD government will immediately  embark upon cutting unemployment step by step. It will not  increase the tax burden and lower taxes and rates in those  fields where they impair growth and employment. The SPD will  make sure that the unconstitutional taxation of the minimum  subsistence level will be stopped as of 1996 and that a child  benefit of 250 marks is paid for each child.    Another priority of an SPD government will be an ecological  modernization of industry. This will require a tax reform that  promotes environment-friendly measures and levies taxes on  behavior that harms the environment. The SPD will maintain its  objective of withdrawing from nuclear energy in the medium term.  Scharping warned against leaving the competence in  environmental matters to the Greens. The welfare state must  also be restabilized. The welfare state is not "the ambulance"  of society, but a clear constitutional mandate, Scharping said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There is now an overwhelming majority in the  parliament in favor of Sweden beginning cooperation with the  NATO military alliance--the so-called Partnership for Peace.  This became possible after the Social Democrats accepted a  motion on the government's proposal on NATO cooperation.  [passage omitted]    In NATO's Partnership program, each country decides how  extensive the military cooperation will be, and every country  pays for the cooperation in which it takes part. According to  Pierre Schori, the foreign policy spokesman of the Social  Democrats, we can never have Swedish soldiers fighting in a NATO  [word indistinct].    [Begin recording] [Schori] No, we will not choose that. That  is directed toward the East and Central Europeans, who want to  join NATO, but cannot. They are offered something that looks  like cooperation with NATO, but it is not.    [Correspondent Herman Melzer] But is this not cooperation  that we are prepared to begin, cooperation with NATO on several  different points?    [Schori] Well, the initiative came from NATO....    [Melzer, interrupting] Is it not false then that we say that  we are free of alliances, when we are now going to cooperate  with NATO?    [Schori] Well, you are stuck on NATO. This is a proposal  that comes from NATO, but this is not direct NATO activity.  This is a manifestation that the world changes, and NATO  actually also changes. NATO must find something else;  otherwise, it has no justification for its existence.    [Melzer] Still, there is no other military alliances with  which we cooperate.    [Schori] No, there is actually no other military alliance  any  more, so we will have to begin with what we have. The aim is  joint security and, from our point of view, the basic choice in  our activities is freedom from military alliances. [end  recording]</p>

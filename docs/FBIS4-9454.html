			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- Completion of the south  Bohemian nuclear power plant at Temelin is not questioned by the  Czech Government or any other institution, Trade and Industry  Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told journalists today. No new law is  necessary to allow the Temelin's completion. The plant's  construction continues as scheduled, Dlouhy said.    Frantisek Benda, the Czech Minister for the Environment,  said  in early April that Temelin could not be made operational before  a so- called "nuclear law" was adopted. He added at the time  that unless such a law were passed, he would not give his  go-ahead for Temelin's operation.    The Ministry for Trade and Industry is responsible for work  on a bill on peaceful use of nuclear energy and ionizing  radiation that should thoroughly integrate regulations in the  sector.    The present legislation is adequate, Dlouhy said. A nuclear  law will come to be needed mainly when the Czech Republic has  two nuclear power plants (in Temelin and Dukovany, South  Moravia) producing 40 percent of the Czech power output.    The government has unanimously agreed on Temelin's  completion. The plant's repercussions on the environment were  discussed at the time when planning permission was issued and  again after 1989, Dlouhy said, adding that changes in the  plant's project which came out of the discussions would increase  the plant's safety and lessen its impact on the environment.</p>

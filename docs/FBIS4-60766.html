			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 29, BNS -- The commander in chief of  the Estonian defense forces, Major General Aleksander Einseln  returned from a visit to Brussels today. Einseln participated  in a meeting of commanders of armed forces of the countries of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC].    The meeting discussed ways to develop the NATO Partnership  for Peace program, and also, the formation of a Baltic  peacekeeping battalion, Einseln said at a press conference in  Tallinn today.    The peacekeeping company to be set up in Estonia under the  joint Baltic force scheme will be ready to participate in joint  maneuvers of the international peacekeeping forces in the  Netherlands, due in late October, the Estonian general said at a  meeting of the NACC peacekeeping group in Brussels Thursday [28  April].    A unit of 20 will be sent to participate in the joint  maneuvers from Estonia, the country's commander in chief said  today. "If we want to join the NATO some time in the future, we  must start taking part in such kind of events as early as  possible," he said.    At a joint neeting of the armed force commanders of NACC and  the NATO Committee for Military Issues on Wednesday, Einseln  expressed hope that the Baltic peacekeeping battalion will be  ready to fulfill its tasks from November 1995.    Einseln told reporters today that the formation of the  Baltic  battalion had gained great support. There exists a readiness to  come in with assistance in training, and possibly, also for the  part of equipment, he added.    According to information obtained by BNS, Einseln has  submitted to the Defense Ministry a draft ruling on the creation  of the detached peacekeeping company, or the Estonian part of  the joint Baltic force. The ruling had to be adopted by the  government.    The draft says the company would be set up as a separate  legal entity under the Estonian Defense Ministry, with its own  seal and symbols. The draft foresees that the ministry would  draw up the lists of the new company's structure and  composition, and submit to the government for approval a draft  budget of the new unit. The ministry and the Central Staff must  see to it that the unit be manned in due time.    The Foreign Ministry will formally apply to the UN  Headquarters for authorization of the new peacekeeping unit and  its submission to the UN peacekeeping force.    Estonia now has also its representative, Lieutenant Peeter  Lans, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to oversee the  country's cooperation with NATO and activity under the  Partnership for Peace plan.</p>

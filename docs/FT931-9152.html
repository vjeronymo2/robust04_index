			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Inflation changes forecast by Bank THE STRUCTURE of inflation in Britain is expected to change after sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, with the gap between goods and service inflation narrowing, the Bank of England said yesterday. In an article released in advance of publication of its quarterly bulletin today, the Bank said that annual retail price inflation was about 3 percentage points higher in the service sector than in the goods sector last year - during most of which the UK was still in the ERM - after being about 2 percentage points higher on average since the early 1980s. Yesterday's article said that the gap was partly explained by faster productivity growth in manufacturing and the recession having a bigger impact in suppressing goods inflation. The Bank said foreign competition had combined with membership of the ERM to restrain traded-goods inflation, and the ERM had 'led to an exchange rate higher than it would otherwise have been'. The report concluded that the gap between service and traded goods price trends will narrow.</p>

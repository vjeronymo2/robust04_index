			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 KILLED WHEN PLANE CRASHES IN MALIBU FOG;  </P> <P> AVIATION: TWO MEN AND TWO WOMEN WERE RETURNING FROM DINNER IN OXNARD. ALL WERE  BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION.  </P> <P> Four people were killed late Saturday when their small plane burst into a ball  of flames after crashing into a rugged fog-shrouded hilltop overlooking the  ocean in Malibu.  </P> <P> The manager of a charter aviation company in Santa Monica said the victims were  the plane's owner and three friends. He said the party had flown from Santa  Monica to Oxnard for dinner and were returning when the Piper Cherokee crashed.  </P> <P> Masato Suzuki, manager of Captain U.S.A., said the victims were Kaz Nakamura, a  Japan Air Lines flight instructor, Nakamura's friend Masatoshi Yokota and his  wife, Fumiko, and another female passenger he knew only by a nickname.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County coroner's officials said the bodies were burned beyond  recognition, and no official identification would be made until dental records  are reviewed.  </P> <P> Suzuki said Nakamura, who is based in Napa, would fly his personal plane to  Santa Monica on weekends to train student pilots. Nakamura, he said, was an  experienced pilot with more than 6,500 hours of flying, but Suzuki said he was  not sure who was flying the plane when it crashed.  </P> <P> The crash "was a horrendous experience," said Lewis Marvin, 56, who, along with  his wife and three children, was awakened shortly after 11 p.m. when the plane  plowed into the hillside less than 70 feet from his house. "I looked out the  window and I thought that the whole world had blown up."  </P> <P> When the accident occurred, county fire Capt. Michael Johnson said, the fog was  so thick that fire personnel responding "couldn't even see the hood of the fire  truck."  </P> <P> Because of the weather and the remoteness of the area, Marvin said,  firefighters and rescue workers did not arrive at the scene until the flames  were almost out.  </P> <P> Marvin's residence in the 20000 block of Everding Motorway is the only  structure within earshot of where the accident occurred, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Saturday night's fog, according to a spokesman for WeatherData Inc., which  supplies weather forecasts for The Times, resulted from a coastal storm that  dropped as much as half an inch of rain in the area. By Sunday, he said, the  storm had moved east leaving a prediction of clear and cool skies through the  early part of the week with temperatures reaching only into the lower 60s.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Siok-Hian Tay Kelley and Edward J. Boyer contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

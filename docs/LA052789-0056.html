			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A juror in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial disclosed Friday in court that  her rabbi had told her Hunter was guilty.  </P> <P> The disclosure came after attorneys for Hunter, 50, asked U. S. District Judge  Earl B. Gilliam to ask each juror and alternate whether they had read anything  about the case or had spoken to anyone about it.  </P> <P> The unidentified juror told Gilliam that her rabbi asked her what she had been  doing lately, and she replied that she was a juror in the Hunter case.  </P> <P> "She's guilty," the rabbi responded, according to the juror.  </P> <P> The juror promised the judge she would not consider the rabbi's opinion, and  she was allowed to remain on the case.  </P> <P> Gilliam turned down a motion by Hunter's lawyers asking that the jury be  sequestered.  </P></p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: US Treasury shortens debt maturity THE US Treasury yesterday announced plans to cut the cost of the federal debt by reducing the amount of 30-year bonds and increasing the amount of shorter-dated securities it sells to investors. The announcement ended months of speculation in the US bond market. For more than a year the Treasury had been toying with the idea of shortening the maturity on government debt as a means of reducing the federal interest burden. The government pays out a lower interest rate on shorter-dated securities compared with longer-dated securities, such as the 30-year bond. The changes will not be introduced immediately, because the Treasury is going ahead with its auction of bonds later this month, although the size of that issue has been cut by several billion dollars. In future, however, the Treasury will cut the frequency of bond issues from three months a year to only one every six months a year. To compensate for the reduction in bond issuance, the Treasury will increase its quarterly sales of shorter-dated securities with maturities of three years and less. The seven-year issue will be phased out altogether. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, described the changes as 'carefully crafted and moderate,' designed to realise long-term savings on interest costs. The extent of those savings was not specified, but President Bill Clinton, in his budget, estimated that changes in the maturity of government debt could save the country more than Dollars 16bn over five years. In going ahead with the changes, the Treasury has chosen to ignore the judgment of the borrowing committee of the Public Securities Association, which advises the government on debt management. The committee warned that shifting the debt load would lead to higher short-term interest rates, which would not only hurt corporate borrowers but also undermine the government's original objective of lowering its interest costs.

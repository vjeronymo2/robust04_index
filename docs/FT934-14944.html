			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Bids for Markham colliery invited BRITISH COAL yesterday invited private mining companies to bid for the licence to operate Markham colliery in Derbyshire. Markham is the first and, so far, the only one of the 12 pits reprieved in March to close. The colliery produced 1.5m tonnes of coal in its last full year of production before its closure in the summer. The 400 miners at Markham, which once employed 2,400, voted to accept voluntary redundancy. Private-sector interest is likely to be limited. Of the first 19 mines to be put out to tender following their closure this year, only 13 tenders remain under active consideration by British Coal and three of them involve surface assets only. Only three mining companies have made bids. Separately, union leaders led by Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, last night pressed Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, to halt pit closures. Mr Monks said: 'We need to achieve a coal-led energy policy through a constructive dialogue, not a political stand-off.' But Mr Eggar was unable to give any assurances over the future of Britain's deep-mined coal industry and he refused to call a halt to pit closures as the TUC wanted. Mr Eggar said the outlook for coal was 'difficult' and he was unable to prevent the development of more gas-fired power stations. Nor was he ready to use any of the Pounds 500m subsidy allocated to help the coal industry. 'Mr Eggar is not even prepared to implement his own white paper,' said Mr Roger Lyons, the TUC energy committee chairman. He added: 'The minister gave the impression that he wants to wash his hands of the coal industry as soon as possible.' Mr Monks said: 'There is a major chasm between the government and the unions over markets, pit safety and the privatisation of the coal industry.' However, the minister did say that he would consider whether to extend the existing favourable redundancy terms for miners which are due to end on December 30. More than 22,000 mineworkers have left the industry since last October, leaving just 30,000 at 30 pits.</p>

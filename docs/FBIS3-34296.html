			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Security issues, agreed to at the talks with the  PLO, are to be discussed today at the Prime Minister's Office.  Prime Minister Rabin, Chief of Staff Baraq, and other senior  officers are to take part. Chief of Staff Baraq says reports of  divisions between the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the  Foreign Ministry over security agreements with the Palestinians  are exaggerated. All of us share a common goal to achieve the  best security arrangements possible, he said in Tel Aviv last  night.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 4 February  adds: "Chief of Staff Baraq said yesterday that in the recent  discussions with the PLO, very promising working papers have  been formalized. The IDF examines every draft and makes its  comments because it will have to execute the agreement in the  field."]    Commenting on the gun battle between an Army undercover unit  and Fatah members in Rafah yesterday in which one Fatah gunman  was killed and two soldiers wounded, General Baraq said the IDF  will continue to pursue anyone still engaging in armed attacks.  The chief of staff, who was attending the annual dinner for  wounded veterans of the IDF Engineering Corps, spoke with our  reporter Alan Ben-'Ami:    [Begin recording] [Ben-'Ami] There is an impression now  that there is a conflict or an argument between the IDF, the  Army, yourself, and the diplomats with regard to security  arrangements and the agreement with the Palestinians.    [Baraq] No, no; we do not have.... [pauses] Our  negotiations are not with the Foreign Ministry or the minister  of foreign affairs, but Israel is running negotiations with the  Palestinians. We have, naturally, different perspectives, but a  common cause and goal to achieve an agreement with the  Palestinians where the security interests -- especially the  personal security of Israeli settlers in the Gaza and Jericho  area -- will be fully secured. We are responsible for it.  These are arrangements that have to do with the security of the  individual settler in Gaza and Jericho, and we feel fully  committed to make whatever should be done in order to secure  that.    [Ben-'Ami] Does it look as if it is going to take a lot more  discussion yet to reach the arrangement?    [Baraq] No. It is quite natural that we are clarifying the  details with our Foreign Ministry officials, but if it should  take another two or three weeks, so let it be.    [Ben-'Ami] General Baraq, has there been any change in the  IDF policy toward Fatah members? There have been a number of  gunfights, a number of arrests of Fatah people by the IDF?    [Baraq] We do not discriminate them along the lines of  organizational behavior, but along the lines of their personal  behavior. Those who are taking part in active violence, even  after the 13th of September, the agreements, we keep pursuing  them. But, we are not dealing with those who let their arms  down and are not participating in active violence, and were not  participating in the past in murders.    [Ben-'Ami] With regard to the violence, a number of young  children have been killed in recent days on the streets in the  Gaza -- an 11-year-old, a 13-year-old -- in shooting incidents  with the Army.    [Baraq] We are making whatever we can in order to reduce the  fatalities among civilians, especially among children.  Unfortunately, the sources of violence are in the behavior of  the Palestinian population. We hope that they will be able to  control the going out and activity on the street of the  youngsters.

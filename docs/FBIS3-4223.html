			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>   [Text] Macao police investigating a bungled armed hold-up  by two Chinese illegal immigrants have discovered what they  described as a "beeper bomb factory" making bombs using pagers.  It is the first time that police have come across the devices  by a pager signal, the police spokesman, Major Jose Lourenco,  said. "It was not the work of amateurs, but of people who have  a very precise knowledge of electronics and explosive devices,"  Lourenco said.    Two men, aged 25 and 27, were arrested by police after a  raid  on a flat in Rua do Almirante Costa Cabral at about 7am on  Saturday [26 March]. They were expected to appear before Macao  District Court today. A team of officers from the Macao public  security police discovered 30 detonators, a Chinese-made Makarov  pistol, 20 rounds of ammunition and an amount of explosives.    He said the men were arrested 24 hours after they had tried,  unsuccessfully, to rob the Chan Hang frozen meat shop on Rua de  Erva on Friday. The men left behind two pager bombs when they  fled the shop after the proprietor bit one of them on the hand,  triggering a gun shot that accidentally hit the other bandit.  The bombs were defused by police but 15 minutes after they had  been deactivated, the two pagers reacted to calls from the  central paging station.    Macao police sources said that the pager bombs were  "extremely worrying for their criminal cunning". "Imagine  someone putting a pager bomb somewhere in Macao, then after that  travelling to China or Hong Kong and phoning from there to a  pager station in Macao in order to trigger the explosion," one  source said. "You could call it cross-border remote control."    "Theoretically, you can put a pager bomb somewhere in  America, then you leave that continent to make your pager  station call from Asia or Europe."</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Job cuts herald shake-up at Owners Abroad Mr Francis Baron, new chief executive of holiday company Owners Abroad, yesterday announced the redundancy of 260 management and support staff and said he was conducting a review that could change the group's name. Mr Baron, who took charge of Owners Abroad last month, said the group had little idea under its previous management of how profitable it was. He added that its branding and marketing strategy had been incoherent. The defence documents it published to fight off a takeover by its rival Airtours earlier this year had 'lacked conviction'. Mr Baron, a former television executive, replaced Mr Howard Klein, the former chairman and chief executive, who announced his resignation last July. Mr Klein left after the group announced that full-year profits this year were likely to be half that of market expectations. Mr Baron said that while the group had been producing large amounts of data, there was no system to ensure this reached directors in a form that would enable them to assess the company's performance. Mr Baron said yesterday's redundancies, accompanied by a restructuring were the first part of a three-phase plan to restore the group's fortunes. The restructuring will eliminate four levels of management. General managers and finance directors of subsidiary companies are leaving. The post of managing director of tour operating is being abolished and Mr Dermot Blastland, the current incumbent, is being reassigned to work on a special project for Mr Baron. Mr Baron would not describe the project. The second phase of the plan, which Mr Baron hoped to complete by the end of February, would improve information systems. The third phase will develop a marketing and branding strategy by the end of March. Mr Baron said: 'Everything is up for grabs, including the corporate name.' Airtours is renaming its Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson retail chains. All 550 shops will be called Going Places. Airtours intends to complete the rebranding by Christmas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak today  called Egyptian-Syrian relations very strong. Speaking to  journalists just after seeing off Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad, Mubarak said that he and President al-Asad discussed  the Middle East peace process and examined ways of restoring  Arab solidarity to its former state and resolving differences  within the Arab family.    Answering a question from MENA, President Mubarak said that  his talks with President al-Asad also touched on the Yemeni  crisis and the disputes between the north and the south. We  also discussed the Libyan-Western crisis, he said.    President Mubarak said: We talked in general about the  issues of concern to the entire Arab world.    Answering a question on whether the Egyptian-Syrian summit  explored ways to end the crisis facing the current peace  process, Mubarak said: We did not get into details, but I would  like to say that we discussed the issue of peace, bearing in  mind the recent meeting in Geneva between President al-Asad and  U.S. President Bill Clinton.    President Mubarak added: I think that there was tremendous  hope for the continuation of the peace talks, and then the  incident in Hebron forestalled and complicated the process.    President Mubarak expressed his full confidence that Syrian  President al-Asad wants peace. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin shares this view and also wants peace, he added.  President Mubarak expressed his hope that negotiations will  resume in the last week of April in Washington. He said that he  hoped there will be flexibility in the negotiations so that  peace can be achieved this year without further delay.    Asked by an Israeli television reporter if he had discussed  the peace negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track with the  Syrian president, President Mubarak said: Yes, we talked about  it. I would like to emphasize that President Hafiz al-Asad  cares about peace and wants to reach a solution to the problem,  a just and honorable solution. President Mubarak expressed his  belief that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is also  following the same line and wants peace. President Mubarak  added: I hope that there will be flexibility in the Arab-Israeli  bilateral negotiations, which I believe will be resumed in the  last week of April. He added: I hope they will reach a peace  agreement before the end of this year.    Asked if he means flexibility on the part of Israel,  President Mubarak said: Actually, the flexibility must come  from both sides, although more flexibility is needed from the  Israeli side so that we can give momentum to the peace process.  In this regard, President Mubarak emphasized that peace  deserves every sacrifice because it means life to the peoples  that enables them to live safely, cooperate, and come together.  He added: Now, they do not come together because there is a  problem that has existed for almost 50 years. We cannot expect  to just push a button and have all parties come together and  embrace. It takes time. Peace is important to every  individual, whether an Israeli or an Arab.    Asked about Syria's position on the Golan, President Mubarak  said: The Golan is Syrian territory, and it is hard to ask  Syria to give up an inch of the Golan. He added: I am not  imposing this on Israel but I say what I believe; that is, peace  must be in return for land, otherwise, the peace process will  remain difficult.    Asked about the current situation on the Israeli-Palestinian  track, President Mubarak said: As you know, the Hebron incident  has complicated things. But I believe that they have reached an  agreement to secure the Hebron region and are now continuing the  negotiations on how to implement the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles. I hope they will finish this quickly  although some minor obstacles still exist, but I am confident  they will overcome them.    In response to another question if there are proposals to  resolve the Syrian-Israeli problem, President Mubarak said: The  matter is clear; the Syrian land must be returned, which would  mean the return of peace, with some security measures that could  be taken. The president referred to the Madrid conference for  Middle East peace. He said: The conference has played its role.  All parties have met and now everybody must get down to direct  agreements among themselves.    Asked whether a meeting between Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin can help  achieve a peace agreement, President Mubarak said: Such a  meeting will help resolve problems. We have tried this several  times. But the Syrians do not agree to such a high-level  meeting at present. When they reach a peace agreement, such a  meeting will not be a problem.    On his upcoming visit to Japan and China sometime this  month, President Mubarak said: We have good relations with  China. There is great cooperation between us. Japan is an  important country and cooperates with us. Japan has given  economic aid to Egypt. We expect more cooperation during our  visit.    On the national dialogue committee, President Mubarak said:  Once I return from China and Japan I will meet with the  dialogue committee to draw up the bases for its work so that it  will start its activity and adopt the necessary recommendations.  On the date the committee will start its work, President  Mubarak said that once the committee meets, the wheels will  start turning.    Asked whether he discussed with al-Asad the issue of [words  indistinct] states that export terrorism, President Mubarak  said: We did not discuss this problem. I hope all this will  disappear. Let us concentrate on the peace process.</p>

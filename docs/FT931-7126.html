			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Strikes sweep France FRANCE'S beleaguered Socialist government yesterday faced a barrage of strikes and demonstrations across the country from farmers, dockers, scientists and factory workers. Militant farmers blocked the Paris-Lille motorway with tractors in protest against the fall in potato prices. The port of Dunkirk was disrupted by dockers protesting against the government's dock reorganisation scheme. The Socialists, already embarrassed by this week's violent demonstrations by fishermen and facing humiliating defeat in next month's parliamentary elections, have for some time been plagued by protests from farmers and dockers. However the government now faces industrial action from public sector employees. The staff at the National Centre for Scientific Research in Meudon-Bellevue yesterday protested against the proposed closure of the site, which employs 400 people. There was also a strike at Syseca, a subsidiary of Thomson, the state-controlled electronics group, in Toulouse, in protest at job cuts.</p>

The trust, which invests mainly in countries in the World Bank's low and middle income brackets, came to the market in July last year. Net revenue for the period from the launch to end-June amounted to Pounds 732,030 for earnings of 1.22p per share, 1.2p of which is distributed to shareholders as a special dividend. However, directors, said that as emerging markets typically provide low dividend yields and that the trust's objective was to achieve capital growth, net income for the current year would be 'significantly lower'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Helga Einecke: "The Fear of the Interest Rate </F> Pause"]    [Text] The financial markets show themselves fearful and  uncertain in these weeks shortened by holidays. They have been  deprived of the phantasy by which they live. Lately, market  participants speculated from week to week on falling interest  rates, and with this hope the prices rose. But this tooth of  constantly slightly dropping interest rates was surprisingly  pulled by the Bundesbank two weeks ago. This not only concerns  the lowering of key interest rates by half a percent, described  in exaggeration as significant. In addition, there were  statements by the Bundesbank president about the cleared-up  horizon, which were taken as an interest-rate pause until summer  or fall, or even as the lowest interest rate benchmark. So even  the minimal lowering of the third key rate this week is of no  help. Sales of fixed-interest securities predominate, prices are  tumbling, and long-term interest rates are rising.    Thus the calculation of the Bundesbank might work out. The  declared goal of its signal two weeks ago was favoring long-term  investments through lower interest rates for short-term  investments. This is backed by the hope of the guardians of the  currency that those active in finances, by switching from the  money market to the capital market, could break down the dam of  the accumulated money supply. For since the end of last year,  tax and interest rate uncertainties have produced a decided  inclination in investors toward short-term disposable money.  Nurtured by relatively high interest rates, billions are parked  in accounts and time deposits instead of flowing into long-term  securities.    The excessive money supply is not the only headache for the  Bundesbank, which can still proudly point to its strong German  mark. So far, no one has been able to refute the thesis that the  liquidity glut may harbor the germ of future inflation. At the  same time, the interest level in this country must remain  attractive for quite some time to finance unification. It is not  own capital which dominates the bond market. In 1993, there was  an influx of 226 billion German marks from abroad, which was  highly welcome in view of the necessary transfers to east  Germany.    Since February, the tide has turned, and foreigners are  again  withdrawing their deposits. The savings rate of Germans also is  no longer what it was, because the savings rate of 11 percent  has reached its lowest point in seven years. It is fortunate  that the dollar also plays in the trans-Pacific field of tension  and does not outstrip the strong German mark. What was it the  BHF bank said? The Bundesbank needs a thick skin, also because  the new slick financial maneuvers can turn any monetary gnat  into a financial elephant.</p>

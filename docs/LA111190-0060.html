			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION RESULTS  </P> <P> The unthinkable has happened. After years of becoming almost apoplectic at the  very mention of Paul Conrad's name, I found myself in complete agreement with  his Nov. 4 cartoon depicting the California ballot as a lottery ticket.  </P> <P> If anything, the cartoon was too restrained. The ballot was worse than a  lottery ticket; it was the quintessence of idiocy.  </P> <P> CARL. G. RIEGE  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

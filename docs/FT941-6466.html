			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Cash carries the day in enlargement talks: How extra EU money broke the logjam The European Union showed endearing consistency yesterday in the way it broke the logjam after five days of gruelling talks on entry terms for Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway. True to past form, when faced with a choice between the four candidates' problems about money and their difficulties over principle, the EU headed straight for the money. At midday yesterday, following the near collapse of the talks around dawn, the Swedes settled for a substantial extra financial consideration which gives them, and to a lesser extent the other applicants, a rebate on their EU budgetary contributions in the first three years of membership. All told, the rich newcomers will get Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.7bn) in 1995-98 to cushion the instant alignment of their higher farm prices with EU levels, which the Union insisted on. Not until the end of this period, therefore, will they contribute the net Ecu1.7bn to the EU budget foreseen before this last round of talks - a figure itself less than half original estimates. The Swedes, in fact, face no wrenching adjustment of their agriculture regime, since their farm prices are similar to the EU's. What they won was a budget rebate disguised as a farm adjustment payment (worth up to Ecu2bn in the first three years) and in the tradition of the contentious UK rebate won 10 years ago by Mrs Margaret Thatcher. 'Sometimes it pays to be stubborn,' remarked a Swedish negotiator with quiet satisfaction. The Swedes had been accused of being boneheadedly stubborn over their budget contributions, not only by the EU but by their Nordic neighbours. But they clearly knew whom they were dealing with. By settling with the Swedes on money, the Union hopes it has 'front-loaded a bandwagon', as one EU negotiator put it, on which the other three applicants yesterday sought to clamber. By early yesterday evening Finland settled, too, for a deal that looked as though it had declared the entire country an Arctic region eligible for special agriculture support. During the night the Union had all but conceded, but carefully camouflaged this in a way politically and culturally unacceptable to the very straightforward Finns. 'There is a little bit of mist in it and they don't like that,' acknowledged Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch European affairs minister. Austria came next following an agreement over its demand for restrictions on EU trucks transiting its Alpine passes. The bandwagon effect was such that even Norway, the most obdurate candidate, whose ministers left the talks at dawn expecting to try again with EU foreign ministers next Monday, returned to the negotiations. Not every EU member state was delighted by the fiscally-induced breakthrough. The Spanish, French and Dutch thought the applicants were being alowed to get away with highway robbery. They and others criticised the current Greek president of the EU Council, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, for running a bazaar, and Germany for behaving more like the applicants' lawyer than an EU member. But as the chaotic talks headed for the rocks early this morning, Mr Pangalos refused to admit defeat, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, appeared like a deus ex machina with an extra Ecu750m to provide more incentives for the applicants, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, seized control of the negotiations. 'Germany played a very crucial role,' a senior Swedish negotiator acknowledged. For instance, the Germans worked hard to satisfy the Finns by ridding their agriculture text of the normal Euro-ambiguities which so appal the literal-minded Nordics, while keeping it - just - within Euro-rules. In a rather bolder move, Germany locked up Norwegian and Spanish negotiators to argue about fish, presumably hoping to endorse the views of whoever came out alive. Spain wants 14,000 tonnes of cod or equivalent from Norway's richly endowed and carefully husbanded waters. Oslo, as one Spanish negotiator put it, is sticking to its 'NASF (not a single fish) formula. They won't give an inch.' There was, last night, undeniable momentum at last behind the EU's drive to embrace the new candidates and begin the drive for a 'wider Europe'. The risk remained, however, that Norway would continue to play hard-to-get in view of the EU's obvious eagerness to it in. 'Both sides consider the other side as the demandeur, a Dutch diplomat remarked as the talks started at the weekend.</p>

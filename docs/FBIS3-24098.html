			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "A Decisive Stage of GATT </F> Negotiations. Russia's Path to GATT Does Not Promise To Be  Brief"]    [Text] Thursday evening after another round of GATT  negotiations, the delegation from the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations returned from Brussels. They had managed to  coordinate the model for integration into this system, that is,  clarify the details of the complex procedure that Russia will  have to go through. One might say that Moscow stands on the  threshold of the GATT. The head of the delegation, Minister of  Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, reflects on the subject  of whether or not Russia will manage to cross this  threshold.    In Mr. Davydov's opinion, in order to gain equal  opportunities and rights in the markets of the world, Russia  must conclude two agreements in the near future--with GATT and  the EC. Membership in GATT will make it possible to avoid  sanctions (which today are applied against Moscow without any  discussion) in a civilized way, that is, at the level of the  GATT Council. Without even having joined GATT yet, Russia is  already making plans for membership in another organization--the  World Trade Association (WTA). This product of the Uruguay round  of GATT, in addition to purely trade issues, will concentrate on  problems of investment policy, intellectual property, and  services. The WTA charter has not been written yet. But, in Mr.  Davydov's words, it is already clear that if Russia enters GATT,  it will be easier for her to join the WTA as well. After all  participants in the agreement familiarize themselves with the  statement of Russia's intention to join their ranks, Moscow must  within six weeks provide responses to all questions they have  (which should be addressed to Russia within a month) and then,  in the event that disputes or trade conflicts arise, all  problems are to be regulated on a bilateral basis. Only after  this, and if she is supported by two-thirds of the votes of the  Council, will Russia be considered to be accepted into GATT.  Incidentally, in Mr. Davydov's words, it took the well-suited  Switzerland six years to do this, while the less stable Mexico  and Venezuela required only a year. And China entered GATT in  1983.    Additionally, the fact that Russia's trade legislation does  not correspond to international trade legislation is an obstacle  to her joining the agreement. Russian import tariffs are a "bone  of contention." In the words of the chief of the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations, the ministry has particularly spoken  out against raising tariffs for foodstuffs. And the West is  dissatisfied with the fact that the current import tariff in  Russia is three to four times higher than the European one. In  order to coordinate all the issues related to this, a  tariff-customs council has been formed in Russia. Although, as  the minister especially emphasized, nobody except the consumers  and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, "which  completely understands the need for free competition within  Russia and advises in favor of entering GATT," is interested in  reducing the import tariffs.    [Begin boxed item]  <H5>  COMMENTARY </H5>   A red carpet is not likely to be spread out on Russia's path  to GATT. All one need do is look at the course of the  negotiations with this organization's leaders--from promises to  complete this procedure by the end of 1993 to the postponement  of the deadlines until the end of this year. Incidentally, this  date too will probably be moved into the unforeseeable future:  The regulation of disputes with the EC Commission (for example,  regarding uranium and aluminum) is proceeding with a fair amount  of difficulty. And one can hardly count on Russia's getting  around these tough spots during the course of the GATT  procedures, for example, the bilateral talks with France and the  United States--the main ones wrangling over these questions. A  great deal will depend on whether the Commission of European  Communities abandons its positions, which have already been  coordinated with Russia, relative to the need for mutual  observance of GATT principles, which they think nothing of  violating even in the EC.

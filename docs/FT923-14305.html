			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Lilley greets pension ruling THE government yesterday won valuable time to reorganise the provision of social security benefits when the European Court decided against calling for an immediate change to the British system under which men are required to pay contributions for a longer period than women. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the ruling was 'good news' and would allow the UK to get on with its task of reorganising social-security provision to eliminate variations between men's and women's benefits. The Department of Social Security is considering several options to equalise the age at which men and women may retire. Present rules allow women to retire on a full state pension at 60 after 39 years of contributions, while men must wait until 65 and pay 44 years of contributions to receive the same benefits. Mr Paul Greenwood of Mercer Fraser, consulting actuaries, said that had the judgment gone against the UK, the government could have been forced to spend billions to end differential contributions and make retrospective payments to men going back to 1984. In its ruling yesterday, the court said European Community legislation intended 'to maintain temporarily the advantages accorded to women with respect to retirement' to allow member states to modify their pension systems progressively. Only four European states have so far fully equalised benefits for men and women and one, Germany, has yet to equalise contributions. Of those that plan equalisation, most are considering a retirement age of 65 but Ireland plans on 66 and Denmark 67. The case was brought by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which argued that UK social security rules on contributions are discriminatory.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / US West finds cable role in TWE deal THE announcement that US West, one of the seven US regional 'Baby Bells', will invest Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) in Time Warner Entertainment, part of Time Warner, the giant media and entertainment conglomerate, marks an important new step in the fast-evolving relationship between the US telecommunications and cable industries, writes Nikki Tait in New York. To date, that relationship has largely been confrontational - a battle over who will bring communications into US homes over the next decade, with complex regulatory restrictions muddying a simple competitive fight. Now, it seems, co-operation may be the order of the day. 'This knocks the regulatory paradigm into a cocked hat,' remarked Richard McCormick, US West's chairman. At a financial level, the deal is complex. Essentially, US West will put up Dollars 1.5bn when the deal closes, hopefully later this year. The remaining money will be supplied over four years. This will give US West a 25.51 per cent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, which covers the parent's filmed entertainment, programming and cable interests. Time Warner will continue to own 63.27 per cent of TWE, and have operating control of much of the division. Remaining equity will be spilt between Itochu (previously C. Itoh) and Toshiba, existing partners in TWE. But the relationship between Time Warner and US West is expected to run deeper. Out of US West's total investment, Dollars 1bn will be devoted to developing Time Warner's planned 'full-service network'. This is the ambitious interactive cable-based home entertainment and communications network, which the company detailed in January. According to Time Warner yesterday, capital expenditure on cable is currently about Dollars 400m a year. Between 1994 and 1998, it is expected to average about Dollars 800m annually - and most of this will go on developing the full-services network. US West's Dollars 1bn will be welcome. The other Dollars 4bn, according to Time Warner, will come from internally generated cash-flows. The full-service network venture will be run jointly and involve both groups' employees. 'US West brings intimate knowledge of network switching (which) permits efficient tracking and billing of the myriad transactions that will cross the network,' said Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman. Other Time Warner executives noted US West's experience in selling to the business community. And US West can boast direct experience of working alongside a cable company: it has already linked up with TCI, the nation's largest cable operator, to provide telephone and cable services in the UK.

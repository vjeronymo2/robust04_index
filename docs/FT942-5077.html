			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Beijing must play by rules - Kantor Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday warned China it must play by world trade rules and said the Europeans and Americans were united over Beijing's bid to join the international economic community, Reuter reports from Paris. 'If the Chinese are going to continue to grow, trade and become an international player, they are going to have to play by the rules. The US is adamant about that,' Mr Kantor said on his way to Paris for the annual meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Mr Kantor said China must change its trade practices before it could join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which takes over next year from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The European Union increasingly shared the US stance, he added. Some US officials have proposed privately that China should be kept out of the WTO for the entire first term of the Clinton presidency because of its poor human rights record. 'But that's not a policy,' Mr Kantor said. 'It's just a guess. We're totally open to them meeting these requirements as soon as possible and we have said that publicly and privately.' On the issue of a partial trade deal with Japan, Mr Kantor said it would be 'immature' to reject such an option. Mr Kantor, who had previously insisted on an all-or-nothing trans-Pacific trade package, said he would now accept a scaled-back version when the two nations' leaders' meet in July. 'You want to make progress where you can. This is a long- term situation and you won't resolve all the problems overnight,' he said. The two sides want to strike a broad new deal that cuts Japan's Dollars 131bn (Pounds 87bn) trade surplus and boosts foreign access to three key sectors: cars, insurance and public procurement.</p>

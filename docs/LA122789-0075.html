			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY;  </P> <P> PANAMANIAN NORMALCY IS NOT THE SAME;  </P> <P> LIFE IN CAPITAL: THE PRESENCE OF U.S. TROOPS IS PERVASIVE. PEDESTRIANS ARE  RANDOMLY STOPPED AND SEARCHED.  </P> <P> Streets filled with cars and people returned to work Tuesday for the first time  since U.S. troops invaded six days ago and life appeared to be returning to  normal -- but it was a different form of normalcy.  </P> <P> It is a normalcy of counting the days of former dictator Manuel A. Noriega's  bunkered existence inside the walled Vatican embassy, where he sought sanctuary  Sunday as diplomats in Washington and Rome negotiate whether he will be turned  over to the United States or given political asylum.  </P> <P> The new normalcy also is evident in the pervasive presence of U.S. soldiers in  nearly all aspects of life.  </P> <P> Soldiers in full combat gear, faces painted in unearthly green and their  helmets covered with ragged strips of old fatigues, randomly stopped and  searched pedestrians, frequently at gunpoint.  </P> <P> Ambulances, their emergency lights flashing and sirens sounding as they rushed  patients to hospitals, are forced to a halt by U.S. troops demanding  identification and searching inside the vehicles because of reports that  Noriega loyalists are disguising themselves as victims of illness.  </P> <P> Normalcy Tuesday included an American patrol walking through the intersection  of Via Argentina and Via Espana, perhaps the city's busiest crossroads, at the  height of the morning rush hour firing several rounds into the air without  warning.  </P> <P> There was an unreal quality to the seemingly high volume of traffic in the  city. Employees turned up in offices and stores to find windows shattered by  vandals and shops emptied by looters.  </P> <P> Although a few workers were busy nailing plywood panels to empty window and  door frames and others swept debris into the streets, most employees either  were sent home or stood in front of shattered storefronts, bewildered and  speculating about who was going to fix things.  </P> <P> As is often the case here, the assumed answer was the United States.  </P> <P> A woman who owns a folk art store said in an interview, "It's wonderful that  the United States drove out Noriega. Now, do you think the United States will  give me the money to fix my store?"  </P> <P> Even as the American military intervention continued, the new government tried  Tuesday to assume the role of a normal regime. First, it swore in the new,  12-member national Cabinet. However, it would not disclose the names of the  officials because of "security reasons."  </P> <P> Then it was announced that the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew initially imposed by the  Americans was changed to 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and applied only to vehicles. Also,  the first of the country's new police force were ordered into place at some  government ministries.  </P> <P> Still, the curfew still will be enforced by U.S. soldiers and the most  important ministry, housing the presidential offices, will be guarded by  Americans.  </P> <P> When an American army patrol showed up Tuesday to check out reports that a  pro-Noriega gunman was hiding inside, the two Panamanian officers stationed in  front of the building took one look at the heavily armed American troops and  scuttled quickly into the shadows of a nearby doorway.  </P> <P> "I don't want them to see me," Sgt. Julio Caranza said. "If they want to take  over this building, it's OK with me. It's their country for now."  </P></p>

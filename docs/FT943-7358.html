			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Mandela plea on Lesotho Lesotho's king must reinstate the democratically elected government he ousted last week, South African President Nelson Mandela said yesterday, Reuter reports from Cape Town. King Letsie III's representatives failed to make their case to Mr Mandela and other African leaders gathered at a summit in Gaborone, Botswana. After returning from Botswana, Mr Mandela said King Letsie and Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhele would attend a meeting in South Africa tomorrow. 'We feel the government of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhele must be reinstated and it is on this basis that we are going to have a discussion with both parties,' Mr Mandela said. Last week, Mr Mandela and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe appeared to rule out military intervention in Lesotho. King Letsie was also facing mounting pressure at home. Lesotho businesses observed the second day of a general strike to protest against the government's dissolution. Shops were closed and school children stayed away from classes.</p>

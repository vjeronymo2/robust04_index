			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: CMI hit by weak steel market A SLOWDOWN in world stainless steel production and weak prices caused Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the world's second largest ferrochrome producer, to record a small loss in the six months to the end of December. CMI, a member of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, made an attributable loss of R180,000 (Dollars 64,000). This was a considerable improvement over the R14.7m loss the group made in the same period in 1990. Turnover rose by 41 per cent to R143.7m and operating profit improved to R10.4m from a R5.1m loss previously. Interest payments were down, following a R102m rights issue last year, but payment of a R4.3m preference dividend drove the company into loss. Mr David Kovarsky, chairman, said the results were worse than expected because volumes had been down and the group had hoped for a higher price. He added, however, that the group was happy to be keeping its head above water, given the difficult state of the ferrochrome market. Mr Allan Kuhnert, marketing director, said world stainless steel production had dropped 6.6 per cent in the second half of 1991 compared with 1990 levels. For the year as a whole, however, he estimated world production for 1991 as being virtually constant at 10.66m tonnes. He anticipated continued weakness of demand in all the key markets during the first half of 1992. With about 80 per cent of ferrochrome consumed in the stainless steel industry, the market was weak. Mr Kuhnert estimated that world ferrochrome production was currently running at an annual rate of about 2.6m to 2.7m tonnes, compared with capacity of 3.4m tonnes. CMI is producing at 60 per cent of its capacity of 330,000 tonnes a year. Mr Kovarsky said the reporting period had been 'very eventful', notably for the merger between Samancor and Middelburg Steel and Alloys, the world's two largest producers, and because South Africa had increased the price from 49 cents to 52 cents a pound in December. No interim dividend was declared.</p>

Katia Rodriguez now will inform us about this phone  call.    [Begin recording] Katia Rodriguez:  Edgar Fernandez said he met DEA agents in Bogota, Colombia, but  that he managed to dodge the U.S. agents in Costa Rica. This is  the report:    Reporter Amalia Pando: [identified by screen  caption] Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who worked for Isaac  Chavarria, phoned the PAT [Television Journalists Association]  to tell us he is not in the DEA's hands. But when Carlos Mesa  asked him where he was, he said he would rather remain  underground. When he was asked how he paid for his trips and  these costly phone calls, he broke down in tears.    Fernandez: I am so desperate that I am begging for  justice in my country and the support of my university mates,  the media, and all those who believe I am not lying.    Pando: We have confirmed that the person who  phoned was in fact Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, Chavarria's  employee. Let us hear this person's voice in the recording  heard by the Constituent Commission:    Fernandez: Help me don Oscar; I have no money.  You cannot screw me after all I have witnessed, such as when  you received 40,000.....    Pando: Now let us hear the voice of the person who  phoned PAT:    Fernandez: My name is Edgar Fernandez Lazcano,  identity card and passport No. 3365571, both issued in La Paz.    Pando: There is no doubt that the voice belongs to  the same person. Moreover, he correctly answered personal  questions such as when he obtained his identity card or what  address he gave at the immigration office when he applied for a  passport. Therefore, we are certain that the person who phoned  PAT was, in fact, Edgar Fernandez Lazcano.    We told him we wanted to know how he left Bolivia and  entered  Costa Rica because there is evidence that Fernandez Lazcano was  abducted by the DEA.    Fernandez: I will tell you how I left Bolivia when  I am given guarantees to return to Bolivia. I will tell you  what towns I went through, what means of transportation I used,  all of it public transportation. I was never in contact with  the DEA. The first time I got in contact with the DEA was when  I arrived in Bogota.    Pando: As you see, all the details of how he left  Bolivia are uncertain. He told us later he ended up in Bogota,  Colombia, but to enter Colombia you need an entry visa, which  can be requested at any consulate. PAT confirmed that Fernandez  Lazcano had not acquired that visa. He never appeared at the  Colombian consulate in La Paz, Lima, nor in Quito. How then did  he enter Colombia without a visa. One thing Fernandez Lazcano  does admit is that the DEA took him to Costa Rica.    Fernandez: When we arrived in Bogota, I talked to  DEA agents. I concretely told them: The only thing I demand is  that you help me reach the United States, and once I am there I  will disclose everything. I admit having gone to Bogota.  Initially they told me we would go to Panama and I said, well,  that I would speak in Panama. At first they said: No. Speak  now; tell us all you know now; tell us what they say. I  answered: No, I am not going to speak here; I am going to do so  in another country. At my insistence--because I said the United  States or nothing--they first said we would go to Panama because  the plane was too small to fly from Bogota to the United States.  So, first we will go to Panama. When we were about to land in  Panama, because I thought we were heading for Panama--I do not  know why because the people who picked me up spoke English and  understood, two of them especially, very little Spanish, I  wondered whether we were in Panama but it turned out we were in  Costa Rica.    Pando: Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's version sounds  even more incredible when he says that he managed to dodge the  DEA in Costa Rica.    Fernandez: As you said, in Costa Rica I dodged the  DEA, because I was surprised only three people interviewed me  given the importance of the U.S. Embassy. I decided to follow  my plan. I was arrested in Costa Rica because I decided to wait  a few days and not go to Nicaragua as I planned in the belief  that the DEA would be after me in Costa Rica.    Pando: According to Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, after  getting away from the DEA he was detained, by chance, for 27  hours by Costa Rican police. After he was released, a Bolivian  prosecutor arrived to interrogate him.    Mesa: Didn't you try to get in contact with the  DEA or did the DEA seek you after you were released in Costa  Rica, and were you able to move freely and leave Costa Rica  without any problems?    Fernandez: This is what surprised me and made me  really happy because when I was arrested the first thing I  thought was: The Bolivian DEA [as heard] is quite capable of  sending a fax or something and messing up my life because I have  dodged them. But I got very happy when I realized they were not  aware...    Pando: Despite what Isaac Chavarria's employee  asserts, the Costa Rican Government has its own version. It  said Fernandez Lazcano left Costa Rica in a DEA aircraft to  Miami. It is quite likely that Edgar Fernandez Lazcano may have  made fun of the DEA but it is quite unlikely he will make fun of  all of us.    Fernandez: Regarding my job with Isaac Chavarria,  I was a close aide of his. I do not know what he considered me,  probably his dog's keeper, an employee with no rank; I do not  know. But, unfortunately, during the several years I worked for  him I learned about a lot of things.    Pando: Edgar Fernandez Lazcano's conversation with  Carlos Mesa lasted 45 minutes. During it he ratified all he  told the Bolivian prosecutor in Costa Rica and a lot more.  Among the new things he said was that Jaime Paz Zamora's  government had offered Isaac Chavarria the possibility of  benefiting from the repentance law.    Fernandez: Before the 120-day deadline the  government granted the drug traffickers to surrender, Susana  Seleme went--I do not have concrete evidence about this but I  was told that the captain was upset by the two visits Susana  Seleme paid him on weekends to suggest that he surrender, that  he benefit from the repentance law.    Mesa: Who told you that?    Fernandez: The captain's wife told me that. You  can ask her. I am sure she will not lie; I know she is aware of  my true situation.    Pando: So far we have all heard that Chavarria  gave Paz Zamora money, but according to this new version Jaime  Paz Zamora gave Chavarria $40,000.    Fernandez: I maintain that Edith [Paz Zamora's  sister] went to Santa Cruz, to Los Troncos town, where she met  Chavarria. She asked Chavarria to help her find some good land  to buy for Jaime Paz's sons. Taking advantage of this occasion,  Edith said: Oso [Chavarria's nickname], Jaime has sent you this  $40,000.    Mesa: In other words, Jaime Paz gave Chavarria  $40,000.    Fernandez: That is precisely what happened.    Pando: To that end, Fernandez Lazcano said he  wants to return to Bolivia to speak, to disclose all he knows,  but said he fears he will be arrested. He refused to say where  he is now. Anyway, we all know he is in Miami, to be more  precise, in the DEA offices. And we say this based on the report  issued by the Costa Rican Government to the media. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas shares slide over C-17 SHARES in McDonnell Douglas, the financially stretched US aerospace group, plunged Dollars 5 5/8 to close at Dollars 47 1/8 yesterday - a fall of more than 10 per cent - as Wall Street worries mounted over the fate of its problem-plagued C-17 military aircraft. The C-17 development programme is running more than a year behind schedule and substantially over budget on the company's Dollars 6.6bn fixed price contract. The share price drop came in response to news of fresh production problems on the aircraft and a call this week by the House of Representatives' Armed Services committee for a 30 per cent cut in next year's funding for the programme and a block on the C-17 going into full production. Congressional ire was also increased by allegations from the Pentagon's inspector general that the Air Force had connived in 1990 to provide secret financial assistance to McDonnell Douglas by improperly rushing through acceptance of the first completed C-17 when it was only 80 per cent finished. McDonnell Douglas has repeatedly denied asking for or receiving any bail-out money.</p>

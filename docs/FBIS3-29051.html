North Korean businessmen have lost interest in contacting  their South Korean partners this year and instead are turning to  American or Japanese firms to pursue joint-venture projects, the  official said.    The change in their position is understood to be in  connection with the dismissal of reform-minded Kim Tal-hyon as a  vice premier and chairman of State Planning Commission and the  mounting tension over the nuclear issue, the official said.    South and North Korean businessmen have continued their  contacts in Beijing even when the nuclear problem became an  international issue, he said, but the North is making no efforts  this year.    Pyongyang is also very cold on allowing South Korean  companies taking part in its infrastructure projects and instead  is seeking partnership with U.S. or Japanese firms, he said.    Kim of North Korea reportedly met with Samsung,  Lucky-Goldstar, Daewoo leaders in December 1992 and asked for  their participation in Pyongyang's economic development projects.</p>

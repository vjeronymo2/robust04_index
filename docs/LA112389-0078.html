			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LYNWOOD SEEKING WAYS TO CURB EMISSIONS AT RESIN PLANT  </P> <P> Under pressure from neighbors to shut down a chemical manufacturing plant and  its incinerator, City Council members Tuesday declared a 45-day moratorium on  construction of similar facilities in the city.  </P> <P> Council members concluded that they lack the authority to close the  controversial Cargill operation. But they asked city staff members to look into  ways that the city can regulate the plant and incinerator at 2800 Lynwood Road.  </P> <P> The plant manufactures resins that are used in plastic and paint products. A  small incinerator at the site burns hazardous waste.  </P> <P> Residents have been concerned about odors from the plant and the release of  possibly harmful materials from the incinerator.  </P> <P> "The plant should be (moved), or it should be shut down," resident Everson Hill  told the council, adding that the odors are making neighbors "miserable."  </P> <P> Council members told residents that officials are seeking methods to control  such plants.  </P> <P> "We are aware of the citizens' concerns," Councilman E. L. Morris said, "but  since we can't close or kick Cargill out, we should work with Cargill to  eliminate the odors for the benefit of the community."  </P> <P> Councilman Robert Henning said that even though the city has received no  proposals for similar plants, the moratorium is designed to provide officials  time to develop stricter regulations for future plants. There are no provisions  in the city ordinance regulating hazardous waste plants, but the city staff has  been asked to prepare possible regulations for discussion at the council's Dec.  5 meeting.  </P> <P> Henning also said the city Fire Department should consider monitoring emissions  from the Cargill plant. And Councilman Paul Richards asked the city attorney to  determine whether the state Department of Health Services erred in issuing a  hazardous-waste permit to the plant without first requiring an environmental  impact report from the company.  </P> <P> Richards said he believes the health officials should have ordered such a  report before issuing the permit Nov. 7.  </P> <P> Ella Woods, an organizer of Lynwood Families Against Toxic Waste, said the  group is pleased by the council's efforts but still prefers that the plant be  moved.  </P> <P> "We are real happy with the stand they took," she said. "But the only answer it  to move them out.  </P> <P> "We're going to stay on them. We are not going to let them sweep this under the  rug."  </P> <P> Doug Graff, the general manager of Cargill, described the council action as  political.  </P> <P> He said the company has been willing to do what it can to clean up the air.  "Who can be against clean air?" he asked.  </P> <P> Plant superintendent Michael Dobeck told the council that Cargill had spent  more than $3 million to reduce emissions and improve the environment.  </P> <P> Dobeck said the incinerator, which has operated at the plant since 1980, has  actually reduced the odors.  </P> <P> Vapor control vents have also been installed to help reduce odors, he added.  </P> <P> Dobeck said the company had spent at least $400,000 in the last year to perform  emission tests to see whether the incinerator complies with state and federal  standards.  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency last month denied the company a permit to  operate the incinerator because it failed to meet federal emissions standards  during a test in October, 1988. But the incinerator passed a recent test and  may receive a permit as soon as the results are analyzed, according to an EPA  spokesman.  </P> <P> The company is allowed to continue operating the incinerator while it appeals.  </P> <P> EPA officials have said they do not think that the plant endangers people's  health.  </P> <P> However, state officials have asked Cargill to submit a plan by Dec. 8 for  controlling the plant's odors. State officials believe the odors are caused by  the materials used in the chemical process to create the resins.  </P></p>

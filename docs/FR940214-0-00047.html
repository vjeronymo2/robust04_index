			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) There have been no deviations from the FmHA approved plans and specifications;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The transferee will not be composed of any principals of the transferor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The transfer will be in the best interest of the FmHA and prospective tenants;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The applicant/entity and all members thereof whose obligations are transferred will not be considered eligible for further participation in the RRH program for at least 5 years from the date of the transfer of the FmHA loan obligation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Prior approval is obtained from the National Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interim financing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the amount of the loan exceeds $50,000, the applicant may obtain interim financing from commercial or public sources for the construction period if it can be obtained at reasonable interest rates, fees, and terms, and in the best financial interests of the Government. Interim financing will be obtained to preclude the necessity for multiple advances of FmHA funds. The interim lender must be authorized to operate in the State in which the project will be located and must have an established record of providing financing to entities other than FmHA-financed projects. Since the interim lender is responsible for inspecting construction along with FmHA, the borrowing entity (including any of its identity of interest entities) cannot provide interim financing to its own project. Interim financing will be used subject to the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (viii) Because interest rates can fluctuate between the time construction estimates are finalized and completion of construction, any excess funds remaining from interim financing will be returned on the FmHA loan. Also, interim funds remaining because of early completion of construction will be returned. The leftover interest may be used for certain other eligible loan purposes critical to the completion of the project which were unknown to the applicant and contractor at the time the loan was approved, provided prior National Office concurrence is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1944.236 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. Section 1944.236 is amended in paragraph (c)(3) by revising the reference ``&sect;1944.215 (d)'' to read ``&sect;1944.215 (c).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. Section 1944.237 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c)(2) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1944.237  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A subsequent loan is made to an applicant/borrower to complete, improve, repair, and/or make modifications to the project initially financed by FmHA, or for equity and/or other purposes when authorized by the provisions of subpart E of part 1965 of this chapter to avert prepayment. A subsequent loan to develop additional units must be rated and ranked in accordance with the priority point system contained in &sect;1944.231 of this subpart. Other subsequent loan requests do not have to compete for funding under the priority point system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the initial investment and 2 percent O and M amounts are sufficient to cover only the initial FmHA loan, the applicant/borrower must provide the additional respective amounts to cover the subsequent loan. The 2 percent O and M amounts must be in the form of cash as described in &sect;1944.211 (a)(6) of this subpart. The required amount of the initial investment is described in &sect;1944.213 (b) of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Declaration signed by President Leonid Kravchuk and </F> Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev on 20 January in Kiev]    [Text] On Friday 21 January, Ukraine's media circulated the  following declaration issued jointly by presidents Kravchuk of  Ukraine and Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan: Modern World, Challenges  and Threats:    The 20th Century is drawing to a close, mankind is preparing  to enter a new epoch of its development. History has  accelerated its pace, making mankind both a participant in and  an eyewitness to global -- in terms of their consequences- -  changes in the world structure. The world has become  increasingly more open and interdependent.    The epoch of the two systems and military-political blocs'  great confrontation has fallen into oblivion. The global  community of nations has been joined on par by many peoples who  have established their new independent states. Concurrently  positive changes on the European and Asian continents have been  accompanied by emerging new challenges and dangers: interethnic  conflicts, which are becoming sharper; emergence of security  vacuum zones; attempts to destabilize the newly independent  nations from outside and setting the spheres of influence are  among them. All these demand urgent and adequate measures and  decisions.    While adhering to the principles of the world community and  global security's indivisibility Ukraine and Kazakhstan believe  that threats to any country's national security pose a danger  for general security and peace the world over. The world's  politics should be guided by axiomatic principles of one's own  security through security of all and domestic stability  contributing to global stability. Concerns which exist in the  field of national security of a number of states may be  eliminated only by way of estimating an inter-regional universal  security system, extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok and  including all the nations without exception. Such international  organizations and institutions as the UN, CSCE, NATO, the North  Atlantic Alliance Council and others play an important role in  this process.    The concept of Partnership for Peace, which was endorsed by  NATO member nations' heads of state, has great potential. Its  realization will allow to expand the framework of stability  peace and trust among nations. The past decade's major event  was the establishment of new independent states on the former  Soviet Union's territory. Wishing to construct new civilized  relations among them based on sovereign equality, parity, good  neighbourliness, noninterference and mutual respect are nations  who have behind them a common long and thorny historical road  decided to set up their commonwealth to assist each other in  overcoming the hard consequences of the totalitarian epoch and  retain their good and mutually beneficial relations which really  promote and consolidate friendship among our peoples.    The Commonwealth of Independent States has existed for over  two years now. Its evolution has been difficult and  controversial, with intermittent instability and crisis periods  sometimes aggravating into sharp conflict situations. Yet the  two years of the CIS existence may be referred to, with all the  due responsibility, as having summarized the fact that global  cataclysms and (?societal) turmoil on the former USSR's  territory were avoided, which had been forecast by some  politicians. The process of the new nations accedance to the  world community was accelerated and foundations laid for  consolidation of our major priceless gain, that independence and  the right to dispose of one's own destiny.    Ukraine and Kazakhstan are both multiethnic entities intent  on constructing their open democratic societies who base their  development on retention and consolidation of interethnic and  social peace and accord. We are aware of the tremendous  significance of keeping civic and interethnic stability in our  nations and other CIS member states and declare our full  determination to further continue this course.    In view of this deep concerns have been generated by certain  trends which have surfaced in the international situation both  within the CIS as a whole and in some of its individual member  nations. We have no right to shut our eyes to the fact that of  late irresponsible forces have been active which are calling for  the totalitarian regime's reanimation igniting interethnic  strife, xenophobia, chauvinism, nationalism, and propagating  destructive ideas which contradict the UN Charter and the CSCE  principles.    These alien to civilized international relations phenomena  have recently been condemned by foreign ministers of the CSCE  member nations and the CIS heads of state. We declare with full  responsibility that any support for aggressive national  patriotism, imperial chauvinism, national exclusiveness, and  intolerance which are being propagated by certain extremist  political circles may result in destructive consequences of  global dimensions. We draw the attention of all sober minded  politicians, CIS peoples, the entire world community to the need  of joining efforts in a bid to prevent further dissemination of  ideas based upon propagation of fascism, calls to imperial  expansionism and attempts at their realization which pose a  threat not only to the new independent nations but to the entire  world.    Ukraine and Kazakhstan, who have voluntarily chosen a road  to  getting rid of the most devastating and lethal weapons in human  history, nuclear weapons, can not but feel deep concern over  their security, which they do not think as possible outside the  context of universal international security. We appeal to all  interested nations and governments, democratic forces, and the  world public to double their efforts directed toward  construction of a safer and more stable world based on  cooperation, mutual assistance, and deep mutual respect among  nations.    Ukraine and Kazakhstan, acting jointly or parallelly [as  heard] will strive for creation of an atmosphere of mutual  understanding and trust, will engage in mutual beneficial trade  and economic cooperation, and will make their weighty  contributions to consolidation of regional and global security  and stability.    The text of the declaration issued jointly by President  Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Nursultan Nazarbayev of  Kazakhstan.</p>

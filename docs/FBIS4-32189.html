			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Arsenic] </F>   [Text] "We would be immediately in favor of having  the Serbs in Croatia given as many rights as the Albanians have  in Kosovo," Tudjman says, stating that Milosevic made a  statement along those lines in the Greek KATIMERINI.    Zagreb, 28 May--Just before Croatian Statehood Day (30 May,  when the Assembly was constituted in 1990 after the first  postwar multiparty elections), Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  spoke with the chief editors of the Croatian media, and long  extracts from this were published in today's newspapers.    On that occasion Tudjman mostly repeated his already  well-known ideas about events in the last three years--about  "the Yugocommunist army's offensive to overthrow the Croatian  authorities, and not just to conquer Croatian areas as a  whole"--but some of his statements in connection with solving  the Serbian question in Croatia are interesting, in view of the  topicality of the subject.    Stating that "a trip to Belgrade by our foreign minister had  been agreed upon, but our condition for that was that it could  take place when the route to Belgrade was normalized, i.e.,  through Okucani and by telephone," Tudjman, among other things,  said the following:    "The world does not accept that the Serbs in Croatia have  the  right to self-determination, which they and their politicians  and intellectuals are citing. The Serbs are a minority in  Croatia, we have guaranteed them all the rights of an ethnic  community, and we are even willing to give them territorial  self-government in districts, the two districts where they had a  majority even before the war, cultural autonomy within Croatia  as a whole...."    Saying that "They (the Serbs) are still spreading all sorts  of deceptions about the emergence of the NDH [Independent State  of Croatia]," Tudjman said that Croatia was willing "for the  exercise of those rights to be under the supervision of the  international community."    "In discussions of the Serbian question in Croatia, people  are still bringing up the NDH, with those awful figures that at  least 600,000 to 700,000 Serbs were killed in Jasenovac alone.  But the total number of people who died in all of Yugoslavia  during World War II was not that high," Tudjman also claimed,  commenting that "back in the 1950's, i.e., in Belgrade, I  rebelled against those lies." He claimed that "600,000 people  did not die in all of Yugoslavia during World War II, counting  all the partisan, chetnik, ustashe, Home Guard losses, with all  the Jasenovac, Bleiburg losses, and so forth," but that instead  "The war losses were 597,000."    "Back when I wrote `Wilderness' ["Wilderness of Historical  Reality"], I did not have that fact. Go to the public, and give  them those facts in all the newspapers, in order to destroy that  rumor and deception, because that is the basis for the alleged  justification for the Serbian demands, fear, deception, and so  forth," Tudjman commented, and so it turns out that what the  ustashe did to the Serbs is not any sort of reason for fear,  even though it is a fact that their goal and intention was the  biological extermination of the Serbian people from the  territory of the Quisling NDH.    In connection with possible trips to try to solve the  Serbian  question in Croatia, Tudjman continued by saying this:    "In contrast to the Martic-Mikelic tension and irrational  behavior, there is a statement by Milosevic in the Athens  KATIMERINI, where he said regarding a solution that the problem  of the Serbs in Croatia should be solved in the same way as the  problem of the Albanians in Kosovo. That is the most positive  thing that has been publicly stated to date. Of course we would  be immediately in favor of having the Serbs in Croatia given as  many rights as the Albanians have in Kosovo."</p>

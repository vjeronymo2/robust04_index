(Granite State) tendered for filing with the Commission the original and revised tariff sheets listed below in its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, containing changes in rates and other tariff provisions for effectiveness on July 1, 1994: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Third Revised Sheet No. 20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Original Sheet No. 35 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Original Sheet Nos. 36&hyph;99 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to Granite State, its filing is a limited Section 4 filing to direct bill its former bundled sales customers, Bay State Gas Company (Bay State) and Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities) for unreimbursed transportation charges paid to upstream pipeline transporters prior to the effectiveness of its restructured operations on November 1, 1993. Granite State further states that, prior to restructuring, it had assembled a system supply of natural gas to provide its sales services which included purchases of Canadian gas from Boundary Gas, Inc. (Boundary Gas) and Shell Canada, Limited, (Shell). It is further stated that Granite State purchased these supplies at the U.S.-Canadian border and arranged for transportation services on upstream transporters for the delivery of these supplies to its market area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Granite State it was authorized to pass through the upstream transportation charges in a Transportation Cost Adjustment added to its sales rates during the period prior to the commencement of its restructured operations. The Transportation Cost Adjustment was approved by the Commission in Boundary Gas, Inc., et al., 26 FERC &para;61,114 (1984) and initially reflected only the transportation charges incurred under Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's Rate Schedule CGT&hyph;NE for the transportation of Granite State's Boundary Gas purchases to its market area. Later, according to Granite State, the transportation charges incurred for the delivery of its Shell purchases over the combined facilities of Iroquois Gas Transmission System (Rate Schedule RTS&hyph;1), Tennessee (Rate Schedule NET&hyph;NE) and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Rate Schedule AFT&hyph;2) were included in the derivation of the Transportation Cost Adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Granite State, the Transportation Cost Adjustment was essentially a tracking mechanism; however, revisions in the Adjustment often lagged changes in the upstream transporters rates. Granite State further states that it has made a complete review of the transportation charges incurred under the upstream pipelines transportation rate schedules compared with the reimbursement through the Transportation Cost Adjustment for the period from July, 1989, through October 31, 1993. According to Granite State, during this period it incurred $505,080 of unreimbursed demand and commodity transportation charges which it proposes to direct bill to Bay State and Northern Utilities, as shown on Original Sheet No. 35 in the instant filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Granite State further states that Third Revised Sheet No. 20, an Index, and Original Sheet Nos. 36&hyph;99, Reserved Sheets, are included for the editorial revisions in the tariff necessitated by the addition of Original Sheet No. 35. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Granite State, copies of its filing were served upon its customers, Bay State and Northern Utilities, and the regulatory commissions of the States of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (37): Surface is scratched - Rural reform India's latest economic reform programme has barely scratched the surface of the country's agricultural sector. While the government earlier this year announced a far-reaching liberalisation of agricultural exports, it has done very little to modernise the vast domestic markets and has, by and large, fought shy of liberalising a sector of the economy which is riddled with controls and regulations. Consequently, the economic reform programme has by- passed a significant proportion of the population. About 80 per cent of Indians live in rural areas, and 67 per cent of the people work in agriculture. About a third of domestic production comes from agriculture. Reform-minded economists believe that there is an urgent need for change in the agricultural sector to improve productivity, largely by eliminating restrictive regulations so that farmers can realise the full potential of their land and efforts. But they are opposed by powerful vested interests including wealthy farmers who manipulate the current regime and the many officials who administer the panoply of agricultural regulations. With its history of terrible famines, post-independence India has placed enormous importance on the need for self-sufficiency in foodgrains, and has chosen in the past to restrain food exports in order to keep down food prices and build up food reserves. The Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s helped India to achieve its goal of self-sufficiency. The use of fertilisers, pesticides, high-yielding crops, farm mechanisation and better irrigation methods led to an increase in farming output. The index of agricultural production, quoted by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) in its Economic Intelligence Service, has risen almost three-fold since 1949-50. Agricultural production accelerated during the 1980s, and total foodgrains production rose from 129.6m tonnes in 1980-81 to 176.4m tonnes in 1990-91, according to government figures. The increase in production during the 1980s stems largely from a significant rise in yields: for foodgrains, the yield rose from 1,023 kgs/hectare in 1980-81 to 1,380 kgs/hectare in 1990-91, according to government statistics. Today, market-oriented economists question the self-sufficiency policy, arguing that it makes more sense for India to liberalise imports and purchase those food items that are available at a lower real cost on the world market instead of attempting to meet all of its requirements domestically. The central government sets the procurement price (which is the floor price) for wheat and rice, as well as having a wide range of controls on various other agricultural products. It uses a combination of subsidies and price controls both to support producers and to benefit consumers. Farmers benefit from subsidies for fertilisers, equipment such as tractors, and irrigation. Furthermore, in many parts of India farmers pay next to nothing for their electricity. This is used for pump irrigation, allowing some parts of the country to have two harvests a year - one in the monsoon season, and one in the dry season. The system of subsidies - in particular those for fertilisers - acts as a significant drain on government resources at a time when India needs to cut back on expenditure. Fertiliser subsidies have grown to become the largest central government budgetary subsidy, amounting to about 1 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. The government can ill afford to continue supporting the farmers in this manner. At the same time, some of the agricultural methods which were encouraged in the past due to subsidies, may not be sustainable: some parts of India suffer from over-irrigation and damage to the soil. This is taking place at a time when India's population is growing, and the burden on the farmers is increasing. The radical solution for the government would be to get rid of the costly subsidies and open up the sector to market forces, with the option of reallocating some of the savings to investment in the agriculture sector, for example to stimulate agro-industries. However, such a move would be socially disruptive and almost impossible politically. Instead, the government has embarked on a more gradual process of reducing subsidies. The government made a tentative effort to reduce the fertiliser subsidy, with the result that prices for certain fertilisers have risen by around 50 per cent since last year. It is also restructuring the power sector, which should lead to fewer distortions in the price of electricity. Given that India is coming close to the limits of extensive cultivation, it will have to employ other means of increasing productivity, for example by diversifying into higher added value crops and agro-industries, and by adopting more efficient irrigation methods. Mr Balram Jakhar, the agriculture minister, recognises the need to encourage diversification in the agricultural sector and the development of agro-industries. The government points out in its draft agriculture policy resolution that 'value addition in agriculture can only be achieved by a concerted thrust being made in increasing processing, marketing and storage facilities. These are imperative for the development of agro-processing industries which are the key areas for development in agriculture.' With the establishment of processing units in the rural areas, farmers would be able to increase the value of their agricultural produce and could see additional benefits such as the creation of new jobs. The problem for the processing industries - for example, makers of tomato paste or fruit canners - would be how best to ensure standard and reliable supplies in sufficient quantities. In many parts of the country, individual farmers work on relatively small plots of land, and, as a result of various land reforms, there are ceilings on the amount of land which can be held by individuals. These reforms were intended to prevent the accumulation of large landholdings by individuals, although in some parts of India, for example the northern state of Bihar, land ceilings are largely ignored by the powerful landlords. Mr Balram Jakhar is keen to promote closer co-operation between individual farmers living in the same area so that they can work more economically on the land, for example by clubbing together to operate more advanced irrigation systems. 'I want to encourage joint enterprise between small groups of farmers,' he said. While India's agricultural production has increased threefold in the last four decades - which is a considerable achievement - there is still more that can be done to help encourage the growth of the agricultural sector and improve the living standards of India's large and in many areas impoverished farming population.  ------------------------------------------------------ VALUE OF MAIN AGRICULTURE EXPORTS (RS BN)  ------------------------------------------------------ PRODUCT                               1991     1992/93  ------------------------------------------------------ Rice                                  7.55        9.72 Oil meals                             8.71       15.39 Marine products                      13.74       17.43 Fruit, vegetables, processed foods    4.51        4.99 Meat and products                     2.44        2.57 Others                               25.01       22.98 TOTAL                                60.68       73.08  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Ministry of Agriculture  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

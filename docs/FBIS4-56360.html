			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mirta Rodriguez Calderon] </F>   [Text] Every time the people sit down to eat, an explicit  or implicit thought goes to the UBPC [Basic Cooperative  Production Unit] and the rest of the rural producers.    The combined expectations placed upon this type of  production, which assimilates the experience of the Anapistas  [members of ANAP: National Association of Small Farmers] imply  the risk of added frustrations (as in the recent case of the  food program) if the people are not fully aware that it will  take time--and not just days or even months--before a serious  dent is made in the frugality of our meals because of the UBPC's.    One cannot lose sight of the fact that our cooperative  workers have inherited an agricultural picture with marked  shortages of fuel, fertilizer, herbicide, tools, and shoes, a  costly economic program involving machinery, pumping, and  irrigation systems (in addition to dams, minidams, and canals),  combined with an inefficient system of collection worsened by a  lack of containers and a partially inoperative transport pool.    The UBPC members as a whole can decide whether or not to  acquire this equipment that places such a burden on their  economy (which is what is happening in some places, where they  have rejected the FREGAT irrigation machinery, for example, and  some of the tractors, harvesters, and cane combines). Replacing  these resources implies efficiency, but also a return to manual  labor, just as we have had to go back to oxen. This means that  our aspirations for a high-yield agriculture will have to be  postponed for who knows how long.    It may be worthwhile to note that more than a few experts  maintain that this should never have been the model chosen for  Cuba, any more than the gigantic scale of certain factories and  enterprises.    Forced as we are to deal with the situation at hand for the  time being, what strikes us are the events connected with the  establishment and first steps of the UBPC's, which promise to  provide us with a better supply of products from the land and  within a reasonable period of time.    Obviously, what is happening in the fields is closely  connected with our very survival.    This experience of cooperativizing the work, means, and  production, based on national ownership of the land and  macroresources (highways and dams), with the state as the sole  buyer, does entail unknown factors of interest to everyone,  particularly specialists in agricultural transformations.    In other words, it is not only the politicians, economists,  government officials, and farmers themselves who are impressed  with the need to continually evaluate the progress of the  process. Veteran academicians are also sharpening their arsenal  of scientific tools in order not to lose ground or their footing.    Such is the case of the Rural Studies Team of the Department  of Sociology of the University of La Habana, headed by Dr.  Niurka Perez Rojas and made up of Dr. Cary Torres Diaz and  Miriam Garcia Aguilar. Supported by a group of students, the  three women have been examining the startup of the UBPC's in our  country and conducted field studies in the municipalities of  Santo Domingo in Villa Clara and Guines in La Habana.    In addition to a solid volume of first-hand information, the  researchers have evaluated the motivations and individual  features of the labor force making up the UBPC's.    For Professor Perez Rojas, "state-owned agriculture had  demonstrated inefficiency in terms of stimulating farm workers,  but also with respect to yield and the organization of work.  Previous studies done by our team had already demonstrated that  the farm worker's household had a lower level of monetary income  than did cooperative members and individual farmers."    "The UBPC members are starting from a very difficult  situation of a state-owned economy that is generally  unprofitable," Niurka emphasized. "It is an economy in deep  crisis. This explains why its essential motivation and prime  priority is to obtain food for the family via accelerated  development of crops in areas of local consumption and livestock  modules."    "The second expectation identified by our research is the  possibility of obtaining more monetary income. Although this was  not articulated, we realized during our interviews that the  workers also hope to obtain surpluses in time. Being able to  participate in management and major decisions ranging from the  election of boards of directors to anything having to do with  autonomy is the third motivating factor.    "Respecting and promoting that autonomy seems to me to be  extremely important. I was quite concerned when I heard a leader  in Granma Province tell the members of one UBPC that what was  important was production rather than earnings. He was saying so  because that particular UBPC wanted to cut its staff and operate  with fewer workers than the state enterprise. In my opinion, the  bottom line of any cooperative is the distribution of profits.  Without it, there can be no profitability or efficiency. I think  it is indispensable to respect the fact that it is in fact  stipulated that they have the power to decide."    Another aspiration expressed by UBPC members is the  possibility of building homes. The researchers believe that this  motivation ranked fourth because it reveals the understanding of  the current shortage of resources.  <H5>  Man and His Work </H5>   For those seeking conceptual explanations of the phenomena  of  reality, the behavior of work forces within the UBPC has  singular features.    "The first distinctive trait of the permanent UBPC work  force  is its duality," says Professor Cary Torres. She explains: "As  long as they use the land and are the owners of the means and  results of production, they are in fact owners, which gives them  the right to participate in earnings and decisionmaking.  However, they are at the same time an effective labor force.  They are the workers and leaders within the productive process.  This duality makes them different from salaried workers, both in  terms of their relationship to the means of production as well  as their social production."    Another important element in the researchers' analysis has  to  do with the distinction between "the permanent work force and  the hired work force, resulting from their different positions  with respect to the means of production. This lends an element  of subordination to the hired work force compared with the  permanent work force, Torres Vila said, because the former do  not have the advantage of participating in decisionmaking or  local consumption, housing possibilities when scheduled and  built, or other benefits.    The analysis begun by the Rural Study Team of the School of  Philosophy and History will also ponder the labor-related  reaction of cooperative workers (the name given to UBPC  members). "It is a known fact that when they were state  agricultural workers," the professors say, "they did not work a  full eight hours. There was absenteeism and productivity was  very low. Placed in different conditions providing them with a  real feeling of belonging, material incentives, and  participation in decisionmaking, the same individuals have begun  to react. We have observed that the same workers who performed  for three or four hours are now doing so for eight or more. We  also see encouraging signs of improved productivity. If this  trend continues, the hired labor force and particularly the  number of mobilized [sic] workers will be minimal."  <H5>  Many Watching Us </H5>   Like everything else happening to us now, at a time when so  many people around the globe want to see us succeed and others  are predicting the end of our dreams, the implementation of this  type of agricultural organization is viewed with interest by  scholars in other parts of the world.    The research being done by the Rural Study Team, which has  just celebrated its tenth anniversary and which was the most  outstanding collective from the School of Philosophy and History  both last year and in 1992, is part of an international project  on Agrarian Transformations in Socialist Countries sponsored by  the MacCarthur [sic] Foundation in the United States.    The academicians heading up the study in Cuba are American  economist Carmen Diana Deere, professor at the University of  Massachusetts, and Cubans Niurka Perez Rojas and Ernel Gonzalez,  who heads the University of La Habana's Department of Sociology.  In an article to be published in the coming issue of the British  Cambridge University's JOURNAL OF PEASANTS STUDIES, the three  scholars maintain, among other things, that:    "Given the conditions of the special period, when nearly all  types of food and other consumer goods are once again rationed,  other incentives are needed in addition to linking pay to  productivity in order to achieve a greater work effort and  stabilize the size of the farm work force. With the considerable  cut in the quantity and frequency with which many food  products--including eggs, barnyard poultry, milk, and cooking  oil are distributed--the sale of food to workers and the quality  and diversity of the meals served in farm cafeterias have turned  into incentives as important as wages paid in money.    "While it is still too soon to evaluate this dramatic  reorganization of the Cuban state-owned farm sector," say the  authors of the research report soon to appear in the British  periodical, "it became clear in the interviews conducted that it  has generated considerable optimism among workers as well as  administrators, particularly in terms of the recovery of sugar  cane production. UBPC members report that they certainly feel  like `owners' and are working longer days with greater  intensity. They are taking better care, not only of the land,  but also of their machinery and implements."  <H5>  Beyond Desires </H5>   It is certainly premature to make any further evaluations of  the UBPC's and their future. In addition to positive desires, it  is praiseworthy that the CPA's [Agricultural-Livestock  Cooperatives] should transfer their experience and that the ANAP  should help prevent the exodus of the UBPC skilled work force,  as they are now doing.    It is also to be hoped that the UBPC's that grow a variety  of  crops will beware of the evils of disproportion that afflicted  state agriculture: far too much cabbage and too few beans, large  quantities of turnips and eggplant and too little rice.  Political factors having to do with prices and plans that take  the people rather than figures into consideration must also play  a role.    Now that the people have scanned the horizon of the most  noteworthy positive and negative factors, hope prevails. And  time must be allowed to do its work.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Major claims growing support for safe havens - Kurdish refugees MR John Major, the prime minister, yesterday claimed growing international support for his proposal that safe havens should be established within Iraq for the Kurdish refugees fleeing from the forces of President Saddam Hussein. His statement was followed by the announcement late last night that Britain would join the US and France in sending troops into northern Iraq to support the international effort to aid the Kurds. British officials indicated that the effort - designed to provide stable bases in Iraq for the Kurdish relief effort - represented a considerable vindication of the effort first pressed by Mr Major on the European Community last week. The announcement came after telephone conversation between Mr Major and US President George Bush and Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations secretary-general. Describing the safe havens proposal as the 'only way forward', Mr Major told the House of Commons that the idea was 'rapidly gaining ground'. Loyalists on the Conservative backbenches competed with each other to praise Mr Major's initiative, but he was criticised from the opposition benches for not pressing more vigorously for the arraignment of Saddam Hussein for genocide against the Kurds. A renewed charge of 'ditherer' was levelled against the Mr Major from the opposition benches when, pressed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to pursue the genocide issue as a matter of urgency, he said he was awaiting legal advice. The prime minister's apparent hesitancy over charging Saddam Hussein with genocide reflects the belief in government circles that it would probably prove to be a fruitless exercise. Ensuring speedy and effective assistance for the refugees is seen as the over-riding priority. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, insisted in the Commons exchanges that the UN already had authority to prevent the continuing genocide against the Kurds. He called on Mr Major to explain why he still seemed reluctant to remedy the absence of 'political will and international leadership'. Mr Major emphasised that his safe havens proposal continued to dominate the international stage and was under 'intensive discussion'.</p>

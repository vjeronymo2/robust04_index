This caused tension within the Senate.    Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the unofficial  [Senate] office, promises to return to the attack via the law,  with a view to taking back control of the Senate Office. The  following is a report by Daly Valet:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Firmin Jean-Louis,  president of the normalized Senate-- who was in Washington --  has returned to Haiti. However, he did not return to the country  just to stand by and and watch Bernard Sansaricq's unofficial  Senate Office do it all.    Jean-Louis and Sen. Julio Larosiliere went into action very  early on 7 March. They took back their offices, which were  occupied by Bernard Sansaricq's team.    President Jean-Louis and Quaestor Larosiliere said, however,  that they are not there to engage in confrontations; rather,  they are there for reconciliation. This is why Sen. Larosiliere  has proferred the olive branch to Sen. Sansaricq. Larosiliere  also asked the parliamentarians elected in the 18 January  elections to respect the New York pact, which they signed and  which provided for them to refrain from attending Senate  sessions while waiting for a solution to be found by the  arbitration committee provided for in the Constitution. [passage  omitted]    Jean-Louis and Larosiliere were not content with taking back  control of the Senate. They have already announced that the  Senate will meet in normal session on 8 March to work on the  parliamentary plan for resolving the crisis. This plan has  already passed the Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, in the unofficial Senate Office, everybody is  very  angry. Sen. Sansaricq stated he would take back the presidency  of the Senate using any and all means. For his part, Osny  Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office, has affirmed that  Firmin Jean-Louis will be unable to hold sessions at the Senate.    [Unidentified journalist] Senator Sansaricq, since we see  that Firmin Jean-Louis is there, will you go to your office this  morning [7 March]?    [Sansaricq] I will take it back by any and all means. I have  no further comments to make. Whether I take it back in 24 or in  48 hours, we will restore the order we had established. You can  write that down.    [Journalist] What strategy will you use: confrontation,  force?    [Sansaricq] [Response indistinct]    [Journalist] Senator, are you ready to talk with the members  of the other Office? Are you ready to engage in dialog or will  you use force?    [Sansaricq] No comment.    [Journalist] So, you are ready for dialogue?    [Sansaricq] No comment.    [Journalist] [Words indistinct] compromise, Mr. President  [of  the Senate]?    [Sansaricq] No, no. No comment.    [Journalist] But, will you be in your office on 8 March?    [Sansaricq] No comment. I will be in my office. No comment.    [Journalist] Will you be conducting the session on 8 March?    [Sansaricq] We will use any means we must, but we will be in  the office.    [Journalist] [Words indistinct] legal force, Senator?    [Sansaricq] Exactly. [passage omitted]    [Valet] Firmin Jean-Louis and Julio Larosiliere have taken  back their offices at the Senate. Bernard Sansaricq and Osny  Eugene are angry. Senators Serge Joseph and Romel Manigat, for  their part, have gun and rifle in hand. The Senate of the  Republic has become a stage. This is Daly Valet for Signal FM.  [end recording]</p>

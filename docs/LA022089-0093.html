			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CYCLE OF CRIME;  </P> <P> OVER 20 YEARS, TIMES HAVE CHANGED, AS HAVE YOUNGSTERS, OFFENSES, THE LEGAL  SYSTEM ANDTHE YOUTH GUIDANCE CENTER.  </P> <P> Joe is 16, a gang member and drug abuser, and in the last 3 years he has never  been out of juvenile detention more than 2 months at a time.  </P> <P> Last week he sat in a cramped counselor's office at the Youth Guidance Center,  where he is doing his fourth stint, this time for violating probation. Away  from the inquiring eyes of his blue-clad fellow inmates, he was reflective  about his troubled young life.  </P> <P> "I do good for a little while but then I start hanging with my buddies and the  same things happen again," said Joe, which is not his real name. "Even if I'm  in my own neighborhood, hanging around with my cousin or my brothers, I can get  busted cause they're all involved in gangs. I'm not supposed to be around them,  but it's not like I can go to another part of town."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anniversary Celebrated  </P> <P> Hundreds of youths like Joe walk the streets of Orange County these days,  caught in a cycle of drugs, gangs and crime. First-time offenders, probation  violators and youngsters who have committed more serious crimes and have done  their time in Juvenile Hall are sentenced to the Youth Guidance Center, known  as the YGC -- four isolated cinder block buildings nestled between the river  and Interstate 5 in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> It was 20 years ago this month that the the center first opened its doors to  the county's troubled youth. At a ceremony recently marking the anniversary,  counselors and probation officials agreed that as the times have changed, so  have the youngsters, the crimes, the legal system -- and the role of the YGC.  </P> <P> "The kids are more criminally sophisticated now," said Mike Schumacher, the  county's chief probation officer. "They seem to be more violence-prone and more  drug-prone. It has created a more callous group of young people."  </P> <P> The youngsters of 1969, however, were a different breed. They lived in the age  of Aquarius, psychedelic music and distrust of authority. Most committed to the  center were fairly innocent -- runaways and truants -- who may have dabbled  with mind-altering drugs or were just too tough for their parents to handle,  Schumacher said.  </P> <P> The YGC was established by the Orange County Probation Department as an open  facility -- a back door in each detention unit is always left open -- aimed at  rehabilitating them with education and counseling programs.  </P> <P> The law then permitted runaways, truants and any youth deemed incorrigible to  be incarcerated, Schumacher said. There were far more girls than boys, since  most runaways were girls, and they were kept there 6 months to a year, then  released whenever it was determined that they had been rehabilitated.  </P> <P> Originally, there were no fences around the grounds and the newly arrived wards  felt no compulsion to stick around, he said. Eventually a fence was erected,  not to keep the inmates in but to keep out vagrants who had lived on the site  for years and still loitered near the dumpsters.  </P> <P> Schumacher remembers that in those days officials would strictly enforce state  hair regulations. Boy's locks could be no more than 2 inches long.  </P> <P> "The flower children hated that," he said. "We'd often lose a couple before the  weekly Thursday night visit from the barber."  </P> <P> While the task of the YGC has remained the same over the years, it has been  made more difficult because of changes in the system -- changes that YGC  officials say render many of their programs less effective.  </P> <P> The key factor was the passage in 1977 of a law requiring determinant  sentencing for juvenile offenders. Fixed sentences meant that juvenile  authorities no longer had as much leeway in deciding when a ward should be  released. Sentences at the YGC now average 33 days.  </P> <P> And public attitudes about the merits of rehabilitation have shifted.  </P> <P> Society now wants foremost to punish juvenile lawbreakers, and at the least get  them off the streets, according to criminologists and others involved in the  juvenile justice system.  </P> <P> "What we are seeing is the pendulum of public opinion," said Bruce V. Malloy,  administrator of the Juvenile Justice Commission, a court-appointed group that  oversees juvenile facilities in the county. "Over a decade or so it has swung  from a heavy emphasis on treatment to a heavy emphasis on punishment. The  system has to respond to that."  </P> <P> According to county probation researchers, the proportion of first-time  offenders committed to a county youth facility rose from 19% in 1982 to 36% in  1987. And the number probably increased to the 40% to 50% range during 1988,  said Gwen Kurz, director of research for the Probation Department.  </P> <P> "We're locking up kids much more," said Kurz. "But because of that, we may be  taking away from the limited resources that we have for follow-up (treatment).  The benefits are questionable."  </P> <P> YGC Director Richard Duckworth agrees: "We spend a lot of our time just  processing kids in and out.  </P> <P> "We have nearly a 100% turnover every month. Our job is to try to identify  problems as quickly as possible and try to coordinate follow-up treatment."  </P> <P> Experts say the growing seriousness of crimes committed by children and young  adults hardens society's attitudes about whether rehabilitation works.  </P> <P> Most of the teen-agers sent to the YGC are first- or second-time offenders, but  their crimes include just about everything short of murder: armed robbery,  assault, prostitution, gang activity, sales and use of drugs.  </P> <P> Many youngsters are also far more emotionally disturbed than those of 2 decades  ago.  </P> <P> "They are more abused, more mentally disturbed; they have more severe  problems," said Juvenile Justice Commission member Ellen Wilcox.  </P> <P> Probation officials say that more than 75% of those who leave the YGC and the  county's two other juvenile facilities -- Joplin Youth Center in Trabuco Canyon  and Los Pinos Rehabilitation Camp in Lake Elsinore -- never return.  </P> <P> Most of these youngsters, they say, are scared straight by their first brushes  with the law.  </P> <P> But experts in the juvenile justice field say that these kinds of youth centers  generally do not have much success in rehabilitating the more troubled  youngsters.  </P> <P> "Not unless they are miracle workers," said Arnold Binder, a UC Irvine  psychology professor who has written extensively about juvenile delinquency.  </P> <P> "You just don't get a turnaround in behavior in 30 days. Even simple  psychiatric treatment for people who have fewer problems than these kids takes  years. That doesn't deny that some youngsters may benefit from the programs.  But we've become so disillusioned that we don't even pretend anymore that the  (prison) system has any rehabilitative effects," he said.  </P> <P> Kurz said many juvenile authorities now believe emphasis should be placed on  identifying problem youths and intervening at an early stage.  </P> <P> "We can identify 95% of these problem kids the first time they are referred to  us and the rest by the second time we see them," Kurz said. "We need to focus  our attention on the intake process. I feel strongly that we can work with  these kids in the community rather than extend their sentences and have them  come back and back."  </P> <P> Despite problems in the system, officials still believe the YGC and its  programs can work.  </P> <P> The youngsters are assigned to one of five units, or pods, each of which houses  25. Within each unit, several bedrooms are grouped around a common meeting  area. One of the units is co-ed -- older girls are grouped with younger boys.  </P> <P> Despite the institution-gray carpets and smudged pink walls, the units are more  like large dorms than a prison and each has a television and video cassette  recorder, among other diversions.  </P> <P> The units also have their own mascot (dogs are popular, but there are fish,  too) as well as color-coded uniforms (yellow, brown, red, blue and green, worn  in the universal kid attire of T-shirts, sweat shirts and blue jeans.)  </P> <P> While the YGC is considered an open facility, the youngsters are monitored at  all times and their days are rigorously regulated.  </P> <P> On occasion, one of the county wards will walk away, but most have learned that  it is easier to get the time over with.  </P> <P> Wards spend about 6 hours each day in classes at the Rio Contigua School,  located on the grounds. Each unit has a deputy probation counselor who conducts  a weekly group session. Counselors also meet regularly with individual wards.  </P> <P> In addition, there are alcohol and drug abuse counseling, image awareness and  decision-making sessions, and parenting and human sexuality counseling.  </P> <P> The wards also receive work assignments in the laundry and kitchen, but also  might be assigned to prune the orange and peach trees on the spacious grounds.  </P> <P> Officials say there must be a much higher public awareness of the benefits of  programs aimed at rehabilitating youthful offenders. Because of the constraints  placed on the system, the availability of those programs will have to depend  more and more on the contributions from private groups and businesses.  </P> <P> Said Wilcox: "We are going to have to depend on private sector funding, that is  the only hope."  </P> <P> But, she added: "Juvenile delinquents are a hard sell when it comes to fund  raising. The kid who stole a car and stabbed somebody doesn't really get a lot  of identification from others."  </P> <P> Ultimately, not all of those who need help will be reached.  </P> <P> "We have to be realistic," said Malloy. "We can't save everybody and help those  who don't want to be helped. But we can try to identify those kids who will  benefit the most and take a personal interest in them. We can look for what  they are good at and what they can be a success at. The Probation Department  can be a rather human part of a cold system."  </P> <P> For Joe, the center has meant a respite from the more restrictive confines of  Juvenile Hall and the violence of the streets. But he is still uncertain of his  future.  </P> <P> "There is more freedom here than in the (Juvenile) hall and being here helps me  to stay clean," he said. "But it's like a vacation. I'm getting my strength  back for when I get back to reality outside."  </P></p>

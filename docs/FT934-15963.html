			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Orix has visions of credit in China AFTER four decades of being judged for their political worthiness, Chinese will now be assessed for their creditworthiness under a consumer finance joint venture launched yesterday by Orix, the Japanese leasing company. The Shanghai-based venture, claimed to be China's first consumer credit company, will introduce consumers to instalment payments, which have generally applied only to housing purchase schemes and Communist Party members. 'We will be judging Chinese consumers in the same way that we judge the creditworthiness of Japanese consumers. We are aiming at a managerial class, people who can afford consumer durables,' Orix said yesterday. 'There hasn't really been a system of giving credit ratings to people in China, so this an historic thing.' Credit has been slow to be accepted in China, which first created its own plastic, the Great Wall debit card, seven years ago and has done business in awkwardly large wads of renminbi or people's money, the Chinese currency. Shanghai Yintong Trust, which opens next month, is a joint venture between Orix and three Chinese partners: the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Shanghai Number One Department Store, and Shanghai Friendship Overseas Chinese Company. Orix and the bank each hold 41.67 per cent of Yin-Xin Credit, as the company is known in short, while the other two Shanghai partners share the remaining ownership. Yin-Xin has a registered capital of Dollars 2.1m and an initial contract life of 20 years. The Japanese company has a long-term vision of Chinese customers borrowing from Orix-linked loan shops and carrying a pocketful of credit cards, if the Chinese government approves. The credit will be provided through state-owned and foreign-backed stores and the sales agents of the Japanese consumer electronics companies.</p>

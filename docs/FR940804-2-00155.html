			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As currently proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE between the inside spread on Nasdaq, a subsequent limit order on the opposite side of the market priced at the same or a superior price to the limit price of the pending limit order ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a sell limit order priced at or below a limit order to buy) will be matched against that pending limit order. If the incoming limit order is unpreferenced, all market makers at the inside quotation will have a 15-second opportunity to execute the incoming limit order. If the incoming limit order is preferenced, only the preferenced market maker will have a 15-second opportunity to execute the incoming limit order. If no market maker elects to execute the incoming limit order, the system would automatically execute the pending limit order against the incoming limit order. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if the inside bid and offer were 20_201/2, and two limit orders were entered to buy and sell at 201/4, the system would allow the orders to match against each other within 15 seconds. In addition, if two limit orders crossed each other in between the inside spread ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , a buy order priced at 203/8 and a sell order priced at 201/8), the orders would be matched after 15 seconds and the price averaged between the orders (each would receive 201/4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment will change the execution methodology for matched limit orders by eliminating the 15 second window for the display of the incoming limit order prior to execution and permitting an immediate match of offsetting limit orders received by NPROVE. By providing retail customers a greater opportunity to receive immediate and automatic executions of their limit orders priced between the spread, the NASD believes the proposal will enhance NPROVE's price improvement capabilities and limit order protection features. Moreover, to the extent the NPROVE has received two priced orders from retail customers that match or cross each other inside the spread, the NASD believes no market benefit would be served by delaying the execution of this transaction. Indeed, the NASD believes the amendment is in furtherance of Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(v) of the Act, which provides that investors' orders should be executed without the intervention of a dealer to the maximum extent possible consistent with the achievement of other critical market structure objectives, such as the economically efficient execution of securities transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed execution algorithm for matching incoming market orders against limit orders priced better than the inside market will remain the same. Specifically, as proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE at a price between the spread, the next incoming market order on the opposite side of the market (e.g., the limit order is to sell stock and the market order is to buy stock) would automatically ``pass over'' or read the limit order file to see if there are any orders residing in the limit order file at prices superior to the best bid or offer in the Nasdaq marketplace. If a limit order resides on the file at a superior price, then the market order will be flashed on the screen at that superior price for acceptance within a brief 15-second period, instead of at the inside bid or offer, as the case may be. In that event, all market makers at the inside quotation would have the opportunity for 15 seconds to execute the market order at the superior limit price. If no market maker elected to execute the order at that improved price, the system would execute the orders against each other at the limit price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD notes that both the limit order and the market order are better off with this execution process_customers placing market orders receive price improvement and customers placing limit orders will be assured that NPROVE executions will not occur at prices inferior to their limit order prices. Accordingly, the NASD believes this execution process for a market orders is wholly consistent with the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A key consideration for retaining NPROVE's flash display and automated execution feature for market orders is the need to maintain the liquidity and depth of The Nasdaq Stock Market. One of the cornerstones of the success of Nasdaq's competing dealer system has been the availability of market maker capital to satisfy investors' liquidity demands. The extent to which market maker capital is available, in turn, is critically dependent on the ability of market makers to interact with customer order flow. Without the ability of market makers to trade with their customers' orders, orders presented to them by other members, or orders entered into Nasdaq execution systems, market-maker profitability will suffer and, as a result, market liquidity will diminish and investors will receive inferior executions of their orders. Accordingly, if market makers are denied any opportunity, however brief, to interact with incoming market orders entered into NPROVE, the NASD believes that liquidity on Nasdaq will inevitably be affected in an adverse manner to the detriment of investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD notes that an objective for a National Market System contained in Section 11A of the Act regarding the execution of investors' orders without the intervention of a dealer is premised upon, and necessarily incorporates the corresponding assurance that, such executions will be fully consistent with the economically efficient execution of such securities transactions. The NASD maintains that affording market makers an extremely narrow 15-second window of exposure within which they may view, evaluate, and respond to incoming market orders prior to the automated match of two investors' orders is appropriate in a competing dealer market environment. The ability of market makers to interact with customer order flow is essential to the long-term well-being of Nasdaq and the efficient execution of customer orders that results from vigorous competition among viable, aggressive Nasdaq market makers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, the NASD believes the proposal significantly enhances the price improvement and limit order protection features of NPROVE and eliminates the possibility that a pending limit order will remain unexecuted while other public customer orders receive executions at the order's limit price, while preserving the liquidity and orderliness of Nasdaq by allowing a minimal, yet essential, opportunity for market makers to interact with retail order flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Reset feature on John Lewis loan NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the UK merchant bank, is to arrange an innovative five-year loan facility for John Lewis, the UK retailing group. The structure - known as a 'flexible participation facility' - replaces an existing Pounds 150m loan signed in 1990 and gives both lenders and the borrower greater flexibility than a standard revolving credit. It allows the borrower to lock into market-priced finance at various times during the life of the loan through a so-called 'reset mechanism'  - a kind of auction which is managed by Rothschild, in its role as agent. The loan is split into a core facility of Pounds 35m - priced at 25 basis points over Libor with a commitment fee of 10 basis points - and two tranches of Pounds 45m. The terms of one of these tranches can be reset in mid-1996 and mid-1998; those of the other in mid-1997. Banks are being asked to participate with individual commitments of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m. Commitments for the core facility and both Pounds 45m tranches will be secured when the deal is signed in the next few weeks but banks can bid to increase their shares of the two Pounds 45m tranches, with the amounts allocated on the basis of price. If banks are prepared to bid more competitively to increase their stakes in the deal, the borrower can obtain a reduction in its cost of funds. It could also increase the size of the facility if bids are received for a greater aggregate amount. At the same time, however, the banks are obliged to provide finance at the maximum rate of 25 basis points over Libor. Mr Paul Tuckwell, director of NM Rothschild, said: 'The facility provides borrowers with certainty and flexibility of funding and pricing at a capped cost and banks with the opportunity to actively manage their balance sheets.'</p>

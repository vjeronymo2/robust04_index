			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Purchases help Baynes rise 48% Contributions from acquisitions helped Charles Baynes, the distribution and specialist engineering business, lift 1993 pre-tax profits by 48 per cent. The group, which spent Pounds 48m on purchases during the year dominated by Buck &amp; Hickman, the industrial tools distributor acquired for Pounds 33m last autumn, said contributions from these operations pushed profits up from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 8.2m. Sales advanced to Pounds 91.2m (Pounds 70.3m), including Pounds 27.2m from acquisitions. The comparative figure included Pounds 5.68m from discontinued activities. Continuing activities rose 41 per cent. Acquisitions provided Pounds 2.56m of operating profits of Pounds 7.9m (Pounds 4.1m). Profits from underlying businesses moved ahead 34 per cent to Pounds 5.4m, despite a 1 per cent fall in turnover. Earnings per share increased to 3.71p (2.8p), while a proposed final dividend of 1.075p (0.9p) takes the total to 1.65p (1.425p). Welcoming the figures, Mr John Perkins, finance director, said the group had defied flat markets in the UK and continental Europe and increased operating margins by embarking on a cost-cutting programme. Aerospace engineering suffered the brunt of the rationalisation as the workforce was cut by 25 per cent to 430 after six plants acquired from Cookson Group were merged on one site. 'The aerospace business remains poor and we do not envisage a substantial pick up before 1995,' according to Mr Perkins, who predicted further rationalisation in the valves and packaging sectors. He also hinted at fresh acquisitions, which would be financed from cash reserves or debt rather than new equity. COMMENT With net cash of Pounds 10.1m, Baynes is well-placed to pick off small engineering companies and has the support of its bankers to go for larger prey. Its ability to do so has been enhanced considerably by stripping out costs from existing businesses and making shrewd purchases at home and abroad. Impressed by its strategy, analysts have upgraded profit forecasts to Pounds 12.1m. Although the prospective multiple of 17.5 is ahead of the sector average, the shares are worth considering given the group's record for earnings enhancing deals.</p>

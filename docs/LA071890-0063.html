			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CASEY WILL SIT OUT FOOTBALL SEASON DUE TO SAT SCORE  </P> <P> Jerome Casey of Sylmar High, perhaps the Valley's finest all-around football  player last season, will not attend USC in the fall after failing to meet  Proposition 48 requirements concerning the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  </P> <P> Casey, a running back who also played middle linebacker and safety, accepted a  scholarship in February on the condition that he score at least 700 on the  test, the minimum required for athletic eligibility under Prop. 48.  </P> <P> "Of course it's frustrating," Casey said. "It's just a test and to put it all  on one test -- I don't think that's right. But those are the rules."  </P> <P> Casey said he was unsure about his next move pending a meeting, not yet  scheduled, with USC Coach Larry Smith. But it is likely that he will enroll in  a junior college in the fall and continue to take the SAT. He will not play  football in the fall.  </P> <P> Provided he passes the test, he likely will enroll at USC under a scholarship  that university officials indicated will be held for him. If all goes well,  Casey said, that could be as soon as the spring semester.  </P> <P> Casey's situation is reminiscent of that of Curtis Conway, a 1989 USC recruit  out of Hawthorne High who also sat out his freshman year after failing to score  the required 700 on the SAT. Conway attended junior college for a year and did  not play football before passing the test. He is enrolling at USC for the fall  semester as a sophomore.  </P> <P> Casey will lose a year of eligibility, but still plans on attending USC. Other  schools -- such as Washington State, Nebraska and Washington -- recruited  Casey, but the 5-foot-10, 180-pounder had his heart set on playing for the  Trojans.  </P> <P> "I always imagined myself running on the field at the Coliseum," he told The  Times in February. "I grew up loving SC."  </P> <P> As a senior, Casey, the East Valley League co-Player of the Year and a Times  All-Valley selection, rushed for 1,447 yards, caught 14 passes for 378 yards  and scored 26 touchdowns. He also led the team with 70 solo tackles.  </P> <P> Casey will play for the East in Friday night's Daily News All-Star Game at  Birmingham High.  </P></p>

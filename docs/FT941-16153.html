			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Reversal of economic reform angers lenders: Nigeria turns away from market economy The Nigerian military government's decision to abandon policies of market-based economic reform has caused consternation to foreign aid donors and international lending institutions. International economists say that the budget announced on Monday, which cuts interest rates and reimposes foreign exchange controls, is likely to lead to empty shelves in Lagos shops and to the emergence of a thriving black market in foreign currency. With interest rates cut to 12-15 per cent while inflation runs at 50-60 per cent, credit is likely to expand rapidly, fuelling further inflation. The low interest rates and fixed exchange rates are likely to prove popular among Nigerian manufacturers and importers who can get access to foreign currency, but could prove devastating to the country's economic growth prospects. Although officials from the International Monetary Fund are due to visit Lagos later this month for regular consultations, the chances that their talks might lead to any agreement on future lending, already faint, are now thought to have been extinguished by Monday's budget. The IMF's last agreement with Nigeria expired nearly two years ago, and the country has not been servicing its external debts since then, accumulating around Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.35bn) of arrears on Dollars 31bn of outstanding debts. Several foreign aid donors, including the US and the UK, imposed some symbolic sanctions on Nigeria last June following the annulment by the military regime of a presidential election which appeared to have been won by Mr Moshood Abiola. Since General Sani Abacha seized power in November, donors have been assessing stiffer aid cuts. Besides the reversal of economic reform policies, several countries are disturbed that the government seems to have dropped even the rhetoric of transparency and financial accountability, which was much discussed last year by the short-lived government of Mr Ernest Shonekan. International analysts view the Nigerian government's new economic programme as one of the most damaging setbacks so far to a general trend towards market economics in Africa, and link the reversal to General Abacha's seizure of power. 'General Abacha likes to command everything, including the economy. He thinks he can just order prices down, and everything will be normal,' said one European diplomat.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The flood peak has already passed through the Bei  Jiang, and the vast area surrounding the river is safe and  sound. This morning, the Bei Jiang Flood-Fighting Headquarters  arranged the work for the post-flood period. The following is a  report just sent back by this station's reporter on the Bei  Jiang front:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] This morning,  Guangdong Province's Bei Jiang Flood-Fighting Headquarters held  a series of meetings to arrange flood-fighting work after the  flood peak had passed. Commander in Chief Ou Guangyuan [also  vice governor] demanded that the leaders of various branches  maintain a high degree of alertness, prepare work well, and  guard against slacking off and becoming careless. He stressed  that dams often collapse not when the river is rising but when  it drops, and that each shift must be strengthened to detect  problems promptly. He said: It is unlikely that the flood will  pull down the main dam; it would be worse if we were slow to  discover a dangerous situation. He demanded that, before the  water drops to safe levels, there must be round-the-clock  patrols, no one must slack off, and flood-fighting materials  must be further supplied to various positions. Ou Guangyuan said  earnestly that the work has touched the hearts of the central  leaders, the provincial and city leaders, and the cadres and  people throughout the province. He added that, due to their  unique importance, we must ensure that the areas along the Bei  Jiang and Guangzhou City remain perfectly safe. This is a  report from Guangdong Radio's reporting team on the front of the  battle against the flood in the Bei Jiang. [end recording]    According to Guangdong Radio's reporting team on the Bei  Jiang front of the flood battle, the State Council's joint  relief work team arrived at the Bei Jiang this morning to give  instructions on fighting the flood and providing relief. The  work team spoke highly of the Guangdong people's high degree of  alertness against the flood and their skill in combating natural  disasters. It also pointed out that the flood peak had only  just passed through the Bei Jiang, that a difficult battle  remained to be fought, and that the water level was still high  and a high degree of alertness must be maintained to strive for  overall victory in the battle against the flood in the Bei  Jiang. The work team today arrived at (Shi Qiao), (Xia Lin  Zhou), and other dangerous areas to inspect the flood prevention  work. Its members said: Guangdong has done a great deal of  work in flood prevention and relief and has an admirable ability  to resist natural disasters. The leaders at various levels pay  attention to work and give sensible orders, and the people's  minds are at ease. From the party, the government, and the  military down to the ordinary people, everyone has pulled  together to fight the greatest flood in 50 years. Had it not  been a contingent with such a high degree of awareness about  fighting floods, such a great flood would have submerged many  areas. At present, the flood peak has just passed safely, and  this can be considered a victory. The water level is still  high, and the typhoon season will come in July and August;  therefore, Guangdong must maintain its high degree of awareness,  must not slack off or become careless, and must continue to  prepare materials for fighting floods, so as to achieve an  overall victory in relief work and in the fight against the  flood in the Bei Jiang.</p>

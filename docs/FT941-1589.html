			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Town Centre improves to Pounds 3.95m Town Centre Securities, the Leeds-based property investment and development company, yesterday revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.95m for the six months ended December 31 1993, compared with Pounds 3.65m. The interim dividend has been increased by 9 per cent to 1.2p, up from 1.1p. During the year the company bought the freeholds of two of its leasehold properties with the result that at the year end only Pounds 11m of its Pounds 193m property portfolio was long leasehold, compared with Pounds 64m previously. There will be a marginal impact on short-term earnings, as a result of the cost of the acquisitions, but the strategy will strengthen the company's balance sheet. During the interim period, gross rental income increased by 10.5 per cent from Pounds 8.91m to Pounds 9.84m, while interest charges increased marginally to Pounds 3.1m. Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, said that the company should 'show further steady improvement in the next six months'. Earnings per share amounted to 2.68p, up from 2.4p.</p>

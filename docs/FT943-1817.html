			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Cumbre Flamenca - Dance The Cumbre Flamenca troupe is back, and that news is probably all the inducement dance-lovers need to hasten to Rosebery Avenue. The evening is real, gutsy, life-enhancing. No one will claim that there is much variety about Flamenco: you watch it for the sake of bodies twisting, stamping; for flaring emotions; for arabesques of yowling and prodigies of rhythm from hands and feet. But at its best - and thus it is with Cumbre Flamenca - it is heady stuff. What I love especially is the sense in which the performers commune with themselves. On certain terms, Flamenco is introspective, the performers - be it singers, guitarists, dancers - dragging their art from their psyches. The three women, Juana Amaya, Mariquilla, Angela Granados, are wonderfully contrasted dancers, each a priestess of her own rite. Amaya comes on looking rather put out - you would hoist storm cones if wife, mother, beloved, appeared looking like this at breakfast, and duck behind the marmalade. She seems to sulk her way through the first moments, as singer and guitars urge her on. Then gradually, she is possessed by her daemon, and the movement becomes urgent, vicious in its accents, more elemental. Her art is laid bare for us - nuanced but fierce, uncompromising, stunning. At the end of her solo, hair everywhere, eyes staring, she seems drained of the wonderful identity the dance has given her. She is an extraordinary, fascinating artist. So, too, is Mariquilla, a darling of the last Cumbre visit. She hurries on stage fully charged, in 'Now I'll show you' mood, and proceeds to do so. She is, I must ungallantly observe, no longer in the first flush of girlhood, but her power and charm are the more tremendous because of that. She marks out the stage with a first sketch of pose and step: this is her domain. She broods over some movements. She has lit the blue touch-paper, and we had better watch out, the fireworks are about to begin. She smiles. She shouts. The dance takes hold: the wonderful drumming of her feet, the flash of her torso, her sated look as the movement builds up in speed and her audience responds to her - these are the marks of great flamenco art. She is generous, joyous, glorious. Very different is Angela Granados, whose dancing springs from the cobra-coils of her dress's train - yards of amber ruffles - and is framed by her white shawl. It is sensuous, splendidly mannered, iconic. Her movement is luscious, her style alluring, but it is also hieratic, reduced to a fascinating essence. Where Juana Amaya and Mariquilla seem driven by the dance, Granados is always, and beautifully, its mistress. The two men, Juan Fernandez (who is new to us) and Cristobal Reyes, are no less well contrasted. Fernandez is an elegant, stylish artist, at his most compelling when confronting or partnering another dancer. Reyes is a rhythmic virtuoso, and is phenomenal in a dialogue with the handclaps of Pedro Montoya, where the rattle and purr of his feet embroider and respond to rhythms stated by Montoya - it is a bravura display from both men. The staging remains absolutely simple. The musicians and singers are very fine - and Jose Luis Monton is superb in a guitar fantasia. The dancers offer the true raw spirit of flamenco - and as with any slug of raw spirit, you knock it back and enjoy the intoxicating kick. At Sadler's Wells until October 8.</p>

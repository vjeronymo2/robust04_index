			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Drug profits may face curb Curbs on drug companies' profits were envisaged by Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, during a fringe meeting. She said a joint team from the ministries of trade and industry and health would produce a policy document aimed at preventing the NHS being 'ripped off'. Attacking the existing voluntary scheme for regulating prices, she said it enabled pharmaceutical companies to secure a return on investment second only to that obtained by armament manufacturers. A price regime was needed which was 'democratised'. Ms Primarolo acknowledged, however, the need for spending on research and development. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, confirmed that reform of health service trusts would initially involve the removal of members not sympathetic to Labour's approach.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Martina Fietz: "Breathing Space"] </F>   [Text] Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] leader  Kinkel has created some breathing space for his party. With his  statement that he intends to continue the government alliance  with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union  [CSU] in Bonn after 16 October, he has given his party the  chance to carry out an election campaign on its own behalf.  Without constantly having to answer questions regarding the  loyalty to the coalition, the FDP can now clearly and plainly  express its position.    Thus, Kinkel has stood up mainly to the critics from within  his own camp, who have more than once requested a strong image  for the party -- and quite rightly so, by the way. After all,  the FDP has lost its traditional role as being the only party  that can create a majority with another one.    The outlines of what the FDP's new "public relations work"  can look like became clear yesterday with the request that the  solidarity surcharge be reexamined after three years. The  rejection of a higher gasoline tax is also a move to create a  distance from the CDU/CSU. The FDP's basically positive account  also creates a challenge for the CDU/CSU. It is in the areas of  economic and fiscal policy, in particular, where the junior  partner will try to distinguish itself against its senior.    Apart from the fact that the FDP has on principle defined  the  course for the continuation of the government alliance, the  coalition statement has not yet been expressly formulated. And  nobody must forget that it is intended to be an election  statement "with conditions." Yesterday Kinkel said that those  who want to prevent a coalition between the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens or a grand coalition now  must vote for the FDP. He did not say anything about an SPD-FDP  coalition.</p>

LELAND OPPOSED  </P> <P> City Council members are receiving calls from residents upset by a proposal to  rename Houston Intercontinental Airport after Rep. Mickey Leland, who died in a  plane crash last month in Ethiopia.  </P> <P> But Councilman Rodney Ellis, a Leland friend, said that he would press the  idea, which he hopes the council will consider next week, even though most of  the 50 calls his office received opposed the name change.  </P> <P> Some council members said they felt torn between their desire to honor the  congressman and to adhere to constituents' wishes.  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Bosnian talks set sights on the long haul TALKS on Bosnia-Hercegovina's future open in Geneva today in an attempt to formulate a lasting political settlement and allow refugees to return home. However, the talks have no time limit and no agenda other than some basic principles laid down at the London Conference on the former Yugoslavia last month. Mr Martti Ahtisaari, head of Finland's foreign service called in by the United Nations, will chair the closed-door negotiations involving representatives of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government and the Serb and Croatian factions. UN officials said yesterday they still expected all three sides to turn up, despite another threat from Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, to boycott the talks while Bosnian Serb forces continue air attacks against government-held towns. Leaders of the three factions last week promised Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the joint UN/EC Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia, that they would attach no preconditions to attending the talks. Earlier this week Mr Izetbegovic withdrew a similar threat, agreeing to send Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian foreign minister. The Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, his deputy, Mr Nikola Koljevic, and the Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, will also be in Geneva. The London conference stipulated that any long-term Bosnian settlement must entail respect for existing borders, unless changed by mutual agreement, the return of territory seized by force, the right of refugees to return home and protection for minorities. With the EC's 'cantonisation' plan now off the agenda, Mr Vance and Lord Owen have given Mr Ahtisaari a free hand to broker any political solution compatible with the principles of the London conference. But officials warn that the talks, if they do not break down, are likely to be prolonged. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, will meet representatives of the three Bosnian factions in Geneva today, in the hope of securing assurances on the safety of relief flights into Sarajevo to enable the airlift to restart. Suspension of the airlift a fortnight ago, after an Italian cargo aircraft was downed by a missile, has left the Bosnian capital short of essential supplies and prevented the planned build-up of winter stockpiles for up to 1m people in central and southern Bosnia. Mr Ron Redmond, a UNHCR spokesman, said Mrs Ogata hoped to be able to recommend a restart of the air bridge later today; flights could resume this weekend if donor-governments agreed. However, with Bosnian Serb forces stepping up their air bombardments this week, Mrs Ogata wants the personal assurances of all Bosnian political leaders that the UN airlift can be resumed in safety.</p>

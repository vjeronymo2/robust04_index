			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PACIFIC DANCE ENSEMBLE SHOWCASES CHOREOGRAPHER MIX  </P> <P> Because modern dance is an art emphasizing both personal vision and an original  movement language, sampler programs often prove frustrating. Case in point: the  five-part Pacific Dance Ensemble performance Friday at the Assistance League  Playhouse.  </P> <P> Instead of drawing you into an individual artist's unique sensibility, this  evening emphasized variety -- as if the components were interchangeable  showpieces. The juxtapositions yielded no new insights and there were none of  the extenuating justifications for such programming: a shared special premise  or purpose, for instance, or the chance to reach the big audiences unavailable  to struggling single-choreographer companies. This was variety by default.  </P> <P> First up, Gilberte Meunier's formal quintet "It Was a Large Room" (music by  Laurie Anderson) deftly contrasted weighty circular motion and paths with  buoyant forward-and-back actions and trajectories. Increasingly, however,  Meunier's resourceful spatial design dominated (and unified) her contrasts.  </P> <P> Next at bat: Young-Ae Park's perplexing "A Wrinkle in Space (Par Avion),"  largely overwhelmed by a haunting original score by Lorenzo Buhne and obsessed  with contrasts of its own -- between walking steps and fluid, lyrical dancing,  for example. Sometimes Park took commonplace gestures (including a handshake)  and isolated them, and sometimes the formal dancing highlighted the rigidity  and artifice of academic placement.  </P> <P> Park set up all manner of tantalizing dichotomies, but who had time to sort out  her ambitious playoffs between "natural" and "unnatural" movement, societal and  artistic codes of motion? -- because on came Lisbeth Davidow's "Full Circle."  This surging duet incorporated a wedge-shaped sculpture unit with seven  attached doors (each one smaller than the last) by Megan Williams. Set to music  by Egberto Gismonti, it was exactly the kind of piece that succeeds on such a  program: simple, showy, with no loose ends or aftereffect whatsoever.  </P> <P> Following intermission came Karl Schaffer and Erik Stern's ironic "The Curse of  E.S.P." (previously reviewed) and Tina Gerstler's new trio "Talking to Myself,"  which featured an artfully layered score by Brad Dutz that ideally complemented  Gerstler's theme: the paralysis resulting from overlapping confusion and  self-doubt.  </P> <P> Using gesture to objectify states of mind and structural ploys to make  purposeful movement statements out of supposedly purposeless behavior, Gerstler  created something distinctive, exciting and very finely wrought. She is an  increasingly important locally based artist, not always well served by these  grab-bag bills, but here quietly triumphant.  </P> <P> Pacific Dance Ensemble performed all five works capably and the program boasted  first-rate lighting and sound.  </P></p>

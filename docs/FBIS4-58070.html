			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Badr Hammam, President Husni </F> Mubarak's envoy to Yemen, in Sanaa by Muhammad al-Aswad in  Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Al-Aswad] In light of your mission in the Yemeni  Republic, what are your impressions of the crisis in fraternal  Yemen and how are Egypt's efforts to contain it received?    [Hammam] Several months have passed since the Yemeni crisis  started and we are working with all the parties in Yemen to  contain the situation and to prevent it from erupting We want to  continue with the process of protecting Yemeni unity and with  implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document prepared by all  the Yemeni parties that took part in the dialogue committee.  The document sets the single course to be pursed by Yemen  toward building the unified state the Yemenis want.    There are incidents along this course, including the  military  clash in 'Imran, about 60 kms to the north of Sanaa. It goes  without saying that the tension in this crisis is bound to put  the ordinary citizen and the Yemeni Armed Forces on edge because  they care about Yemen and are worried about their country's  future. Anxiety is normal is such crises. But the use of the  Yemeni Armed Forces in a political contest, even if this contest  reaches the level of struggle, is impermissible and brings many  dangers to Yemen, its people, territories, unity, present, and  future. I believe that the Yemeni leaders are aware of these  dangers. I also believe that they are aware of the dangers of  involving the Yemeni armed forces in this partisan political  competition that arose because of differences in views over the  ways to achieve a unified state. We are clearly and firmly  drawing their attention to these dangers.    [Al-Aswad] Ambassador Hammam, you have met with the Yemeni  leaders, particularly President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his  deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid. What are your impressions from these  meetings and what are the obstacles impeding the implementation  of the Pledge and Accord Document?    [Hammam] My impression is that all the leaders are aware of  the dangers, are keen on Yemen's unity, and have the desire to  implement the Pledge and Accord Document. But there are  different views over the manner of implementation and of the  crisis factors. This is normal. But involving the Yemeni Armed  Forces or using them in this political competition is  impermissible and should not be undertaken. This involvement is  a very grave matter.    I met with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and with Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Aden and also met with  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al- Ghani, member of the Presidential  Council. We discussed the means of containing the current  situation and of regarding the armed clash between two Yemeni  Armed Forces' units in 'Imran as an isolated incident that we  should not focus on. We should not forget the main course we  have started, namely the implementation of the Pledge and Accord  Document and protection of Yemen's unity, territorial integrity,  and the safety of its people. I believe that all the Yemeni  leaders are fully aware of this fact. I find that all of them  have good intentions and I hope that this will get us what we  want, God willing.    [Al-Aswad] You mentioned the broad context of the agreement  but how can this be transformed into action and how can Yemen  emerge from its current crisis?    [Hammam] The problem, as is the case the world over, is how  to unite the state's agencies and institutions that are  entrusted with implementing the Pledge and Accord Document and  how to keep the Yemeni Armed Forces from being involved in this  political conflict.    Struggle for power is normal and happens in many countries,  but Yemeni unity is a great deed and achievement and cherished  by all Yemenis and Arabs. Maintaining this unity requires  further patience and effort. It is no small venture that can be  completed overnight; it is a great task that necessarily faces  problems and impediments. It is wise and useful that we be  patient and take care in finding solutions for them.    [Al-Aswad] How do the brothers in Yemen view Egypt's clear  role in the efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis and bring a  fraternal united Yemen to the shore of safety?    [Hammam] What I encounter and hear here from officials and  average citizens I meet is a sincere and conscious welcome for  Egypt's efforts and role because we are sincerely and seriously  working to preserve Yemen's security, interest, and  independence. I believe they fully realize Egypt's sincere  intention and President Mubarak's personal interest in, and  regular follow-up of, what happens in Yemen. Therefore,  President Mubarak gave instructions for me to return to Yemen on  the 28th [April]. I had returned to Cairo for only a couple of  days, but the flare-up of the military situation between two  units in 'Imran prompted President Mubarak to return me to Yemen  at once so that I could follow up the situation, propose,  according to his directives, possible solutions to contain this  marginal crisis, the crisis of the military clash, and pursue  the path to settle the Yemeni crisis through objective solutions  satisfactory to all parties.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO </F> Political Department, in Tunis, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in  Cairo, from the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not  given--recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Welcome to the Voice of the Arabs.    [Qaddumi] Welcome.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you give us an idea about the  Palestinian  action following the dreadful massacre committed against the  sons of the Palestinian people?    [Qaddumi] The horrendous crime committed by the Israelis in  collusion with the army is a sign of disgrace in the history of  these racist powers. We have taken measures to provide the  necessary protection to our people by referring the issue to the  UN Security Council, the highest international authority, to  take the required steps to send international troops. We are  pressing in the direction of the United States, because it can  put pressure on Israel to disarm those settlers who tamper with  peace and security and effect an early withdrawal. There are  settlements that Rabin calls political settlements. Why don't  they dismantle these settlements? Why are there no deterrent  measures against the perpetrators?    Regrettably, the first responsibility falls on Rabin and the  Israeli Government, which failed to take any measures to stop  such acts in the past. We drew attention to these acts  repeatedly; we warned Israel and the United States, as a sponsor  of the peace conference.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You demand the disarming of settlers to  guarantee the safety and security of the Palestinian citizen.  Do you believe that this is sufficient, particularly as the  army's collusion with the settlers has been established, as you  said?    [Qaddumi] It is not sufficient. But to start with, we expect  a swift withdrawal, as they promised. We expected it, as  stipulated, on 13 December. Unfortunately, they failed to do  that. I was certain in opposing that agreement that they would  not withdraw. They were stalling for time to tell the world that  security is unstable and that incidents would happen when they  withdrew, leaving the security task to the Palestinians. By  prolonging the period, the Israelis want to justify to the world  the killing and terrorism they have exercised against our  people. They killed national symbols. They have committed the  biggest ever crime--the major holocaust [last word in English]  at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.    We will struggle. Our Arab brothers and our friends are  standing by us against this dreadful crime.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You pointed out that settlements must be  eliminated. They have become time bombs. You demanded that  they be dismantled. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said  that settlements will stay, that you agreed to this, and that  they insist on that agreement.    [Qaddumi] First, we did not say we agree with maintaining  the  settlements. The political solution should be based on  international legitimacy. Second, international legitimacy is  represented by the UN Security Council resolutions. There is  Resolution 465, which calls for eliminating the settlements. The  United States approved that resolution.    Besides, the United States said the settlements constitute  an obstacle to peace and Europe said they were illegal. Rabin  is a liar and he prevaricates. He agreed with the army to carry  out this filthy job. Had Rabin wanted peace, he would have  withdrawn on 13 December. But, as Peres said, we have been  talking or negotiating with ourselves in Cairo. The controversy  has concerned the means to (?perpetuate) their presence. This is  what they have been discussing. Why then do they arm the  settlers? Isn't the Israeli army occupying our land? Yet they  want to tell the world that they are not responsible for these  crimes, which they plan in the dark.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is a question that arises concerning  participation in the new round of bilateral peace talks between  you and Israel, is there not?    [Qaddumi] On what do we negotiate now? What does Clinton  want us to tell him at these negotiations? Why does he call the  negotiators? First, decisive measures must be taken if the  United States is eager for security and peace and not biased  toward Israel.    By these quick negotiations, it seems that the United States  wants to absorb international indignation. But international  indignation is overwhelming and the United States cannot absorb  it. Israel will indeed encounter numerous afflictions in the  future because of its terrorist behavior. It has been proven to  the world, particularly the countries that supported Israel,  that Israel is the cause of tension in the region. It is the  hotbed of tension. So, on what do we negotiate? Let Clinton  tell Rabin frankly and clearly to withdraw from the Palestinian  land. We have accepted peace and the U.S. conditions. Now they  want us to negotiate following this tragedy.    The United States is asking the impossible. The Palestinian  nation can stand fast and sacrifice. It will not surrender, no  matter how big a power supports Israel. Yes, we know we are  sacrificing and that this sacrifice is essential. If there is  seriousness about establishing a just and durable peace, we  support such a move. We said yes with pride to the peace  conference under unjust conditions, which Baker, the architect  of this settlement, knows. Why then does Clinton hesitate to  take measures? We want you, the friends of Israel, if you are  concerned about peace, to come forward and bridge this wide gap  between us and Israel.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much.    [Qaddumi] We thank you very much and appreciate the role of  our brothers in Egypt, who support the Palestinian people. We  also appreciate the role of the Arab nation and the Arab League  in this tragedy. No doubt, the united Arab stance is a basic  factor and this unity has been clearly shown to the world.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Georgians scorn threat of sanctions GEORGIA yesterday shrugged off Russian threats of sanctions, aimed at imposing a peace settlement on it and its separatist region of Abkhazia, as it emerged that Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, was almost killed on Sunday. An aide said a shell narrowly missed Mr Shevardnadze's car as he was driving through the war-torn province, where hundreds of people have died in almost a year of fighting. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned on Sunday that Russia would take harsh measures unless the two sides signed a peace agreement within two days. However, a spokesman for the Georgian Foreign Ministry said sanctions would make no difference as the republic was 'under an economic blockade from Russia anyway'. The Abkhaz parliament said heavy fighting was raging yesterday after an offensive on the regional capital, Sukhumi, which is in government hands, was repulsed. Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi claimed yesterday that President Boris Yeltsin's home region had declared itself a republic, as part of a plot sanctioned by the Russian leader. The latest broadside against Mr Yeltsin, who has not commented on the proclamation of a Urals republic within Russia, came as Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister, warned the declaration could upset attempts to hammer out a new constitution.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE FEINSTEIN  </P> <P> I can't tell you how infuriating it was to see the caricature of Feinstein on  the cover.  </P> <P> While San Francisco's former mayor may not be popular with some Southern  Californians, that does not warrant such a display of contempt.  </P> <P> Would you have dared to paint such an unflattering portrait of our two male  gubernatorial candidates? I think not. Yet you chose to portray our one female  contender in a pseudo-Leona Helmsley pose.  </P> <P> MARINA BAROFF  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P> <P> Editor's note: This illustration of gubernatorial candidate John K. Van de  Kamp, also by Edward Sorel, appeared on the cover on Jan. 14.  </P></p>

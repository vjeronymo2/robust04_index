			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Satirical? Sir, Was the reference to 'Aerostructures Humble' (Lex, September 24/25), the troubled aircraft components manufacturer, merely a Freudian slip, or was it an admirable attempt to inject some satire into the Financial Times? As they say in Private Eye, I think we should be told. Andrew Blackman, assistant editor, Acquisitions Monthly, Lonsdale House, 7/9 Lonsdale Gardens, Tunbridge Wells, Kent TN1 1NU</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets had a quieter session yesterday as the two-week equity account came to its close, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the FT-SE contract for December delivery moved erratically in thin turnover with only 6,633 contracts traded, but maintained the premium which has now been sustained for more than one month. Interest rate optimism was encouraged by Thursday night's speech in the City of London by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and with the domestic political outlook now more stable, there was support for the futures contract. At the official close, December showed a premium of about 30 points to cash. Dealers estimated the fair value premium, which allows for dividend flows and carrying costs, at about 17 from Monday morning, taking account of expectations that interest rates could fall before December expires. In traded options, volume fell to 19,164 contracts from Thursday's 24,637. The FT-SE contract recorded only 3,415. Among individual share contracts, British Airways (1,917) headed the actives list.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA PAWS PRESIDES AT ADOPT-A-PET YULE PARTY  </P> <P> It was an unbeatable combination: children, animals, senior citizens and Santa  all in a party atmosphere.  </P> <P> The occasion was the fifth annual Adopt-a-Pet Party at the Long Beach Animal  Control Center.  </P> <P> Sixty-five dogs and cats were given away Saturday to low-income senior citizens  and underprivileged children who could not otherwise afford to have a pet.  </P> <P> This program is made affordable because the sponsoring agencies, Beach  Charities and the FHP health maintenance organization, promise a lifetime of  animal food and veterinarian care to the qualifying adoptive "parents," who in  turn must promise to provide a home and love.  </P> <P> Helping with the pet distribution was the Beach Charities mascot, dressed as  Santa Paws, who posed for pictures with the participants. Participants were  able to choose their pet through coupon requests.  </P> <P> "The response to this program from the community is remarkable," said John  Gonzales, senior animal control officer.  </P> <P> Over the five-year history of the program, the shelter has given away more than  600 animals. And Beach Charities continues to support them with funds raised  from its other charity events.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Crown Prince Hasan, regent, at Third Arab Youth </F> Forum conference in Amman on 15 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I do not want here to start  replying to certain accusations leveled at your Jordanian  homeland. Some of these accusations may be made with good  intentions, but most of the time they are made with bad  intentions. Over the past 70 years, we have heard here and  there descriptions of Jordan's role, the tasks it was entrusted  to carry out when it was established, and how its role is  threatened. We have been listening to analyses that some  believe are convincing and with which they themselves are  convinced.    Brothers and sisters, Jordan has always replied to all this  and more with its achievements and the pursuance of its course,  believing that homelands are not shaken by injustices and that  their marches are not affected by doubts and skepticism.    Here we are pursuing the march of good that was started by  the great Jordanian Arab people early in this century, united,  and in response to the program of the late founder grandfather  -- may God's mercy be upon him -- confident in the soundness of  our beliefs, and believing in the role we have to play. We have  not changed and we will not alter our stand. We have adopted a  centrist stand in economy and politics and we thank God that the  memory of the Arab citizen records and remembers. It remembers  that Jordan is committed to what it believes, and knows that the  means it uses are in line with the results. Jordan has never  made any secret step, and has proven to all those who watch it  that it is the homeland that continues to abide by what is right  and which continues to respond to the nation's aspirations.    The leader of this homeland, the head of the Al-Hashim  family, King Husayn, has raised over the past few years a slogan  embodying the revival of unity among us, the slogan of descents  and origins. He has also raised the following slogan: Those who  tamper with national unity are my foes until the day of  reckoning.    Brothers, some whisper or explicitly say that Jordan is for  the Jordanians. Some prepare studies from time to time about  statistics on who is Jordanian and who is not, and who is from a  non-Jordanian origin.    I find in your conference an opportunity to sincerely  clarify  this point to you, and to ask: Actually, who is a Jordanian?  Does Jordan, in the geographic sense of the word, extend only  from al-Ramthah at al-'Aqabah? Is raising the fabricated  contradiction between the Jordanian in the east and the  Palestinian in the west as innocent as it appears and without  ulterior motives? Is there a feeling of dual citizenship that  the state has not succeeded in tackling? [passage omitted]    Brothers and sisters, we are a sovereign homeland that seeks  to attain its interests without fear. We deal with developments  frankly and sincerely. We inform all the citizens of what takes  place around us. We participated in the peace conference with a  popular consensus that was achieved through the national  congress. We act with the interest of our country and nation at  heart without hesitation, and by scientifically studying every  step we make. We do not disparage our national capabilities but  work to enhance them. We also do not try to assume more than we  can. Homelands are not forged with adventures and slogans.  [applause]    Brothers, this is a homeland that is realistic and one that  can do all that is needed to further enhance its status.  [passage omitted]</p>

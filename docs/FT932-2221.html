			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Heseltine challenges Nadir to substantiate 'smears' THE GOVERNMENT yesterday challenged fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir to substantiate his allegations about the role of ministers and the Conservative party in the demise of Polly Peck International. In a move strongly endorsed by Mr John Major's office, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said that Mr Nadir should either end the 'smears' or back them up. In a direct message to Mr Nadir, he said: 'Don't let's get involved in allegations. Publish it. Stop smears. Publish what you believe to be evidence.' Amid a swirl of speculation at Westminster about the possible links of past or present ministers with Mr Nadir there was private acknowledgment that the constant flow of allegations was damaging the government. One government minister suggested a thorough overhaul by Conservative Central Office of its fundraising procedures to tighten the rules on acceptance of company donations and to ensure greater transparency in the party's accounts. He said: 'Accepting the money from Nadir was an understandable mistake given his good reputation at the time. But some of the mud is bound to stick. We should not allow it to happen again.' The party has, so far, refused to repay the Pounds 440,000 donated during the 1980s by Mr Nadir's companies. Ministers also criticised the role of the media in publishing unsubstantiated allegations made by a fugitive from the British courts. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called on Mr Major to intervene directly in the 'scandal' of Tory party financing. He said the prime minister was legally responsible for the Conservative party organisation. At the same time, as head of government, it was his responsibility to close loopholes in the Companies Act which had allowed the Tory party to accept loans rather than gifts and thus avoid the existing disclosure rules. Mr Smith said that the practice - proposed but then quickly abandoned by the Conservatives last year - was a 'disgrace'. Senior Tory officials flatly rejected the notion that the party should be responsible for compliance by corporate donors with the legal requirement on companies to include political donations in published accounts. The Northern Ireland minister, Mr Michael Mates, whose gift of a watch to Mr Nadir was described by the prime minister as a 'misjudgement', yesterday issued a statement denying claims that he had received the gift of a car on behalf of his wife, Rosellen. In the statement to the Press Association news agency, he said: 'It has been put to me by some journalists that I have received on behalf of my wife the gift of a car, with improper motives being adduced. 'I wish to categorically deny that anybody connected with me has received any such gift or that I have done anything in any way improper in this connection.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw (DDP/ADN)--Poland's Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak believes that German-Polish cooperation offers scope for  development. Relations between the two states are good, and  Germany is Poland's most important trade partner. Nevertheless,  the opportunities offered by proximity have so far not been  fully exploited, Pawlak said in an interview with DDP/ADN in  Warsaw before his visit to Germany, which is due to begin on  Thursday. "What is needed is stronger commitment in the search  for partnership and balance," the prime minister said.    This applies above all because "certain disproportions"  became apparent last year. For instance, Polish imports from  Germany developed more dynamically than exports to Germany.  Therefore, both sides should strive for equilibrium in the  balance of trade. In Pawlak's view, for example, the export of  Polish construction services could be again raised to the level  reached years ago.    In the talks in Bonn, the Polish prime minister wants to  concentrate on the practical side of cooperation. The priority  is "the creation of mechanisms and infrastructures that promote  exchange between companies and relations between people," Pawlak  said. Governments have many opportunities to facilitate this  process. The prime minister included in these the creation of a  financial and transport infrastructure such as new  border-crossing points, the development of cultural cooperation,  youth exchanges, and tourism. Pawlak said he wants to talk  about these issues in Germany.    He pointed out that Poland is very attentively watching  Germany's stand on Poland's efforts to seek rapprochement with  the EU [European Union] and with NATO. "I think our interests  coincide in this area," the prime minister stressed.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH REPORT 2ND-WORST TRADE DEFICIT  </P> <P> Britain's trade picture took a severe turn for the worse last month when its  balance of payments showed a massive deficit of $3.25 billion (2.06 billion  pounds), the second-worst monthly figure ever, the government said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The deficit compared to a shortfall of $2.5 billion (1.5 billion pounds) in  June, and its size surprised economic analysts who had forecast an improvement  in the trade gap.  </P> <P> The report was a blow to government hopes that the figure, which measures trade  in goods and services, had taken a decisive downturn as a result of government  policy of pushing interest rates higher to cool the economy.  </P> <P> The Central Statistical Office said the deficit on trade alone was $3.9 billion  (2.46 billion pounds), but this was offset by a surplus of $630 million (400  million pounds) on invisible items such as banking, insurance and tourism.  </P> <P> The surprisingly large deficit sent the British pound tumbling. It slid more  than 1.5 cents to $1.5720 from $1.5895 on Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Single Reason  </P> <P> Britain recorded its worst current account deficit of $3.7 billion (2.33  billion pounds) last October as a runaway consumer boom, which is only now  beginning to wind down, sucked in imports.  </P> <P> Although Britain's seaborne trade was affected by a three-week dock strike in  July, the government said there was no single reason for the jump in the  deficit.  </P> <P> Imports increased by 4%, while exports rose 2%.  </P> <P> Imports in July included an influx of cars ready for the start of the new  registration year in August, when sales reach their annual peak.  </P> <P> The bad July trade figures countered more encouraging recent economic reports,  including the first fall in inflation since the start of 1988 and a halt to  growth in pay rises.  </P> <P> Analysts said Britain's finance minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel  Lawson, was less likely to cut interest rates from 14% despite pressure from  businessmen who fear that the economy risks moving into recession.  </P> <P> Lower interest rates could push sterling down further against the dollar and  the West German mark and give a fresh twist to inflation.  </P></p>

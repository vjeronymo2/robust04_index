			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUT BY THE 'KNIFE'  </P> <P> On July 30 I had the choice of watching various programs, including "American  Masters."  </P> <P> Knowing that KCET probably would repeat that program, I opted for ABC's "The  Knife and Gun Club," starring Perry King and Dorian Harewood, and was  pleasantly surprised.  </P> <P> The show was gripping and factual and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I just hope that  it was not an unsold pilot and will never be seen again.  </P> <P> Donna L. Starr, Tustin  </P> <P> Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but "The Knife and Gun Club" indeed was  an unsold pilot and, in all likelihood, will never be seen again.  </P></p>

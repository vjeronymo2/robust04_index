			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Experts from both  sides of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) met here  today to discuss issues concerning the Hong Kong residents after  1997.    Chen Zuoer, resident representative of the Chinese team of  the group, said that experts from both sides exchanged views on  matters such as right of abode, visa abolition, and the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region travel documents.    He said that the Chinese side attaches great importance to  the above issues as they constitute the major contents of the  transfer of power in 1997, adding that he hoped a legitimate and  reasonable solution towards the issues could be worked out  between the two sides.</p>

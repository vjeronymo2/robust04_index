			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: High Gosforth development turned down High Gosforth Park, the quoted company which owns and runs Newcastle racecourse, heard yesterday that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has refused planning permission for development at its green belt site. It wanted to raise Pounds 4.4m, by land sales for housing and offices, to finance improvements to course facilities and had warned that without a large capital injection it could not continue to trade beyond 1996. Mr Gummer said it had not demonstrated the 'very special circumstances' needed to permit green belt development. All realistic means of financing the proposed improvements had not been explored, he said; nor was there 'compelling evidence' that the proposed development was the only way to secure Grade I racing's long-term future at Gosforth Park.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Cedel to settle Russian oil shares International trading in the shares of JSC Rosneftegazstroy (RNGS), Russia's giant oil and gas construction company, is set to begin on Monday following the successful private placement of some Dollars 25.5m of the company's equity with international investors. The shares have been issued by a RNGS holding company based in Cyprus, which in turn holds RNGS's equity. The structure has been adopted to avoid the difficulties associated with share settlement in Russia, functioning in the same way as a system based on American or global depositary receipts, paper which represents underlying equity. The paper, equal to 3.7 per cent of RNGS's equity, has been distributed by Rhone Finance of Geneva and ICE Securities, a London broker which specialises in Italian and central European markets. Settlement will be available by Cedel, the European share clearing system. 'This is the first time that international investors have been able to make settlement in Russian equities outside of Russia,' said Mr Chris Woodgate, of ICE Securities. Under the terms of the placement the shares carry a fixed 8 per cent annual US dollar dividend payable half-yearly and premium redemption rights by way of a put. RNGS, which has agreed to allow up to 10 per cent of its equity to be issued to foreign investors, is one of a number of Russian companies seeking to raise capital on the international markets. Gazprom, the country's gas company, could raise several billion dollars if its plans to issue global depositary receipts, currently scheduled for 1995, are successful. Gazprom is seeking to sell 9 per cent of its equity.</p>

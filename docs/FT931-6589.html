			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Lord Pennock: ICI deputy chairman and CBI president LORD PENNOCK, former deputy chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and president of the Confederation of British Industry, died last week aged 72. Raymond Pennock spent more than 30 years at ICI, initially in personnel and later as head of the agricultural operations. He was appointed a director in 1972 and became deputy chairman between 1975 and 1980. Knighted in 1978 for his services to exports, he was widely tipped as a possible chairman of ICI, but the position went to Sir Maurice Hodgson. Between 1980 and 1982 he was president of the CBI and at the end of his term he was made a life peer. In 1980 he became chairman of BICC, the cables and construction group, where he was already a director. He stayed at the post until 1984, helping to turn the company around. His entry in Who's Who mentions his directorship at Eurotunnel, but not his unhappy year-long stint as the group's co-chairman between 1986 and 1987. He stepped down after criticisms from the Bank of England about the handling of an international share placing which almost failed. Lord Pennock, an energetic committee member, was a member of the National Economic Development Council from 1979 to 1982. He was the first British president of the Union of European Community Industries from 1984 to 1986 and was president of the Chemical Industries Association in 1978 and 1979. He was a director of Morgan Grenfell and deputy chairman of Standard Chartered Bank and Plessey. In 1943 he married Lorna Pearse and they had a son and two daughters.</p>

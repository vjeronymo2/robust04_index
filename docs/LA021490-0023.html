			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TASK FORCE WANTS METHANE SENSOR LAW ENFORCED;  </P> <P> GAS: ONLY 35 DETECTORS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN A 400-BLOCK HIGH-RISK ZONE NEAR  THE FARMERS MARKET.  </P> <P> A city task force has found that a requirement for gas detectors to be  installed in homes and commercial structures in the methane risk zone near the  Farmers Market is being widely ignored.  </P> <P> The detectors proved themselves as recently as one year ago, when a portable  device warned that a dangerous concentration of gas was building up in a store  across the street from the spot where a methane explosion and fire injured more  than 20 people on March 24, 1985.  </P> <P> To date, 35 of the sensors have been installed in a 400-block area that was  declared to be a potentially dangerous area after the 1985 fire, the task  force's chairman, city geologist J. W. Cobarrubias, said.  </P> <P> Because city law requires sensors whenever a home or building with a basement  that could trap methane changes hands, the actual number should have been much  higher, he said.  </P> <P> In the report, which is awaiting action by the Los Angeles City Council, the  task force said that wells and ditches should be dug to provide a safe exit for  any further gas buildups in the porous soil beneath the corner of 3rd Street  and Ogden Drive.  </P> <P> It also called for commercial and industrial buildings to be equipped with  ventilation systems that can change the air in a room as soon as a dangerous  accumulation of the odorless and colorless gas is noticed by the mechanical  sensors.  </P> <P> The task force recommended that a special priority be given to a several-block  area close to the Ross Dress for Less store, where the 1985 blast occurred, and  that the Fire Department and the Department of Building and Safety be  authorized to devote time and money to inspections and other measures to  prevent additional explosions.  </P> <P> In this priority area, the task force recommended that a team of inspectors be  hired to make a systematic survey of existing apartment houses and commercial  and industrial buildings to make sure that the required gas detection and  venting systems are in place.  </P> <P> The report also recommended that technical surveys be conducted to identify  other potentially dangerous locations in the Fairfax District.  </P> <P> Cost of the surveys was estimated at $75,000, but installation of $133,600  worth of relief wells and collector trenches probably would cost the city no  more that $4,600 because state funds would pay for the rest, the report said.  </P> <P> The task force recommendations must first be considered by the City Council's  Finance and Revenue Committee, but a spokeswoman for Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky, chairman of the panel, said that it has not yet been scheduled for  discussion.  </P> <P> Cobarrubias said this month that the group devoted "a lot of time" to the  question of where the methane comes from, but did not reach a conclusion.  </P> <P> One study, funded by a grant from the Gas Research Institute, concluded that  the methane seeped up from deposits in an oil field thousands of feet below the  surface. But other research paid for by the state of California found that  similar gases could be produced by microbes near the surface.  </P> <P> The debate most likely will end up in the courts, where victims of the 1985  explosion and fire in the Ross store are suing McFarland Energy Inc., an oil  company that operates 42 wells under the area from a compound behind the  Farmers Market.  </P> <P> The latest methane incident took place on Feb. 7, 1989, when seepage was so  strong that a fountain of gas, water and mud burst through the pavement near  3rd Street and Ogden Drive, outside the Gilmore Bank on the Farmers Market  property. The same day, a sensor in the basement of a K mart store across the  street detected a dangerous methane buildup.  </P> <P> Although the City Council required in 1986 that gas detectors be installed in  nearby homes and buildings with basements where methane could collect, the  Building and Safety Department has no way to check on compliance, Cobarrubias  said.  </P> <P> "The main line of defense is recognition of incursion by use of these  detectors," he said. In the 1989 incident, "there's no telling how long it  would have taken people to notice it."  </P> <P> In that case, workers at K mart saw the alarm flashing when they came in  shortly after 6 a.m. Nobody was hurt, but the area was closed off for two days.  </P></p>

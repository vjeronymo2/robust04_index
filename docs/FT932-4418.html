			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: National Grid expects to cut 450 jobs despite profits increase NATIONAL GRID said yester-day it expected its workforce to fall this year by about 450 to about 4,900. The statement accompanied a 7.1 per cent rise to Pounds 533.2m in annual pre-tax profits on a historical cost basis. On a current cost basis the pre-tax figure for the 12 months to March 31 improved 11 per cent to Pounds 350.5m (Pounds 314.5m). Mr John Uttley, finance director, said the job losses were likely as part of a drive to cut 30 per cent from controllable costs from 1991-92 to 1996-97. The target was set after a regulatory review resulted in National Grid having to cut transmission charges by 12 per cent over the next four years. Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said he expected further efficiencies to result from the company's decision to put its wires, control centres and towers business into one unit, leaving the rest of the company to contract services to it. Turnover improved 5.4 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn in spite of a slight decline in electricity demand to 264.8 (265.5) terrawatt hours. Mr Jefferies said company strategy was to take expertise overseas, particularly in countries where there was a likelihood of the grid system being sold off. In the UK, the company is laying 80km of fibre each week for its new telecommunications company and would be able to contact 70 per cent of potential customers in the UK by next March. Profit growth was most marked in pump storage and interconnections, up 35 per cent to about Pounds 64m, but Mr Uttley indicated future growth would be less. National Grid is jointly owned by the 12 regional electricity companies.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (9): Swaps trade dodges issue - Now that the debate for a multilateral swaps clearing house has died down, even the most self-interested proponents recognise that the swaps trade, a highly customised retail market, will not fit into a wholesale clearing mould. Laurie Morse examines the options / Clearing THE IDEA of a futures-style clearing house for over-the-counter derivatives gained prominence early this year, in part because the US government had just exempted swaps from US commodity regulations, increasing the uneasiness politicians and bank regulators have about the Dollars 7,000bn market. Advocates argued that a multilateral swaps clearing house would broaden access to the burgeoning market, reduce credit risks, and produce reams of data for regulatory scrutiny. The world's biggest futures exchanges, at least one law firm, and several dealers rushed to research prototypes. However, the handful of AAA-rated banks and dealers who conduct 80 per cent of the world's swaps trade carefully sidestepped the clearing house debate, knowing that without their participation, a swaps clearing house would not succeed. They value the competitive edge their credit ratings deliver, and are satisfied with their own credit controls. Now that the excitement has died down, even the most self-interested proponents recognise that the swaps trade, a highly customised retail market, will not fit into a wholesale clearing mould. Consensus is building that what is needed instead is a series of third-party agents providing services usually performed by a clearing house. Dealers would continue bilateral netting, using standard master agreements like those provided by ISDA, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, but trade matching confirmations, collateral handling, and depository duties would be outsourced to others. 'There are credible substitutes provided by reputable institutions for almost every individual function of a swaps clearing house,' Mr John Davidson, senior vice-president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's clearing operations, told a banking group recently. 'As their functionality improves, the incremental need for a clearing house diminishes. The swaps industry perhaps has learned from the long, controversial, and expensive attempts to develop clearing houses for over-the-counter foreign exchange transactions. Several ventures, such as New York-based FxNet, has bilaterally netted spot trades for years. However, multilateral clearing remains elusive, and most efforts have avoided derivatives altogether. Two competing groups, one on each side of the Atlantic, plan to offer multilateral foreign exchange contract netting and global settlement services next year, and intend to include forward contracts as well as spot deals. Multinet, backed primarily by First Chicago and Chase Manhattan, will use the services of the Options Clearing Corp. Multinet lost the backing of several top-rated banks when they realised the venture, by enhancing credit quality, could strengthen their weaker rivals. 'We knew from the start this was a project subject to fractious relationships,' says Mr Garrett Glass, a senior vice-president at First National Bank of Chicago, and the chief architect of the six-year-long project. Echo, or the Exchange Clearing house, has much the same object as Multinet. Based in London it has a dozen bank shareholders, and is being directed primarily by Barclays. Its prolonged development has been due to difficulties in guiding its charter through jealous waters, and to the fact that starting any kind of clearing operation from scratch is extremely expensive. In the swaps market, the credit worries extend far beyond initial settlement risk, with credit exposures extending over the term of the contract. Banks, even more than regulators, are concerned about this exposure. In addition to imposing strict credit quality standards and credit limits on customers and counterparties, the swaps industry has begun to collect collateral on all but the most standard transactions, and to mark positions to market to assess risk ore accurately . Both practices are the basis of the high credit quality awarded to exchange-affiliated clearing houses. Although the CME has considered developing a swaps clearing house, Mr Davidson says that fundamentally, the existing system of counterparty credit limits works. 'Banks and other financial intermediaries are good at applying them, supervisors are good at reviewing them, and senior management understands them. Rapidly untethering the swaps market from its current, largely self-imposed limitations, may not have entirely desirable systemic risk implications,' he says. If the primary swaps dealers do begin to move toward an organised clearing house, they will be driven by regulatory capital requirements. It is widely assumed that a fully collateralised swaps clearing house would be exempted from requirements to beef up capital to back up trades. However, if this spring's Basle Committee proposal to recognise bilateral close-out netting is approved, capital reserve requirements for swap-dealing banks could be trimmed by more than half, according to Mr Ottho Heldring, a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank. That, in turn, would widen the use of standard netting agreements, and hasten the evolution of agents to service settlement and collateral processing needs. One such service is Bankers Trust's C-Trac+, which offers third-party processing for all types of collateralised OTC transactions. Capitalising on the bank's own derivatives processing capabilities, the product tracks exposures, makes margin calls, and handles the pricing and custody of the assets pledged as collateral. Ms Eileen Bedell, managing director for Bankers, says the product is aimed at derivative dealers that may not have fully developed back office procedures, and find using the system less expensive than developing in-house capabilities. She thinks that as the derivatives business becomes more competitive, consolidating back-office functions will become more popular. 'People will begin to realise that a swaps trading model is proprietary, but margin tracking is not,' she says. However, since most leading dealers have already invested in their own processing functions, she says the new services can only compete by reducing costs and increasing profitability.</p>

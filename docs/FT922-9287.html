			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Momentum Life, RMB in link-up MOMENTUM Life, South Africa's fifth largest life insurance company, and Rand Merchant Bank (RMB), one of the three main merchant banks, have joined forces to create an independent financial services group. The deal will create a group with assets of over R10bn (Dollars 3.57bn) and a market value of about R750m. It will be independent of all the main large life offices and conglomerates which dominate the South African financial services sector. Ultimate control will rest with the directors and management of the RMB group who control RMB Holdings, parent company of RMB. The deal brings together a relatively young life office - Momentum is 25 years old - that has grown mainly by acquisition, and a merchant bank renowned for its aggression in the market. The tie-up arises out of the recent merger between the two banks Absa and Bankorp, announced in January. One of the consequences of the deal was that Sankorp, the industrial arm of the Sanlam insurance group, was to buy control of Momentum from Absa and Rembrandt, the tobacco group, who between them held 59 per cent of the shares. Momentum management, however, was given the option of choosing an alternative partner, outside the life assurance industry, and they chose RMB. The deal is in two parts. RMBH will pay R180m - 41m Momentum ordinary shares at R4.40 per share - to acquire the 58.7 per cent of Momentum held by Absa and Rembrandt. Momentum will then pay R385.6m to buy RMB, satisfied by the payment of R154.2m cash and R52.6m Momentum ordinary shares. RMBH will hold 76.4 per cent of Momentum which will hold 100 per cent of RMB. Momentum will remain a listed company and RMBH will be listed in the later in the year.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ulster Bank paying IPounds 25m for stockbroker Ulster Bank, the Irish subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, has applied for approval under Irish monopolies and mergers legislation to buy NCB, the second largest Dublin stockbroker, for IPounds 25.5m (Pounds 25.1m). The deal follows eight months of negotiation and will involve a payment of IPounds 10.5m with another IPounds 15m over five years depending on performance. Mr Dermot Desmond, the broker's non-executive chairman and 56 per cent shareholder, stands to receive more than IPounds 14m. At least IPounds 6m of this will be paid initially, but Mr Desmond may actually receive a larger portion up front as he is leaving the company. The rest will be split between 35 other employees who own the balance.</p>

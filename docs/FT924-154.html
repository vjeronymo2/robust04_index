			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / GPA to cut firm aircraft orders GPA GROUP has reached agreement with aircraft manufacturers to reduce its firm orders by more than Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn). The resulting penalties may adversely affect its results in 1993 and later years, it says. The information is contained in a prospectus the aircraft leasing company filed in the US earlier this month. By the beginning of the December GPA had agreed with its aircraft manufacturers to reduce its Dollars 11.9bn of firm orders up to the year 2000 by Dollars 3.2bn, after taking into account aircraft purchased since April. A further Dollars 3.1bn of orders which are 'subject to cancellation' has been agreed, which may allow the group to cancel most of its Dollars 4.8bn worth of orders beyond 1994. The prospectus says: 'The combination of the cancellation, deferral and recharacterisation of orders is likely to result in penalties to GPA which may materially affect results of operations for fiscal 1993 . . . and also affect results of operations for later years.' Aircraft manufacturers have agreed to provide short-term finance for the purchase of aircraft and have already made some advances. The penalties mentioned in the prospectus are likely to be the loss of some of the Dollars 954m of pre-delivery payments made to aircraft manufacturers by GPA at the end of March. It is understood that Boeing and Airbus Industrie have proved more willing to reach an accommodation with GPA than McDonnell Douglas. GPA's negotiations with aircraft manufacturers, which are expected to be concluded by January 17, depend on a successful outcome of the group's talks with its lenders. The group is seeking to defer up to Dollars 1bn of debt and to change its bank covenants by the end of next month. The banks have agreed to waive potential breach of covenants until the end of January. However, during the term of the temporary waiver, the group is prevented from increasing the amount drawn on the facilities. According to the prospectus, further temporary waivers may be necessary before agreements are reached with the bank lenders.</p>

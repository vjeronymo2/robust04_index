			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S QUICK STRIKE IGNITES MOORPARK WIN  </P> <P> Freddie Bradley must believe in making a good first impression.  </P> <P> The freshman returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown Saturday in  Moorpark College's opener, much to the amazement of East Los Angeles Coach Al  Padilla.  </P> <P> "To start off the game like that is a real shock treatment," Padilla said.  </P> <P> Bradley made a lasting impression on Padilla by scoring his second touchdown on  a 25-yard reception with 32 seconds left in the first quarter. Quarterback  Jayson Merrill added three touchdown passes to lift the Raiders to a 31-7  victory at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Bradley jump-started Moorpark's offense by bursting through the middle on the  opening kickoff. Fourteen minutes later, Merrill hit the running back with a  scoring pass to give Moorpark a 14-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. All  the scoring in the game came in the first half.  </P> <P> "I really like that guy and when he returned that kickoff for a touchdown I  liked him a lot more," Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said.  </P> <P> Bittner, who is known for his love of the running game, let Merrill pass  against the Huskies and with good results: 12 completions in 20 attempts for  201 yards.  </P> <P> "We were really concerned with our offensive line in the first half," Bittner  said. "They did a lot of blitzes and stuff that pretty much forced us to pass,  and we did not hesitate to go to the air. I have a lot of confidence in Merrill  and we went up top right away."  </P> <P> With Moorpark leading, 14-0, East L. A. tailback Adan Avina burst through the  middle for a 44-yard touchdown run with 14:40 left in the first half.  </P> <P> On the ensuing possession, the Raiders moved 73 yards in six plays to score  their third touchdown. Wide receiver Rick Wright took Merrill's pass 62 yards  for a touchdown. Sean Cheevers' point-after gave Moorpark a 21-7 lead with  10:23 left in the first half.  </P> <P> Moorpark gained 343 yards in total offense. The Huskies (0-2), who gained 554  total yards and rang up 39 points in an opening loss to Pierce last week,  picked up 268 yards. Avina accounted for 147 yards in 21 carries.  </P></p>

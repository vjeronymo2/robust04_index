			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Lu Chao-lung (0712 2507 7127)] </F>   [Text] Taipei -- It was disclosed that the Army will spend  more than NT$ [New Taiwan Dollars] 10 billion for the purchase  of 200 Patriot missiles of an improved version to equip three  missile companies to be deployed in northern Taiwan to guard  against tactical missiles and air defense. The Patriot is the  only missile that has had actually been able to counterstrike  other missiles.    During a luncheon with Legislator Wang Tien-chin yesterday  [13 April], Lt. General Chang Kuang-chin, deputy commander in  chief of the Army, and other high-ranking Army officers briefed  him in detail about the purchasing plan. The Army was quite  impressed with Wang's recent rather professional questions on  Patriot missiles.    It was disclosed that, after extensive assessment, the Army  is able to combat the problem of launching Patriot missiles even  under circumstances that the Republic of China [ROC] lacks  satellite navigation for missile launching. A high-ranking  general also confirmed that the launching of Patriot missiles  will not be affected by lack of satellite navigation. Army  officers also learned from a study trip in the United States  last July that the U.S. Army does not consider the Patriot  outdated and will continue to improve the missile.    Regarding how accurate the missile is in hitting a target,  information provided by the Army shows that Patriot missiles can  be 40 to 70 percent accurate in hitting a target. The  information is based on various sources, including briefings at  the U.S. Congress given by an assistant chief of staff of the  U.S. tactical planning units.    It was pointed out that Patriot missiles have been improved  four times and the system the ROC Army will purchase is the  latest. On the basis of the tactical capabilities it  demonstrated in the Persian Gulf War, this model has gone  through the U.S. Army's tactical tests and thus has a better  launching control system.</p>

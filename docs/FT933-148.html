			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Brewer fills its cup in north and south: Single buy helps S&amp;N to many goals Scottish &amp; Newcastle has achieved several important strategic objectives in a single step with the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's 1,654 Chef &amp; Brewer pubs. After disposing of 748 pubs - to meet limits imposed by the government on the size of national brewers' estates - S&amp;N will be left with a retail business of 2,700 outlets. More than 60 per cent of the GrandMet pubs are in London and southern England, complementing S&amp;N's existing estate which is nearly 70 per cent in Scotland and northern England. This wider national presence will provide S&amp;N with a solid base from which to promote its portfolio of beer brands - including Younger's, McEwan's, Theakston's, Beck's and Coors - and strengthen its operations in the independent pub trade and take-home market. Integrating Chef &amp; Brewer into its existing pub retail business will offer scope for cost savings, and give S&amp;N more negotiating clout in the purchase of wines, spirits, soft drinks and food. The enlarged retail operations give the group a more evenly balanced business across its three trading divisions. Pubs contributed Pounds 53.3m or 23.5 per cent of last year's operating profits of Pounds 226.5m. Brewing accounted for 42.5 per cent and its Center Parcs and other leisure businesses contributed 34 per cent. Chef &amp; Brewer achieved profits of Pounds 72m last year and is expected to make not less than Pounds 66m this year. GrandMet's disposal offered the only likely opportunity to acquire a substantial number of high quality, well-located pubs in a single parcel. They include the directly managed houses which formed the top profit generators of the GrandMet and Courage estates. During 10 months of negotiations, S&amp;N has inspected every pub. 'Our investigations have confirmed that the estate has considerable unexploited potential,' said Mr Brian Stewart, group chief executive. Some 300 pubs are likely to be refurbished in the first year, at a cost of between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000 a pub. Recent investment in S&amp;N's estate on this scale has brought significant trading improvements. In the longer term, the group plans to introduce into the new pubs some of its Homespreads family catering initiatives and other facilities and products. The deal makes S&amp;N a much more significant participant in a pub market which has been substantially restructured in the past four years. Though the national brewers remain among the biggest operators - Bass, Allied-Lyons and Whitbread each have more than 4,000 outlets - they have disposed of 11,000 pubs from their estates to comply with government orders. Regional brewers, such as Vaux, Marston and Greene King, have used the opportunity to strengthen their estates, and many of the pubs were sold to individual tenants. But the main structural change has been the entry into the market of independent pub retailing groups. They include former brewers such as Boddington and Greenalls, which three months ago increased its pubs to more than 2,000 with the Pounds 214m takeover of Devenish; Pubmaster, the Brent Walker subsidiary; and a number of entrepreneurial operators, such as Wetherspoon, Regent Inns and Enterprise Inns. The changes have encouraged the spread of retailing skills, that are beginning to improve the prospects of a business that has been badly hit by the recession and changing demographics. GrandMet's disposal of Chef &amp; Brewer, meanwhile, brings more consistency to its recently restated aim of building international branded businesses in food, drinks and retailing, underlined yesterday by its acquisition of Glen Ellen wines in the US. The Pounds 622m cash it receives will reduce its Pounds 3bn debts, cutting gearing from 82 to 63 per cent. The sale of the property interests of Inntrepreneur Estates, the GrandMet/Courage joint venture, will also reduce from Pounds 130m to about Pounds 80m the amount which the partners have to inject into the operation next month to comply with banking covenants. Inntrepreneur, the country's biggest pub operator with 6,800 outlets, is expected to be floated as an independent company as soon as it becomes profitable.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, arrived this afternoon and will meet  President Glavkos Kliridhis tonight.    In a statement after his arrival, Clark said he wants to  discuss with the leaders of the two communities the current  state of the confidence-building measures and other fundamental  issues. Clark was answering a question on the contents of his  mission, given that he is not carrying any letters from UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.</p>

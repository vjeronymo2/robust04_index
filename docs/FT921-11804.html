			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brel lodges faults claim against BR  -Transport BREL, the privatised train-maker once part of British Rail, has lodged a multi-million pound claim against BR for the cost of rectifying faults in trains which Brel itself made. Problems blamed on the innovative design of the Class 158 diesel express trains have badly delayed deliveries and caused trains already supplied to BR to be recalled for costly modifications. At the Commons transport committee yesterday it emerged that Brel's owners - Asea Brown Boveri, Trafalgar House and Brel's management - had won exemption from warranty claims by BR when they bought the company in 1989. BR said in written evidence that Brel had made a 'very substantial claim' for reimbursement of costs incurred in rectifying design defects. Rail analysts say the figure exceeds Pounds 10m.</p>

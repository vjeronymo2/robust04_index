			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Pakistani hostages are freed Pakistani Islamic militants yesterday released about 50 government officials taken hostage in a remote north-western region at the start of a violent campaign for Islamic laws, Reuter reports from Peshawar. The officials, freed at Matta town in the North West Frontier Province, were unhurt, provincial police chief Masud Shah said. The hostages included two judges, a senior local civil servant and a senior police official. Yesterday's release was the largest group of hostages freed after the heavily armed militants began a truce on Sunday on the orders of their leader, Sufi Mohammad, after two days of battles with security forces in which at least 25 people from both sides died. Provincial chief minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, who ordered the enforcement of Islamic laws last Thursday, in an interview published yesterday linked 'foreign involvement' to the militants' action. Last Thursday, the militants killed a provincial parliament member of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party after taking him hostage. Mr Sufi says the demand of his Tehrik Nifaz Shariat-i-Mohammadi organisation has been met and he is satisfied by the Sherpao order. But some local TNSM leaders say they do not trust the government, hinting at a rift in the fundamentalist group. Despite a sharp political polarisation in Pakistan, there has been little sympathy for the militant cause.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Elliott cuts loss to Pounds 3.1m THE reconstructed B Elliott cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 9.37m to Pounds 3.06m in the year to April 2. It turned round from an operating loss of Pounds 1.83m to a profit of Pounds 3.14m before financing costs and exceptional charges. Restructuring involved the complete withdrawal from the traditional machine tool merchanting activities and sale of the largest machine tool manufacturing business. The proposed sale of Philidas (self locking nuts) to reduce borrowings was not concluded and, as a consequence of refinancing, this profitable business was being retained and developed. The group now concentrates on specialist engineering, electrical engineering and machinery. In the year these continuing businesses reported an operating profit of Pounds 3.32m, against Pounds 4.16m, on turnover of Pounds 70.5m. Conversion into preference and ordinary shares of part of the indebtedness to banks and the raising of Pounds 12m reduced indebtedness by Pounds 27m. Borrowings at April 2 stood at Pounds 14m. Losses per share worked through at 43.84p (457.39p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Memorandum Addressed to the Council of Europe by the City </F> of Timisoara"; place and date not given]    [Text] On occasion of the Easter Holiday, the former  sovereign of Romania, King Mihai I, was invited to Timisoara by  his holiness the metropolitan of Banat, the Timisoara  Municipality Council, and by the mayor of the city. The  invitation was based on the fact that King Mihai is the founder  of the Timisoara metropolitan cathedral.    For the third time, the Romanian Government denied King  Mihai  the right to visit Timisoara, this time invoking false security  problems. We wish to notify international public opinion that:    1. Mihai of Romania is a Romanian citizen who was born in  Romania, his parents being Romanian citizens. According to  Romania's current Constitution and the stipulations of the  Universal Declaration on Human Rights, that gesture of the  government is an abuse.    2. Considering that not a single foreign citizen has been  subject to circulation restrictions on the territory of Romania,  the imposing of such restrictions upon a Romanian citizen is an  arbitrary and discriminatory act.    3. The stance adopted by the Romanian Government offends our  dignity as citizens of the city of Timisoara, by the sacrifice  of which in Romania, in December 1989, the way was opened for  liberty and democracy. At the same time, such practice  maintains a state of tension in the country and creates  suspicion that may divide Romanian society and prevent national  reconciliation.    We request that the Council of Europe should discuss in its  special commissions, as well as in its plenary session, the  abuse signaled by us. The attention granted by the Council of  Europe to the present memorandum would represent moral  reparation for us.</p>

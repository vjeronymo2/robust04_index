			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Argus Press deal referred to MMC TRINITY INTERNATIONAL'S proposed Pounds 23m purchase of the 26 local newspapers owned by Argus Press was yesterday referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A reference by the Department of Trade and Industry is automatic under fair trading legislation if the deal involves average paid-for circulation of 500,000 or more on day of publication, unless the business is not viable. Chester-based Trinity, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and the Echo, has been expanding aggressively in the local and regional newspaper market. The company, which owns newspapers in north-west England, north Wales, Canada and the US, last year bought Scottish and Universal Newspapers from Lonrho in a Pounds 45m deal. Since the Argus agreement Trinity has made a Pounds 12.6m recommended cash offer for the Huddersfield Daily Examiner. Although the Argus deal will increase Trinity's presence in the local newspaper market it is likely that it will receive MMC approval.</p>

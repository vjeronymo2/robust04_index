			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has approved plans of another 36 states or  territories to step up use of their National Guard units in fighting drug  trafficking, the Pentagon said. The additional approvals bring to 48 the number  of such plans now in place. The action makes the states eligible for extra  federal funds from a congressional appropriation of $40 million approved last  year to finance such Guard operations. Cheney announced the first approvals  March 30, concentrating then on 12 high-priority border states, including  California. Those 12 states together were authorized to use $11.8 million.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Partnership is unlikely to result in a lessening of competition. The proposed Judgment permits Morton Plant and Mease to consolidate only those services for which consolidation would pose few, if any, competitive concerns. The services eligible for inclusion in the Partnership can be roughly grouped into three categories: outpatient, tertiary, and administrative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A consolidation of Morton Plant's and Mease's outpatient services would pose no significant competitive risk because there are a very large number of providers of such services in North Pinellas County. In addition to general acute care hospitals, other providers of outpatient services include physician offices, clinics, and ambulatory surgery centers. Furthermore, in North Pinellas County it is relatively easy for new providers of outpatient services to enter the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nor would a consolidation of certain tertiary services offered by Morton Plant or Mease threaten competition. For some of these services, a consolidation would have no effect because only one of the hospitals currently provides that service. For example, open-heart surgery is currently provided by Morton Plant, but not by Mease. Even for services in which the hospitals currently compete, persons are typically willing to travel greater distances for highly sophisticated, tertiary-level care than they are for more routine medical care. Therefore, Morton Plant and Mease compete in providing these services in a geographic market much broader than North Pinellas County. For example, the geographic market for level III neonatal care includes at least several major hospitals in South Pinellas County, and the same is true for other tertiary services that the Judgment permits Morton Plant and Mease to consolidate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposed Judgment protects against anticompetitive harm from the joint ownership and operation of certain administrative services. Services such as human resources, information services, accounting, billing, and collection, are only a part of the inputs into Morton Plant's and Mease's provision of acute care services. Currently, Morton Plant and Mease independently decide how to allocate their administrative costs in pricing their acute care services to managed care plans and other health care purchasers, and they will continue to do so under the Judgment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Moreover, the proposed Judgment requires the Partnership to establish protections to ensure that the joint operation of administrative services does not result in any sharing of information such as pricing or managed care contracting for Morton Plant and Mease, thus guarding against the risk of ``spillover'' of competitively sensitive information from the Partnership to the independent hospitals. (Section V(I)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Of course, Morton Plant and Mease also ``compete'' in purchasing these administrative services, but they do so in a geographic market much larger than North Pinellas County. The consolidation would not lessen competition in that market to any substantial degree. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to these protections, the proposed Judgment requires Morton Plant and Mease to market, price and sell all of their services_even those jointly owned and operated through the Partnership_in competition with each other and other hospitals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This ensures that both hospitals will remain as separate and viable competitors and permits them the maximum flexibility in competing for managed care contracts in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The minor exceptions to this would be home health care, home infusion services, durable medical equipment, rehabilitative services, skilled nursing retirement facilities and long term care, for which the markets are very competitive in North Pinellas County.

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Earnings at BCI likely to match year earlier Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Italian bank expected to be privatised next month, should report 1993 net earnings in line with 1992. BCI is not due to release figures about last year's performance until a board meeting next week to examine preliminary parent company results. However, analysts forecast that net profits for the entire group will not differ much from the L218.5bn (Dollars 128m) made in 1992. That prediction, which includes the likelihood of a maintained dividend, comes despite sharply higher provisions and tax charges in 1993. Last year's results are also unlikely to benefit from big extraordinary gains. The loan book at BCI, which lends to some of Italy's biggest companies, has been badly hit by the recession. Prominent among last year's corporate casualties was Ferruzzi, to which the bank is believed to have lent about L600bn. BCI will also face substantially higher taxes because it has now used all the extraordinary tax breaks which boosted earnings in recent years. However, Mr Sergio Siglienti, chairman, said matters were more than compensated by a sharp rise in fee income, reflected in results for the first nine months of 1993, when pre-tax profits soared to L585.3bn from L267.6bn. Fee income had grown 'dramatically,' notably on securities. Mr Siglienti denied the privatisation would be affected by the general elections on March 27. He forecast privatisation would trigger some streamlining of the bank's structure, with the possible removal of one of the bank's three layers of holding companies and a closer relationship with the three small retail banks it controls in Italy. Internationally, he revealed BCI is negotiating to buy out its partners in Banque Sudameris of Paris.</p>

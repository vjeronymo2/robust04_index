			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Fuji faces dumping penalties The US yesterday levied preliminary anti-dumping penalties against Fuji of Japan ranging between 360.95 per cent and 321.23 per cent on colour photographic paper sales into the US, AP-DJ reports from Washington. The decision, which involves punitive tariffs, requires Fuji to post cash or bond equivalents with the US Customs Service pending further review by the Commerce Department. A final ruling on the dumping complaints filed by Eastman Kodak against Fuji photographic paper produced in Japan and the Netherlands must be given by August 18. If the preliminary ruling is upheld, the International Trade Commission will have 45 days in which to decide whether Eastman Kodak has sustained financial injury.</p>

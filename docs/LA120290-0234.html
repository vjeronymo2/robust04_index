			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLACK, CAMP KILPATRICK WIN, 52-20  </P> <P> Although the team is playing its first season of 11-man football, Camp  Kilpatrick is no longer a secret, and neither are running backs Michael Black  and Bobby Wilson.  </P> <P> In attendance at Saturday night's Southern Section Division X semifinal playoff  game were coaches from Montclair Prep, which Camp Kilpatrick will face in the  final on Friday.  </P> <P> Also in the stands were coaches from Dorsey High, the school that figures to  inherit both Black and Wilson when the two are released from Camp Kilpatrick, a  county-run school for juvenile offenders.  </P> <P> After viewing Camp Kilpatrick's 52-20 pasting of Mammoth, the Dorsey staff  walked away quite a bit happier than the folks from Montclair Prep.  </P> <P> Black rushed for a career-high 342 yards in 27 carries and Wilson chipped in  with 92 yards in four carries to lead the Mustangs (9-3-1).  </P> <P> And there was more disconcerting news for ground-oriented Montclair Prep, the  division's top-seeded team: Mammoth (10-3) was held to just 61 rushing yards.  </P> <P> "We've been fortunate in the last few weeks to have been fairly successful  early in the game," first-year Camp Kilpatrick Coach Sean Porter said.  </P> <P> Ditto Black, who earlier in the year rushed for 324 yards in a game. His mark  Saturday is the highest among Valley-area backs this season.  </P> <P> The first half was a game of can-you-top-this. Black had gained 211 yards by  halftime and Wilson, a sophomore, already had scored on a one-yard run and an  80-yard kickoff return.  </P> <P> Camp Kilpatrick took a 14-0 lead behind the outside speed of Black, who broke  loose for a 59-yard gain on his first carry to set up the Mustangs' first  score.  </P> <P> Kenneth Young scored on a seven-yard pass from Rafael Sarabia and Wilson  scooted in for a two-point conversion and a 14-0 lead.  </P> <P> Mammoth struck back with the home run, however, when Daron Dondero hit receiver  Mike Benson for an 80-yard bomb to make it 14-6. Wilson answered with an 80 of  his own, when he took the ensuing kickoff at the 20 returned it for a touchdown  and a 20-6 lead.  </P> <P> Black surpassed the 300-yard plateau on a 55-yard scoring run with 1:31 to  play. Wilson also added a 55-yard scoring run in the second half.  </P></p>

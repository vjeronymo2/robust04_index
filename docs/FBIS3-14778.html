Twenty independent candidates and 1,022  candidates from 13 parties and blocs contend for 104 seats in a  new parliament.    Numerous public opinion polls taken on the eve of the  elections forecast a convincing victory of the Agrarian  Democratic Party headed by Parliament Speaker Petr Lucinschi.    Sociologists' view is that success is also expected to be  achieved by the Socialist, Social Democratic, and Republican  Parties, which, like the Agrarians, strive for Moldova's  independence, a fair solution to the Gagauz and Dniester region  problems, and for stronger ties with the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    They will be opposed by movements which believe that Moldova  must unite with Romania. Those movements have a following  despite the unpopularity of such slogans in Moldova.</p>

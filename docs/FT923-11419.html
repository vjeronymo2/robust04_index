			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Hill &amp; Smith tumbles to Pounds 1.2m midway Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, the West Midlands-based steel fabricator and stockholder, blamed the recession as interim profits tumbled from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 1.24m before tax. The outcome for the six months to March 31 was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 212,000 relating to losses incurred by Tipton Steel Stock Holders (Stoke) which was sold after the period-end. Profits for the first half of the previous year amounted to Pounds 2.42m. Mr John Silk, chairman, said the winter months were 'particularly severe' in the engineering, construction and building sectors. The group had strived to increase market share without sacrificing margins, he added. A cost cutting programme led to reduced stock levels and meant the loss of a further 7 per cent of the workforce over the period. Turnover fell to Pounds 31.8m (Pounds 38.7m). The interim dividend is 2.1p, compared with an adjusted 1.91p. Earnings were 2.98p (5.74p).</p>

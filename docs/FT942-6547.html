			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Sport: Main events WEDNESDAY: For four days Epsom Downs, just outside London, will be covered in Fortnum and Mason hampers, marquees, a fun-fair and gipsy caravans. The Epsom meeting opens with Derby day and finishes on Saturday, when the Oaks race for fillies will be run. THURSDAY: England take on New Zealand in the first cricket Test at Trent Bridge. After his ordeal against the West Indian fast bowlers over the winter, Mike Atherton will start his first full home series as England captain more worried about bouncers from the selection committee than on the pitch. New Zealand, for all their youthful promise, are one of the weaker cricket nations. SATURDAY: England's rugby side faces South Africa in Pretoria. England lost their first two provincial matches and barely won the third. But France did the same last year and then won the Test series.</p>

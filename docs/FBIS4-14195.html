			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanon was officially invited by the United States,  Russia, and Egypt to take part in the Middle East multilateral  talks on refugees scheduled to be held in Cairo on 10-12 May.  The invitation was conveyed by the American, Russian, and  Egyptian ambassadors to Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan, the Foreign  Ministry secretary general, today.    The Egyptian ambassador said after the meeting that Lebanon  should always take part in the Middle East peace negotiations  because Lebanon is a principal, important, and effective party  in the peace process.    The Russian ambassador expressed the conviction that Lebanon  will take part in the multilateral negotiations, noting that  Lebanon is entitled to choose the stance it likes. The Russian  envoy said it would be in Lebanon's interest to take part in  these negotiations.    The U.S. ambassador said that Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is unlikely to visit Lebanon, adding that the  ongoing talks could achieve progress.    Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz today received a written  message from his Sudanese counterpart, Husayn Abu-Salih. The  message was forwarded by the Sudanese ambassador to Lebanon. It  contains the Sudanese Government's thanks to Minister Buwayz and  the Lebanese Government for their support for Sudan during the  Arab League Council's meetings in March, when Minister Buwayz  backed a decision condemning plans to partition Sudan.</p>

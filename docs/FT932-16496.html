			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Ramos attacked over privatisation of Philippine Airlines A leading senator has attacked President Fidel Ramos over the privatisation of Philippine Airlines and said he has a moral obligation to regain control of the company, AP reports from Manila. Sen Arturo Tolentino said in a weekend speech the airline had no domestic competition and that privatising it had created a giant monopoly when the government wanted to reduce monopoly power. The government sold majority int-erest in the airline to a consor-tium, PR Holdings, last year. In February, PR Holdings was taken over by Mr Lucio Tan in a bitter proxy fight.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold subcabinet-level talks for two days from Wednesday on  two areas of trade connected with government procurement, a  Japanese official said Tuesday [21 June].    A planned meeting here between Japanese Deputy Foreign  Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and U.S. Deputy Trade Representative  Charlene Barshefsky will take up issues that have not been  covered in recent working-level procurement trade talks, the  official at the Foreign Ministry told reporters.    "Quantitative criteria" as a tool to assess Japan's  government procurement market is among the remaining issues put  on hold until the coming high-level talks, the official said.    The official was briefing reporters on Tuesday's  working-level meeting on medical equipment trade.    Trade in medical equipment, covered in the discussions on  government procurement along with telecom trade, is one of the  three priority fields under the bilateral trade "framework"  negotiations launched in July last year.    Working-level talks on telecom trade were held in Tokyo last  Friday, with the most sensitive issue of how to set  "quantitative criteria" also held over for the coming high-level  meeting.    The working-level medical equipment talks, shortened to a  one-day session from the originally scheduled two-day meeting,  were held in "a good admosphere," the official said.    Tuesday's talks were devoted to explaining Japanese-proposed  steps contained in a March market-opening package as a way to  enhance foreign access to Japan's medical equipment market,  according to the official said.</p>

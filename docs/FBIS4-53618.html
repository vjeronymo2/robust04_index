			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 2 May that the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] mapped out a package  of reform programs for the current food control system three  years ago to overhaul the current food control system which puts  the production, distribution, and sales of rice under the  government's direct control, switching them to the "government's  indirect control" and limiting the government's role to the  stockpiling and quarantine of rice. The Agricultural  Administration Council is expected to hold full-fledged debates  on the food control system on the eve of Japan's partial opening  of its rice market. Although Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato has said "The government still  intends to keep the current food control system in place," the  package of reform programs for the food control system is likely  to greatly affect the debates.    The package of reform programs mapped out by MAFF is  comprised of a "reform program for rice management policy" and a  "reform program for the tariff system on imported rice."  According to an informed source, MAFF mapped out the package in  late 1991 when pressure was building on Japan to open its rice  market at agricultural negotiations under the Uruguay Round of  GATT. The final draft agreement put forth by then GATT Director  General Dunkel included the principle of "tariffication without  exception" which aimed to replace all import restrictions with  tariffication.    The package of reform programs that SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained  on 2 May gives a "very dire picture" of the current rice  production in Japan and points out that "the people ask the  government to provide a smooth supply of rice in response to  changes in the demands of consumers for rice and to deal  properly with the growing trade of rice in black markets." The  package stresses that its primary objective is to "take  advantage of rice tariffication to overhaul the current food  control system and build a new rice control system under which  Japanese rice growers enthusiastically work in paddy fields and  the needs of consumers are met."    Specifically, the package calls for a full relaxation of the  current paddy-field reduction system (production adjustment) and  stresses the need to transfer the body responsible for enforcing  the system from the government to such producer organizations as  the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperative  Associations. The package also calls for the creation of a  system under which rice growers themselves decide whether to  reduce their paddy fields, and under which there is a "price  guarantee," with the area of paddy field and the variety of rice  established to get rice growers to resume production. The  package calls for the creation of another system under which the  difference between the "standard sale price" and actual sale  price by rice growers is paid to rice growers.    The package of reform programs points out the need to  replace  the current license system with a simple application system for  collectors and wholesalers in the distribution system and to  liberalize the distribution of rice by abolishing various  restrictions. The package calls for introducing futures  transactions in rice wholesale markets that open under the  government's licenses, but makes it mandatory for wholesalers to  obtain licenses from the government to participate in the rice  wholesale markets.    The package of reform programs aims to largely acknowledge  the freedom to produce rice, the freedom to sell it, and the  freedom to buy it on the principle of market and competition by  overhauling the current food control system which makes it a  principle for the government to control the rice.    Under a new rice management policy, the government will only  work out the basic plan for production and distribution of rice,  and its stockpiling and quarantine. The package of reform  programs, however, acknowledges the government's management of  rice in case of an emergency situation like the recent rice  crisis following the poor 1993 rice crop.</p>

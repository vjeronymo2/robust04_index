			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee market hits 4-year high Coffee producers had the satisfaction this week of seeing the initial target of their export retention scheme achieved. On Thursday the retention indicator price for arabica varieties (grown mostly in Latin America) exceeded 75 US cents a pound, triggering the reduction of the amount of beans they are committed to put into storage from 20 per cent of export shipments to 10 per cent. Further encouragement was given by the fact that the news appeared to do no damage to market sentiment on either side of the Atlantic. On the day of the cut the July futures price on the New York futures market - which trades arabicas - rose by 0.40 to 85.05 cents a pound, while at the London Commodity exchange - which trades the coarser robusta type, grown chiefly in Africa - the May futures price ended up Dollars 13 at Dollars 1,360 a tonne. During the day the London price had touched Dollars 1,368 a tonne, the highest since the abandonment of the International Coffee Organisation's export quota system in 1989 triggered a market collapse. Some traders suggested the market had become 'overbought' as the May price rose Dollars 26 to Dollars 1,358 a tonne over the week, but they suggested any retracement would be relatively brief. With consumer stocks continuing to decline, most saw the market extending the 48 per cent advance it has registered since the retention scheme was agreed last July. The silver market also reached the highest level for more than four years this week, as US investment funds continued to buy and speculators were thought to be targetting the Dollars 6 a troy ounce barrier for spot metal. But the technical chart barrier at Dollars 5.75 an ounce must be overcome first, and this week's upsurge stopped just a quarter of a cent short of that before edging back to Dollars 5.70 1/2 , up 29 cents overall. Gold fed off silver's strength, and as Korean tensions were added to concern about the pre-election situation in South Africa its price pushed above Dollars 490 an ounce to two-month peaks on both Thursday and Friday. But having failed to hold its gains on either occasion it closed relatively tamely yesterday at Dollars 389.40 an ounce, up Dollars 3.20 on the week. Platinum was also sensitive to situation in South Africa, and particularly in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, where around 20 per cent of the white metal is produced. After putting on Dollars 4 in each of the past two days the London price was fixed yesterday at Dollars 408.75 an ounce, up Dollars 8.35 on the week. At the London Metal Exchange copper and aluminium prices surrendered some of last week's gains, the former ending Dollars 11.75 down at Dollars 1,956.75 a tonne and the latter Dollars 14 down at Dollars 1,332.50 a tonne, both prices being for three months delivery. But copper had ended the week with its tail up. After finding firm support below Dollars 1,930 yesterday morning it climbed strongly, helped by another fall in LME warehouse stocks. Aluminium also found support below Thursday's closing level, which enabled it to put on Dollars 6. Copper's rally helped to steady other LME base metals contracts yesterday, notably lead, which early on had been moving closer to a widely-predicted test of support at Dollars 450 a tonne for three months metal. After dipping to Dollars 460.25 at one stage the price recovered to Dollars 465.75, up 25 cents on the day but down Dollars 14 on the week.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium           +500 to 2,598,650 Aluminium alloy     -360 to    45,460 Copper            -4,000 to   514,975 Lead                +550 to   332,100 Nickel              +138 to   136,338 Zinc              +5,775 to 1,097,225 Tin                 +335 to    23,915  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / A pill to beat MF: The EU's search for a constitution is just beginning Maastricht fatigue (MF) is endemic throughout the European Union, though observable in its most acute form among British members of parliament. The main symptom is an inability or unwillingness to listen to any proposition intended to improve the institutions or processes of the Union. Specialists differ about the precise causes of the disease and about the treatment. One school of thought sees MF as a normal reaction of the human organism to prolonged exposure to the subject in question, and recommends that the patient be shielded as far as possible from further exposure. The other holds that MF is caused by the form that discussion about European institutions took between about mid-1991 and autumn 1993. According to this view, while the reaction may indeed be 'normal' it is not healthy and, if allowed to develop, may have dangerous effects. This school favours a homeopathic remedy: the source of the trouble should be used as an antidote but in carefully adjusted doses, enabling the patient to develop appropriate antibodies. I hope the second school is right, because the idea that the next bout of argument about Euro-institutions can be put off, or confined to a minimal convulsion which no one will notice, is surely an illusion. Negotiations now in progress between the EU and four applicant countries - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden - will produce, within a few months, a new treaty of accession, requiring ratification not only in the new member states but also in the existing ones. And the Maastricht treaty itself provides for its own revision at an intergovernmental conference (IGC) in 1996. That, too, will produce changes which will have to be ratified. It would make sense to telescope these two processes. The 1996 IGC could be brought forward and the applicant countries could be invited to take part in the conference but to delay putting their accession to the vote until the results of the meeting were known. Then both old and new members would be taking a decision, in late 1995, about the institutions of a wider Union which their governments would all have agreed on. That idea is too radical for the present mood of European governments. They prefer to negotiate enlargement quickly - obliging the new members to join the EU as it now stands - and then wait until 1996 to discuss such minimal adjustments as seem unavoidable. This thinking is a classic symptom of MF, but it is also the thinking that produced Maastricht in the first place. In 1991 governments avoided any radical reform of EC institutions, particularly in the direction of greater democracy. They knew that, in a reformed system, states with larger populations would have greater influence and that this would be difficult for smaller states to accept. But Danish voters suspected (rightly) that such a reform was being planned behind their backs, and this was one of the reasons they voted No in June 1992. Now, by putting off reform until enlargement has gone through, governments are nourishing the same suspicion among voters in the candidate countries, many of whom are now swinging against the EU. Attempting to secure a Yes vote, governments in those countries will promise to block any reform that reduces their share of influence once they are in. That ensures that the 1996 IGC will be confrontational and sterile. Perhaps the price of joining a workable and democratic union of 16 is simply too high for voters in some applicant countries to accept. If so, it would be better to establish that fact before the final decision on enlargement is taken, rather than put them in a position where they can only defend their sovereignty by making the union unworkable. But there is a chance they would not come to that conclusion if the reform proposed were sufficiently radical. Its object should be to make the central institutions of the union strong enough to take effective action on matters of genuine common interest, but to restrain them from interfering unnecessarily with the lives of citizens in matters which could be dealt with at the level of member states (or lower). This should be done in a document which non-lawyers could understand, arrived at through a public debate in which ordinary people and their elected representatives would participate. Such is the object of A Proposal for a European Constitution*, published last week. Sadly, I hear this document is being rubbished in Brussels as an 'Anglo-Saxon' product, though only one of its 13 authors is a native English-speaker, while French and Germans make up the majority. No doubt Mr Jacques Delors's entourage dislike it for being permissive rather than prescriptive on matters social and monetary, and for reserving 'to the member states, or to the people' those rights and powers not delegated 'expressly or by necessary implication' to the union. The authors wisely avoid the word 'federal' but it is clear they have drawn inspiration from federal constitutions, including that of the US. In the nature of things few people will agree with everything they suggest. (I, for instance, would take issue with their claim to be defending the separation of powers when they allow the council of ministers to remain the central body, both executive and legislative.) But in their central object of launching an informed public debate before next summer's European elections, and well ahead of the 1996 IGC, they surely deserve to succeed. If there is a homeopathic remedy for MF, this might be it. *By the European Policy Forum, 20 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AA. Price Pounds 25.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, 18 May (EFE) -- Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo said that his 5-day official visit to South Korea, which  concludes today, has been a total "success." Cavallo said that  trade and investments between the two nations will increase as a  result of his visit.    The economy minister and Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong  Sun-yong on 17 May signed an agreement for the reciprocal  protection of investments in both countries.    Cavallo said that Argentine export of products such as  fruit,  fish, leather, oils, and beef to Korea, which have recently  dropped, will increase significantly in the future.    On 16 May Cavallo met with Deputy Prime Minister Chong  Chae-sok and other high-ranking South Korean Chamber of Commerce  and Industry officials. Minister Cavallo also met with the  directors of large South Korean conglomerates such as the car  manufacturers "Hyundai" and "Daewoo" in order to discuss  investment opportunities in Argentina with them.    The Argentine minister also talked about the possibility of  exploiting Argentina's natural resources with representatives of  companies such as "Samsung," the largest South Korean  manufacturer of household appliances, and "Lucky-Goldstar,"  among others.    Cavallo denied reports that Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and  Uruguay have decided to postpone for three months an agreement  on free trade that was scheduled to become effective in January  1995.    Argentina exports mainly agricultural products and raw  materials to South Korea, and imports equipment.    Last year the South American country exported a total of $66  million worth of products to South Korea, some 42 percent less  than the previous year, while Argentina imported South Korean  products for a total of $535 million, 15 percent more than the  year before.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Ex-union chief investigated Mr Giorgio Benevenuto, a former union leader who briefly led Italy's Socialists after Mr Bettino Craxi was forced to step down in February 1993, was told yesterday he was under investigation for alleged corruption related to overseas aid contracts. Milan magistrates, meanwhile, have asked for passports to be withdrawn from 22 former politicians, mostly members of the previous Andreotti government and former party leaders. They include Mr Craxi, who is currently in temporary 'exile' at his Tunis holiday home. Robert Graham</p>

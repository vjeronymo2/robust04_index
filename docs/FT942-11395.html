			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (24): Britain: taking initiatives Opportunities to produce international consultancy work funded by multilateral lending agencies are being seized by UK firms. In addition to consulting engineers - which have long formed the backbone of the UK consulting sector - new markets are emerging for firms which can provide expertise in a range of disciplines, including architecture, electronics, urban and rural development, agriculture and human resource management. Still more opportunities exist for consultancy firms working in EU programmes, such as Phare and Tacis, where a multilateral approach was considered the most effective way to give technical assistance and know-how to the new democracies in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet bloc. The UK consultancy sector generates some Dollars 2bn each year in invisible earnings and evidence that some of the business comes from firms successful in bidding for work funded by multilateral lending agencies is demonstrated by the sector's share in key markets. In procurement work financed through the World Bank, for example, UK firms are among the top providers of consultancy services. Tony Boam, director of the British Consultants Bureau which promotes UK consultancy firms abroad, points out that UK consultants have featured strongly in a large number of Tacis initiatives and, at one time, accounted for 50 per cent of Phare projects. Consultancy firms are naturally reticent when it comes to divulging their recipes for successful bidding strategies, but there is clearly a store of commonly used ingredients. Careful preparatory work is essential: Scanning publications such as the United Nations' Development Business, the World Bank's Monthly Operational Summary of Proposed Projects or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Procurement Opportunities; Registering on consultants' rosters maintained by the funding agencies and keeping abreast of their activities; Researching the local markets in which opportunities might occur; Establishing which local organisations will ultimately commission work; If possible, visiting these organisations. With the exception of some small-scale consultancies, the local organisation decides which firm will be commissioned, although the multilateral lending agencies or EU programme administrators define the method of selection and may influence the decision-making process. Some larger consultancy firms have opened local offices in markets where opportunities are likely to arise. Being close to the customer strengthens a bid and if it is proposed that local as well as UK staff are used and, even better, trained in new skills, then the commissioning organisation may well feel there is added value in such a bid. Howard Moody works for the consultancy firm Eastern European Enterprise in the Czechinvest initiative within the Phare programme which aims to attract foreign direct investment to the Czech Republic. As one of three UK consultants working alongside 15 Czech nationals, Mr Moody feels that a characteristic of UK consultants is their ability to transfer knowledge to their national colleagues in a way that is applicable in a local context. 'The common thread among UK consultants is that they are very practical, able to get their sleeves rolled up and work alongside nationals . . . unless a consultant has practical experience, forget it.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Beijing] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 22 January that North Korea  recently established a South Korean affairs operation team  within the Workers' Party of Korea, which is operating  successfully in large- scale operations in China to attract ROK  students, traders, tourists, and businessmen who have visited  China frequently since the establishment of ROK-Sino diplomatic  relations in August 1992.    A well-informed source in North Korea's situation in China  said: North Korea's large-scale operation organization, which is  directed by the South Korean affairs operation team, is briskly  conducting operations mainly in three districts -- Northeastern  area, including Yinji City; Beijing; and Shanghai-- where ROK  citizens have visited frequently. North Korea's operation  agents are attracting ROK citizens by making pro-North Korean  compatriots responsible for a small operation base.</p>

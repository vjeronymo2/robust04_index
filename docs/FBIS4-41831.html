			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yermolin: "Budget Law Adopted. Army's </F> Interests Unaffected"]    [Text] It has happened: The State Duma has adopted the  Law on the Federal Budget for 1994 in its entirety. In the  section which concerns us, the military, it can be said that  nothing has changed. In point of fact, the debate over defense  expenditure was closed back at the second reading. But certain  details will probably be of interest to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's  readers.    Individually, the results of the vote were as follows: 278  for, 80 against, with eight abstentions; 89 deputies did not  vote [figures as published do not correspond with referent  item]. By comparison with the second reading the number who  said "no" to this budget doubled. Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of  the State Duma Defense Committee, explained to me that "the  abstentions and nonvotes are also votes against. That is how we  will look at it. In total 177 did not agree with the government  distribution of expenditure and revenue (and therefore with the  reduced defense budget)."    As for the vote by factions, 81.8 percent of the Russian  Agrarian Party, 0 percent of "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy Bloc], 64.1  percent of "Russia's Choice," 73.3 percent of the Democratic  Party of Russia, 10.9 percent of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia, 79.3 percent of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord], 90.9 percent of "Women of Russia," 73.1 percent of "New  Regional Policy," and 56.2 percents of deputies not belonging to  factions voted for the budget.    By comparison with the second reading (compare the  publication of the results of individual voting in KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA for 16 June) Zhirinovskiy's party has radically changed  its stance -- the majority of those who voted for the budget at  the second reading today voted against.    Sergey Yushenkov told me that in conversation with him  Russian President Boris Yeltsin had confirmed his recent press  conference statement that the Army will be financially "topped  up" from extrabudgetary funds. The only issue now is to ensure  that the money is transferred from the Ministry of Finances to  the Ministry of Defense promptly and under the requisite  controls.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Northern League Presents Government </F> Platform"]    [Text] Milan, 27 Feb (ANSA) -- The Northern League on  Sunday [27 February] presented a 40-page government platform  based on free market policies and regional federalism.    The main points of the program are the following:    Economy - The ratio between the deficit and public debt must  be lower than the ratio between the increase in gross domestic  product and the GDP itself, states the document, adding that the  two main lines of approach are: transferring current public  spending to investments, "reducing waste and useless expenses";  restructuring of the public sector, reducing government  intervention and favoring private initiatives, especially  through: an overhaul of the public employment sector, a "radical  change" in the state's shareholdings in industry, privatizations  and so-called fiscal federalism.    Labor -- Unemployment is "the real problem," according to  the  League, which is pushing for more flexible working hours.    Fiscal federalism -- The two key elements of this catchword  platform are giving regional administrations total freedom in  setting local taxes and giving the same administrations spending  responsibility, in accordance with revenues. The League also  wants a reduction in personal income taxes and the total number  of taxes and simpler fiscal procedures.    Industrial policy -- A "clear distinction" must be made,  according to the League, between "development in the north and  development in the south." The foundation of Italian industry  must remain small- and medium-sized businesses, which must be  helped grow by forming consortiums.    Immigration -- More restrictive legislation must replace  existing laws that, according to the League's thinking, make it  too easy for foreigners to enter the country and obtain  residence permits. Immigration must be stopped and foreigners  (presumably from Third World countries) must be allowed to enter  only if they have work permits.    Social Security -- The League wants to set up a regional  pension system and wants pensions to be calculated according to  individual payments.    The South -- The League wants all state aid to the poorer  Mezzogiorno [southern] regions stopped and development of a  region's resources to be commensurate with a drop in the crime  rate.    Education -- Authority must be taken from the ministry and  given to the regions, with the central government responsible  only for coordinating the national Conference of regional  authorities.    Justice -- The judiciary must stand in the middle ground  "between the state and society," the program states, adding that  trials must no longer be led by more than one judge.    Defense -- The Armed Forces must be overhauled and the  present draft system must be replaced with a mixed  volunteer-draftee Army. Spending must be reduced and investments  increased for the volunteer Army and technological updating.    Mass media -- The League wants changes mostly in television  and wants to privatize the public network, RAI. "Clear" rules  must be made "to protect both broadcasters and citizens."    Healthcare -- Regions must be given full autonomy, including  in running hospitals, and general family practitioners must be  given a larger role in the system.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MAN, OLD ATTITUDE WILL RULE IN SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> In the nasty climate that is South African politics, Pieter W. Botha's sudden  resignation has quelled the thunderstorm over which National Party oligarch  will run the government. Unfortunately there is no sign things will get  substantially better soon. Frederik W.de Klerk, Botha's interim successor --  who appears certain to be elected president after whites choose their new  Parliament in September -- inherits a country that has been in a debilitating  crisis for more than a decade. De Klerk enters office with countless problems  and three assets: relief, expectations and opportunity.  </P> <P> Everyone is happy to see Botha go. His irrationality and tantrums are  legendary. Botha screamed at Cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors and  visiting U.S. congressmen. He once told his own vice president to "shut up" at  a meeting where Botha personally fired the director-general of the South  African Broadcasting Corp. for straying from his prescribed line for TV news.  He told Cape Town's Catholic cardinal to "listen or get out" when the cardinal  asked Botha to stop human-rights violations by the police and army. Given  Botha's close connections to South Africa's dreaded intelligence and security  forces -- forged during 14 years as defense minister -- his ire was terrifying.  Few had the guts to tell Botha the truth, and he clung to a dream world where  he relied on thugs, rogues and political alchemists to respond to the demand  for black rights, the most pressing issue confronting the South African  government.  </P> <P> Botha never accepted the fact that the majority of black South Africans support  the African National Congress, he never comprehended the effects of burning  barricades in Soweto on the decisions of bank presidents in Zurich and New  York. Botha also reserved a special contempt for foreigners who sought to be  involved in South African affairs. Two exceptions were British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but Reagan fell from grace after the U.S.  President imposed mild sanctions on South Africa in 1985, to ward off harsher  measures then gaining support in Congress. Botha still believes Reagan betrayed  him.  </P> <P> In August, 1985, as international financiers and Western governments waited for  Botha to deliver a speech drafted by the South African Foreign Affairs Ministry  to restore confidence in South Africa's stability, Botha threw away the text  and declared he would keep South Africa on a course of repression and  segregation. The next year, Botha promulgated state-of-emergency laws that the  police and army used brutally in an attempt to kill off support for the ANC and  its internal allies in the United Democratic Front. They failed, and the  effects of the state of emergency, still in force, were to strengthen the  resolve of anti-apartheid dissidents, to increase black support for the ANC and  to prolong the political stalemate while the government refused to talk to  legitimate black leaders.  </P> <P> Meanwhile large sums of money continue to flow out of South Africa, and no one  will lend South Africans capital needed to modernize industries and put  employment opportunities in sync with population growth. Black unemployment is  already dangerously high -- more than 60% in some areas. Blacks are  increasingly being politicized and activated against the government because of  their desperate economic conditions. Ironically whites, whom Botha claimed to  protect, are also pinched by the deteriorating economy, while feeling ever more  threatened by the country's permanent political crisis. Botha saw his role as  that of a parochial, white Afrikaaner politician. He leaves South Africa in a  terrible mess.  </P> <P> Many people expect, or hope, De Klerk will find a way out of the mess.  Principal among them is Thatcher, who met with De Klerk in London last month  and told him it is getting tougher everyday for her to defend South Africa from  those in the European Community and Commonwealth who want to punish Pretoria  for its treatment of blacks. De Klerk, for his part, probably responded by  assuring Thatcher of his plans eventually to release ANC leader Nelson Mandela  and to enter into negotiations with blacks.  </P> <P> What is less likely is that De Klerk could have told Thatcher he is prepared to  allow blacks equal political rights with whites. De Klerk is a segregationist  who wants to maintain white privilege despite spiraling political and economic  costs. He is solidly within the National Party right wing that hopes to attract  blacks away from the ANC by imposing black quislings on the black masses as  "leaders" and sponsoring public works projects in areas where blacks live. This  will never succeed. Similarly, De Klerk opposes admitting blacks into a  national Parliament on a one person-one vote basis. When he told Thatcher  recently that he will seek a system of government in a South Africa where no  racial group will be able to dominate any other, Thatcher reportedly  interjected impatiently: "What are you, afraid the blacks will do to you what  you did to them?"  </P> <P> Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes  repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years  ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was  fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government  to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that  the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in  close touch despite their differing politics.  </P> <P> De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president  above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious  circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC  has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals  outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even  more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each  other about how they would relate during negotiations.  </P> <P> Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such  negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at  a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South  Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the  state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the  National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it  was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling  Namibian independence to South African whites.  </P> <P> Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to  arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the  steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party  hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A  group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk  when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening  patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the  crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: "Gentlemen, I am prepared to  accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as  it keeps the National Party in power." If this is indeed De Klerk's goal, God  help South Africa.  </P></p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Gonzalez haunted by anti-Basque operations The shadowiest episode of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's tenure of office has returned 10 years later to haunt Spain's prime minister, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. How much did he and his government know about an undercover war fought by French and Portuguese mercenaries, who styled themselves as GAL, the Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, against members of Eta, the Basque separatist organisation, in south west France between 1983, the year after Mr Gonzalez took power, and 1986? It was then that the picturesque villages and towns of France's Cote Basque, just across the border from Spain and long a safe haven zone for Eta members, were wracked by a shooting and bombing campaign that ended as abruptly as it had started. The events are now being relived in a legal investigation that has severely embarrassed Mr Gonzalez and threatens to rock his government. Eta was at the time extremely active and the mysterious GAL suddenly appeared on the scene to carry the separatist violence into France. Every terrorist action in Spain extracted, within days, its retribution with a tit-for-tat incident in St Jean-de-Luz, Biarritz, Hendaye and other locations across the border. The undercover war ceased when, in a reversal of its previous policy, the French authorities began to round up Eta suspects and hand them over directly to Spanish police. Eta continues its violence to this day but the Cote Basque is no longer its sanctuary. In all GAL claimed 23 fatal victims, among them several leading Eta members. Between 1987 and 1988 courts in France and in Portugal brought charges against more than 20 GAL members some of whom helped to identify Spanish policemen Mr Jose Amedo and Mr Michel Dominguez, who were then attached to an intelligence unit in the Basque city of Bilbao. In 1991 Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez received long prison terms after a Madrid court upheld evidence that they had recruited gunmen in mercenary circles and organised them into the GAL death squad. The court absolved the administration of any involvement in GAL's sinister activities and Mr Gonzalez said at the time there 'is no proof and never will be' incriminating his government. This week the investigating judge who brought the two policeman to court, and who decided in September to re-opened the dirty war case, has indicted and committed to prison the director general of state security between 1984 and 1986 and two former senior counter-terrorism officers on charges that they created GAL. Yesterday the respected Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia headlined a report on its front page saying that the legal probe, conducted by Madrid high court judge Baltasar Garzon would extend up through the administration hierarchy to include Mr Jose Barrionuevo, a stalwart of Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party, who was interior minister between 1982 and 1988. The government's chief spokesman has said the indictments had 'surprised' the government but that it would maintain a 'prudent silence' over judge Garzon's investigations. Mr Barrionuevo has not remained silent. He has visited Mr Julian Sancristobal, the former security boss, in prison and in a succession of statements he has said he stands fully by his former aide and the other former counter-terrorism chiefs. In a radio interview Mr Barrionuevo rhetorically asked whether in other countries that faced a terrorism threat such as that posed by Eta 'people who fought against that terrorism with considerable personal sacrifice would be treated as they are here.' The problem that Mr Barrionuevo, and possibly Mr Gonzalez himself, face is that if there was a GAL cover-up, it is now, for two reasons, likely to be blown wide open. One is that Judge Garzon, Spain's foremost legal celebrity, is a persistent investigator who is said by his supporters to be 'a man with a mission' and who is accused of 'wanting to settle scores' by associates of Mr Barrionuevo. In 1993 he hung up his judge's toga to run on Mr Gonzalez's ticket in the general elections and was given a senior job in the interior ministry. Later judge Garzon resigned his parliamentary seat to resume his legal career saying the government was not doing enough about corruption. The other reason is that Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez, who were transferred to an open prison in July as part of a partial amnesty package that involved jailed Eta members, have decided to co-operate fully with judge Garzon following his decision to resume the investigation into GAL. The two former policemen were questioned at length last week by the judge and they were subsequently cross-examined together with Mr Sancristobal and the other indicted former security chiefs. Yesterday Judge Garzon, in a further twist to the GAL scandal, ordered the indefinite release from prison of Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez, saying he wished to safeguard their security.</p>

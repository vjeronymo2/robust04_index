			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / The pertinent fears of 'apartheid's children': How a conservative alliance has highlighted the key issue facing South Africa's constitution writers IT WAS no roll call of honour. Indeed, some commentators called it an unholy alliance of apartheid's children, the five leaders of South Africa's new conservative Freedom Alliance facing the press together for the first time. They posed for their team photo earlier this month in a nondescript Pretoria hotel, in front the three black leaders, chief minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi of Kwazulu, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo of the Ciskei, President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana, and behind them the two Afrikaner leaders, Mr Ferdie Hartzenberg, leader of the Conservative Party, and General Constand Viljoen of the Afrikaner Volksfront. Many wrote it off disparagingly as stricken at birth by internally contradictory policies. When, however, only a few days after the alliance's formation, President F W de Klerk told the Cape congress of the National party that a referendum might be necessary to break an impending constitutional impasse, this strange union began to appear in a different light. Taken together the two events have brought into focus the key constitutional conundrum facing South Africa: how to reconcile the power of the majority with the fears of minorities. This issue has always been at the heart of the constitutional debate. What is now clearer than ever is that, despite nearly two years of negotiations, it remains fundamentally unresolved. The most obvious symptom of this is the alliance itself, representing a considerable body of conservative opinion, which stands outside and wholly opposed to the Multi-Party Negotiating Forum (MPNF) where the country's constitutional talks are being held. As President de Klerk said, the negotiating process has become bogged down and needs to be revived. 'It cannot continue like this. Our country cannot afford that negotiations lose their momentum. There is no question of turning around.' What recent events have made clear is that there are only two real options. Either the government and the ANC, the dominant players at the constitutional talks, are going to have to make significant concessions in this next few weeks on the issue of a more federal system - which the Freedom Alliance has made a central plank of its demands - to bring the alliance back on board; or the government and the ANC are going to press ahead without them. The problem with the latter course is that it would require a referendum, in which the MPNF obtained commanding public support, to legitimise it. The ANC, after initially making supportive noises, has said it does not support a referendum, apparently believing that for the ANC and Mr de Klerk's NP to be seen supporting the same issue would be to lend the NP undeserved credibility in the run-up to elections. How to keep negotiations moving, preferably with, but possibly without, the alliance is sure to be the main subject of discussion at the two-day retreat where government and ANC negotiators are currently locked away. To date the government has laid more stress on trying to accommodate the alliance, while the ANC has been uncompromising in its commitment to honouring existing timetables, in terms of which all outstanding constitutional issues must be resolved by November 5. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said on Monday that if the Freedom Alliance was not on board by then, the boat would leave without them. Those commentators who believe the current draft constitution is still far from federal, and who take the disruptive potential of the alliance more seriously, take a more conciliatory line. Among them is Professor Lawrence Schlemmer of the Human Sciences Research Council and South Africa's pre-eminent pollster. He says the Freedom Alliance probably now enjoys about the same level of support as the NP, giving it a claim as the country's second-largest political grouping after the ANC. Recent polling data suggests the ANC would win 50-67 per cent of a popular vote, while the NP is in the 12-17 per cent range. Prof Schlemmer believes the Freedom Alliance needs to be taken seriously because its decision to negotiate as a single bloc gives it considerable leverage compared with when most or all of its constituents were negotiating on an individual basis and were susceptible to being played off against each other. He says it is a much more formidable grouping than in its earlier incarnations when it was little more than a loose assortment of parties that had something to lose. Now, argues Professor Schlemmer, South Africa has seen the emergence of a 'minority-based political position'. He disagrees with those who say the alliance is an artificial construct. 'It has a very, very coherent position. It is the minority rights position.' There are many who caution against premature efforts to bludgeon the alliance into line through a referendum. The newspaper Business Day argued recently: 'A referendum majority, however large, will not shield the winners from the violence that an exclusive settlement will bring.' The same, of course, applies for efforts to proceed without the Alliance. There is considerable support for the view that the current draft constitution is not adequately federal in its nature. Professor Mervyn Frost of Natal University argues that the various pretexts - minimum standards, maintenance of economic unity, unreasonableness - whereby the central state can interfere in the affairs of a region are inimical to federalism. Political analysts are having increasingly to resort to the poker analogy with the ANC and Freedom Alliance seemingly determined to go right down to the wire before revealing whether they are prepared to make any compromises.</p>

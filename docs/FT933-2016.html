			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Dinkie Heel up sharply to Pounds 309,000 Boosted by an increase in export sales, pre-tax profits of Dinkie Heel, the manufacturer of components for the shoe trade, showed a marked increase from Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 309,000 in the six months to end-June. The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 3.49m and was helped by improved margins and reductions in fixed overheads. Lower interest rates led to a fall in interest payable to Pounds 33,000 (Pounds 44,000). An interim dividend of 0.5p (0.35p) is declared, payable from earnings per share of 1.76p (0.67p). The shares closed up 2p to 26p.</p>

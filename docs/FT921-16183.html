			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Cracking the Morse code One of the more interesting banking riddles at the moment centres on who is going to replace Sir Jeremy Morse and Brian Pitman, the chairman and chief executive of Lloyds Bank, Britain's second biggest financial services group. They are the longest serving - and most successful - duo at the top of their trade. But their time is coming to an end. Until Michael Hepher's surprise decision to swop the chairmanship of Lloyds Abbey Life for the number two job at British Telecom, he seemed the favourite to replace 60-year-old Pitman. Even so, several younger Lloyds' bankers are training by Pitman's side and his replacement is nowhere near as hard to spot as Sir Jeremy's. The easiest solution would be for Pitman to replace 63-year-old Morse. Pitman has done a first-rate job transforming Lloyds into the best regarded of the big four banks and deserves to be rewarded. But a strong chief executive can find it hard to stop interfering on being kicked upstairs. Sir Jeremy, and his predecessor Sir Eric Faulkner, came from outside, and both proved excellent choices. There is no obvious future chairman amongst Lloyds' current crop of non-executives. But as Sir Jeremy lists problems and puzzles amongst his favourite recreations in Who's Who, it would be surprising if he blotted his record by failing to pick the right successor.</p>

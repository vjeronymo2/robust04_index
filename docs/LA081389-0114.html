			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WEIGHTY MATTER  </P> <P> The casting call was for a woman of 5-foot-4, size 22, about 230-260 pounds --  a Roseanne Barr body double for "She Devil." There was a catch: She had to be  nude.  </P> <P> Plus Models Ltd. of NYC -- which specializes in larger-size models -- took the  call from the film's production office. The Orion comedy, which just wrapped in  Gotham, stars Meryl Streep as a romance novelist who comes between clumsy  housewife Barr and hubby, Ed Begley Jr. -- leading Barr to plot revenge.  </P> <P> "But we couldn't find any girls who were interested (or the right size)," said  Plus Models prez Pat Swift.  </P> <P> "Most of our girls start at 5-foot-8 1/2. Then there's the fact they wanted the  girl to pose nude. You know, the bigger a girl gets, the more reluctant she  tends to be about taking her clothes off."  </P> <P> Swift also said the potential pay was well below usual for a day's  nude/semi-nude work -- an initial offer of $125, later raised to $175.  </P> <P> We aren't sure if a size 22 body double was ever found, or filmed. At press  time, calls to the film's production office, Orion and Barr's publicist had not  been returned. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

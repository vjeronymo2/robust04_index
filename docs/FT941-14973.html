			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: The shape of things to come - The venture capital industry is lobbying for a better deal on investment trusts When Britain's chancellor announced in his November budget that he would introduce new venture capital investment trusts, a buzz of excitement spread through the investment and small business community. Taken with the new Enterprise Investment Scheme, which replaces the Business Expansion Scheme, and changes to rules on capital gains tax roll-over relief, the government at last appeared to be addressing the problems of private investors who fund smaller companies. But, as ever, the devil is in the detail. With a consultative document on the new investment trusts due out at the end of the month, there is some concern that the Inland Revenue will bind them with overly restrictive rules to avoid the kind of shenanigans that marked the last years of the BES. Granted, the future salesmen of the new trusts have an interest in sounding gloomy to tease more concessions from the government. But even taking their comments with a healthy pinch of salt, there appears to be a real concern that tax breaks alone may not make the scheme sufficiently attractive to justify the high risk of investing in unquoted companies. Professional investors say excessive Inland Revenue caution could jeopardise the best attempt any government has yet made to reduce the shortage of investment capital that has dogged small and medium-sized companies since the 1930s. For unquoted companies, properly structured trusts would hold the promise of an increase in the supply of venture capital. For investors, they would open up an area of investment that is currently dominated by professional investors. The specific attraction for investors in the new style venture capital investment trusts (VCITs) is that dividends and capital gains on holdings would be paid free of tax. In this way they would be similar to Personal Equity Plans. So what elements does the Association of Investment Trust Companies say need to be included to make VCITs attractive? At the time of the budget, the Inland Revenue said a 'substantial proportion' of the VCITs' assets should be held in unquoted trading companies. The AITC says this proportion should be 70 per cent - although the Inland Revenue may be thinking of a higher level. The 30 per cent balance should be either shares in companies that have gone public after being held as unquoted investments, the proceeds of sales, or uninvested cash, the AITC says. It calls for a relatively long three-year period in which to invest the 70 per cent. And it says trusts should be allowed a generous period in which to reinvest proceeds of realisations. 'If the venture capital investment trusts became forced sellers (when one of its investments floated) it would become something of a dampener on the share price,' says Ernest Fenton, director-general of the AITC. Crucially, professional investors want recognition that companies seek funding though a package of financial instruments and do not only want equity. The AITC and the Inland Revenue appear to agree that qualifying investments should include loan stock, mezzanine debt instruments, preference shares and warrants as well as equity. The AITC firmly believes there should be no limit to the size of the unquoted company in which the VCITs can invest. 'There is just as much of a funding gap for larger unquoted companies,' says Fenton. If investment is restricted to the smallest companies, venture capital managers might be loathe to launch a trust. 'If the rules for venture capital trusts say we can only invest in very small companies - ie with sales less than Pounds 1m - we would not be interested (in setting up an investment trust) and I don't think many people would be,' says William Eccles, a director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures which manages a quoted venture capital trust. Finally, the AITC says it expects the 22 existing venture capital trusts - with assets of about Pounds 1.6bn and a market capitalisation of about Pounds 1.3bn - to be allowed to qualify. But it expects that less than 10 of the existing trusts would qualify under its suggested criteria. There appears to be considerable common ground between the AITC and Inland Revenue on the above points. Where they are more likely to part company is over what the AITC says is necessary to make the trusts attractive enough to generate investor interest. 'With venture capital you get into illiquid situations,' says Fenton. 'Without further incentives it will be difficult to market these things.' Among the additional incentives he would like to see are: Capital gains roll-over relief on profits made on other investments - whether the sale of ICI shares or a second home - if the profits are invested in venture capital investment trusts. This postponed CGT liability to be waived entirely if the investment in the trust is held for five years. No maximum limit to the amount of investment any individual can make, or a high limit of at least Pounds 100,000. Investor prudence, the AITC says, is likely to provide a natural limit. Any losses to be offset against income tax, as was the case with the Business Start-Up Scheme which preceded the BES. Striking the right balance between making the scheme attractive and avoiding abuse will be a delicate task. The quoted venture capital trusts have had a poor record relative to the FT-All share index over the last 10 years - although the category did outperform the Footsie in 1993. Too many restrictions would not entice investors to risk investing in unquoted companies, even indirectly, through investment trusts. But there is a risk if the government makes the regime too liberal. 'The scheme may get distorted again into a purely tax-saving device and will not help back smaller companies,' says Eccles.</p>

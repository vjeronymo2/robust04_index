In an interview with ITAR-TASS Ustinov expressed concern  over  the notorious ultimatum made by NATO countries, saying that the  use of force against Bosnian Serbs cannot bring military  operations in former Yugoslavia to an end. "There is a threat  that air-strikes on Serbian positions around Sarajevo might be  followed by intervention of NATO troops into Bosnia," Ustinov  said.    Ustinov believes that in order to prevent the conflict from  being raised to a higher level of confrontation all  peace-keeping forces should be withdrawn from Bosnia and  Herzegovina and "former Yugoslavia should be given a chance to  resolve its problems itself."    According to Ustinov, the Duma Committee for Issues of  Geopolitics is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the  Balkan crisis.</p>

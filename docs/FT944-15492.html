			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitive MY leaps to Pounds 4.5m MY Holdings, the packaging group, pledged to continue its acquisitions strategy after announcing an 80 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to August 27. The company, which spent Pounds 23.3m acquiring four packaging businesses this year, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 4.51m on turnover up 46 per cent to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 35.1m). Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the company was considering another share issue to fund acquisitions this year. In February, the group raised about Pounds 23m through a placing which more than doubled its market capitalisation. 'This year's acquisitions are not the end of the story. We are only at the beginning,' he said. 'We like healthcare and would like further expansion in that sector. We are also looking to continue our expansion of specialist corrugated activities, and would like to fill in gaps in our geographical spread. We do not really have anything in the Midlands and the west country, and the Scottish market would be very interesting to us.' However, the directors warned that operating margins, which increased from 7.6 to 9.4 per cent last year, would come under pressure from price rises for its pulp and paper raw materials. Turnover on continuing businesses rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 39.8m, despite a poor performance by Trondex, the moulded cushion packaging business. Stripping out acquisitions, operating profit grew 12 per cent to Pounds 3m. Interest costs increased from Pounds 164,000 to Pounds 301,000 as the group raised its borrowing for cash acquisitions and capital investment. Gearing rose from 4.2 to 16.3 per cent. Earnings per share grew 16 per cent to 4.52p (3.91p), as the number of shares doubled. The board recommended a final dividend of 1.1p to make a total of 1.6p (1.25p) for the year.</p>

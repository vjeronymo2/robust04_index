			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Washington by Natan Gutman] </F>   [Excerpts] Israeli sources said that the first day of  talks in Washington between the heads of the Syrian and Israeli  delegations was positive. According to the sources, Muwaffaq  al-'Allaf, head of the Syrian delegation, demonstrated an  encouraging approach, although there was no room to talk of  progress.    Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation, told  al-'Allaf that the two issues which the talks had focused on up  til now -- the question of withdrawal and the nature of peace --  have already been sufficiently discussed and progress was made  on them; therefore, Rabinovich would now like to move on to the  issue of security arrangements on the Golan Heights. Israeli  sources refused to interpret these remarks or to say whether  they mean that Syria and Israel have already reached agreement  with regard to withdrawal and the nature of peace. [passage  omitted]    The meeting between Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich and chief  Syrian negotiator Muwaffaq al-'Allaf lasted approximately 90  minutes and dealt primarily with procedural issues. Rabinovich  opened the discussion by expressing condolences on behalf of the  Israeli Government over the death of Basil al-Asad, son of the  Syrian president. Rabinovich later sought to discuss future  security arrangements on the Golan Heights. It was reported  that no progress was made on this matter and that there was no  change in the Syrian positions. [passage omitted]    The peace talks on the other tracks were scheduled to resume  at around midnight, Israel time. Upon arrival in Washington,  Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks  with Jordan, said that he had brought detailed plans to fill the  Jordanian-Israeli agenda with content in order to help transform  it into a real peace agreement. Rubinstein was accompanied by  experts in the fields of water, environmental studies, and  economics.    Major General Dani Rothschild heads the Israeli team to the  talks with the Palestinians. Rothschild is supposed to  negotiate opposite Sa'ib 'Urayqat, his Palestinian counterpart.  Rothschild reiterated the prime minister's position that no  progress can be made at the Washington talks before the problems  holding back the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement are resolved. The Washington talks on the Palestinian  track will focus on election modalities in the territories and  the powers of the autonomy council. [passage omitted]</p>

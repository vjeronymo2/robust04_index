			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bright spots in a cloudy forecast - The outlook for global advertising growth The outlook for global advertising is not as bright as it looked six months ago, according to the latest advertising expenditure forecasts from Zenith, the UK-based Saatchi and Saatchi media-buying company, published this week*. Expectations of growth for 1994 have been cut to 5.5 per cent, compared with the 6.2 per cent Zenith was hoping for when it last reported in July. Similarly, forecasts for 1995 have been reduced to 6.5 per cent from 7.3 per cent. Zenith's six-monthly forecasts - which now predict a 4 per cent global increase for 1993 - are among the most closely studied in the advertising industry. The scaling back of its expectations can chiefly be attributed to deteriorations in the US and Japanese advertising markets. Figures for Europe have remained stable, with the UK and France showing gradual improvement. The global figures also disguise areas of the world in which exceptionally high growth is expected. Top of the league is China, where growth of nearly 72 per cent is expected over the next three years. Rate increases in China continue at what Zenith calls a 'staggering pace' as media owners cash in on heavy demand from overseas advertisers seeking to reach the country's 1.2bn consumers. The report says that rates for foreign advertisers are significantly higher than for Chinese companies. Demand outstrips supply in advertising space and airtime. In Greece, the only European country to be included in the report's top 10 countries for growth, television is the main focus of attention. New licences were allocated this summer to six national operators - about 145 channels have been broadcasting illegally in the country for the past six years. Daily newspapers have seen a decline in circulation, while magazines have been strong. The increasing popularity of 'drivetime' radio has prompted a continuing rise in radio's share of advertising revenue. Moves have been made by the Thai government towards liberalising television, which should augur well for spending in that area. The introduction of VAT on advertising in Thailand last year did not have a big effect on advertising spending, with two of the fastest-growing sectors being leisure and transport. Thai Rat, the largest daily newspaper, continues to grow. 'Advertising demand for the title is enormous with advertisers being allocated on average half of the advertising space requested,' says Zenith. In the Philippines power cuts have darkened Manila for between four and nine hours every day since 1991. In spite of this, television continues to claim 65 per cent of advertising expenditure and its share is forecast to continue rising over the next three years. *Advertising Expenditure Forecasts, from Steven Winram, Zenith Media Worldwide, Bridge House, 63-65 North Wharf Road, London W2 1LA.

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A LANGSTON-WITT GEM DANDY;  </P> <P> ANGELS: AN UNLIKELY PAIR COMBINES AGAINST MARINERS FOR THE TEAM'S FIRST  NO-HITTER AT ANAHEIM STADIUM SINCE 1975.  </P> <P> Mark Langston, the Angels' $16-million man, held Anaheim Stadium enthralled  Wednesday night with a pitching performance that was priceless -- and hitless.  </P> <P> That he lasted only seven innings against his former Mariner teammates did not  diminish his feat, for in a wonderful bit of irony, the finishing touches on  the 1-0 victory that was the eighth no-hitter in the Angels' history were  provided by Mike Witt, who 5 1/2 years ago pitched the only perfect game in the  club's history.  </P> <P> In that game, the final one of the 1984 season, Witt blanked the Texas Rangers,  who were then managed by current Angel Manager Doug Rader.  </P> <P> "That's why I knew Witt was the right guy to finish this one," said Rader.  "He's done it before."  </P> <P> Langston, in his Angel debut, worked with little margin for error against his  former Seattle teammates. The Angels did not score off Erik Hanson over five  innings and finally Dante Bichette drew a bases-loaded walk that scored Johnny  Ray, who had walked to lead off the inning  </P> <P> Langston who spent his first 5 1/2 seasons with the Mariners before being  traded to Montreal last May, has never pitched a complete-game no-hitter. The  closest he has come was a one-hitter against Texas on Sept. 24, 1989. He also  took a no-hitter into the ninth against Toronto last season but lost the game.  He walked four and struck out three Wednesday, making 98 pitches.  </P> <P> Didn't he want to stay in?  </P> <P> "I basically had hit the wall after the seventh," said Langston. "This early in  the season, I'm lucky to go seven. It's just wild."  </P> <P> The crowd of 25,632 booed when Witt came out of the bullpen to take over for  Langston at the start of the eighth inning, but his departure was inevitable,  given the shortened preparation time he and all pitchers had in the  lockout-shortened spring training.  </P> <P> Langston said it wasn't how he envisioned his Angel debut.  </P> <P> "Believe me, what I pictured wasn't even close," he said. "I was hoping to  throw five strong innings. I was very fortunate and grateful to be able to go  seven. The defense was great behind me.  </P> <P> "I had a problem throwing strikes early on, but I got in a groove from about  the third inning on. I was throwing strikes and staying ahead of the hitters."  </P> <P> Langston may have been nervous in the first inning, and understandably so. But  his professionalism triumphed, enabling him to grow stronger as the game  progressed.  </P> <P> "The one Mike Witt threw was the most dominating I've ever seen," said Rader.  "This was the most satisfying because you've got the new kid, Langston, and  Mike Witt comes in and finishes it."  </P> <P> His first deed as an Angel was hardly auspicious. He walked leadoff batter  Harold Reynolds on four pitches, but was supported by his defense. The next  hitter was Griffey, but left fielder Bichette helped turn Griffey's sinking  liner into a double play when he ran in to catch the ball, saw that Reynolds  was most of the way to second and made a fine throw to first to double Griffey  off first.  </P> <P> That proved important when Langston walked Alvin Davis, his former roommate.  However, Langston got out of the inning when Jeffrey Leonard hit a grounder to  short that forced Davis at second.  </P> <P> Langston issued another walk to Brian Giles in the third inning, but the  defense again stepped in and turned an inning-ending double play on a grounder  hit by Reynolds to second.  </P> <P> The Angels weren't faring much better against Hanson, who stands an imposing  6-6 but seemed short after the sight of 6-10 Randy Johnson Tuesday. The did get  to Hanson for two hits in the second, when Lance Parrish singled with two out  and Jack Howell doubled, moving Parris to third, but Mark McLemore ended the  threat with a fly to left.  </P> <P> Devon white and Wally Joyner sandwiched singles around Ray's fly ball to left  in the third, but Chili Davis bounced into a double play to end the inning.  </P> <P> The Angels put runners on base in the fourth inning, but again failed to score.  Bichette led off with a single to left and advance to second when Claudell  Washington walked. Parrish then hit a grounder that hopped under the glove of  third baseman Edgar Martinez, but shortstop Giles recovered the ball in time to  tag Bichette out at third. Reynolds, the second baseman, bobbled Howell's  grounder, but managed to get Parrish at second. With Washington on third and  Howell on first, McLemore struck out swinging.  </P> <P> Langston came close to giving up his first hit in the fifth. Pete O'Brien led  off with a grounder that Joyner played deep on the dirt behind first. Langston  raced to cover the bag, but Joyner's throw was high over his head. Parrish  retrieved it, and had the presence of mind to get O'Brien involved in a  rundown, which ended with O'Brien being tagged by Joyner at first.  </P> <P> Martinez walked, but Langston got Henry Cotto to fly to left and David Valle to  look at a third strike.  </P> <P> The Angels again had runners on base in the fifth but failed to score. White  swung at a bad pitch on what should have been strike three, but the ball eluded  Valle and White reached first. Ray sacrificed him to second, but he remained  there. Joyner was walked intentionally and Hanson got out of trouble by  striking out Davis and getting Bichette to fly to left.  </P> <P> In the sixth, Howell stroked a one-hop double off the wall in center with two  out, but he was stranded there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield may remain on the disabled list beyond the minimum  15-day period because he experienced increased discomfort in his right  hamstring Tuesday after taking ground balls and moving laterally on the field.  Trainer Ned Bergert said the muscle discomfort meant Schofield had "regressed a  little bit." Bergert added, "He's eligible (to come off the disabled list) on  the 16th and I don't think at this time it's likely he'll come off on the  16th." . . . Reliever Bob McClure, whose sore left elbow showed no improvement  following a cortisone injection Monday, will undergo a Magnetic Resonance  Imaging test today at Centinela Hospital. The test, in which a radio frequency  pulse causes electrical elements of injured tissue to react and appear on a  computer display, is being done "for peace of mind, to make sure nothing is  being missed," Bergert said.  </P> <P> Catcher Bill Schroeder, who is on the disabled list because of soreness in his  surgically repaired right elbow, will see Dr. Paul Jacobs, who performed the  arthroscopic procedure, next week in Milwaukee. . . . Jack Howell rejoined the  healthy Wednesday, exactly a week after he sprained his left ankle while diving  for first base in an exhibition game. "I'm OK, as far as practice situations,  ground balls hit pretty much right at you, batting practice, and running pretty  much straight ahead," said Howell, who blooped a double that landed just inside  the right-field foul line in his first at-bat Wednesday. "That's not to say I  expect game situations to be all that different. The only way to tell is trying  to turn on a good fastball, beating out a grounder or fielding a hard shot hit  to your left when you've got to make a quick turn. Til those things happen, I  don't know how it feels." He feels fortunate to be back so quickly. "Looking  back, it could have been a lot worse," he said. "I could have totally ripped my  ankle and not been able to come back until June. I'm fortunate it happened  early in the season, when I was going through spring training-type drills. It's  not like it was in the middle of a pennant race, where if you miss games it's  hard to get back in."  </P> <P> ANGEL NO-HITTERS  </P> <P> No-hitters thrown by Angel pitchers:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:3.65IN:2.11IN:1.67IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pitcher(s)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Opponent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Score  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Site  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 5, 1962  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bo Belinsky  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orioles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dodger Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July 3, 1970  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Clyde Wright  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Athletics  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> May 15, 1973  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Royals  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Royals Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> July 15, 1973  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tigers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tiger Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sept. 28, 1974  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Twins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> June 1, 1975  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nolan Ryan  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Orioles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sept. 30, 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mike Witt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rangers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Arlington Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> April 11, 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mark Langston/Mike Witt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mariners  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Anaheim Stadium  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Frankfurt brushes up its act: Germany's financial capital is improving its appeal as a regional centre Frankfurt has not always had the most inspiring of images, either as a place to live or as a centre for financial activity. Several years ago, foreign bankers posted there often saw it as something less than an enhancement of their career prospects. But while some still complain about the lack of lively wine bars in which to unwind after hours, Frankfurt's appeal as a financial centre is improving. Foreign banks are stepping up their activities, the big German banks have learnt new tricks in global equities and the complex financial instruments called derivatives, and the authorities have introduced changes in the markets to make them more attractive to foreign investors. While these improvements will not put Frankfurt right up in the ranks of global centres such as London, they will reinforce its role as Continental Europe's leading regional financial centre. These plans will be put to the test when one of the biggest state sell-offs in the 1990s - the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications concern - takes place. Success in selling the shares to big international institutions and retail investors at home and abroad will depend on how well the DM15bn (Pounds 6bn) issue, due in 1996, is managed and marketed. Mr Andre Teeuw, head of the German operation of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, is confident that the Deutsche Telekom issue 'will contribute to international awareness that Frankfurt is growing in importance as a financial centre'. If the Deutsche Telekom share sale is successful, it could encourage big institutional investors to take more interest in Germany. Only Dollars 2.7bn of the net flow of Dollars 68bn into foreign equities by US investors last year went into Germany, said Mr Andreas von Buddenbrock, head of investment banking at the German operation of Merrill Lynch, the US investment house. Compared with the UK, the number of new issues on the German equity market has been small. Last month saw one of the largest such offerings, the DM530m sale of 25 per cent of Hanover Re, the world's fifth biggest reinsurance group; the oversubscribed issue was the seventh biggest in 10 years. But there will have to be many more if Frankfurt is to play the important regional financing role, serving west and east Europe, that many participants see as its main future. Investment bankers look forward to such a development as German companies seek new funds to stay competitive in a fierce and fast-changing world business environment. 'I expect to see a lot of new entrants to the German stock market,' said Mr Piers von Simson, head of European operations at SG Warburg, the UK investment bank. 'There will be a lot more Mittelstand (medium-sized) companies coming; the new issue market will open up.' An acceleration in the sluggish pace of new listings would benefit Frankfurt, which dominates German trading in securities, futures and derivatives. Home of the Bundesbank, Germany's powerful central bank, the city's status was enhanced last month when the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the planned European Central Bank, moved into its new premises. The surprise decision last week by BASF, the German chemical group, to delist its shares from the seven regional bourses and concentrate on Frankfurt is a further boost. Other companies are likely to follow, thus reinforcing the Frankfurt stock market, which accounts for three-quarters of share dealings. The others may eventually be confined to an advisory rather than a trading role (though local politicians will resist this). Not everything is going Frankfurt's way, however. Its financial self-esteem was shaken by the recent decision of Deutsche Bank to put its international investment banking activities in London, home of Morgan Grenfell, its UK merchant banking subsidiary. Most bankers accepted that Germany's biggest bank needed to be in London to develop a more credible presence in this highly competitive and innovative business. But Deutsche Bank's move highlights the strengths and weaknesses of Frankfurt, located in Europe's most powerful economy. 'I remain very positive for Frankfurt as a financial centre and I think it is right to say it is the financial centre of the continent,' said Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chairman. 'It may, over time, backed by the strength of the D-Mark and the size of our economy, be in a position to extend its lead on the continent,' he added. 'But I still maintain that, for many years to come, London will remain the more international marketplace.' This week's announcement by Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, that it is to strengthen its investment banking activities in London reinforces that point. It is in New York, Tokyo and London that the biggest concentrations of financial talent and banking strength lie. Located around each of these are smaller but thriving regional markets, and Frankfurt's aim is to be pre-eminent among those on the continent of Europe. 'The reason Frankfurt is so important is that it's in the most important economy in Europe,' said Mr Tim von Halle, Merrill Lynch's capital markets director in Germany. But in spite of housing Europe's second busiest stock exchange outside London and its biggest bond market, it has not always capitalised enough on its location in generating investment business. The government, market authorities and banks have taken several steps to help Frankfurt meet the growing demands put on it. New legislation has been passed to overhaul financial markets, evolved in an era when banks and companies were wedded to the cosy house bank style of corporate lending. Insider trading is no longer outside the law; it has been illegal since August and next year, a new supervisory authority will start policing securities dealings. More stringent share disclosure requirements are being introduced, so holdings exceeding 5 per cent will have to be made known (the disclosure level is currently 25 per cent). German companies wanting to raise new share capital can now do so without having to offer pre-emptive rights to existing holders. On the trading and settlement side, Frankfurt has introduced advanced electronic systems and has a successful futures market, the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB). 'By German standards, they (the government and market authorities) are doing a pretty good job,' said Mr Christian Klein, treasurer at Landesbank Hessen-Thurigen (Helaba), the Frankfurt-based regional bank. 'The insider trading law is really tough.' But there is still further to go, according to bankers. Action is needed to protect minority rights in takeovers; there is no takeover code or set of rules to guarantee fair treatment for all classes of shareholders. Nor are there enough quoted companies to satisfy many big investors; and liquidity in many stocks is restricted by the existence of large stakes by banks and institutions. German companies also need to make their accounts clearer and more transparent, said Mr Buddenbrock. 'From a corporate perspective, a major decision has to be made to open up information more to international investors.' The prospect of the Deutsche Telekom share sale alone will not right these deficiencies. For Frankfurt's growing status, said Mr Teeuw, the sale 'will be a confirmation rather than a big push'. The government is keen for the issue to attract private investors to the idea of share buying and will put strong pressure on the banks to see this happens. The next year will show whether Frankfurt proves up to the job.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FRANKFURT: RAISING ITS PROFILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- German new share issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Total raised Year      Number      (DMm)       Biggest issue                    DMm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992        8         805         Walter Bau        Construction   368 1993        8         967         Heilit &amp; Woerner  Construction   291 1994       10       1,020         Hanover Re        Reinsurance    530  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: German stock exchanges, Commerzbank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volume of business on Frankfurt stock exchange  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           Total          Percent of          Shares            Bonds Year     (DMbn)         German total         (DMbn)           (DMbn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990     2,385              66               1,128            1,257 1991     2,430              70                 905            1,525 1992     3,162              69                 976            2,186 1993     4,873              71               1,413            3,460 1994*    5,201              74               1,415            3,786  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Deutsche Bourse                                       *Jan-Nov  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

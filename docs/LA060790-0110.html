			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALTADENANS IRATE OVER PROPOSAL FOR 22 HOUSES  </P> <P> Irate residents charged this week that a plan to build 22 single-family homes  on the edge of Eaton Canyon is a threat to wildlife, an interruption of  longstanding hiking and equestrian trails, and a potential flood hazard for  people who might live in the homes.  </P> <P> "It would be immoral for the county to permit this plan to go forward," said  Duane Merrill, a member of the unincorporated community's Town Council, citing  past floods which have swept away structures built along the canyon.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning hearing officer is  scheduled Tuesday to consider the plan by Monterey Park developer Lao-Ko Chu to  build the 22 houses on a six-acre site north of New York Boulevard and west of  the canyon.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Town Council held a special session of its own to consider the  plan. As about 80 Altadena and Pasadena residents cheered them on, the 12  members present voted unanimously to recommend that the county require the  developer to prepare an environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Many of those in the audience are already involved in a 3 1/2-year battle  against a proposed 272-home development on the site of the old La Vina  Sanitarium, in the foothills north of Lincoln Avenue.  </P> <P> Also present at the meeting were Chu, who bought the parcel 2 1/2 years ago for  $1.6 million, and consulting engineer Patrick J. Conley. Both said that planned  measures to bolster the terrain would eliminate serious flood hazards.  </P> <P> "Where are you guys going to be when those houses get washed out?" one critic  asked.  </P> <P> Chu contended that past floods were the result of illegal dumping in the  canyon. "People dumped trash and there was no place for (water and debris) to  go," he said, as those attending the meeting watched videotapes of a 1969 flood  that swept away a restaurant near the site of Chu's project.  </P> <P> The developer plans not only to bolster the west bank of the canyon, narrowing  the channel through which potential floods could pass, but also to build the  houses above the maximum flood stage, the highest point that water could be  expected to reach in the event of a major deluge, Conley said.  </P> <P> "Minimum protection would be one foot above the maximum flood stage," Conley  said. "The project will be between two and three feet above it."  </P> <P> Chu added that he has been conservative in planning for the development. The  size of the project is substantially less than zoning would permit, he said.  "We could build 36 homes there," he said.  </P> <P> "The property was on the market for development," he added. "I'm a developer."  </P> <P> Critics agreed that Chu has a legal right to build there, but they insisted  that there are moral considerations that dictate that the site remain  undeveloped.  </P> <P> The site, a stable until a year ago, abuts on the county's Eaton Canyon Park  and McCurdy Nature Center. Critics said new houses in the area would drive  wildlife away. "There are deer, quail, rabbits and our own mountain lion," said  Loren Lutz, who runs a nearby private nature preserve. "People living up there  will head right for the (canyon) for their recreation. That will have an  adverse effect on wildlife."  </P> <P> Jerry Acker, head of a local equestrian group, said Chu has already blocked  longstanding horse trails. Acker and others would like the county or a  public-interest group to take over the property and convert it into an  equestrian center.  </P> <P> Chu denies blocking any trails and said he has tried to be sensitive to horse  lovers' interests. As for wildlife, Chu said, a nearby rifle range creates far  more disturbance than his houses would.  </P> <P> The county so far has required no environmental impact report for the project,  although it has required Chu to pay a $33,000 fee rather than meet the  requirement of turning a portion of the land over to the county for parkland.  </P> <P> Conley said the developer would prepare a detailed environmental impact report  only if the county requires it.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk: "Bread Will Get Dearer. </F> Much Dearer, `Roskhleboprodukt' Corporation Chairman Believes"]    [Text] As is frequently the case in our country, gloom  abruptly turned to uncommon joy at the mention of the upcoming  harvest. It was clear to everyone that, if there are more ears  in the fields, Russia will not have to buy grain abroad this  year. This is remarkable, of course, but we will have to pay  more for bread at the store. And there had been rumors that the  price of bread would go up in June.    Unfortunately these rumors have been borne out. Bread has  been and is still getting dearer, and the price will continue to  go up. Maybe not in June, but in the middle or at the end of  the summer 1 kg of bread will cost around 950 rubles [R]. As  always, the search for a culprit has begun.    Agrarian Party of Russia Chairman Mikhail Lapshin stated  that  this fact is "in no way connected with demands by the peasantry  to boost state support for the agro-industrial complex."  Moreover, Mikhail Ivanovich stressed: "Agricultural producers  categorically oppose price rises since they gain nothing from  them. The peasant's cut of the retail price is just 8-10  percent, whereas it is the government that is allowing bread  prices to be ratcheted up without restraint by increasing the  cost of grain storage, transportation, and processing and the  actual trade in bread."    It is extremely difficult right now to keep track of the  grain situation in our country, and the picture is pretty  clouded anyway because everyone is playing their own game.    Nevertheless Leonid Cheshinskiy, president of the  "Roskhleboprodukt" federal contracting corporation, believes  that "the corporation is in no way to blame for the price."  Everything is getting more expensive -- raw materials, fuel and  energy resources, and all types of services. In his opinion,  the biggest share of the price hike is accounted for by bank  credit. Grain currently being stored and processed at the  corporation's enterprises has been bought on credit at the bank  rate, hence the increase in the bread price is going to average  20 percent a month.    In addition, however, Leonid Stepanovich acknowledges that  the corporation was unable to purchase all the grain and that  grain was left with the farms. Many oblasts purchased it from  peasants at a price which, as a rule, did not exceed R90,000 a  tonne. So they used it to bake more or less cheap bread. At  the present time there is practically no grain left on the  farms, so now it has to be taken from state resources. The  grain has already been paid for, it has incurred interest  charges and storage and processing costs, and the price of grain  has now risen from R120,000 to R150,000 on the other side of the  Urals.    The situation is also made worse by the fact that in order  to  bring a tonne of wheat from Omsk, for example, you need to pay  R100,000. As a result the full cost of that tonne will be  R250,000. So you can calculate how much a kilogram of bread  will cost at the store.    But all the indications are that the main problem still lies  ahead. The fact is that the Russian Ministry of Agriculture and  Food has already determined purchase prices for arable produce.  How can the price be determined if, according to the president's  edict, this is supposed to be done by the market!    The answer can be found in letters from the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food that have turned up in the editorial  office. Apparently, "because of the undeveloped nature of the  market infrastructure, the lack of experience of working in  market conditions, and the high level of inflation, agricultural  production, procurement, and processing enterprises are  experiencing considerable difficulties in determining an  advantageous market price." So the Ministry has set guideline  purchase prices. For example, this year wheat will be bought  for R220,000 a tonne compared to R65,000 last year. Add to this  mark-ups and costs totaling another 30 percent, and you end up  with the price we have to pay for bread at the store. This is  how the market determines the cost. And then the whole cycle  starts up again: If grain goes up, so does meat, and therefore  the cost of technology and gas goes up too.... Basically,  nobody is to blame. It is unclear who can break this vicious  circle. Possibly the "Roskhleboprodukt" corporation, which has  basically become a private company and naturally has an interest  in buying grain as cheaply as possible, even abroad if need be.</p>

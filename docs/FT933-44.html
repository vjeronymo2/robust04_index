			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (2): Ruling party is yearning for a new Nehru - The tide of Hindu militancy threatens to breach Congress's defences It is the lull before the storm in Indian politics. For much of the year, India has been waiting for a settling of accounts over the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque and the inter-religious violence which it provoked. Voters will finally have their say in state elections to be held in four northern states in November and December. The polls will cover nearly a third of India's population, but their results will be as significant as any general election. 'The fight will be fairly tough. There's no doubt about it,' says Mr Arjun Singh, the minister for human resource development and a leading figure in the ruling Congress (I) party. The crucial question is the extent to which the Hindu militants who tore down the mosque have gained or lost from the ensuing upheaval. The betting is that they have profited handsomely: the Bharatiya Janata party, the opposition Hindu militant party, is riding high in opinion polls; the ruling Congress (I) party is in disarray with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, fighting to contain dissent in his ranks. Disenchantment with Congress runs so deep that even the left-wing parties, weakened by years of in-fighting, have recently seen a modest revival. Whatever the voters decide, Ayodhya seems likely to continue to dominate the political agenda. Just at the time when the government is carrying out the most extensive economic reforms in 40 years, ministers have little time for anything but Ayodhya and its consequences. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, concedes in an interview in this survey that, while the government remains committed to economic reform, Ayodhya and other issues have diverted attention. Mr P. Chidambaram, a former commerce minister and a strong advocate of economic reform, puts it more bluntly: 'When we began the reforms (two years ago), economic reform was at the top of the agenda. Now it has slipped to third place behind communalism (relations between religious communities) and the internal debate in Congress about how to confront the challenge caused by communalism.' The Ayodhya mosque's destruction and the violence which followed it caused widespread revulsion among many middle-class Indians. It brought terror into the lives of many of the poor in northern cities and in Bombay which bore the brunt of the unrest. But even at the height of the violence there were those who cheered the action of the Hindu militants. Since then, it has steadily become more acceptable for middle-class Hindus to make public their support for the BJP. They like the argument that it is time for Hindus to assert themselves; that Moslems have enjoyed too many favours in a predominantly Hindu country; that it is time for India to become Hindu. These sentiments are often vaguely-expressed, but they are powerful. At a sub-conscious level, they reflect the unease which economic growth and urbanisation often causes in traditional rural societies. As the long-standing bonds of regional and caste loyalty weaken, so Indians are searching for a sense of identity. As the party which fought hardest for independence, Congress has a strong nationalist streak in its ideological make-up. But with the independence struggle now a distant memory, many Hindus find Congress's form of nationalism too bland. They have also come to distrust the party efforts to gather support from the nation's minority groups, notably the Moslems. Even though Moslems have remained poor and socially-disadvantaged, many Hindus have swallowed the BJP's argument that Moslem 'privileges' must be restricted - such as the right for family and other personal matters to be settled by separate Islamic law. Mr KR Mulkani, BJP vice-president, speaks for a growing number of Hindus when he says: 'It's all right for Moslems to have a sense of identity. But do they have to stick out like a sore thumb?' Congress faces a profound dilemma. If it stays with its traditional supporters, it risks being left behind by the shift in Hindu opinion. If it drifts to the right to try to absorb the milder elements of Hindu militancy, it risks alienating not only Moslems but also others who are suspicious of Hindu militancy such as former untouchables and other disadvantaged castes. The disadvantaged castes are concerned about Hindu militancy because the militants' leaders are predominantly high caste people. They fear such leaders might encroach upon the disadvantaged castes' privileges, such as special quotas for government jobs. Concern about the threat to job reservation is driving many low-caste voters away from Congress and into the arms of Janata Dal, the main left wing party, and its allies. Mr VP Singh, the Janata Dal leader, has made job reservation his top issue. To try to recover lost ground, the government this month extended job reservation from the most disadvantaged groups - the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes - to the less disadvantaged - the other backward classes. Fully 49 per cent of government jobs will now be set aside for the disadvantaged. But it still may not be enough for Congress to steal Janata Dal's thunder. Mr Narasimha Rao has from the start headed a minority government, since the 1991 general election left Congress without an absolute majority. Worse, because its support in 1991 included a wave of sympathy for Rajiv Gandhi, the recently assassinated Congress leader, the result concealed the true level of voters' disenchantment with Congress. Mr Rao had a good first year, with much public recognition for his handling of the 1991 economic crisis. But since last summer, his support has withered as the BJP has moved centre stage and forced other parties on to the defensive. According to an opinion poll published last month in the magazine India Today, Congress would now secure only 198 out of 537 seats in the lower house of Parliament if a general election were held - compared with 245 in 1991. In July, Mr Rao survived a no-confidence motion by just 14 votes, the narrowest margin ever. In an unprecedented alliance of left and right, the left-wing parties and the BJP combined to attack the government over Ayodhya and over corruption charges levelled against Mr Rao by Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of last year's financial scandal. All is not lost for Congress. In India, issues, even those as contentious as Ayodhya, are only half the battle in elections. The other half is patronage: as the party in government, Congress, is as well placed as ever to promise voters in the four northern states government jobs, building schemes and other electoral sops. Even straightforward cash bribes are commonplace in the Indian countryside. However, it will be very difficult for Congress to come out well in the forthcoming polls in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. All four were ruled by BJP governments until last December when they were abolished after Ayodhya for allegedly failing to carry out central government instructions in implementing anti-Hindu militant measures. Mr Malkani of the BJP says the party will win all four states - and most independent commentators agree. Congress's main chance could be to try to woo centrist splinter groups among the left-of-centre parties. But Janata Dal and its allies this month announced plans to stand on a united platform. To improve its prospects, Congress has arranged for the Election Commission, which supervises polls, to stagger voting over a month, with the first vote in Himachal Pradesh, where Congress believes it has the best chances. But even if the polls proceed in this way (a final decision has yet to be taken), commentators do not see Congress winning even one state. Worse, it is expected to fare particularly badly in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state and the site of Ayohdya. The BJP says that, if it wins the state polls, it will demand a general election. Congress is unlikely to oblige. But Mr Rao's enemies are bound to ask for his head. His critics accuse him of being too soft on the BJP and urge him to be more forthright in his condemnations of Hindu militancy. Chief among them is Mr Arjun Singh, who, while publicly protesting his loyalty to Mr Rao, has fomented dissent. Mr Singh does not hide his ambitions to be prime minister one day. He is also anxious that Congress should not lose the fight with the BJP by default. Fortunately for Congress, the BJP is still some way from winning an overall majority in a general election. Its power lies in the north; in the south and west, which include some of India's most prosperous regions, its impact has so far been weak. Also, in the north, the left-of-centre parties have recovered some ground, even from the BJP. Congress's support in the south, its traditional powerbase, has slipped. A big blow this year has been the loss of support from Ms Jayalalitha, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of the local DMK party. The most likely result of a general election would therefore be a three-way split between Congress, the BJP and the left-of-centre parties. India Today's opinion poll estimates that while Congress could see its lower house representation slide from 245 to 198, the BJP's would rise from 119 to 166 and the Janata Dal and the left-of-centre parties' would increase from 136 to 153. Given its access to patronage, Congress might still emerge as the party of government. But it would have to strike so many deals with actual and potential splinter groups that its ability to carry out coherent policies would be seriously compromised. This prospect leaves even loyal Congressmen deeply concerned about their party. Some dream of rebuilding a centrist alliance with Congress at its core, which would capture support from both the BJP and the left. But they are at a loss to say what this alliance would stand for; what its ideology would be. Others talk vaguely of finding a new strong man to lead the party. More than one says wistfully: 'We need another Nehru.'</p>

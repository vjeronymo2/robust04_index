"I don't  think such measures were spelled out," he said of the  government's decision on February 25 to compile the package of  measures to address the Japan-U.S. trade disputes.    Fujii was speaking at a regular press conference after a  morning cabinet meeting.    "The centerpiece will be the four key measures and the  actions in three priority areas" of the stalled trade framework  talks with the United States, Fujii said.    His comments in effect ruled out recent remarks by Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura calling for inclusion of  tax and other macroeconomic measures in the forthcoming package.    The four key measures cited are deregulation, boosting  imports, facilitating competition through stronger enforcement  of the antimonopoly law, and expanding government procurement.    The three "framework" priority areas are insurance,  automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment.    Fujii has repeatedly told the U.S. side that Japan would  conduct a "full-fledged" tax reform, including permanent tax  cuts, as the ruling coalition has vowed to do so by the end of  the year.    He has also repeatedly said that the latest 15.25 trillion  yen stimulus package would put the economy on the path of  full-scale recovery in the coming fiscal year.    Fujii said he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen  agreed to tackle bilateral trade talks in a "cooperative mood as  we did at the APEC meeting." The finance minister and Bentsen  held talks on Friday in Hawaii ahead of a two-day meeting there  of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum.    Fujii stressed, "the greatest importance for the government  is to clearly show its voluntary measures this month."    U.S. officials have indicated that the U.S. would assess the  possibility of resuming the stalled framework talks after  reviewing the market-opening package Japan promised to compile  by the end of this month.    On increasing international tension involving North Korea's  nuclear issue, Fujii said his ministry will follow the  government's decision in line with any United Nations  resolution. He was referring to possible suspension of bank  remittances from Japan to North Korea if the UN decides on trade  sanctions against Pyongyang.</p>

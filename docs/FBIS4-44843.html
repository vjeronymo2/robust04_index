The computer can  perform 12.8 billion calculations per second.    The German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) displayed  Germany's fastest and most powerful mainframe computer in  Goettingen on Friday. The head of the DLR Central Data  Processing Division in Oberpfaffenhofen, Hans-Martin Wacker, put  the NEC Corporation SX-3R supercomputer into operation following  a test run lasting several months. The mainframe, which was  installed in the DLR institute in Goettingen in September of  last year, is one of the three fastest computers available in  Europe. The "superbrain" can perform up to 12.8 billion  calculations per second. Especially scientists who work in the  fields of aerospace and traffic technology as well as climate  research can carry out numerical simulations with the computer.    The "superbrain," which was installed on a 100-square-meter  surface, consists of a puzzle-like set of metal boxes. The  system includes, among other things, a main memory unit that has  the enormous capacity of 1 gigabyte (a billion bytes) and  numerous disk drives with a total capacity of 46 gigabytes. The  most impressive thing about the mainframe is its speed. Access  to the main memory unit takes 20 nanoseconds (20 times 10 to the  power of -9 seconds).    The technical child prodigy is Japanese product. The DLR had  also invited leading representatives of the NEC Corporation from  Tokyo to the opening. As early as the beginning of September, 10  of the manufacturer's engineers came to Goettingen from Japan to  install the computer comprising three truck loads at the DLR  research center.    Those scientists in particular who work on extremely  calculation-intensive tasks can benefit from the new mainframe.  Even the most difficult numerical problems can be solved with  the "superbrain." Thus designers of aerodynamic equipment, for  example, can simulate the flow response of aircraft or  individual airfoils on the computer. Such enormous amounts of  data can only be processed with this immensely rapid access to  the main memory unit. But computer-controlled computational  procedures are not only used in the calculations for and  optimization of aerospace vehicles, but also in environment and  climate research to, for example, obtain insights into the  origins and dissemination of pollutants.    The enormous speed and capacity of the system are also  apparent in the central unit, the so-called CPU (central  processing unit). It has four so-called pipeline sets, each of  which has four vector pipelines that operate at a total of 6.4  gigaflops, that is, 6.4 billion floating point operations per  second. Andreas Landhaeusser, who is in charge of the DLR  computer, illustrated its scarcely imaginable speed with an  example: "If the entire population of the world were to add two  numbers on a pocket calculator, the SX-3 would still be faster  than all the people on this earth together."</p>

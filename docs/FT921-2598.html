			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Nikkei's decline ruffles Japanese bankers - Capital-to-assets ratios are threatened by falling share prices THE Nikkei index's fall below 20,000 on Monday gave many financial executives a sleepless night as they worked out the impact on their companies. For Japanese bankers, the calculations were especially nerve-racking. The banks' main concern is the effect of falling share prices on their capital reserves. Under rules set by the Bank for International Settlements, Japanese banks are allowed to count as capital a portion of unrealised gains on their stock holdings. The more the market falls, the smaller are the unrealised gains. At the 20,000 level, leading commercial banks are close to the 8 per cent ratio of capital to assets which the BIS has set as a minimum. As Mr Reese Harasawa, a financial manager at Mitsubishi Bank, said: 'We are at the critical level.' The BIS standard does not apply until next year. But banks cannot afford to wait until then to put their balance sheets in order. They must act now to bolster capital and cut asset growth. Moreover, banks are also suffering from an overhang of bad and doubtful debt incurred during the speculative boom of the 1980s. Some of these loans will have to be written off against reserves - further eroding the banks' capital and reducing their ability to expand lending. As much as possible, banks will try to avoid write-offs by taking possession of land and stocks held as collateral and waiting for an opportunity to sell. But this could take years. As Mr Masashi Kojima, the president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, said yesterday: 'It will take banks two years to really determine whether they can recover their bad debts and decide which of the borrowers will survive and which will die.' For borrowers, in Japan and overseas, that means that credit will be harder to obtain and more expensive. So far, the domestic impact has been largely limited to property investments, where hard-pressed companies are being squeezed by a collapse in asset prices and a rise in the cost of servicing loans. For the Japanese economy as a whole, the threat of a credit crunch still lies in the future. With economic growth slowing, companies are running down inventories and cutting capital investments, so their credit needs are shrinking. The money supply, including loans, grew by just 1.8 per cent in January, compared with same month in 1991 - a record low. However, if the economy picks up later this year, as the authorities hope, a shortage of credit could emerge as a serious constraint on growth. The assets of Japanese city banks (big commercial institutions), which grew by an annual rate of over 10 per cent in the late 1980s, increased by an estimated 5 per cent in the year to the end of March and could grow by just 4 per cent next year, according to Mr Hiroki Akimoto, banking analyst at Nomura Securities. If the economy fails to recover as quickly as the government expects, then the threat of a squeeze on credit would also recede. However, this will also bring banks little relief since slower economic growth would erode their customers' profits and so push more borrowers into financial difficulties. In the meantime, banks are doing what they can to shore up their balance sheets. Most importantly, they have taken advantage of falling interest rates to widen their lending margins. So basic business profits for the year to end-March should rise sharply - by around 30 per cent for city banks, according to industry estimates. Pre-tax and net profits, which take account of loan write-offs, stock investment losses and other charges, will decline but not by as much as was once feared. The worst result among leading banks is likely to come from scandal-hit Fuji Bank, which has suffered losses associated with a fraudulent loan scheme. Fuji has forecast a 74.9 per cent decline in net profits to Y30bn - a poor result, but one that still leaves the bank in the black. Another step taken by banks to defend balance sheets is securing subordinated loans, which count as capital under BIS rules. The city banks have raised around Y1,700bn so far in this financial year and plan to raise a further Y300bn or so by the end of the month. This follows Y4,000bn raised in the 1990 financial year. The funds come largely from life insurance companies. Even these large cash injections could be dwarfed by large-scale write-offs of bad loans. Banks keep silent about the true extent of their problems. Under Japanese regulations they are not required to publish figures for the size of bad and doubtful debts. The Ministry of Finance may change the rules next year but even then many problem debts are expected to stay hidden. Outside estimates of the bad and doubtful loans of the big banks range up to Y20,000bn. Not all this money will be lost because banks could eventually sell land held as security. Some banks are much worse off than others. Long-term credit banks and trust banks generally have stronger BIS ratios than commercial banks. But their exposure to problem debtors is also bigger. City banks generally are less exposed to property-related debts because their branch networks gave them better information about market conditions and the status of borrowers. Each lurch of the Nikkei prompts banks to reassess their BIS ratios. They must watch the yen, too, since exchange rate movements alter the value of overseas assets, and so change the ratios. So far Japanese banks have managed to keep their problem debts mainly under cover. However, if the Nikkei falls any lower or the bad debts go much higher, some banks at least would find it impossible to meet the regulators' requirements.  ----------------------------------------- JAPANESE BANKS BIS RATIOS SEPTEMBER 1991  ----------------------------------------- Bank            BIS ratio (%)  ----------------------------------------- Dai Ichi Kangyo      8.38 Mitsui Taiyo Kobe    7.56 Sumitomo             8.94 Fuji                 8.72 Mitsubishi           8.72 Sanwa                8.50 Tokai                8.34 Tokyo                8.44 Kyowa Saitama        8.90 Daiwa                9.02 Hokkaido Takushoku   8.82  ----------------------------------------- Source: Salomon Bros  -----------------------------------------</p>

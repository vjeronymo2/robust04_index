			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Australia seeks funds to clean up N-test site THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment will hold talks in London today seeking additional British funding to clean up former British nuclear test sites in South Australia. Senator Gareth Evans, foreign minister, and Mr Simon Crean, energy minister, are to meet Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, with new evidence suggesting Britain may have deliberately misrepresented the extent of radioactive contamination at the Australian test sites. Under a previous agreement with Australia, Britain's responsibility to fund the clean-up of sites in Maralinga and Emu Plains in South Australia ended in 1968. However, an article in the New Scientist reports that recently declassified American documents showed the British knew in the early 1960s that radioactivity at the test sites was worse than first thought. Australia is now seeking ADollars 60m (Pounds 26.50m) to clean up the areas, plus ADollars 45m to compensate aboriginal tribes that originally occupied the sites. The Australian government under Sir Robert Menzies, the then prime minister, offered the test sites to the British during the cold war years. Tests were conducted between 1952 and 1963. Nine atomic explosions were carried out at Maralinga and Emu Plains, in addition to three explosions off the coast of Western Australia.</p>

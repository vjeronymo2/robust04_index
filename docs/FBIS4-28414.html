			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The repatriation of Kim  In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop, unconverted  long-term prisoners in South Korea, were demanded in different  countries.    The Guinean Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification  in  a statement on May 24 said that old men Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan, who were taken prisoners during the Korean war, should  have been sent back to the Northern half of Korea in accordance  with the Korean Armistice Agreement, but they suffered pains in  South Korean prison for 30 years and are now living a lonely  life without the support of their families and relatives after  their release.    The South Korean authorities must immediately send them back  to the Northern half of the country where their families and  relatives are waiting for them, stressed the statement.    The Portuguese Committee for Supporting the Independent and  Peaceful Reunification of Korea in an appeal on May 23 demanded  that old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan be repatriated to the  Northern half of Korea at once and unconverted long-term  prisoner An Hak-sop be set free.    The South Korean authorities claim that the fascist  dictatorial regime has been replaced by a "civilian government",  but the people are not ensured even elementary freedom, the  appeal noted, and strongly demanded that the "National Security  Law," a fascist law, be scrapped without delay.    The Mongolia-Korea Friendship Association in a letter to the  International Committee of the Red Cross on May 21 called for  helping old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan go back soon to their  hometowns to enjoy human rights.</p>

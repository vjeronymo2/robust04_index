			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS PICTURE WORTH AT LEAST A FEW WORDS  </P> <P> Here we go again. The Times' photo of Charles White's "phantom" touchdown in  the 1979 Rose Bowl is sure to stir up controversy.  </P> <P> Why don't we give a slide of the picture and a light table to a team of Times  staff writers and be done with it.  </P> <P> I'm sure they'll come to three conclusions: It really was a touchdown, we are  SC, and the rest of the world are whiners.  </P> <P> ALBERT CANEDO  </P> <P> Yucaipa  </P></p>

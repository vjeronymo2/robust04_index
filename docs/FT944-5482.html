			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail close to finalising Bailey deal The Daily Mail and General Trust is expected to win the right to push ahead with the Pounds 92m acquisition of T Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post, despite the opposition of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It is believed a deal is close to being finalised between the DMGT and the Department of Trade and Industry, under which the publishers of the Daily Mail will make a number of compromises in order to get a deal. The deal on offer would involve DMGT setting up independent editorial boards for the main Bailey Forman titles to protect both their editorial independence and local roots. In addition, peripheral businesses would have to be sold. The compromise has not yet been formally accepted by DMGT, but it is considered likely that it will do so. The national and regional newspaper group was given until December 5 to convince Mr Tim Eggar, the trade secretary, that the deal should go ahead, despite the MMC view that the bid could operate against the public interest. The main MMC objection was that the DMGT already owned the nearby Leicester Mercury and Derby Evening Telegraph through its Northcliffe Newspapers subsidiary. This would give DMGT too high a concentration in the east Midlands area. Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail, told the government that the acquisition should remain blocked. The Bailey Forman group was put up for sale this summer in an auction organised by BZW, the merchant bank. The final sale price was very much at the higher end of newspaper industry expectations. If the deal were to fall through, it would pose considerable difficulties for Bailey Forman. Bids from other potential owners could start at about Pounds 20m less than the DMGT bid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- "My visit to the Czech  Republic was very successful. Opportunities to intensify  bilateral relations in different sectors are opening up,"  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said on his return from  Prague today. His talks there focused on economic issues and  the two countries' adjustment to the new environment.    Mr. Daskalov said work was in progress on the agreements on  the avoidance of double taxation and on investment promotion.  Bulgaria and the Czech Republic expressed willingness to hold  talks on setting up a free trade zone which would allow  businessmen to step up two-way trade. "Our problems are  identical: Both countries want to become integrated into  Europe," Mr. Daskalov said. The Czech officials showed an  interest in Bulgaria's position on the situation in the former  Yugoslavia, he said.    "I had an interesting meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus. Being one of the greatest experts in reforms, he was  interested in their progress in Bulgaria, as well as in the  political situation," Mr. Daskalov said. On commission of  President Zhelyu Zhelev, he handed over to Czech President  Vaclav Havel archive records on the 1968 events and Bulgaria's  participation in them. This act was highly praised. "By the  way, Bulgaria is the last country to deliver these documents and  Czech journalists asked me why we had not done so earlier," Mr.  Daskalov said.    The agreement on visa-free entry clearance signed in Prague  allows Bulgarians to spend up to a month in Prague and return  home quite pleased, Mr. Daskalov said.    While in Prague, the Bulgarian foreign minister was also  received by Chairman of the Czech parliament Milan Uhde.</p>

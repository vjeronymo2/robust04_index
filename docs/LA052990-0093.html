			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE SOFTBALL WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> UCLA'S DRIVE TO TITLE IS OVERNIGHT SUCCESS  </P> <P> Heather Compton had to wait a day to resume pitching UCLA to its third  consecutive NCAA women's College World Series championship. But she didn't let  it bother her.  </P> <P> "There was no hesitation," Compton said after UCLA defeated Frenso State, 2-0,  Monday. "You get really nervous. You have to turn that nervousness into  excitement, and I tried to go out there and do my best."  </P> <P> Compton and UCLA led, 1-0, after 2 1/2 innings of play Sunday, but the game was  postponed because of rain. She finished a one-hit, five-strikeout performance  Monday.  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Sharron Backus said it was difficult to determine what effect, if  any, the delay had on her team.  </P> <P> "It's hard to say. We were extremely tired. I got a couple of hours of sleep,"  Backus said.  </P> <P> "I didn't know which team was going to wake up this morning, or whether Fresno  was going to come in and take it away."  </P> <P> The Bruins (62-6) scored in the first inning on two singles and a wild pitch  and in the third on two singles and a sacrifice.  </P> <P> Compton (18-1) had a perfect game going into the fifth inning, but gave up a  single to leadoff batter Kerri Donis.  </P> <P> Terry Carpenter took the loss for Fresno State (61-15).  </P> <P> The Bruins have won six of the last eight NCAA titles, but Fresno State Coach  Margie Wright doesn't believe in a UCLA dynasty.  </P> <P> "The only dynasty they have is in their own heads," she said. "When the other  teams believe they can start the same thing, then they can do it. I thought  this year was the year someone would do that. I think other teams allow that to  happen."  </P></p>

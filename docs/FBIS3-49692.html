Speaking at a press conference of the government coalition  Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL), which he belongs to, Baudys stressed that the project  had been drafted as a dynamic one, which would make possible  adaptation between NATO and the countries interested in joining  NATO, "...with the possibility of greatly accelerating the  process if necessary," Baudys said.    At the same time, it is necessary to open up the Czech  Republic's defense budget, which would be subject to civil and  democratic oversight, and to prepare certain military units for  possible joint operations, Baudys stated.    He said that the project was of a markedly individual  character and did not count on the creation of regional defense  associations or groups. "Of course, certain regional  cooperation is counted on in the areas where it is needed,"  Baudys added.    He appreciated the fact that at the Prague talks on the  partnership program, U.S. President Bill Clinton had underlined  not only military cooperation, but also economic cooperation as  cornerstones of the project.    The chairwoman of the opposition Left Bloc party (LB) Marie  Stiborova said at her party's press conference today that  Partnership for Peace did not solve the question of European  security and de facto confirmed the strategic geopolitical  security vacuum.    The project is in line with the LB opinion that it is  necessary to seek new solutions which correspond to the dramatic  and dynamic development of security relations in Central and  Eastern Europe. "A simple expansion of NATO cannot bring  positive solutions," Stiborova said. She added that worn-out  models, including NATO, presented no way of achieving European  security.    That is why the LB opposes the Czech Republic's joining any  military pact which would be aimed against the remaining part of  Europe, Stiborova emphasized. The LB favors the creation of new  mechanisms of European security to be based on the principle of  collective security and excluding any possibility of one  European country's action against another, she said.</p>

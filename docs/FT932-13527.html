			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Barclays' US issue raised to Dollars 500m BARCLAYS, the UK clearing bank, yesterday increased to Dollars 500m from Dollars 300m the amount it is raising in the US through an innovative issue of convertible capital, following strong demand from retail and institutional investors. The fixed-rate notes count as tier two capital for regulatory purposes, but are convertible into non-cumulative preference shares, which count as tier one capital, at the bank's option. Strong demand for the bonds, which carry an 8 per cent coupon, was accounted for by the premium they offered over US Treasuries. If converted, the bonds would yield 9.25 per cent inclusive of advance corporation tax in the UK, leaving US tax-paying investors with a net yield of just below 8 per cent, Barclays said.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds lead equities to successful recovery - Market Report More favourable news on economic progress, reflected in firmer bond prices, encouraged a rally in the UK stock market yesterday. A steadier opening to the new session on Wall Street confirmed London's improvement and the FT-SE 100-share Index climbed 28.1 to close at 2,984.4, taking it once again into what has been seen as a support zone. However, traders hastened to point out that the real test of the market's confidence will come this afternoon when the US payroll and unemployment data will flash across the trading screens. Equities took their lead early from an improvement in British government bonds, which had stood up better to the shocks that upset equities in the previous session. Stock index futures were also in a more positive mode. The rally was extended on the news that UK manufacturing output had dipped by 0.3 per cent in August, a welcome indication to the equity market of reduced economic pressure for a further rise in UK base rates. The Footsie quickly extended its early gain to around 30 points, recapturing the 2,985 area whose loss added to the general woe in the previous session. Interest then slackened off until Wall Street opened, and even then a dip of 2.69 in the Dow during London hours left the UK market with little to go for. The Footsie closed just below the day's best and stock index futures were still at a discount to the fair value premium, which allows for carrying costs and dividend flow on the shares in the contract. Trading volume of 579.7m shares through the Seaq network remained moderate, compared with 517.1m on Wednesday, when retail business was worth a respectable Pounds 1.41bn. Some trading houses claimed to have scented a more optimistic mood in New York ahead of today's publication of the September payroll figures. There was no wish to take large share positions, and traders remained very wary of the savage falls recorded in the market this week. However, suggestions that some marketmakers had been seriously hurt were believed to be exaggerated. Market strategists have been favourably impressed by the relative steadiness in bonds this week and believe that this may be laying the foundations for a genuine recovery in the stock market. However, the renewed optimism towards base rate prospects which followed release yesterday of the August manufacturing output data would be unlikely to survive any negative news on employment numbers from the US today. Most of the gains in share prices yesterday could be ascribed purely to technical recovery from the setback on Wednesday. Marketmaking firms were content to mark prices higher on fairly thin demand, but were not actively in search of stock. Views on prospects for the London market towards the end of the year remained very mixed. Some chartists warned that if the Footsie proves unable to hold at its present levels, it could find itself unsupported - 'right down to 2,200,' according to one of the more pessimistic commentators. However, the market appeared significantly more calm at last night's close and traders hoped that if today's US data can be taken aboard safely, then a more genuine recovery in share prices may set in. Flemings, the London-based securities house, believes that, provided that base rates remain unchanged until the new year and the November Budget reveals significant reductions in spending programmes, then the end of December could bring a rally in both equities and government bonds. But it expects consumer spending power to remain squeezed, with margin stagnation continuing to be a problem for many leading UK companies.</p>

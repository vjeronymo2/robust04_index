			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / MPs rap Revenue on inheritance tax stance The Inland Revenue was criticised yesterday by the Commons public accounts committee for failure to impose more stringent penalties against inheritance tax fraud and negligence, Andrew Jack writes. MPs on the committee called on the Revenue to review the level of penalties and ensure that they were sufficient to provide 'a just remedy and an effective deterrent'. They said it was unsatisfactory that under the present arrangement the cost of producing evidence of fraud was often considered too high to justify the effort because of the low value of penalties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from UN Headquarters] </F>   [Text] On 17 June, James Rubin, a spokesman for the U.S.  mission to the United Nations stated that consultations at the  UN Security Council are proceeding without interruptions on the  sanction resolution against North Korea.    Mr. Rubin was instructed by Madeline Albright, U.S.  ambassador to the United Nations, to make this point clear.    This notwithstanding, Pak Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador  to  the United Nations, stated to reporters that the North Korean  Government will not allow special inspections [tukbyol sachal]  for two facilities suspected to be nuclear waste processing  facilities.    On 16 June, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci said:  As a way to a general solution of the situation, North Korea  expressed its willingness to completely accept safeguards  regulations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the  International Atomic Energy Agency, including special  inspections.    North Korean Ambassador Pak Kil-yon spurned Assistant  Secretary of State Gallucci's remarks, stating that this was  either Mr. Gallucci's personal interpretation or his personal  pronouncement.</p>

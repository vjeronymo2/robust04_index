			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ramon Melenciano] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 28 Feb (EFE) -- A report from the  Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace, which says that the  Dominican Government is violating the UN embargo against the  Haitian coupist military leaders, is a false accusation,  Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told EFE  on 28 February.    Herrera Cabral said that the Dominican Republic is complying  with the UN sanctions and only sends "humanitarian aid" to  Haiti. He added that the accusation has been made at a time  when Haitian Catholic bishops are trying to obtain UN permission  to transport fuel from Dominican territory to face the critical  situation in Haiti.    The Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace published a  report in Port-au-Prince today saying Dominican and Haitian  soldiers are involved in fuel trafficking to Haiti, which is  facing a blockade since the ousting of Constitutional President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991.    Herrera Cabral said the report is false and contradicts a  request from Haitian bishops and civilian assistance  organizations demanding permission for the entrance of more  products to reduce the misery in Haiti, which has increased with  the embargo. Herrera Cabral deplored that the "commission"  should dedicate its efforts to supervising the border between  the two countries to verify if the Dominican Government is  complying or not with the embargo.    He added that the commission should dedicate its efforts to  plans that will make it possible to improve the calamitous  situation afflicting the poor people of Haiti, who are living in  misery. "They are wasting their time, because we (the Dominican  Government) are complying with the sanctions and they should  dedicate their time to fight poverty," Herrera Cabral told EFE.    Herrera Cabral, however, did not rule out the possibility  that "some gallons of fuel" could cross the border, but not with  the government's permission. Herrera Cabral reminded the  Haitian Commission for Justice and Peace that last week the  Dominican Armed Forces Ministry punished an officer involved in  fuel trafficking to Haiti and that vigilance at the border is  constant and strict. He reiterated that he does not understand  the reason for the "false reports at a time when Catholic  bishops are requesting aid."    Today, the Dominican Foreign Ministry announced that the UN  Security Council and the UN Sanctions Committee authorized the  country to send food, propane gas, agricultural products, and  other staples to the Haitian people, within the concept of  "humanitarian aid" permitted by that international organization.  In announcing the UN authorization, Herrera Cabral explained  that the Dominican Republic will continue implementing the  embargo that seeks the return of democracy to Haiti.    In its protest, the Haitian commission also accused the  United Nations of permitting the violations and not supervising  the Dominican Republic's compliance with the sanctions.    Herrera Cabral said that the United Nations are aware that  the Dominican Republic is complying with the embargo, and  rejected a recommendation that the international organization  should control the Dominican-Haitian border.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS RIDE A CASE OF MONKEY BUSINESS  </P> <P> A troupe of performing chimpanzees became unwitting cohorts in a simian joy  ride Saturday morning, when a man stole a van sitting outside a gas station in  Castaic.  </P> <P> Larry Sturchen, a 30-year-old transient, was arrested on suspicion of grand  theft auto, grand theft property and drunk driving by Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies after a 15-minute chase.  </P> <P> Deputies apprehended Sturchen on a dirt road west of Interstate 5, said Sgt.  David Stunson of the Santa Clarita Valley station.  </P> <P> Gregory Lille, who owns the six male and female chimpanzees worth about  $100,000, was transporting the performing animals from his Auburn-based  business, Going Ape Animal Rental, to Los Angeles, Lille's secretary said. But  she was uncertain where Lille was headed.  </P> <P> The auto theft occurred after Lille left the keys in the ignition of his 1981  Ford van while shopping at a Shell gas station mini-mart in the 31400 block of  Parker Road at 2:30 a.m., Stunson said.  </P> <P> When Lille returned to his car, the van was gone along with its six primate  occupants, Stunson said.  </P> <P> Lille called sheriff's deputies, who were still at the gas station when  Sturchen drove past the mini-mart and Lille identified his van to officers,  Stunson said.  </P> <P> The deputies chased the van, which was weaving erratically on the road for  about 15 minutes, he said.  </P> <P> Sturchen stopped the van after the road became too steep and narrow for him to  continue. He was ordered out of the vehicle by deputies, Stunson said.  </P> <P> "It appears that the man had been drinking a bit to much," Sgt. Gary Sinclair  said later. "It's obvious he didn't make a real successful getaway."  </P></p>

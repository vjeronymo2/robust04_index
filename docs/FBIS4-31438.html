			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 8 (ATA) -- The trial of ten former  senior officials of the communist system in Albania continued  yesterday with testimonies from witnesses. Defendants Adil  Carcani and Manush Myftiu did not appear in the court because of  their serious health problems and they were defended by their  attorneys.    Nine intellectuals, called the group of Ballsh, were  arrested  on September 21, 1982. On September 23 and 27 of the same year  they were tried by Fehmi Abdiu (now a Socialist Party deputy)  and they were sentenced with 69 years of imprisonment, 35 years  in concentration camps, and 35 years of denial of the right to  take part in elections. Five out of the nine intellectuals,  Muhamet Xhaferri, Selfo Pasha, Vullnet Arabicka, Musa Begaj, and  Spiro Sofroni were witnesses in the yesterday's session. The  witnesses responded questions by the defence attorneys and  explained the circumstances of their detention, sentencing and  internment, underlining the negative role of Defendant Zylyftar  Ramizi in the trial. The families of the witnesses had been  sent to concentration camps upon a decision of the commission of  concentration camps three days before the present witnesses were  tried.    Seven other witnesses, members of the formerly persecuted  families under the motivation "persons of great danger for the  society," witnessed as well. Other witnesses were Fatbardh and  Riza Caniku, expelled for an unlimited term for having a bad  biography; Sutkie Konica expelled because her mother was a  Yugoslav national; Saryhan Merdani, interned together with her  relatives for bad biography; Mimoza Sherifi, Perparim Skendo,  and Pertef Gega, also sent to concentration camps for the same  reason. The next session opens on June 8, at 1600.</p>

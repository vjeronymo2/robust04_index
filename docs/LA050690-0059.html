			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: STUPID FRECKLE TRICKS  </P> <P> If NBC is successful, the old "Howdy Doody Show" will be resurrected -- with  David Letterman involved. No, the late-night TV host -- who bears something of  a resemblance to the gap-toothed cowboy marionette of TV legend -- would not  play Howdy.  </P> <P> He's been approached to take over the role of host from Buffalo Bob Smith, NBC  chief Brandon Tartikoff tells us.  </P> <P> "We have had several conversations with David Letterman and his production  staff about doing a new version of 'Howdy Doody' for Saturday mornings,"  Tartikoff says.  </P> <P> The discussions are only at the talking stage; Letterman's representatives  aren't commenting.  </P> <P> If Letterman agrees, the network is considering the show for fall, 1991. The  original show ran 1947 to 1960 on NBC, then was syndicated briefly in 1976.  </P> <P> The proposed "Howdy Doody" revival is part of Tartikoff's plan to beef up  Saturday mornings at a time when network cartoon programs are steadily losing  viewers to offerings from cable and independent stations.

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Yeltsin signals change in economic policy MR BORIS YELTSIN has signalled a sharp change of course in Russian economic policy in the face of rising public discontent. The turnround was highlighted at the weekend when the Russian president said he would resist pressure from the International Monetary Fund to raise energy prices to world levels and fired his energy minister, who supported price liberalisation. He confessed his unease over the effects of radical economic reforms in talks with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, on Saturday. According to Mr Delors, Mr Yeltsin told him that 'the Russian people still support me - but their patience has its limit'. Mr Yeltsin met Mr Delors on his return to Moscow after a tour of Russian provincial centres where he was the target of fierce criticism about the effects of economic reform. Mr Yeltsin's remarks follow serious difficulties in the Russian cabinet with its reform programme. Last week, the Russian parliament refused to pass laws on privatisation and bankruptcy, threatening the planned transfer of state property into private hands - the core of the government's economic strategy. The Russian president told a weekend conference of managers of the country's oil and gas enterprises that he would resist pressure from the IMF to raise energy prices. Instead, an 'expert group' has been established to analyse the effects of energy price rises. Mr Yeltsin dismissed from office Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the energy minister, and replaced him with Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former Soviet minister of the gas industry. Mr Lopukhin had been a supporter of free energy prices. He failed to stop the fall in oil production and in recent weeks has faced a rising threat of strikes in the oil producing regions. Mr Delors said at the weekend that Mr Yeltsin had complained to him that none of the Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13bn) of foreign assistance put up by the leading foreign industrial countries and the IMF had been paid. The Russian president told Mr Delors he would press for a more efficient mechanism of payment at his meeting with G7 leaders in Munich next month. Mr Yegor Gaidar the first deputy prime minister, pressed Mr Delors for a five-year moratorium of repayments of Russian debt to western countries - estimated at about Dollars 62bn - and for a relaxation of the Cocom rules which prohibit the export of advanced technology from the industrial countries to Russia. Mr Delors said he cautioned the Russian leaders against 'expecting too much from Munich' and said the conference would set stiff conditions for Russia and the other former Soviet states. Mr Gaidar said yesterday that the Russian government planned a big increase in the print run of rouble notes in the next two months - including the introduction of a new Rbs5,000 note - to try to alleviate a cash shortage caused by soaring prices, AP-DJ reports from Moscow. Speaking on Commonwealth television, he said that, although likely to fuel inflation, a boost in the money supply was the only way to soothe an 'explosive situation' in the economy and among workers whose payrolls had not been met.

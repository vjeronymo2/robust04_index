			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> QB SUES COLTS FOR $50,000  </P> <P> Chris Chandler, the Indianapolis Colts' unhappy quarterback, filed a lawsuit  today seeking a $50,000 workout bonus he says the team owes him.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in Marion County Court, also seeks to have his contract with  the NFL team rescinded.  </P> <P> Chandler reported for training camp Thursday at Anderson University but walked  out the next day after the Colts refused to give him the bonus.  </P> <P> Chandler claims he worked out at the Colts complex for the 16 weeks required to  receive the bonus. However, Colts officials said he had not participated to the  degree necessary to satisfy his contract, which called for workouts two hours a  day for five days each week.  </P> <P> Chandler's suit also seeks $5,000 for each day the bonus is unpaid, and  attorneys fees.  </P> <P> Chandler, who returned to his home in Seattle Friday, was starting quarterback  for the Colts last season before being injured.  </P></p>

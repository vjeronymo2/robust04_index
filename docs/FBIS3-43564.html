			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  SUNDAY STAR </H6>   IFP Election Decision -- The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  "has  about 12 weeks in which to prepare for the most important  election in the country's history but stubbornly refuses to play  in the only game in town," an editorial in johannesburg SUNDAY  STAR in English on 9 January on page 26 notes. While IFP  "leaders now seem intent on destroying their only hope of access  to the real political game," IFP leader Buthelezi "knows all  about the reins of power." But Buthelezi "carries some heavy  baggage: in the Freedom Alliance, the infantile idea of a  boerestaat [Boer homeland] and harliners within his central  committee." "And for months pragmatic IFP leaders have indicated  their disapproval of hardliners calling the shots." "In this  context the IFP decision to stay out of the election makes some  sense. Buthelezi needs time to throw out the baggage and then  focus his energy and resources to secure power for the IFP in  Natal. Perhaps Buthelezi is serious about staying out of the  election. If that is true, he has lost touch with reality."  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   ANC Violence Myths -- While "opinion polls indicate that  violence is the single biggest concern among all South  Africans," "the ANC [African National Congress] as the  government-in-waiting, has shown such ambivalence towards the  question of policing that it has contributed mightily to the  growth of lawlessness," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY  TIMES in English on 9 January on page 18 notes. Its response has  been "a retreat to mythology. It still clings to the  `third-force' theory of a government-orchestrated campaign of  destabilisation against it." The editorial considers the ANC  logic "faulty," as the police are "largely impotent," stripped  of their "dreadful array of powers," "keeping their heads down."  The ANC's response has been to "establish its own self-defense  units. It has neither the skill nor the discipline to keep them  in check. Banditry has consumed places like the East Rand."  "Caught between the impotence of the police and the incompetence  of the ANC, the criminals and political warlords have  flourished." The ANC must "make a decisive break with the past.  It must accept the existing police force, defective as it may  be, is the nucleus of the force that it will have to use after  April 27" and "discipline among ANC members must be enforced."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   ANC Election List `Mishmash' -- The ANC PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region issued its list of nominees  for the provincial legislature and the National Assembly last  week, which included "people who are not ANC members or are  known not to share the same values with those of the ANC or any  of its allied organisations," an editorial in Johannesburg  SUNDAY NATION in English on 9 January on page 8 notes. "We doubt  whether this is a wise move from the ANC leadership. Our  understanding of the ANC is that it is an organisation that grew  into what it is today by upholding certain values. To uphold  these values would then be a prerequisite for anyone wanting to  join the ANC, let alone being one of its leaders." Now, it seems  "that the ANC first sought to appoint leaders and then hoped  that they would imbibe ANC values. This is a recipe for  disaster." The "other disturbing feature" is that the ANC "made  the list public without informing some of the nominees." "We  hope that next week's ANC national list conference will take  account of these issues and take the necessary corrective  measures before all other things go wrong."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky met  representatives of [ethnic] Serbs in Hungary today. Before his  departure to Yugoslavia on Thursday [27 January] he wanted to  gather information on their situation, to be able to forward  their possible request to Belgrade. Kata Peli Nagy reports.    [Peli Nagy] The Serbs of Hungary are also interested in the  improvement of Serbian-Hungarian relations because they affect  the situation of Serbs in Hungary in a favorable way.  Therefore, Hungary's Serb minority of several thousand  unanimously welcomes Jeszenszky's Belgrade visit, which is to  take place the day after tomorrow. The chairman and deputy  chairman of the Democratic Association of Serbs in Hungary told  "Chronicle" a few minutes before the beginning of the  ministerial meeting: The embargo against Serbia has made keeping  contacts with the mother country much more difficult. The  situation of teachers who came here to work is unresolved,  cultural cooperation is difficult, and links which had been in  place have partly been interrupted.    If Jeszenszky intends to receive information on the  situation  of Hungary's Serbs--numbering about 5,000 to 10,000--the two  representatives will raise, among other things, the question of  constitutional cultural autonomy, since the Minority Law  declares the right to cultural autonomy, but the rights of  minorities in connection with this are unclear. To establish  autonomy there is a need for a network of cultural institutions  and, first and foremost, money. Peter Lasic, the deputy  chairman of the association, said that, in their view, the  return of Serb church properties would be delayed and the  financial situation of the single Serb secondary school should  be resolved as well, particularly since the split of the  Serbo-Croat educational institution.    The Serb minority representatives, as it is expected to  happen in Belgrade too, will probably raise the unsettled matter  of parliamentary representation [of minorities] as well.</p>

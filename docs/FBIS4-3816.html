			<p>BFN     [Text] Suggestions that conditions be placed on MFN (most  favoured nation) trading status for China have been dismissed as  impractical by Director-General of Trade Tony Miller.    Mr Miller, responding to questions at the launch of the  Trade  Department's Customer Liaison Group yesterday, renewed his call  to the United States Government for unconditional renewal. He  said: "I do not think customs officers in America would be able  to distinguish goods that were made at a state-owned factory or  other factories. Partial renewal of MFN is not practical. I do  not think it will help Hong Kong, it will create uncertainty and  would be just as damaging as withdrawing MFN." His comments  came on the eve of Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang's  visit to the U.S. to lobby for MFN.    Earlier, Mr Miller launched the 30-member liaison group,  which aims to improve communications between traders and  officials. He said: "A new feature of this year's performance  pledge is the enhancement of customer input. The setting up of  the Customer Liaison Group aims to provide for a direct and  ongoing dialogue between the department and our officials. Our  customers' concerns are our concerns. The department will take  the group's suggestions and feedback seriously ."</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT ;  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR INEXPENSIVE PHOTO PROCESSING? TRY LAKE ONTARIO;  </P> <P> THE WATERWAY IS SO FULL OF POLLUTING CHEMICALS IT ACTUALLY CAN DEVELOP  PHOTOGRAPHS. AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT ONE LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS. AND HE HAS THE  BLACK AND WHITES TO PROVE IT.  </P> <P> First it was the Cuyahoga, the river in Cleveland that was so polluted it  caught fire. Now, there's Lake Ontario, the lake that's so full of chemicals it  develops photographs.  </P> <P> Or so says Jeremy Lynch, a third-year photography student at Ryerson  Polytechnical Institute here. Lynch has a portfolio of black-and-white pictures  of the Toronto lake front developed, he says, in water from the lake itself. He  says he added no chemicals.  </P> <P> "It's really scary," said Lynch. "I have one print that's almost like a regular  photograph," so perfect is the quality of the image.  </P> <P> Officials at Eastman Kodak say they are skeptical of Lynch's claims, but his  professor at Ryerson, Bill Scanlon, stands behind his student.  </P> <P> "He's not pulling the wool over anybody's eyes, by any means," Scanlon said.  "People have done this before, but nobody paid that much attention."  </P> <P> Nor does it come as any surprise to Toronto environmental and health officials  that something is wrong with Lake Ontario, the source of this city's drinking  water. "This gives us a bit of a picture of the state of the water today," said  Bob Pickett, Toronto's assistant director of water pollution control.  </P> <P> Lynch got interested in the photographic potential of lake water last spring,  when he was drinking in a bar with some friends and a heavy rain was falling  outside. Lynch gazed out at the downpour and thought about acid rain, which has  been killing marine life in the lakes of southern Ontario for years.  </P> <P> "I knew acid rain doesn't develop film," Lynch says, but he began thinking that  maybe lake water would.  </P> <P> The photographer says he first called various provincial environmental  officials to ask where he could find water heavily contaminated with mercury  and iron, chemicals that were used to develop daguerreotypes in the early years  of photography. The officials refused to give out such information, he says, so  he set off by himself to the Lake Ontario shoreline. He took samples of water  from near places that struck him as promising: factories, a shipyard, an  airport, a beach, the mouth of a canal, a ferry landing.  </P> <P> "Of course, I did it in the worst possible places," he says, adding that he  made his rounds on calm days, when there were no waves to disperse the scum  floating at the water's edge.  </P> <P> Next, Lynch exposed some film and put it into film-developing canisters with  his various water samples.  </P> <P> Darkroom chemicals take about 10 minutes to develop a roll of film, but lake  water turns out to take a lot longer. Lynch says he started developing his film  at 8 a.m., and the negatives didn't come up on the film until the afternoon of  the following day. Lynch said he swirled the contents of the canisters every  half an hour or so, to keep the pollutants dispersed in the water. He says he  spent the night hitting the 20-minute "snooze" bar on his alarm clock to do so.  </P> <P> Some water samples produced no negatives. Water from the beach, for instance,  was full of bacteria that ate the emulsion off Lynch's film, he says. The best  sample for developing turned out to be the one he took at the shipyard, where a  rusting old cargo vessel was apparently leaching a lot of iron into the water.  </P> <P> After he had his negatives, Lynch took his water samples to a local chemical  recycling plant for a professional analysis. His initial hunch, that mercury in  the water was developing the film, proved to be wrong; mercury appeared only in  minute quantities. But there was plenty of iron. And the shipyard sample also  turned out to contain about 1% diesel fuel, with lesser quantities of motor  oil, dye, varnish and paint.  </P> <P> Fuel oils and paints contain some of the same chemicals used in the modern  photo-finishing process, Lynch says.  </P> <P> Lynch's portfolio won't win any prizes for aesthetics; the pictures are rudely  composed and the tones run generally from white to gray, without many true  blacks to add interest. Lynch says he wants it that way. He said he tried to  shoot Toronto's lake front the way a tourist with a point-and-shoot camera  would, going for simple views rather than thoughtful composition. He likes it  that the lake water's suspended grit, fuzz and fibers left ghostly images on  his prints.  </P> <P> "Grain the size of golf balls," he says with satisfaction, pointing to a  blotchy sky in one of his pictures. He thinks the poor quality of the  photographs only adds to their environmental message.  </P> <P> Now that Lynch's Toronto collection is complete, he said he wants to travel to  the waterfronts of other great American cities and develop their images in the  local waters. Niagara Falls, the Statue of Liberty, Detroit's Renaissance  Center -- he thinks his treatment of each could provoke thought, or maybe even  action, on the part of viewers.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to make people think a lot more," he said. "Shoving  something down someone's throat is not as effective as showing him."  </P></p>

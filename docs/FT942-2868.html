			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / DTI cool on need for tidal barrage Construction of a tidal energy barrage across the Duddon Estuary in Cumbria would be technically feasible but not currently viable as a private sector electricity generating scheme, according to a study sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry. The study is the latest of a series of DTI reports into tidal barrage proposals for estuaries in England and Wales. All were judged uncommercial. They have also aroused environmental concern. The proposed Duddon barrage, costing about Pounds 258m, would generate more than 200m kWh a year of electricity. Cumbria county council is engaging consultants to produce a preliminary feasibility study into barrage or bridge crossings of Morecambe Bay, the Duddon estuary and the Solway Firth to improve coastal communications and aid economic regeneration.

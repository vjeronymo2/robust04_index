			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / West German current account balance to show small deficit The west German current account balance will show a small deficit both this year and next and growth in the west will slip to 2.5 per cent this year, according to the spring report of Germany's five leading economic institutes published today, writes David Goodhart in Bonn. The institutes expect average inflation in west Germany this year of 3.5 per cent (touching 4 per cent at the end of the year) and 11 per cent in east Germany (touching 15 per cent at the year's end). GNP in east Germany is expected to fall by 17.5 per cent. The report expresses cautious hopes of a construction-led turnaround in east Germany in 1992. But by the end of this year 3.5m people will be without work or on short-time work in the east. The institutes are critical of the large wage increases in east Germany and propose that the Treuhand agency, which owns most east German companies, should become involved in wage bargaining.</p>

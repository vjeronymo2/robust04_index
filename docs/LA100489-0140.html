			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HARVARD, WESTLAKE SCHOOLS TO MERGE  </P> <P> Harvard School for boys, widely considered among the most prestigious private  schools in Los Angeles, has decided to give up an 89-year tradition and merge  with Westlake School for girls, a private institution in Holmby Hills.  </P> <P> The 800-student Harvard School, in North Hollywood, is a one-time military  academy that is affiliated with the Los Angeles diocese of the Episcopal  Church. Both Harvard and the 680-student Westlake School send virtually all  graduates to four-year colleges.  </P> <P> Founded in 1904, Westlake -- like Harvard -- is known for emphasizing community  service among its students.  </P> <P> The boards of trustees of the two schools agreed on the merger Monday and  announced it to the schools' faculties, students and parents Tuesday. The  merged institution will be known as Harvard-Westlake School and will operate on  both campuses, with grades seven through nine at the Westlake campus and the  upper grades at the Harvard campus. The merger will not be complete until the  fall of 1991.  </P></p>

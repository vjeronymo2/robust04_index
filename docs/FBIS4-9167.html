			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by G. Mihajlovski: "Orthodox Messages to the </F> Americans"]    [Text] What was Yuriy Trushin, a representative of the  Russian Federation in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], doing at the news conference of the  Democratic Christian Party? If his intention was to impose  himself on the Macedonian public opinion or send an indirect  message to the Americans, whose additional troops have just  landed at Skopje airport, then why did he not do it at the news  conference of a larger minor party and in the presence of  politicians more-or-less heard of by the people? Particularly  because, only a day before, the same Russian diplomat held a  news conference with yet unclear motives in the Russian offices  in Skopje.    Trushin was diplomatically silent, while his host, the  president of the party, Vasil Ristevski, was explicit: "The  arrival of the U.S. soldiers in Macedonia means acceptance of  the position of a protectorate!" He also said that Trushin  would speak to the Macedonian authority about including Russian  soldiers in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in  Macedonia.    The journalists got no further information at this news  conference except for the profitable knowledge about Macedonia  as a protectorate and the Russian soldiers who are going to save  our Orthodox religion. Trushin did not say much about  Russian-Macedonian relations, because "there were more questions  than answers." He does not know when the Russian Embassy will  be opened in Skopje, because it was a "technical question."  Trushin also does not know if Macedonia is threatened by Serbia  "because he has been here for only three months, and accurate  facts are needed for that." It is true that he told us that it  was necessary to have a border between us and Yugoslavia as with  all the other neighbors, because Russia recognized us as a  sovereign state and it also advised us to make an agreement with  Serbia, because the border is "still administrative, that is of  a conditioned character."    In order to do it all in the frameworks of the religious  name  of the party, there were also discussions about the relations  between the Russian and the Macedonian Orthodox Church. It was  all "in the name of spiritual unification of the Orthodox world."    The Russian diplomat confused us on Tuesday when he called  us  to a news conference where he spoke about Bosnia. Yesterday, he  confused us because he was the one to determine the agenda of a  news conference of a Macedonian party. If Mr. Trushin thinks  that his appearance yesterday is not a kind of interference in  the internal political life of Macedonia and if he announced  that "all groups and parties that wish to cooperate with us can  call us to a news conference," it means that in a few days we  can see the Russian diplomat [whose embassy had to be opened at  the beginning of March, as Vitaliy Churkin announced during his  unexpected visit to Macedonia] at a news conference held by  Dragisa Miletic from the Democratic Party of the Serbs, or with  a new communist movement collecting signatures against the  Americans. Like Vasil Ristevski, they also think that the  Americans will make a protectorate out of us, and they want the  Russians on the border with Serbia!    Here is another question for consideration: How will the  Macedonian state react if tomorrow, for instance, the diplomatic  representative of Albania holds a news conference within the PDP  [Party for Democratic Prosperity] or the party of Taci [PDP  faction]?</p>

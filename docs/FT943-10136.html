			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuity rates The table (right) shows the latest compulsory purchase annuity rates for those with Pounds 100,000 to invest. Since the payout can vary greatly between life offices, it is important for those buying an annuity to shop around for the most suitable and the best rate. 'The annuities market has slowed from the rapid increases it experienced during the first half of the year especially after gilt rates, upon which annuity rates are dependent, dropped by half a percent over the last month,' said Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau. 'A number of providers have lowered their rates since the last annuity table, with Royal Life dropping by 2 per cent and the Prudential by 1.9 per cent. Companies which have increased their annuity rates include Britannic Assurance, Axa Equity &amp; Law, Equitable Life and Norwich Union.' William Burrows, of Annuity Direct, said: 'After a stable period for annuity rates in June, rates increased slightly in the middle of July. Since January annuity rates have increased by over 14 per cent, a direct response to the increase in gilt yields. 'The future trend for annuity rates will be influenced by expectations for inflation and interest rates. 'The indicators suggest that annuity rates will continue to increase, albeit slowly. However, I do not expect rates to rise significantly during the rest of summer even if interest rates are increased.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LATEST ANNUITY RATES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Compulsory purchase level annuity  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 55                Annuity    Female age 50             Annuity      Months movement  +2.5%                Months movement  -1.4% Equitable Life    Pounds 10,284.00    Equitable Life    Pounds 8,967.00 Prudential         Pounds 9,845.52    Scottish Widows   Pounds 8,900.04 Sun Life of Canada Pounds 9,817.11    Norwich Union     Pounds 8,897.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 60                Annuity    Female age 60             Annuity      Months movement  +3.4%                Months movement  +0.4% Equitable Life     Pounds 11,196.96   Equitable Life   Pounds 10,014.00 RNPFN              Pounds 10,788.00   RNPFN             Pounds 9,815.00 Sun Life of Canada Pounds 10,674.77   Canada Life       Pounds 9,798.36  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male age 70                Annuity    Female age 70             Annuity      Months movement  +2.6%                Months movement  +1.6% RNPFN             Pounds 14,310.00    RNPFN            Pounds 12,376.00 Equitable Life    Pounds 14,138.04    Equitable Life   Pounds 12,201.00 Canada Life       Pounds 13,865.52    Canada Life      Pounds 12,023.76  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint Life - 100% spouse's benefit  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 60/Female 57         Annuity     Male 65/Female 63         Annuity      Months movement  -0.9%                Months movement  +0.006% Equitable Life    Pounds 9,081.96     Equitable Life    Pounds 9,698.04 Prudential        Pounds 8,970.24     Canada Life       Pounds 9,557.52 Norwich Union     Pounds 8,970.16     Prudential        Pounds 9,512.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All payments are monthly in advance.

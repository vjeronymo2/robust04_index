			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Blair wins shift in policy on united Ireland Mr Tony Blair yesterday forced through a historic shift in his party's policy on Ireland when the Labour conference dropped its commitment to campaign for unity between the north and the south. Following the recent IRA ceasefire, the conference overwhelmingly accepted a statement by Labour's national executive committee which stressed that there could be a united Ireland only with the consent of its people. The change in policy, which means that Labour will no longer persuade unionists to accept unification, follows a campaign by Mr Blair to move his party away from its traditional pro-nationalist stance. However, some nationalists in the party maintained last night that they had forced the Labour leadership to a compromise. They said a composite resolution also passed by the conference yesterday put pressure on the unionists to accept a constitutional settlement between north and south. The NEC statement marks a substantial move in favour of unionist opinion in the province by stating that 'there can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of its people'. It adds that 'it is for the people of Ireland alone to exercise their right of self-determination'. Some party leaders had feared that Mr Blair's determination to change policy might trigger a row. But he has successfully convinced colleagues that Labour's campaign for a united Ireland was outdated and could have damaged prospects for permanent peace. Addressing the conference yesterday, Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland spokesman, underlined the extent of Mr Blair's success in persuading colleagues to change course. Mr McNamara is regarded as one of Labour's strongest pro-nationalists. But he emphasised that a united Ireland was the best solution 'in the long run' - a phrase which implied to many delegates that it has gone on the policy back-burner. Nationalists claimed that the composite resolution passed by conference contained a greater commitment to unification than the NEC statement. In particular, the composite puts pressure on unionist politicians by arguing that 'the intransigence of any party, group or individual should not be permitted to veto discussions or any move along the path to peace'. However, there was reassurance for Ulster's Protestant community from Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who addressed a packed session of the conference. Mr Hume, who was given a standing ovation, urged a 'dual referendum' in Ulster and the Irish Republic to give people a say on any outcome from cross-party talks.

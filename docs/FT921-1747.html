			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Challenges to the Alan Sugar view (1) Sir, It is rare to encounter an emotional outburst in a newspaper which prides itself on fact and accurate analysis. It is perhaps a healthy thing in this age of slick political advertising that people still have a chance to speak from the heart, but Alan Sugar's letter (March 19) simply cannot go unchallenged. First, he bemoans his 'meagre salary' of Pounds 170,000 and the collapse in the value of his shares to Pounds 100m. Before he complains too loudly perhaps he should consider the fact that the same society which has provided his markets and opportunities has also seen a doubling of poverty in the 1980s and 1990s with about 12m people on incomes below half the average. Behind this statistic are real people who simply do not have enough to feed and clothe themselves. Second, he suggests that yesterday's 'barrow boys' are today's share dealers and that limitless opportunity is there for all to grasp if they want to. He should realise that for many, prosperity is prevented by crumbling schools, poor-quality training and dearth of job opportunities. Mr Sugar acknowledges that more should be done to help the poor but his claim that the 'them and us' situation has disappeared is total nonsense; 2.7m unemployed people, 0.5m homeless people, and 10m people dependent on means-tested benefits bear witness to that. If only the talent, enterprise and organisation which Mr Sugar told us has gone into making and marketing satellite dishes was put into solving the housing and unemployment crises, perhaps we could end the scandal of poverty.

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Kemper bows to higher GE offer Kemper, the US investment group, yesterday bowed to an unwanted takeover approach from GE Capital after the General Electric financial services arm increased its offer for the company to Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.64bn). GE Capital, which had first offered Dollars 55 a share for the company in March, overcame the resistance of Kemper's board by raising its bid to Dollars 60 a share. The agreement, announced jointly by the two companies yesterday, comes just three days before Kemper shareholders were due to vote on whether to appoint four GE Capital nominees to their company's board. If approved, this would have put irresistible pressure on the Long Grove, Illinois-based company to agree a sale. The agreed deal will turn GE Capital into one of the US's biggest fund management groups. Kemper, whose operations span life insurance, mutual funds and securities broking, had Dollars 67.4bn under management at the end of March. Kemper's shareholders had been pressing for a higher offer than the initial Dollars 55 a share. Although publicly backing the rejection of GE Capital's opening offer, some of the company's institutional shareholders had hinted they would consider a higher bid. In an attempt to appease the institutions, Mr David Mathis, Kemper's chairman, last week said the company would poll shareholders a year from now on a possible sale, if the company's share price had failed to reach Dollars 65. It appears this assurance could not overcome the attraction of an immediate sale. Many of Kemper's shares are believed to have passed in recent weeks to arbitrageurs, who buy shares in the hope of a quick profit from events such as takeovers. Mr Mathis's letter had added to a belief that Kemper's board would accept an immediate offer of Dollars 65 a share. However, the GE Capital bid failed to flush out any rival offers, as some Kemper executives had hoped, and even at Dollars 60 a share the deal is well above the Dollars 40 level at which Kemper was trading until mid-March. GE Capital said its new offer was dependent on a review of Kemper's troubled Dollars 1.7bn real estate portfolio, and outstanding litigation against the company. It had earlier said that it might be prepared to raise the Dollars 55 a share offer, subject to a review of the real estate investments. The Kemper annual meeting, which was due on Wednesday, has been postponed until August 22. Global Investor, Page 22</p>

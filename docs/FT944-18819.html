			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Plan to smooth bank profits endorsed by top supervisor A leading international banking supervisor yesterday endorsed plans by banks to even out the swings in their reported profits caused by sharp rises in provisions against bad and doubtful debts during recessions. Mr Brian Quinn, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, said banks should consider smoothing their profits by making consistent provisions against loans in line with likely rates of default. Barclays is among banks working on plans to make general provisions against corporate loans at the time they are made, rather than waiting for signs that borrowers are in danger of defaulting. Mr Quinn's endorsement at a Financial Times conference on international banking in Madrid yesterday is the strongest public backing given to the idea by a supervisor. He said banks should consider 'smoothing out the differences between reported and actual profits over the life of the loan book', or alternatively recalculating capital ratios internally to reflect likely bad debts. Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, had argued that banks had mis-reported profits during the late 1980s because they took into earnings income from loans which they later had to write off in the recession. UK banks have been discouraged from making large general provisions against future bad debts because such provisions - unlike specific provisions against troubled loans - do not attract favourable tax treatment. Banks would find a more stable pattern of profits attractive, even if the peaks in profitability were lowered, as shareholders would regard bank earnings as of higher quality and consistency. Mr Quinn said that greater stability through anti-inflationary fiscal policy could lower banks' risks, and cost of capital, but he could not assume that banks 'will not find other ways of digging holes for themselves'. Speaking at the conference, Mr Eugene Ludwig, US comptroller of the currency, said it was still hard to estimate the true value of banks' financial derivatives in times of market turbulence. Mr Ludwig said internal computer models, on which banks rely to value derivatives such as swaps and options, often make different estimates of the values of complex instruments when markets change suddenly.

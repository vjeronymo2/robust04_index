Their statements are included in the report by  Commissioner Jean-Pierre Lachapelle, appended to the  parliament's Ancia file. At the request of the Liege examining  magistrate, Veronique Ancia, the inspector also scrutinized the  contracting procedures. He concluded that they amount to a case  of unfair competition.    Following an inspection at Agusta, inspectors from the High  Committee of Inspection concluded that the Italians sold their  helicopter at 12 percent under the cost price. According to the  inspectors, a twin-engined helicopter was supplied for the price  of a single-engined helicopter, constituting "a sale at a loss."  The company refused to offer any explanation for this  "abnormally low price."    "On the basis of the legislation regarding public contracts  and the comments of Professor Flamme (the same expert which  Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme called to his defense), this was  sufficient reason to refuse the Agusta offer," writes inspector  Lachapelle of the High Committee. He confronted three  high-ranking army officers with this conclusion. They openly  agreed with him.    "According to the law, a contract may not be awarded in such  circumstances," declared General Major Jacobs on December 1992.  "I did not know it, but Agusta's offer should have been  rejected on the grounds that the price was abnormally low," said  General Major Fournier on 8 December 1992.  <H5>  Control </H5>   From Inspector Lachapelle's report, it also appears that the  Finance Inspectorate could not subject the contracting file to a  thorough financial control. Inspector De Caesemaerker had just  24 hours in order to give an "urgent advice." [passage omitted]    There was no question of a budgetary control. "In agreement  with the minister," the assistant private secretary to the  national Defense Minister Guy Coeme -- Jean-Louis Mazy --  decided to sidestep budgetary control. Such control is,  however, obligatory by the terms of the ministerial decision of  13 March 1986. The head of the department responsible for the  budget control protested against this maneuver.    According to Mazy, budget control was scrapped "in order not  to unnecessary delay the procedures." Nothing of the question,  says inspector Lachapelle of the High Committee: "The real  reason is that a delay in the procedure would have obliged the  authorities to take account of the latest offers from  Aerospatiale (Agusta's French competitor)."

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah  has blamed the southern leadership for the failure of efforts to  resolve the Yemeni crisis. Basindwah, who toured the MBC  Television building in London today, said that Aden refused to  hold a dialogue within the framework of Yemeni unity. Basindwah  told our colleague Hasan Zaytuni that Sanaa refuses to make any  concessions to end the crisis.    [Begin recording] [Basindwah] First of all, I would like to  say that the failure of political efforts so far is the fault of  the separatist rebels. We agreed to talk to a delegation  representing them within the framework of the Republic of Yemen,  but they insisted on conducting the talks as representatives of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which is so far unrecognized  by any country. We cannot recognize the existence of any state  on Yemeni soil, other than the Republic of Yemen.    [Zaytuni] Should we conclude from this that Sanaa is not  ready to hold a dialogue in the framework of, say, a  confederation or federation between the south and north?    [Basindwah] No one has the right to impose on our people any  form of unity other than the merger formula agreed upon since  the unification of the country. I am puzzled by those who  refuse to understand that constitutional legitimacy does not  permit anyone to impose a formula for unity other than the  existing one. [end recording] [passage omitted]    For his part, 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, the foreign minister of  the  government declared in south Yemen, has said that the visit to  Washington by southern Yemeni officials is designed to brief  U.S. and UN officials on the latest developments in the Yemeni  crisis. Speaking to us by telephone, al-Asnaj blamed Sanaa for  the continued fighting, referring to what he said was Sanaa's  procrastination in implementing the cease-fire.    [Begin al-Asnaj recording] The visit [to the United States]  by Prime Minister Haydar al-'Attas and myself is aimed at  ensuring that the UN Security Council and UN member countries  are briefed on the true situation in Yemen. We hope to initiate  efforts leading to an end to the fighting in Yemen. No region  is more vital and strategic to international community than that  of the Arab peninsula and the Gulf.    The UN Security Council will decide on a course of action.  We in the Democratic Republic of Yemen simply want to give a  true picture of the situation, the perils involved, and the  external forces encouraging the Sanaa regime to keep the war  going and to destroy south Yemeni towns, villages, and  institutions.

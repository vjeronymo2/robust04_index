			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW STICKS TO BUSINESS AND WINS  </P> <P> Ocean View High School's businesslike approach to baseball continued to pay big  dividends Tuesday as the Seahawks defeated Westminster, 2-1, in a Sunset League  game at Westminster.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive one-run victory in league play for Ocean View  (10-3 overall, 2-0 in league play) after a 4-3 decision over Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> "A typical Sunset League battle," said Steve Barrett, Ocean View's first-year  coach.  </P> <P> Well, not quite. The last time the teams met in league play, Westminster  rallied for a 7-6 victory to gain a share of the league title. Both teams were  very vocal in that emotional game. Later, Westminster was forced to forfeit the  victory for using an ineligible player.  </P> <P> This time, the teams played in an atmosphere more suited for a library, but  Barrett said the mood suited his team's style of play.  </P> <P> "We take a quiet approach to the game," he said. "You won't hear much noise  from the bench or the field. The players have taken a businesslike approach."  </P> <P> Ocean View took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when first baseman Mike Burns  singled and moved to third on a double down the left-field line by catcher  Corey Colbert.  </P> <P> Left fielder Scott Caringella drove in Burns with a sacrifice fly to center.  Leadoff batter Steve Hernandez drove in the Seahawks' second run with a single  in the fifth inning that scored Kevin Mullens.  </P> <P> Westminster (8-3-1, 0-1) managed only two scratch hits off Ocean View starter  Brent Woken through six innings before the Lions finally came to life in the  seventh.  </P> <P> First baseman Ryan Klesko opened the inning with a single and scored on a  two-out double by shortstop Chris Larson. The Lions had the bases loaded after  a single by catcher Angel Lopez and a walk to left fielder Mark Murphy, but the  game ended when Jeff Fortune flied to left.  </P> <P> "The intensity wasn't there until the seventh inning," said Ken Ostrowski,  Westminster coach. "Emotion is a part of the game, and we didn't come alive  until the seventh."  </P> <P> Ostrowski sensed a letdown in Monday's practice after the Lions had averaged  six runs per game in tournament play. Westminster also played without  three-year starter Brian Stubbs, who was suspended Monday by the school's  athletic council for breaking the athletic code last week. Stubbs, a pitcher,  will sit out the first round of league play.  </P> <P> It won't get any easier for Westminster this week with the Lions playing a  makeup game against Marina on Thursday and then facing Fountain Valley on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Woken's performance was a big boost to Ocean View's staff, which has been  relying heavily on sophomore Randy Karliner. Woken (1-1) appeared to be fully  recovered from an ankle injury that had limited him to two starts.  </P> <P> "I felt good my last game against Mission Viejo when I pitched four shutout  innings in relief," he said. "I didn't have much luck against Westminster last  year, so hopefully things have changed."  </P> <P> Starting pitcher Brett Grebe (4-1) was the only bright spot for Westminster  despite losing for the first time. Grebe kept Ocean View's hitters off stride  with a good curveball and had two of the Lions' five hits.  </P> <P> In other Sunset League games:  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 11, Marina 10 -- The Oilers held off several Marina rallies  for the victory at Marina. Huntington Beach led, 7-2, but Marina came back to  tie the score, 7-7, in the fourth. In the seventh, Chris Maher singled home  Chris Mangels and Joe Kijewski to give the Oilers (5-5, 1-0) an 11-8 lead. In  the bottom of the inning, Marc Newfield's two-run double pulled the Vikings to  within one run, 11-10, with two outs. However, winning pitcher Josh Faurer got  a groundout to end the game. The Oilers had nine doubles, including three by  Mangels. Mangels, Chance Agnew and Ryan Marlin each had two RBIs. Newfield had  three hits, including a solo home run, and three RBIs for the Vikings (0-1 in  league play).  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 7, Edison 2 -- Steve Grack had two hits and four RBIs to lead  host Fountain Valley (6-4, 1-1), which had five hits. Steve Montgomery (2-1)  pitched the first five innings for the victory.  </P> <P> In Pacific Coast League baseball:  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills 7, Laguna Beach 3 -- Jeff Carrao had two hits and three RBIs for  the Mustangs (5-3, 2-0) at home. Trabuco Hills scored four runs in the fifth,  two on a bases-loaded single by Carrao, to take a 7-3 lead. David Lowery (4-1)  struck out seven for the victory.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills 9, Costa Mesa 2 -- Laguna Hills starting pitcher Ron Kortman  improved his record to 5-0, allowing just two hits over six innings. Mike Helm  drove in four runs on two hits for Laguna Hills (10-3, 2-0).  </P> <P> In the Olympic League:  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran 10, Santa Margarita 1 -- Mark Bredehoft had four hits,  including a double, and five RBIs for visiting Orange Lutheran (4-6-1, 1-0).  Doug Senne had three hits, and Todd Dudley and Mike Rossi had two each for  Orange Lutheran, which had 15 hits.  </P> <P> Whitney 10, Capistrano Valley Christian 5 -- Kerry Langdale had a hit, scored  two runs and stole a base for host Capistrano Valley Christian (5-4, 0-1).  </P> <P> In a nonleague game:  </P> <P> Liberty Christian 10, Pioneer Baptist 5 -- John Van Dyke had three hits,  including two triples, and three RBIs for host Liberty Christian (6-0). Mark  Baltodano had two hits and an RBI for Liberty Christian, which scored five runs  in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Chris Buckels (3-0) had 12 strikeouts in six innings for the victory.  </P></p>

Delivering the presidential address at the physical sciences  section of the 63rd annual session of the National Academy of  Sciences here on Wednesday, Dr K. Kasturirangan, Director of the  Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) satellite centre here,  said studies exploring the possibility of such a mission carried  out by ISRO were quite encouraging and the mission appeared  feasible.    The study was carried out in the wake of the recent advances  made in the realisation of a geosynchronous launch capability.    He, however, said a time schedule for such a mission had not  been fixed as yet.    Dr Kasturirangan said the GSLV could be used for a mission  to  launch a spacecraft to Mercury, either as a fly-by or as an  orbiter to the planet using the gravity-assist trajectories of  the planetary probe due to Venus and Mercury itself.    He said ISRO has also framed the objectives and profile of  an  Indian planetary mission to Venus and Mercury.    The GSLV would launch the spacecraft first into a 300 km  orbit and later boosted to a heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft  would be designed to provide three axis stabilisation using the  sun for pitch and yaw control and a star as a roll reference.    In situ particle detectors, plasma probes and  magnetometer onboard the orbiter could provide vital information  on solar wind and associated phenomena.    A fly-by mission of Venus and Mercury would provide some  opportunity to have a short glimpse of these planets. The  mercury orbiter could carry a number of instruments for imaging  the surface and for remote measurements of the surface  parameters and environment of the planet.    Dr Kasturirangan said the instruments in such an orbiter  could include ultra violet spectrometer for determining  elemental composition of rare and other gases and throw light on  the sodium enigma of Mercury, plasma analyser to measure solar  wind particles in the transitional atmosphere of the planet,  imaging with television cameras at a high resolution of 50 to  100 metres in different visible and infrared bands, gamma ray,  x-ray and infrared spectroscopy to study the composition of the  surface material of the planet.    He said India could also go in for a multi-wavelength space  observatory that could be launched by the Polar Satellite Launch  Vehicle (PSLV) to a low earth inclined orbit. A space astronomy  mission capitalising on simultaneous multiple wavelength  observations of celestial "flash" transient phenomena.</p>

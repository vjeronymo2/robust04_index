			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax-free premium payment allowance increased - Friendly societies An increase is planned, to Pounds 270 from Pounds 200, in the annual amount that an individual can pay in premiums under tax-exempt life assurance policies issued by friendly societies. The premium under an existing tax-exempt policy is to be increased to reflect the new limit without the policy losing its tax privileges. There will be a removal of the statutory limitation on the surrender value of a qualifying tax-exempt policy that can be offered by a friendly society during the first 10 years of the policy. These measures will take effect on the day the finance bill receives Royal assent. In applying the limit on premiums payable under tax-exempt life assurance policies, allowance is made for the extra cost involved in collecting premiums at monthly rather than annual intervals. The proposed annual limit of Pounds 270 will allow societies to provide policies with premiums of up to Pounds 25 a month written on their tax-exempt funds. In general, tax-exempt policies are designed to meet the conditions for a 'qualifying policy'. If a policy is a qualifying policy, then once premiums have been paid for 10 years, or for 7 1/2 years in the case of some shorter policies, the policy-holder can take the benefits from the policy without incurring a charge to tax on the profit produced by the policy. The conditions for a qualifying policy include a requirement that premiums should be payable year-by-year in equal amounts. The measures will enable societies to offer existing holders of qualifying tax-exempt policies the opportunity to increase the premiums payable for the future without losing the benefit of qualifying status. It is a long-standing condition for a qualifying tax-exempt policy that it should carry an express condition limiting the surrender value of the policy during the first 10 years, or 7 1/2 years in the case of some shorter policies, to a maximum of a return of premiums. It is proposed that this condition should be removed, leaving societies free to offer the best possible surrender value on their qualifying policies.</p>

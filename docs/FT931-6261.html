			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: German money markets lifted by new paper THE development of the German money markets was given an added stimulus yesterday as the first issue of short-dated government paper, or bulis, coincided with the first issue of money market instruments from a German bank. The Bundesbank sold DM14.8bn of three, six and nine-month paper, soaking up some of the extra liquidity created as a cut in German minimum reserve ratios took effect. The change in minimum reserve policy, announced last month, released DM32bn to the banking system, which had previously been tied up in interest-free deposits with the Bundesbank. The cut in minimum reserves on bank deposits to 2 per cent prompted Bayerische Vereinsbank to issue short-dated paper. It is the first German bank to take such a step. The bank's paper has been timed to mature on the quarterly settlement days of the Euro-DM futures contract on Liffe, potentially making it a more useful instrument in interest rate risk management, said Mr Norbert Juchem, a deputy member of the board of managing directors. The bulis auctioned yesterday attracted bids of more than DM30bn, helping to push the yield levels on the paper sold well below current yields on comparable short-term deposits. The DM4.7bn of three-month paper issued, for example, was sold at a yield of 7.86 per cent, below the 8.06 per cent deposit rate. Some DM5.7bn of six-month bulis were sold at a yield of 7.52 per cent, with the DM4.4bn of nine-month paper giving a yield of 7.06 per cent. 'The auction went well, with a high level of bids,' said Mr Klaus Baader of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. He expressed surprise, though, that the three-month paper was yielding so much less than the three-month deposit rate. Bayerische said its paper was trading late yesterday at a yield  1/8 point below the London Interbank Bid Rate (Libid), in line with price levels for commercial paper issued by such names as Daimler-Benz and the Bundespost.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Pak Chong-mun] </F>   [Text] The government believes that even though North Korea  said it had begun changing fuel rods at the five-megawatt  nuclear reactor, the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks  would be held. Accordingly, it has been holding in-depth  discussions with the United States regarding the issue.    The government's view is based on the fact that the  replacement of fuel rods by North Korea has not yet reached the  point in which the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA]  call for the selection and preservation of some fuel rods would  not be met. Therefore, the ROK and U.S. Governments agree on the  holding of the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks when IAEA  inspectors -- who are scheduled to visit North Korea on 17 May  -- satisfactorily complete their additional inspections or  follow-up [husok] inspections.    The government has decided, however, to urge North Korea  through many channels, including North Korea-U.S. working-level  contacts and China, not to carry out the work of replacing fuel  rods any further.    A high-level government official said on 14 May that  "although North Korea said it had begun replacing fuel rods at  its nuclear reactor, it is not sure to what extent it has done  so."</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bombardier gains extra clout BOMBARDIER, the Montreal-based transport equipment-maker, expects its acquisition of de Havilland of Canada to give it extra clout in the world regional aircraft market. De Havilland's twin-engined Dash 8 turboprop is expected to be marketed as a complement to the slightly larger and longer-range Regional Jet, which is built by Bombardier's Canadair subsidiary in Montreal. At the same time, Bombardier has indicated that de Havilland's operations willbe integrated with those ofits other airframe manufacturing subsidiaries, namely, Short Brothers of Belfast and theUS executive jet-maker Learjet. Bombardier is buying a 51 per cent interest in loss-making de Havilland from Boeing of Seattle, with generous financial assistance from the Canadian and Ontario governments. The province of Ontario will have a 49 per cent equity stake in de Havilland, but Bombardier will have the option to buy the province's shares after four years. Bombardier and Ontario will contribute a total of CDollars 100m (USDollars 86.2m) in new equity in proportion to their shareholdings. The federal and Ontario governments will provide CDollars 490m in other financial support, mainly loans. In addition, the Export Development Corporation has agreed to provide subsidised export financing to put de Havilland on an equal footing with its competitors. The two governments have been desperate to find a buyer for de Havilland since a bid by Aerospatiale of France and Italy's Alenia was torpedoed by the European Commission last September. The EC contended that the proposed takeover would have created a dominant player in the European commuter aircraft industry. The 63-year-old company has enormous symbolic value to Canada. Maker of such famous aircraft as the Tiger Moth, the Mosquito and the Twin Otter, it is one of only two airframe builders in the country and one of the biggest industrial employers in the Toronto area. De Havilland's only remaining product is the Dash-8. It has delivered 300 Dash-8s and has orders for about 90 on hand. Bombardier's airframe manufacturing subsidiaries have been increasingly integrated, with one company providing components, research and testing facilities for the others. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, Bombardier's chairman, said 'by combining their resources, skills and experience and building on their united strengths, Bombardier and de Havilland can look forward to achieving a strategic position in the aerospace industry.' Boeing put de Havilland on the block almost two years ago after losing patience with the company, which last made a profit in 1982. Although its products are widely respected, de Havilland has been bedevilled by high costs, low productivity and uncertainty over its future.</p>

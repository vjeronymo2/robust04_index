			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: A last resort by the seaside - As oil companies drill closer to land, Robert Corzine looks at how they are stepping up safeguards Santa Barbara is not one of the twin towns listed on the sign outside the municipal limits of Christchurch, one of the prosperous resort and retirement communities which line England's south coast. But an event that took place off the US west coast 25 years ago has a particular relevance to residents of environmentally sensitive seaside areas in the UK such as Christchurch. In 1969, a blow-out at an offshore production platform left 30 miles of beach near Santa Barbara, one of southern California's main tourist destinations, covered in oil pollution. The impact of the spill on public opinion was such that development of the state's rich offshore oilfields was curtailed for decades, while the political fallout from it is felt even now. Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, recently confirmed that residents of coastal states still have a virtual veto over new offshore oil developments. The Santa Barbara spill has also had a lasting effect on how the international oil industry operates in sensitive coastal areas, including those in the UK. Over the next few years, oil companies plan to increase inshore exploration drilling, encouraged by coastal discoveries such as the Wytch Farm oilfield near Poole in Dorset and the Liverpool Bay natural gas field. In last year's 14th licensing round, the government included a large number of inshore blocks, many of which are located near well-known coastal beauty spots, important fishing or breeding grounds, or in areas which support endangered species. But the special requirements of operating inshore often conflict with established ways of working in the North Sea, according to Geoff Nicholson, manager of near-shore exploration projects for Elf Enterprise, a joint venture between Elf Aquitaine of France and Enterprise Oil, the biggest UK independent. It has been active in Poole Bay on the south coast and is about to begin exploration in the Irish Sea, 15 miles off Anglesey. 'The industry likes to move fast and with few constraints,' he says. In the North Sea, the sudden availability of a drilling rig at an attractive rate can cause companies to alter plans overnight. In the exploration phase, oil companies also tend to operate at an arm's length through specialist contractors. 'But you can't operate like that inshore,' says Nicholson. 'Long periods of consultation with local governments and community groups are necessary before actual operations, such as seismic surveys or drilling, can begin.' Senior Elf executives say it is as important to understand the 'geo-political aspects' of England's south coast as it is of south Yemen or the other remote locations in which the oil industry operates. Elf's emphasis on the careful identification and cultivation of community groups is no accident. In 1992, its initial exploration efforts in Poole Bay ended in angry confrontations at sea between seismic survey ships and local fishermen. The company had reached an early agreement on compensating those who fished for crab and lobster. But it struggled to reach an understanding with the trawlermen. 'We first had to define who was a fisherman,' says Nicholson. 'In the winter someone might be a painter and decorator, but in summer they might do a little fishing.' In addition, some political pressure groups saw the chance to use Elf's dispute with the fishermen to their own advantage. Elf eventually had to pay out more than Pounds 1m in compensation to the fishermen. 'We had to solve the dispute on the run and in a very unsatisfactory way,' concedes Nicholson. The problems of dealing with 10 different fishing associations persuaded the company to set up and fund a forum in which to channel problems. It also provides a mechanism for arbitration. The fragmented nature of the fishing industry made it the most difficult for Elf to deal with. But many other groups also saw the company as a threat. Some were concerned that even the hint of an oil spill offshore in summer could do long-lasting damage to the area's important tourist industry. Others simply did not want oil companies operating in their back yard. 'I don't care if you drink your bloody oil,' was the attitude of one resident at a public meeting. Late last year, Elf drilled an exploratory well, the results of which it has yet to divulge. The licence for Poole Bay was issued in an earlier round, but Elf observed many of the environmental conditions set by the government for 14th round licences. Seabed studies were carried out both before and after drilling to determine if there was any damage to marine life. A narrower than usual well was specified to cut down on the amount of rock cuttings brought to the surface. Water-based drilling muds were used when possible in preference to oil-based ones to lubricate the drill bit. Rock cuttings brought to the surface were cleaned before being dispersed over a wide area - rather than piled on the sea bottom - to avoid smothering fish feeding grounds. And the normal stand-by safety vessel was augmented by one carrying a chemical dispersant and booms to contain any spills. Local officials say such precautions have made inshore exploration drilling acceptable to the public. But they say the prospect of permanent platforms within sight of land is no more acceptable now than in 1988 when a British Petroleum proposal to build an artificial island off Wytch Farm to tap the offshore extension of the field triggered a storm of protest along the south coast. New technology, in the form of horizontal drilling from a land base to a point more than 5km offshore, solved BP's problem. But technology is unlikely to offer a solution in all cases. At some time in the next few years an inshore discovery could be made that will test whether coastal residents in the UK have a similar power of veto as their counterparts in California.</p>

Various sources of information available in Beijing on Deng's  physical condition all essentially agree on this point. There  are even reports circulating that say the Chinese leader,  appreciating his deteriorating physical condition, has given up  the idea of visiting Hong Kong, which will be returned to China  in three-and-a-half years.    Parkinson's disease is a nervous disorder that is marked by  such characteristics as sluggish movement and rigidity of the  whole body, and for which there is reportedly no cure. The  disease rarely leads to sudden death among sufferers but they  are, however, very susceptible to complications.    Deng's physical condition, such as his trembling hands, were  noted in a television broadcast which showed him meeting  delegates to the CPC convention in October 1992. People in  Beijing, however, were even more startled when they saw how far  his condition had deteriorated during his appearance on a  television newscast on 9 February, the eve of the Spring  Festival (Chinese New Year).    It is said that Deng's dream is to visit Hong Kong in July  1997 when it is returned to China. Deng himself, however, has  reportedly acknowledged that this has become seemingly  impossible. When Deng was 86, he said: "To live past 90 is  victory." This coming August, Deng will celebrate his 90th  birthday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Presidency; place and date not </F> given]    [Text] Since the sovereign national conference, the  Togolese people have been suffering a great deal from the  various interpretations of democracy and the provisions for the  transition. But through patience and determination, they  mobilized themselves for the pursuit of the democratic process  that saw the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of  presidential and legislative elections. According to the  official results of the legislative elections proclaimed on 14  March, two political parties, namely the Action Committee for  Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], won  parliamentary majority at the National Assembly.    In conformity with the provisions of Article 66 of the  Constitution, the head of state should have named a prime  minister from within this majority in line with the  Constitution. But the head of state, out of his concern to  demonstrate his clearly expressed desire on the eve of the  elections to set up a broad-based national government whatever  the elections results may be, decided to hold prior  consultations with political party leaders. He, therefore,  received the CAR and UTD leaders on two occasions.  Unfortunately, after meeting on two occasions with the two  leaders accompanied by officials of their parties and after two  other private meetings with these leaders, no consensus was  reached because the two party leaders have not been able to  reach an agreement.    However, out of his regard for the deep aspirations of the  people and, in particular, out of his concern to avoid the  baneful consequences of a policy of exclusion, the head of state  is relentlessly continuing his consultations with the CAR and  UTD chairmen. He has already accepted the resignation of the  transitional government, which he has asked to expedite pending  matters. Meanwhile, the people, who are deeply affected, are  waiting for the setting up of the new government team so that  they can resume their political, economic, and social activities  as soon as possible with more confidence and in full force. For  this reason and in the supreme interest of the nation, the head  of state is making an urgent appeal to the leaders of the two  political parties to meet the people's expectations.</p>

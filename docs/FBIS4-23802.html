			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adrian Hadland] </F>   [Text] Parastatal companies had a special role to play in  government's reconstruction and development programme and would  not be privatised, Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau  said yesterday. As providers of vital foreign exchange and  suitable conduits for the implementation of affirmative action  initiatives, parastatal groups falling under Sigcau's  ministerial ambit, such as Denel, Eskom [Electricity Supply  Commission], Transnet [Transportation Network] and Safcol  [expansion unknown] would be commercialised but not sold to the  private sector.    This was a change from the former government's policy which  was to commercialise public enterprises with a view to eventual  privatisation, she said in Pretoria. "While we have  appreciation and understanding for the role of privatisation in  the more sophisticated economies, we remain justifiably wary of  privatisation along similar lines in SA's unique context."    Privatisation could lead to share ownership being  transferred  to "an exclusive group" without granting the nation as a whole  the opportunity to benefit from the process. For the moment,  the emphasis would be on commercialisation as well as ensuring  transparency and accountability in the governing of public  enterprises.    While affirmative action programmes had already been  instituted in the parastatals, Sigcau said she would be taking a  keen interest in how these were developed, particularly with  regard to women.    Eskom's objective was to achieve a "fundamental shift" in  its  race and gender profile by the year 2000. Until December 1996,  Eskom's recruitment of employees, bursars and trainees would  give preference to black South Africans.    Transnet's Turn Strategy, which had been in operation for  two  years, had similar aims and objectives.    Denel had committed itself to training 500 technicians, 200  computer programmers and had agreed that 30 percent of its  management would be from under-represented groups within three  years.    Sigcau said affirmative action programmes would have to be  sensitive to the aspirations of non-black staff. "There will  still be promotions of white South Africans and no white  employee will lose his job because of affirmative action." But  she warned that while every effort would be made to implement  affirmative action in a sympathetic way "no one will be allowed  to frustrate its objectives."    Sigcau also said government's policy on acquisitions would  prevent, "if at all practicable", the continuing concentration  of markets. Competition policy would emphasise the "protection  of competition, rather than of the competitors."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["National Fortifications-Storming Plan for Supporting 80 </F> Million Impoverished People Over the Next Seven Years  (1994-2000) (Excerpts)" -- XINHUA headline]    [Text] Beijing, 18 May (XINHUA) -- Socialism must  eliminate poverty. To further solve the problem of poverty in  rural areas so as to narrow the gap between regions in east  China and those in west China, and to achieve the goal of common  prosperity, the State Council decided to concentrate manpower  plus material and financial resources by mobilizing the forces  from all walks of life from 1994 to 2000, and to strive to  basically solve the problem of food and clothing for the 80  million people living in poverty in rural areas across the  country in about seven years. This is a very arduous  fortifications-storming battle. To this end, the State Council  drew up a "National Fortifications-Storming Plan for Supporting  80 Million Impoverished People Over the Next Seven Years." It  is a program for the work to be carried out nationwide over the  next seven years to help poor areas achieve development, and  constitutes an important integral part of our program for  national economic and social development.  <H5>  1. The Situation and Tasks </H5>   It has been a consistent policy of the party Central  Committee and the State Council to support the impoverished  areas to change their face of poverty and backwardness as  quickly as possible. Especially since the mid-1980's, the state  has carried out large-scale, organized work to support the  impoverished areas across the country in a planned way. The  state increased input by a big margin to support the  impoverished areas, formulated a series of help-the-poor  policies and, furthermore, carried out fundamental reform and  adjustment of the help-the-poor work done in the earlier period,  thereby bringing about a change from the delivery of relief to  the offer of support to poor areas in achieving development.  After strenuous efforts by the state for years, the problem of  poverty in rural areas across the country has been noticeably  eased and the number of impoverished people whose problem of  food and clothing remains yet to be completely and steadily  solved has decreased to 80 million. It was a tremendous  historical achievement and proved that the help-the-poor  principle and policy formulated by the party Central Committee  and the State Council were correct and fully demonstrated the  superiority of the socialist system.    Though the number of people living in poverty does not  represent a large percentage of the rural areas' total  population across the country, the tasks to help poor areas  achieve development are very arduous. These people mainly  concentrate in the impoverished counties which the state focuses  its attention on supporting. These counties are scattered over  remote mountain areas, rocky mountain areas, deserts, high  mountains where it is very cold, loess plateau areas, areas with  a high incidence of endemic diseases, and dam areas. Their  common characteristics are remoteness, inconvenient  transportation, lack of proper care for ecological environment,  sluggish economic development, shortage of potable water supply  to people and livestock, and extremely bad production and living  conditions. These are the main fields for our fortifications-  storming battle to support the impoverished areas.    The establishment of a socialist market economic system has  brought unprecedented opportunities and broader prospects for  poor areas' development. Paying close attention to helping poor  areas achieve development to solve the problem of food and  clothing for the masses in these areas as quickly as possible,  to change their situation of economic backwardness, and to ease  and eradicate poverty is a great undertaking that has important  and profound economic and political significance under the new  situation. Therefore, governments at all levels must uphold  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, adhere to  the principle "while giving top priority to efficiency, we must  pay attention to fairness at the same time," and further improve  the work of helping poor areas achieve development.  <H5>  2. The Goals After Which We Strive </H5>   The standards for solving the problem of food and clothing  for the impoverished population by the end of the century:    -- We must attain a comparatively greater increase in the  per  capita net annual income of the overwhelming majority of  impoverished households.    -- We must support impoverished households to create basic  conditions for steadily solving their food and clothing  problems. In areas where conditions permit, half to one mu of  basic farmland with steady, high yield must be cultivated by one  person on the average; one mu of orchard or farmland for cash  crops must be cultivated by one household on the average; one  worker per household must be transferred to a village and town  enterprise or to a developed area; and, on the average, one  household must be engaged in one agricultural project or other  sideline production. In pastoral areas, on the average, every  household must have a plot of fenced grassland or an "enclosure  of grassland." Meanwhile, efforts must be made to consolidate  and expand the achievements scored in helping poor areas promote  development so far, and to reduce the number of people who  relapse into poverty.    We must carry out construction of more infrastructure  projects. We must basically solve the problem of shortage of  potable water supply to people and livestock. We must build  highways to reach the overwhelming majority of impoverished  townships and towns as well as the localities that produce  commodities and have rural fairs. We must make electricity  available to all counties and to the overwhelming majority of  impoverished townships.    We must change the situation of backward education, culture,  and public health. Efforts must be made to basically popularize  elementary education; to vigorously wipe out illiteracy among  youngsters; to conduct adult education, vocational education,  and technical training in a bid to enable most of our young  workers to familiarize themselves with one or two practical  skills; to improve conditions for medical treatment and public  health in order that we may prevent, treat, and reduce endemic  diseases and prevent deformities; and to strictly implement  family planning in a bid to bring the natural growth rate of the  population under control and within the limit set by the state.  <H5>  3. The Guiding Principle and Measures </H5>   Continuing to adhere to the guiding principle of supporting  the poor through development: It is necessary to encourage  large numbers of cadres and people in impoverished areas to work  hard and self-reliantly and, under the state's support and by  relying on advanced science and technology, exploit and utilize  local resources to develop the production of commodities in  market demand, thereby solving the problem of food and clothing,  shaking off poverty, and becoming well off.    Basic measures for helping the poor in development:    -- Giving priority to projects for developing crop-planting,  fish-breeding, and related processing and transportation  industries that require small investments but can yield quick  and good returns, cover broad areas, and directly contribute to  the solution of the problem of food and clothing.    -- Actively developing resource-exploiting and  labor-intensive village and township enterprises that can bring  into full play the advantage of local resources while providing  ample job opportunities to impoverished households.    -- Expediting the development and utilization of wasteland,  barren mountains, uncultivated slopes, and undeveloped beaches  and waters through the compensated lease of land or transfer of  the land use right.    -- Developing the supply of labor service to developed areas  in a planned and organized way to actively facilitate a rational  and orderly flow of laborers from poor areas.    -- Helping poor areas develop by resettling a small number  of  villages and farm households with extraordinary difficulties in  subsistence and development conditions.    Main forms for supporting the poor through development:    -- Exploiting local resources to develop the production of  competitive famous-brand, special, rare, and quality goods in  accordance with market demands. A legion of households in the  whole area should be organized under unified planning to engage  in the development of specialized production and to gradually  establish large-scale commodity production bases or regional  pillar industries.    -- Persisting in setting up support-the-poor economic  entities, which combine trade, industry, and agriculture and  which integrate production, processing, and marketing to  contract developmental projects. Maintaining ties with both  outside markets and local farm households, these economic  entities should provide serialized services to farmers before,  during, and after productive seasons; and should help the masses  cast off poverty and become well off.    -- Guiding poor areas having no condition for setting up  enterprises to bring capital and labor to invest, on a voluntary  basis, in the development of secondary and tertiary industries  in selected rural towns and small industrial zones having a  better investment environment.    -- Expanding the exchange of cadres and economic and  technical cooperation between poor and developed areas.    -- Helping poor counties set up backbone enterprises to  overcome financial difficulties of counties and build up their  capability for self-development, while giving priority to  solving the problem of food and clothing.    -- Helping poverty-stricken disabled people with  rehabilitation programs.  <H5>  4. The Management and Use of Funds </H5>   To ensure the implementation of this plan, the state's  various budgetary funds and credits will be continued until the  year 2000. The time limit for the funds for providing work as a  form of relief and the special funds for the construction of the  "sanxi" areas [the three poorest areas -- Gansu's Dingxi and  Hexi, and Ningxia's Xijie-Haiyuan-Guyuan sector] will remain  unchanged. The time limit for using support-the-poor credits  for projects requiring long-term development will be extended as  deemed necessary.    The State Council has decided to increase, from 1994 through  2000, the funds for providing work as a form of relief and  support-the-poor loans with discount interest rates. Along with  the growth of financial revenues, the state will continue to  increase funds to support the poor.    Local governments at various levels should, based on the  work  to help the poor, increase their support-the-poor funds year  after year so as to ensure the realization of this plan.    It is necessary to readjust the regional structure of  investing state funds to support the poor. The central  government's credits to support the poor should be concentrated  on the severely poverty-stricken central and western provinces  and regions.    All provinces and regions concerned should make necessary  readjustment of investing funds to support the poor based on  this principle.    Central appropriations, credits, and funds for implementing  the policy of providing relief in exchange for work should be  spent mainly on poverty-stricken counties on the state priority  list. Funds of relevant provincial and regional governments and  central departments should be used in coordination with these  funds, with impoverished villages in counties designated as  poverty-stricken being the target areas of such funds and  projects. Funds for scattered impoverished villages or rural  households in counties not designated as poverty-stricken should  be arranged by local governments.    Bank loans for helping the poor should be given to  development projects that promise good economic returns and are  capable of repaying the loans. Poverty alleviation funds from  the treasury should be used mainly on projects that yield good  social benefits. Additional appropriations for relief in  exchange for work should be used on building and mending roads  and on solving drinking water shortages. Priority should be  given to roads linking up villages with commodity producing  areas, rural fairs, and to roads built as support facilities for  poverty-alleviation development projects. The three types of  funds should be used in a well-coordinated manner to improve  overall efficiency of fund utilization.    It is necessary to reform the way poverty-alleviation funds  are used and managed by introducing a mechanism of  self-regulation and incentive, and by tightening the fund  auditing system. It is strictly forbidden to misappropriate  poverty-alleviation funds; violators will be called to account.  <H5>  5. Policy Guarantees </H5>   -- Take the actual conditions into account in granting  poverty-alleviation credits to impoverished households or  economic entities set up to alleviate poverty. Conditions for  loans may be appropriately eased for projects that yield good  economic returns and can guarantee loan repayment.    -- State-owned commercial banks should set aside a certain  amount of funds to help selected projects in poverty-stricken  areas that yield good economic returns and are capable of  repaying the loans.    -- More financial assistance and commercial credits should  be  given to poverty-stricken counties in the six coastal provinces  -- Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Liaoning  -- and to counties in other provinces and regions that only  recently cast off the label of being poverty-stricken. The  amount of such input should, as a general rule, not be lower  than the support these counties used to receive from the state.    -- Newly established enterprises in areas designated by the  state as "old revolutionary base areas, areas inhabited by  minority nationalities, frontier areas, and poverty-stricken  areas" should have all or part of their income tax returned to  them in the first three years of operations.    -- Governments at all levels should list poverty-alleviation  funds in their budgets and see to it that these funds are spent  on help-the-poor development projects.    -- To alleviate the increased burden of peasants in  poverty-stricken areas brought about by the lifting of price  controls over capital goods and by rising grain prices, the  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities may use local  grain risk funds to appropriately subsidize the impoverished  households living off grain resold to them by the state.    -- In deciding on centrally or locally-funded development  projects, favorable consideration should be given to  poverty-stricken areas well-endowed in resources. When  establishing large and medium-sized enterprises in a  poverty-stricken area, central, provincial or regional  governments should take into full account local interests and  properly balance local and state interests.    -- When formulating and implementing industrial policy, the  state should take into account the special characteristics of  poverty-stricken areas and give them support and help  accordingly.    -- We should, pursuant to the principle of preferential  treatment, give priority to the development of import and export  trade in poverty-stricken areas by incorporating it into the  government plans.  <H5>  6. Tasks of Government Departments </H5>   Government planning, foreign and internal trade,  agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, science, education,  industrial, communications, labor, civil affairs, nationalities,  cultural, public health, family planning, finance, banking,  industrial and commercial administrations, and customs  departments should -- in line with the general requirements of  this plan -- formulate their own poverty-alleviation plans for  the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. They should fully  utilize their respective strengths and implement a policy of  favorably tilting toward poverty-stricken areas in terms of  funding, material, and technological support. They should  implement positive measures to help poverty-stricken areas  develop the economy pursuant to the requirements of  poverty-alleviation development and their respective functions.  <H5>  7. Mobilization of Society </H5>   Central and local party and government organizations, as  well  as enterprises and institutions where conditions permit, should  actively commit themselves to helping certain selected poor  counties, and their commitment should remain unchanged for  several years until the recipients of their assistance get rid  of poverty.    All democratic parties and the federations of industry and  commerce should take advantage of their abundant manpower and  technological resources, and their wide connections to further  help poor regions in scientific and technological application,  and in the development of intellectual resources. They should  help poor regions in personnel training, popularization of  technologies, acquisition of information, and promotion of  economic and technological cooperation.    Trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's  federations, science and technology associations, and  federations for the disabled at all levels should actively take  part in the help-the-poor development work.    It is necessary to give full play to the role of the China  Fund for Helping Poor Areas and other non-governmental  organizations for helping poor areas.    Big cities such as Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, and more  developed coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu,  Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning, and Fujian should each help one or  two western provinces and regions in economic development.  Large and medium-sized enterprises should be mobilized to take  advantage of their superiority in technology, manpower,  marketing, information, and materials to enter into mutually  beneficial cooperation with poor regions; and the cooperation  may be in various forms, such as economic cooperation,  technological service, use of labor service, distribution of  products, and exchange of cadres. If someone plans to set up an  enterprise of a developmental nature in a poor region, local  help-the-poor funds may be used in an appropriate way in support  of the plan, and joint efforts should be made for the  development.    Universities, colleges, and scientific research  organizations  should take full advantage of their strength in specialized  personnel and technology to cooperate directly with poor  regions. The cooperation, designed to raise the level of science  and technology in poor regions, may be in such forms as signing  of science and technology contracts, popularization of  technologies, and selection of candidates for the posts of  deputy heads in charge of science and technology of counties and  townships.    The People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force  should continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of  supporting the government and cherishing the people, and help  local people solve the problem of food and clothing and become  well-off.  <H5>  8. International Cooperation </H5>   It is necessary to actively promote international exchanges  and expand and develop cooperation with the international  community in helping poor areas.    Efforts should be made to improve the investment environment  in poor regions, and to attract, with abundance of natural  resources and preferential policies, investors from abroad to  come to run enterprises of a developmental nature in poor  regions so as to promote economic development there.  <H5>  9. Organization and Leadership </H5>   The central departments concerned and all provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities shall be organized in a  unified way by the State Council Leading Group for Economic  Development of Impoverished Areas to implement this plan.    While all levels, particularly the provincial level, should  assume responsibility, we should persistently practice the  system of the provincial governor (autonomous regional chairman,  municipal mayor) assuming full responsibility for accomplishing  the tasks set in this plan within the prescribed time.    All poor counties should deem it their central task to  undertake developmental projects and solve the problem of food  and clothing for the people, and they should seriously  concentrate on implementing the plan for tackling tough poverty  problems. The Provincial (regional), prefectural (autonomous  prefectural), and city authorities should fill and strengthen  the leading bodies of poor counties with selected capable cadres  who can endure hardship and have contacts with the people; they  should keep the county leading bodies relatively stable; and  they should regard the results in implementing the plan and  solving the problem of food and clothing for the people as the  major criterion for appraising the job performance of the  leading cadres of poor counties, and for promoting those cadres.  At the same time, efforts should be made to strengthen the  grass-roots organizations of poor townships and poor villages,  so that their leading bodies are capable of leading the people  in achieving prosperity.    The cadres of poor regions should, as always, display the  spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle and of sharing wealth  and woe with the people. Before their people's basic needs in  food and clothing are met, poor counties are prohibited from  buying automobiles or building guesthouses, luxurious hostels or  new office buildings, and they are not permitted to upgrade  themselves into cities.    It is necessary to strengthen the organizations for  development of poor areas at various levels and provide them  with the necessary working conditions. Their job specifications  and organization should match local help-the-poor development  tasks.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Court boost for income plan victims  -Judges clear way for pay-outs HUNDREDS of people who were not warned of the risks of home income plans stand to receive thousands of pounds in compensation, thanks to a high court ruling this week which extended the grounds for compensation. Home income plans were sold late in the 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as a safe way to release income from their homes. In fact, the schemes were highly risky and involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. The investment was meant to produce returns high enough to meet the mortgage payments and to produce an income on top. But the value of the bonds fell as interest rates rose and house prices dropped, pushing many people into debt. Earlier this month, William Powell, Conservative MP for Corby, said the schemes had resulted in 'misery across the country' and accused West Bromwich building society - which lent about Pounds 24m through them - of acting improperly in the way it marketed them. People who were sold a plan by a member of Fimbra (the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers), which then went into default, have recourse under the investors compensation scheme - but this limits the maximum payout per claim to Pounds 48,000. The ICS came into existence only on August 28 1988 and has always maintained that compensation is not available to those who were sold plans before then. The cases were brought against the ICS in the High Court by solicitor Barnett Sampson, which represents 450 people who bought home income plans. One of them is Margaret Weyell, a widow who owned a house in Kent worth Pounds 160,000 in 1988 and free of a mortgage. She wanted to raise Pounds 10,000 to help her son buy a house and took out a home income plan after advice in July 1988 from Aylesbury Associates, a Fimbra member. She was not told that the plan carried any risk, and the mortgage was executed in September. After her plan collapsed, she was forced to sell her home in 1991 and move to a cheaper property. Aylesbury went into default last year but the ICS refused her compensation because the deal took place before August 28 1988. Finding for Weyell, Lord Justice Glidewell and Mr Justice Cresswell said in part: 'Under their agreements with the investors, Aylesbury undertook to report on the portfolio every six months. This obligation itself imposed upon them a duty in contract to give reasonable competent advice about the future mangement of the clients' portfolio.' In another case, John Veniard and his wife agreed to invest in a plan in 1987 after meeting an Aylesbury adviser socially. The couple took out a Pounds 60,000 mortgage and Aylesbury started to manage their investment fund in October 1987. By November 1990, the investment fund was empty and, instead of reducing the size of the mortgage, the loan had climbed to more than Pounds 66,000. The couple had to sell their home and move into rented accommodation. The court decided that although the couple could not claim full compensation for the bad advice given, since the whole investment transaction had taken place before 1988, they were entitled to compensation for losses occurring as a result of poor advice after that date. The court also ruled that the ICS was wrong to halve the amount of compensation to a surviving spouse. Earlier this year, relatives of victims had managed to win in the High Court the right to bring or pursue compensation on behalf of a claimant who had died. The ICS then said it would halve an award if a husband or wife died by applying one of its rules which treats the claim brought by two or more people as one claim. But the judges said this week that the rules did not provide any support for such 'an unjust conclusion.' They added: 'It would be an extraordinary result if the surviving spouse's claim for compensation could not reflect the fact that he or she remained liable for the full amount of the outstanding mortgage.' Richard Barnett, of Barnett Sampson, said the court's decision would 'relieve the tremendous worry caused to many denied proper compensation.' The Securities and Investments Board (SIB) - the chief regulatory body for the financial services industry, which manages the ICS - said it now expected another 150 new claims. The ICS has paid out Pounds 16.3m to 1,300 investors so far. This figure does not cover compensation to investors who bought a plan after bad advice from a salesman 'tied' to an insurance company. They can complain to Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life industry and, if eligible for compensation, will get it from the life office involved. SIB has a help desk to guide those who have not yet made a claim but think they might have grounds. Contact SIB Home Income Scheme Help Desk, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1.</p>

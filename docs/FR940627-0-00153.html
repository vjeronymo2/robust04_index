			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  A. General Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Exposure Duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned previously, EPA originally proposed a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that included six separate tests for the evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endpoints of concern. Because of cost considerations, a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six-week (42-day) exposure period was proposed in the NPRM,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of the traditional 90-day test. EPA requested comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the adequacy of the proposed exposure period and exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regimen, and on the possibility of extending these tests to 90  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days for comparability to historical data. Comments were also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested on the possible use of an alternative approach for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing program, the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocol developed for use by the Organization for Economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooperation and Development (OECD). The standard SIDS protocol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is designed as a single-study screen (45-day) for repeat dose,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive, and developmental effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comments from industry supported the 90-day test over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the proposed 42-day test or the SIDS protocol. Commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed concern regarding both of these protocols because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively less scientific experience and historical comparison  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data are available for these shorter test scenarios. Upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration, EPA agrees that the 90-day protocol is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable and more cost effective than either of the alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the NPRM for purposes of the F/FA registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. EPA recognizes that the shorter tests might miss some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse health effects that might be identified with the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. Apart from the study duration, the SIDS protocol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes somewhat less information for each endpoint, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison with the selected 90-day subchronic inhalation study,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with relatively small savings in time and cost. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIDS protocol includes a fertility screen (i.e., one-generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive study), but does not include an examination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fetus for teratogenic effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, today's final rule requires F/FA manufacturers to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the more standard 90-day subchronic inhalation protocol for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of health effects, with an exposure regimen of at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least six hours per day, five days per week. EPA judges the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure regimen of five days per week for the 90-day protocol to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the minimum acceptable exposure period for the purposes of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 evaluation. Also, the 90-day protocol provides a broad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and efficient testing approach that allows the evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several endpoints at the end of the same exposure period using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same exposed test animals. As a result, the modified Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program provides a reduction in the number of animals needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform the evaluation of the endpoints of concern and savings on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission generation and testing costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

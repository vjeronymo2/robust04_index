			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Single premium business ahead by 19% at CU Commercial Union, the composite insurance group, reported a 19 per cent increase in new life assurance and pensions business during 1991. In common with Prudential, which announced new business figures earlier in the week, most of the gain came from single-premium business which increased 19 per cent to Pounds 597.8m. There was a 9 per cent increase to Pounds 146.3m in annual premiums, which are seen as being more vulnerable to a recession. Single premiums to personal pensions accounted for much of the rise, while new annual premiums for life policies fell by 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: OECD jobless total may hit 35m in 1994 As many as 35m people could be jobless in the industrialised world next year and the modest growth in prospect holds out little hope of a rapid fall in unemployment, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports in the latest half-yearly Economic Outlook. The Paris-based body, which is owned by governments to promote international economic co-operation, says an increasingly solid expansion is under way in North America while moderate, if unspectacular, recoveries are continuing in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and some smaller European countries. Activity in member countries should also be supported by strong growth outside the OECD, especially in Asia. But in continental Europe, the recovery that was expected last spring is 'not yet apparent', while economic activity in Japan has renewed its decline. The OECD expects gross domestic product of the industrialised countries will grow by 2.1 per cent next year after only 1.1 per cent in 1993 and will accelerate to 2.7 per cent in 1995. It is a measure of the frustrations and exaggerated hopes of the past two years that its forecasts for the period immediately ahead are roughly the same as those in its Outlook of December 1991. One bright spot is the fall in inflation to 4 per cent or less in 20 of the organisation's member states. This trend is forecast to continue with inflation in the area, excluding Turkey, expected to fall to 2 1/4 per cent by 1995. This, if sustained, 'will help to establish an economic environment more conducive to sustainable increases in productive investment, output and employment than has existed since the early 1960s.' In the short term, however, the employment outlook is bleak, especially on the European continent. The OECD expects the European jobless rate will rise to 11.5 per cent in 1995, when more than 22m will be out of work, from 8.6 per cent in 1991, when 16.5m Europeans were unemployed. The marked economic variations among the OECD's 24 member states require significantly different policy responses. However, the organisation urges all countries to press on with structural reform to make economies more efficient. In particular, it urges the increased use of market mechanisms to improve quality of public spending. Otherwise, it sees little scope for fiscal policy to support activity because most countries are having to deal with excessive budget deficits. In Europe, for example, there is 'virtually no room for any fiscal stimulus'. Indeed, some heavily indebted countries including Italy, Belgium and Greece, should do more to cut their budget deficits. It recommends caution even in Japan, which is perhaps the only big member country able to contemplate a fiscal boost. Tax cuts should be temporary and designed to achieve other desirable goals. For example, a cut in Japan's direct taxes now could be offset later by a phased introduction of higher indirect taxes which would improve government revenues. The gathering US recovery suggests 'this is the one major country where additional support to activity is not an immediate concern'. Instead, the OECD reminds Washington that more action will be needed to reduce its structural budget deficit. It hints strongly that the Federal Reserve will have to tighten monetary policy soon to lock in low inflation and projects a steady rise in US three-month interest rates to 4.7 per cent in the second half of next year and 5.1 per cent in late 1995, from 3 per cent at present. Interest rates will be crucial to developments in Europe. The OECD argues that falling rates have underpinned recovery in the English-speaking countries and prescribes the same medicine for the European continent but not for the UK. Yesterday Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said that monetary easing must play the central role in supporting economic recovery on the European continent. 'At this stage, prospects for a decline in German inflation appear favourable, and any room for easing monetary conditions further without undermining the credibility of policy should be used fully,' he said. However the OECD outlook recognises that problems could arise if German inflation remains high. To cope with this, other European countries should take steps to bolster their own counter-inflation credibility, possibly by setting inflation targets or giving their central banks greater independence.

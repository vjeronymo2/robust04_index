Kovacevic: "Milovanovic: Air Strikes Would </F> Not Pay Off"]    [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Feb -- "Air strikes against Serbian  positions will not pay off for the possible attackers," chief of  staff of the Srpska republic army Major General Manojlo  Milovanovic assessed today.    Stressing that the military leadership had assessed the  threat of NATO air strikes very seriously, and adding that NATO  represented a very respectable force, he warned that the  attacking squadrons would not be able to sustain the losses that  the artillery units of the Srpska republic army would inflict on  them during each sortie. General Milovanovic believes that of  the 60 to 70 NATO planes that would "fly per sortie," at least  every tenth plane would not return to base.    The Srpska republic army command is aware that NATO pilots,  who have been flying over Bosnia for months, have photographed  every detail and every inch of the territory. In addition to  this, they have been trained for various operations. However,  the antiaircraft defense of the Srpska republic army also had to  prepare appropriate counter measures and tactics, including  permanent and reserve radar stations, some of which even "cover"  the area of the Adriatic Sea and some neighboring countries.  The antiaircraft units will also rely on the extremely  sophisticated electronic innovations and products of the  industry in the Srpska republic.    The Srpska republic army also possesses a significant number  of artillery pieces that have so far been used in battle for  targets on the ground, but the crews have also been  exceptionally well trained for their basic assignments. Their  combat readiness is at a peak, as if the air strikes are going  to commence right away.    The heavy snowfalls over Sarajevo in recent days have  prevented NATO patrols from carrying out even routine control  flights from the "Deny Flight" plan.</p>

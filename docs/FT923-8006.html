			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Japanese vehicle industry alarmed by Nafta THE JAPANESE vehicle industry reacted with alarm yesterday to tougher requirements for local content under the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which it said would particularly affect its car output in Canada, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. Government and business leaders generally gave a cool response to the tripartite pact, saying it seemed to increase barriers to goods from outside. Japan is asking Gatt's secretariat to set up a working party on the pact. This would be charged with examining whether Wednesday's US-Canada-Mexico agreement met Gatt requirements for member countries. The accord 'could be inconsistent with Gatt principles,' said Mr Yasuo Tanabe, director of North America trade policy planning at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. His comments were echoed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Jama), which described the agreement's provisions as counter to a freer global trade system. Japan will also air its qualms with the three countries. Officials made clear they were reserving judgment until then, when they would also have seen the full text. Mr Tanabe said Japan welcomed free trade pacts with 'a positive effect to outside countries' flow of trade and investment and to global trade as a whole'. The agreement should not deflect attempts to reach an overdue conclusion to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks which should remain the top policy issue for Gatt member nations. Mr Hajime Ohta, director of international economic affairs at the Keidanren, Japan's private-sector federation of economic groups, said that as in the case of the US-Canada free trade pact, much would depend on how Nafta would be interpreted and implemented. Operation of the accord would have to be transparent to outsiders, but local content rules 'might be a violation of the Gatt code'.</p>

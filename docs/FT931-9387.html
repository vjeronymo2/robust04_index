			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Population crisis in Daisyworld I HAD another lesson this week with Jasper Strong, my 6ft 5in, sportscar-driving, blond-locked tennis coach. For two hours we worked on my back-court shots, the drives, the lobs and half-volleys. 'Remember,' said Jasper, 'the lob is a lifting shot. Try to concentrate. Your mind should be blank.' I once asked Jasper why he persists with me. All his other clients are rich and wistful women who live in Daisyworld: the area off London's Kensington Church Street. 'Well,' said Jasper. 'You are the only media whinger that I know. You have an interesting mind. Pitiful, but interesting.' He is 23, with a degree in sports studies. As soon as the lesson was over, Jasper interrogated me about my remarks last week on unchecked population growth - specifically, my belief that the planet is hurtling towards a catastrophe caused by manic pollution and over-consumption. 'Priscilla Humpington-Kooning says you're wrong,' said Jasper. 'She says you are a pessimist and a cynic.' Mrs Humpington-Kooning is one of his Kensington clients: beautiful and silly-rich. 'Priscilla says that from now on there will be progress in education, health, family planning and improvement of women's status to counteract population growth, and that technological prowess will help us master planetry degradation. She looked up some figures for me. Priscilla says that if the overall fertility rate stabilises at below two children per woman, world population will fall quite rapidly, perhaps to 5bn-6bn again by 2150. At a rate of 1.7, world population in 2150 would be the same as in 1978, about 4.3bn. Priscilla says optimism on this score is not far-fetched. Europe's current average fertility rate is 1.7. Eleven developed countries are already below it.' 'Sure, Jasper,' I said. 'That is the view from Daisyworld. But I am a Cassandra, a neo-Malthusian. It is equally possible that world population will shoot to 20bn-30bn. Last week I mentioned Paul Harrison and his book, The Third Revolution. Everyone should read it. Referring to a population of 20bn-30bn, Harrison says: 'Assuming such numbers were sustainable, life could come to resemble the prophetic film Soylent Green, where meat and soap are exquisite rarities; nature is glimpsed only in videos played to euthanasia volunteers . . . and human corpses are recycled as high-protein biscuits.' 'Take water, Jasper. I know that when you visit Priscilla, she runs Perrier through the Jacuzzi for you as a prelude to rumpy-pumpy. There is not an obvious scarcity of water in Daisyworld. But its supply is finite. The global annual run-off from rainfall is 41,000 square kilometres. Of that, perhaps 9,000 sq km are available for human use. Of that, we already use more than a third. There will be wars over water. Even then, we are not facing a resource crisis but a pollution crisis. At the end of his lifetime the average European leaves a monument of waste almost 1,000 times his bodyweight. North Americans leave a waste mausoleum 3,900 times their bodyweight.' 'So what are your solutions to population growth?' I said: 'All the usual: education, contraception, immense advances in women's status. But for Cassandras like me, more will be needed. We disagree with the idea that compulsion over family size has no role to play - that it violates human rights and is only possible in non-democratic societies. India and China are the only two countries to have tried it on a large scale so far. In India, family planning was said to have been set back a decade by Indira Gandhi's coercive vasectomy programme. 'However, I believe that such schemes will become the norm. I see nothing wrong with tax bonuses for childlessness or even the odd spot of castration for recidivist or overly gung-ho males.' Jasper had turned chalk-white. 'I thought you were supposed to be a liberal,' he whined. 'I am a liberal, Jasper - but a liberal from the middle of the 21st century. You should see what right-wingers will be like in 2050.' Jasper was stricken. But then he brightened. 'I'll see you next week,' he said. 'What you need most is some extremely serious gym work. I will draw up a programme. Meantime, get your hair cut.'</p>

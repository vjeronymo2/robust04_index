			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUCE HOROVITZ' STORY ON MINORITIES IN PUBLIC RELATIONS SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED  ALL COLORS  </P> <P> Talk about a misleading headline.  </P> <P> The Bruce Horovitz column didn't address what it promised: an up-to-date report  on the industry's quest to improve employment opportunities for  under-represented ethnic groups in communications.  </P> <P> In the article, Horovitz writes about the challenges facing "minority" public  relations practitioners and focuses almost exclusively on the black experience.  While we applaud such reporting efforts and agree with the observations made by  the black professionals who were quoted, we must take issue with Horovitz'  definition of "minority."  </P> <P> Why did Horovitz neglect to interview professionals from other  under-represented groups, in particular Latinos or Asians who make up two  significant minority populations in Los Angeles? Certainly it is not for lack  of sources, such as the Hispanic Public Relations Assn., which has been "doing  something about the 'unmentionable' problem of jobs for minorities" for five  years.  </P> <P> As the most influential newspaper on the West Coast, many look to The Times to  provide an accurate portrayal of the challenges facing L.A., the nation's most  ethnically diverse major city. Please broaden your definition to include other  points of view.  </P> <P> MAGDALENA H. BELTRAN  </P> <P> JACQUELINE DIAZ  </P> <P> Coronado Communications Corp.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

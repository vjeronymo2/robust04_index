			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Removing catastrophe from crisis  -Paul Abrahams examines attempts to stave off the gloom at Bayer BAYER, the first of the German chemicals giants to report full-year results for 1992, yesterday painted a gloomy picture of the European economy's outlook. Mr Manfred Schneider, the chairman said: 'The start of the year has been anything but satisfactory. Crisis is a productive state. We just have to remove the sense of catastrophe that goes with it.' Preliminary figures for the first half of March suggested that month-on-month sales figures had stabilised, however. Over the year, Bayer expected a fall of German sales of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. Worldwide sales for the year would improve on the 11 per cent fall during the first two months, he said. But he cautioned that only last autumn the Bayer board had expected 3 per cent growth in group sales for 1993. Bayer announced a reduced working schedule for 3,000 employees following a collapse in demand for dyes, coating raw materials and polyurethanes. Chemicals plant operating rates fell below 70 per cent during February, the first time they had done so since the early 1980s. The company is looking for the first time at possible swaps or joint ventures with other companies, said Mr Schneider. Candidates included polyurethanes, polymers, titanium dioxide, chromium, dyestuffs and organic chemicals. 'This is a change of mentality. In the past, we have been reserved about such options, but we are now open to this type of deal - they are a good method for dealing with structural problems,' said Mr Schneider. At the same time, he said, the group intends to increase its capital investment in Asia, particularly China, Taiwan and Indonesia. The company's position had been exacerbated by the German health reforms, introduced in January. Their effects had been far worse than expected. He warned: 'If Germany really does become a country of generic drugs and cut-price medicines, there is no real future for research-based healthcare companies in this country.' Deteriorating conditions in Germany could force Bayer to concentrate abroad, he said, primarily the US and Japan. Drug sales in Germany had fallen by between 20 per cent and 40 per cent during January and February, clipping DM35m off operating profits. Mr Schneider said he expected the healthcare division to report static profits during 1993 because of the reforms. The company will be cutting expenditure on drugs marketing.</p>

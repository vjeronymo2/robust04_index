			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Out of order Sir, I recently asked at my local post office for a postal order for Pounds 13, to send to my nephew whose 13th birthday approaches. I was given two postal orders, one for Pounds 10, for which the charge was 66p, and one for Pounds 3, for which the charge was 44p. This represents percentage charges of 6 per cent and 14.7 per cent. The total price of Pounds 14.10 represented a charge of 8.5 per cent. It seems to me that this puts the contentious topic of bank charges into a new perspective. It is also a further demonstration of the fact that the poorer you are, the more you have to pay. I shall not be purchasing any more postal orders.

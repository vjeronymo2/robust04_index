			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Monopoly game IT IS EASY to understand why the British government is setting up a national lottery. If people are keen to play a game which leads to cash being channelled to a variety of good causes, this has obvious attractions over raising money through direct taxation. What is much harder to understand is why a Conservative government, which has pioneered privatisation and liberalisation, plans to set up the lottery as a quasi state monopoly. The experience of other industries from telecommunications to airlines is that state monopolies are inefficient, unimaginative and lead to the government controlling a larger proportion of national life than is desirable. Advocates of the national lottery may say that it does not amount to nationalisation by the back door because operating it will be contracted out to the private sector. But the government will still pick the franchisee and the money for good causes will be channelled through a fund controlled by the National Heritage secretary. Advocates of the lottery may also try to argue that it will not be a monopoly, because charities and local authorities are allowed to run their own small lotteries, while football pools provide punters with an opportunity for a flutter very similar to the one which will be provided by the national lottery. The snag is that both charity lotteries and the pools will be competing on a playing field tilted sharply in the national lottery's favour. The maximum prize for a charity lottery at Pounds 25,000 pales in comparison with the prizes of Pounds 1m and more that the national lottery will offer. Meanwhile, pools companies pay out roughly half their takings in tax and donations to good causes and are tightly regulated in how they can promote their games. It would be far better for the government to throw open the market to any competitors which could show they would run lotteries honestly and fairly. Applicants could include pools companies, charities and perhaps even government departments. At the same time, the government should create a level playing field. One way of doing this would be to set a standard tax rate of, say, 50 per cent on all lottery takings. Any donations to charities or other defined good causes would be fully deductible from this tax and the profit or loss (after donations, tax, prize money and administration costs) would accrue to the private operators. One could expect three main advantages from such a competitive market in lotteries. First, the profit motive would drive down administration costs. Second, a free market would allow punters to choose where their money went by playing those games which sponsored their favourite causes. Finally, since the money for good causes would not flow through a fund controlled by a government minister, there would be no danger of the Treasury consolidating it into public funds at some future date.</p>

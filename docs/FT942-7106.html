			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / PC screen text fails the test of readability If you find it hard to read words on a personal computer screen, you are in good company. A leading US-based computer scientist warned last night that even the best of today's personal computer screens could not display extended text, such as newspaper articles or encyclopaedia entries, so they can be read in comfort. The better a reader you are, he said, the more difficulty you will experience in reading from a screen. Mr Alan Kay, widely credited as the inspiration behind many of the best-known features of personal computers, including screen 'windows' and the 'mouse' pointing device, said the discovery called into question the use of computers in schools for teaching reading. He said: 'It is almost a crime to put computers into schools to teach reading because nothing is more antagonistic to the act of reading than a conventional computer screen.' It also raises questions about the suitability of personal computer technology for on-line text retrieval and other information and entertainment services. Mr Kay, formerly a top scientist for Xerox and now research fellow at Apple Computer, was giving the sixth Charles Read Memorial lecture in London. He is now studying the use of computers in educating children. Mr Kay's conclusions were based on experiments carried out using equipment built for the US space programme and capable of detecting minute eye movements. They show that, close to a screen, the eye is capable of detecting minute changes in light intensity as the image is refreshed, and these are unconsciously recorded by the viewer. The brain interprets them as warning signals in a throwback to the days when humans had to be alert to the possibility of sudden charges by sabre-toothed tigers and the like. The eyes, in consequence, wander continually to the edges of the screen to try to identify the danger. Mr Kay said it was technically possible to build a screen suitable for reading text. It would have 6.3m picture elements (pixels) compared with the 300,000 on a typical PC screen. It would have a contrast ratio similar to white paper of 100:1 compared to 30:1 for a computer screen; and it would refresh the screen at more than 100 frames a second. Such a screen, built at Xerox's research headquarters, had cost Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 133,333). Screens of equivalent quality might be available at an economic price in five years, he thought.</p>

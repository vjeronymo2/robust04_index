			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: ON-LINE SERVICES LEAPING FORWARD  </P> <P> Ten years ago, two companies set out to create an industry. In 1979, CompuServe  and the Source launched competing electronic information services for personal  computer owners.  </P> <P> Subscribers to either service who hooked their computers up to a telephone line  could, among other things, send and receive electronic mail. Over the years,  both services added features such as access to home shopping, electronic  "bulletin boards," up-to-the-minute news, travel information, encyclopedias and  much more.  </P> <P> I was once a regular user of the Source, but I stopped using it a few years ago  when I noticed that CompuServe offered more features for about the same price.  I wasn't alone. The Source, which was once owned by Reader's Digest, reportedly  peaked at about 80,000 subscribers in 1985 and sank to about 50,000 users by  the end of 1988.  </P> <P> CompuServe, however, has grown steadily. The company claims to have more than  500,000 subscribers. And it is about to add thousands more by virtue of its  agreement announced June 29 to acquire the Source for an undisclosed amount.  The company plans to shut down the Source in August and issue a free CompuServe  password and a $20 credit to each current subscriber.  </P> <P> Normally, I would mourn the death of an industry pioneer and lament what might  seem like bad news for consumers. But the "on-line" industry has heated up  lately and CompuServe faces other competitors that are far more innovative and  aggressive than its former rival.  </P> <P> Competition between services was once based on the number of features, or  information services, available. But companies are also competing on ease of  use and cost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change in Communication  </P> <P> When you're connected to a traditional on-line service, your PC essentially  works as a dumb terminal talking to a giant mainframe. The Source and  CompuServe subscribers, in general, communicate with the mainframe directly,  issuing commands in response to on-screen instructions or "menus." Both systems  are easier to use than many academic and corporate mainframes, but neither is  as easy to use as the best of today's personal computer programs. That,  however, is changing.  </P> <P> CompuServe is working on a new program, called the CompuServe Information  Manager, that will revolutionize the way people use the service. A version for  IBM PC and compatible computers will be released this fall followed by a  Macintosh version early next year.  </P> <P> After experimenting with an advance copy of the software, I am convinced that  the service will not only be easier to use but also more economical. Instead of  responding to prompts from the mainframe, the user issues commands by selecting  them from pull-down menus at the top of the PC screen.  </P> <P> Users can also save money by doing some of their work before connecting to the  service. Electronic mail, for example, can be composed and read "off-line" so  that you don't have to pay the hourly fee while you are reading or typing.  </P> <P> The program that will run on your PC or Macintosh is designed to work directly  with the software that runs on the service's mainframes. As a result, the  personal computer is more than a terminal. It's actually a peer in the  communications loop, which makes the service easy to use.  </P> <P> CompuServe requires a $39 start-up kit and costs $12.50 an hour for the basic  service. There are surcharges for some of its databases.  </P> <P> CompuServe's new software follows a trend that was started by several of the  company's competitors. Prodigy, MacNet and PC-Link already came with software  designed to make them easy to use.  </P> <P> Prodigy's software, for example, completely takes over your PC, presenting the  user with graphics, extra large type and easy-to-remember commands. The service  has been criticized, however, because its software does not allow users to save  information on their hard disk or transfer information from their PC's disk to  the service's electronic mail. All messages must be typed in at the keyboard.  </P> <P> Prodigy offers travel information, headline news and access to "experts" in  such areas as fitness (Jane Fonda), movies (Gene Siskel), personal finance  (Sylvia Porter) and computers (Stewart Alsop and yours truly. I write three  on-line columns each week.) The experts no longer provide personal responses  via the system's electronic mail service but do answer public messages posted  on bulletin boards.  </P> <P> A Prodigy start-up kit costs $49 and includes three months of free use.  Subsequent use is billed at $10 a month, with no charge for on-line time.  Prodigy draws additional revenue by displaying advertisements at the bottom of  the screen and by allowing merchants to sell products and services on-line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Innovative Approach  </P> <P> MacNet from Connect Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., provides an extremely innovative  approach to on-line information. The Macintosh version behaves exactly as  regular Macintosh software does, even while you are connected with the  mainframe. Data is displayed in multiple windows, and you can easily copy and  paste information from the MacNet screen to any other Macintosh application.  </P> <P> An IBM PC version called PC/MacNet runs under Microsoft's Windows operating  environment and thus is very similar to the Mac version.  </P> <P> MacNet is aimed at business and professional users and has no games or  entertainment features. It does provide excellent electronic mail, as well as  various news services. Reading news on MacNet is a joy. In addition to the  latest news, the past two week's news stories are available in "folders" that  are visible on the screen. You can access news from any day by using the mouse  to click on its folder. You then get a list of headlines and can read a story  by clicking the headline.  </P> <P> Everything you do during a session remains on the screen, in a window, which  can be viewed by selecting it from a special menu on the top of the screen. The  service is so "Mac like" that it's easy to forget that you're on-line.  </P> <P> MacNet and PC/MacNet require a $75 start-up kit that includes software and your  account number. Usage costs $8 a hour during weekdays and $4 evenings and  weekends.  </P> <P> PC-Link, from Quantum Computer Services, offers news from USA Today along with  business news, stock updates, travel, electronic mail, an encyclopedia,  software library and all the usual on-line features. It uses Tandy's DeskMate  interface which, like Microsoft Windows, works with a mouse and pull-down  menus.  </P> <P> It's extremely easy and pleasant to use with screens that are colorful and easy  to read. The start-up kit, available at any Radio Shack store, costs $30. There  is a $10 monthly fee, but there are no hourly fees for evening and weekend use.  </P> <P> A premium service, called PC-Link Plus, costs 10 cents per minute. There is a  15-cents-a-minute surcharge when using the service during the business day. It  works with any IBM compatible PC and can be purchased at any Radio Shack store.  Quantum offers similar services for the Commodore 64/128 and Apple II. A  Macintosh version is in development.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the authors cannot  respond individually to letters. Write to Lawrence J. Magid, P.O.

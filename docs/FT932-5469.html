			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Allstate's share offer largest seen in US SHARES in Allstate, the second largest car and home insurer in the US and previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sears, Roebuck group, were priced last night at Dollars 27. This is at the upper end of the indicated price range for the flotation, which ranged between Dollars 24 and Dollars 27. Last night's pricing makes the Allstate flotation the largest initial public offering ever seen in the US. The company is selling 78.5m shares to outside investors, including 10m to non-US investors. At the Dollars 27 price, this will raise Dollars 2.12bn. Underwriters' over-allotment options, if exercised, could take the total number of shares available to 89.5m. Prior to yesterday's flotation of Allstate shares, the largest initial offering in the US had come from Conrail. In 1987, the transportation group raised Dollars 1.64bn. In terms of all stock offerings - whether flotations or secondary offerings  -the Allstate transaction ranks in third place, behind share sales by British Petroleum and Time Warner. The shares being sold by Allstate represent 20 per cent of the insurer's equity. Sears, based in Chicago, will continue to hold the remaining 80 per cent. Sears first announced plans to spin off a minority stake in Allstate last year, as part of its general strategy of pulling out of financial services and concentrating on its core retail business. Sears has already sold a 20 per cent stake in Dean Witter, Discover, netting about Dollars 800m, and announced sale plans for its Coldwell Banker operations. Allstate is the second largest writer of homeowners and car insurance policies in the US, behind State Farm, also based in Illinois. State Farm, however, remains a 'mutual' company, essentially owned by its policyholders. Allstate is likely to become the second biggest quoted insurer in the US, in terms of stock-market capitalisation, behind American International Group.</p>

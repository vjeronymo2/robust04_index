			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro doubles its first-quarter net profit NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest publicly-quoted company, has more than doubled first-quarter net profits to NKr506m (Dollars 75.5m) from NKr217m last year, helped by lower production costs, higher crude oil output and a higher krone/dollar exchange rate. The result was better than analysts' forecasts as Hydro's four main business segments outperformed expectations by boosting operating profits and sales. The shares closed up NKr3.50 at NKr168 on the Oslo bourse yesterday. Group sales increased by NKr807m to NKr16.47bn as operating profit rose by NKr398m to NKr1.44bn. 'Hydro's oil and gas activities are continuing to develop favourably, but otherwise the first quarter was characterised by the persistent difficult market conditions and depressed prices,' said Mr Egil Myklebust, chief executive. Net financial expenses were cut to NKr625m from NKr868m as foreign exchange losses fell to NKr194m from NKr470m. Hydro blamed the currency loss on a fall in the value of forward contracts and a loss on receivables due to a strengthening of the krone against European currencies. The company said in the second quarter it would book a NKr2.4bn gain, before interest income and tax, on the disposal of its 38.3 per cent shareholding in Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's biggest chocolate producer, acquired by Kraft General Foods International. KGFI paid NKr3.4bn for Hydro's Freia stake. The agriculture division lifted operating profit by NKr56m to NKr251m on sales up NKr133m to NKr7.373bn. Oil and gas lifted operating profit by NKr162m to NKr900m on sales up NKr566m to NKr3.58bn. Light metals improved operating profit by NKr201m to NKr290m on sales up NKr159m to NKr4.3bn. Petrochemicals' profit rose by NKr16m to NKr112m on sales up NKr48m to NKr1.1bn.</p>

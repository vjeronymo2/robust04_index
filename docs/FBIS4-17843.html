			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 27 TASS--Boris Yeltsin's decision to  look into the problem of the expediency of Russo-US military  exercises planned to be conducted in the Orenburg region might  negatively affect the relations between the two countries, said  presidential aide for issues of national security, Yuriy  Baturin, in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. "However,  Americans are sensible enough, they know how talks should be  conducted and it is possible to come to terms with them on all  positions," Baturin said.    He said that Yeltsin's attitude to the problem was  influenced  by numerous requests made by deputies of the State Duma to look  into the matter and, for the last time, such a request was made  by the Duma council. The president received protests from the  Orenburg region, where the exercises were scheduled to take  place. As a result, Yeltsin decided to look into the matter  again, Baturin said.    Asked about unjustified expenditures in connection with  preparations for the exercises, Baturin said that the  "involvement of military units had not been envisaged. There  were plans that the exercises would be held by a limited number  of Russian and U.S. officers and generals with the help of maps  and computers, Baturin said. In his opinion, the material cost  of the exercises, unlike the political cost, is not big at all.</p>

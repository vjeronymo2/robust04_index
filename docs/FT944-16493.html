			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Heseltine pushes for postal sell-off - Chief whip to have final say on privatisation go-ahead / Backbench critics softening Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday sought to steady government nerves on the proposed Royal Mail flotation in a barnstorming conference speech extolling the benefits of privatisation. Amid cabinet uncertainty about the government's ability to push privatisation through the Commons, Mr Heseltine warned against caution and urged the party to 'force the pace of change'. Senior ministers say the cabinet will decide shortly whether to include a Post Office privatisation bill in the Queen's Speech for the next parliament, which starts in mid-November. There is a small cabinet majority for Mr Heseltine's plan to float 51 per cent of the Royal Mail, following the conversion of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who was sceptical but now believes privatisation is the best option. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has supported Mr Heseltine, as have rightwing cabinet ministers such as Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, who yesterday strongly defended privatisation at a conference fringe meeting. However, the final decision will depend on a judgment by Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, on the number of Conservative backbench MPs who may defy the government and oppose the bill. Mr Ryder is believed to be confident that the bill can be forced through, in spite of the death yesterday of Mr John Blackburn, MP for Dudley West, which reduces the government's majority to 14. But senior ministers say no decisions will be made until further soundings have been taken when MPs return to the Commons for the autumn 'spillover' session next week. 'At the moment, the numbers don't look very good,' said one. There is some evidence of softening opposition among critics of privatisation, following government assurances on universal delivery prices and the future of rural post offices. Mr David Nicholson, chairman of the West Country group of Conservative MPs, many of whom remain unconvinced about the merits of privatisation, signalled that some backbench critics were ready to be won over. 'If Mr Heseltine is to proceed with a partial privatisation and to get second-reading support, the government will have to continue to explain, in detail, why it is important for the industry,' he said. Mr Heseltine, making his first conference speech since suffering a heart attack last year, won a two-minute standing ovation for a wideranging speech which demonstrated his continuing mastery of conference oratory. Lauding the government's earlier privatisation achievements, he dismissed 'those who tell me that the best way for the Tories to win the next election is to slow the pace, to ease the pressure, to opt for the quiet life'. As representatives cheered, he told them: 'What the government is considering and consulting about is how to allow the Royal Mail to be as successful as British Telecom or British Airways.' Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW communications union, said in Bournemouth that Mr Hesel-tine's failure to announce the go-ahead for privatisation 'illustrates how deep-seated government fears are over the future of our trusted and cherished Post Office'. He said most Conservative party members 'seem aware that privatising and breaking up the Post Office would not only be damaging and unnecessary but also deeply unpopular'.</p>

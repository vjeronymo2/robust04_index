			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian winter crop forecast at 12-year low Latest forecasts put Australia's drought-affected winter crop production at 13.5m tonnes, down from 28.4m tonnes in 1993-94. The aggregate figure, published yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, includes a marginal upward revision  - an additional 400,000 tonnes  - to reflect the scattered rainfall received in some cropping areas in late October and early November. Nevertheless, if the estimated production levels prove accurate, they will represent the lowest winter crop seen in Australia since 1982-83. The New South Wales crop is forecast to be just 850,000 tonnes, down from 7.65m tonnes in the previous year. In Queensland, winter crop production is put at 250,000 tonnes, about one-quarter of the levels seen in each of the previous two years. These two states have been worst affected by the current drought, one of the most severe this century. Wheat production is forecast at 8.6m tonnes, down 49 per cent on the previous crop, reflecting both the reduced acreage sown and the fall in yields across Australia caused by below-average spring rainfall. The Australian federal government is revamp the organisation of the country's ADollars 5bn meat industry, handing more responsibility for marketing and development to producers and processors. The changes, which have been endorsed by the federal cabinet, follow criticism from beef exporters about the degree of statutory intervention in the industry, and the lack of responsiveness to producers' concerns. A new meat industry policy council will take over responsibility for the ADollars 150m raised by compulsory levies and spent on promotion and research.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUES EX-LINCOLN S&amp;L OPERATORS FOR $2.4 BILLION  </P> <P> Federal regulators filed a civil lawsuit Friday in Phoenix charging that the  former operators of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan devised a  racketeering scheme to siphon $1.1 billion in federally insured deposits from  the now-insolvent thrift for their own use.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, is the largest ever filed against  directors and officers of failed institutions. With punitive damages and  trebling provisions under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations Act, the government is seeking to recover up to $2.4 billion from  the defendants.  </P> <P> Industry experts estimated that Lincoln's collapse will cost taxpayers up to  $2.5 billion, which would make it the costliest S&amp;L failure in history.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Pattern of Deception'  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental  Corp., and other executives bought the S&amp;L in 1984 and began "to divert . .  . Lincoln's deposits and assets to themselves" through a wide range of  "illegal, fraudulent and imprudent acts," including false and misleading  statements to regulators, forgery and concealment of illegal cash payments.  </P> <P> The racketeering scheme was devised to fuel the operation's "speculative"  business ventures, from securities trading to real estate deals, the suit said.  And to further the scheme, the suit claims, the defendants "engaged in a  pattern of deception to mask prohibited and sham transactions from regulatory  scrutiny."  </P> <P> The suit also seeks to freeze the assets of Keating, who is a multimillionaire,  and others, allowing each to live on $3,000 a month.  </P> <P> Keating was out of town and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> A lawyer for Phoenix-based American Continental called the racketeering charges  "mean-spirited" on the part of regulators and denied that Keating and the other  36 defendants were liable for any of the 14 claims made in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seized in April  </P> <P> "There are no surprises here," said Melvin A. McDonald, a lawyer for the  company, about the allegations. "This is the same old wine in the same old  bottles -- the same information regulators have had for years. They're just  trying to put new labels on the bottles."  </P> <P> The suit stemmed from an in-depth investigation by regulators, said Alan  Whitney, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures  deposits at Lincoln.  </P> <P> Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed  for bankruptcy. Regulators declared the S&amp;L insolvent on Aug. 2 and put it  in receivership. The suit is the first major legal action brought by the  Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created last month by a new federal law to  handle failed banks and thrifts.  </P> <P> The suit alleges four RICO violations and three violations of Arizona's  racketeering laws against Keating and six executives, including his son and two  sons-in-law. An additional seven allegations accuse the defendants -- 20  individuals and 17 companies -- of fraud, conspiracy, negligence and violations  of regulatory laws.  </P> <P> The defendants include William J. Keating, a former congressman and former  publisher of the Cincinnati Enquirer. He is Charles Keating's brother. Their  spouses and those of several other defendants were also named in the suit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Defendants  </P> <P> Keating and the other defendants are accused of wrongdoing in transactions  involving high-yield corporate securities known as junk bonds, corporate stock  bought by American Continental's employee stock ownership plan, land sold to  related parties allegedly for above-market prices and straw borrowers and straw  purchasers allegedly used to avoid direct investment regulations.  </P> <P> The suit also claims that American Continental wrongly appropriated money from  Lincoln to pay corporate taxes, resulting in a $125-million loss of income to  the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Much of the alleged wrongdoing, the suit said, was the result of Keating's  effort to get around federal regulations that limited the amount of money that  Lincoln could use to invest in such things as real estate and securities.  </P> <P> In one example cited in the suit, Keating and others sold a residential  development to R.A. Homes in Phoenix. The transaction was financed through  Lincoln, and Keating entities maintained control over the development. R.A.  Homes is operated by Ron Ober, who has been campaign manager for Sen. Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cheap Sale Alleged  </P> <P> The suit also alleges that the defendants manipulated a number of stock  transactions that will result in more than $22 million in damages to Lincoln.  </P> <P> In one transaction, the defendants allegedly caused Lincoln to sell stock in  Memorex International to a third party for $1 million -- after the investment  banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert sent a letter saying the stock was worth  $2.8 million. The third party soon sold the stock to American Continental for  $2 million, and the company later sold the stock at its market value -- $13.3  million. The suit claims the company misappropriated $11.3 million in profits  that should have gone to Lincoln.  </P> <P> And the defendants also tried to avoid regulations limiting loans to insiders,  the suit said. The primary example involved funds that Lincoln made available  to Southmark Corp. in Dallas and its subsidiaries and about $35 million in  loans that Southmark's thrift subsidiary, San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan Assn.,  made to a Keating-led partnership that owns the Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit.  </P> <P> McDonald was angered that the suit named the spouses of some American  Continental executives as defendants. Though not named as racketeering  defendants, he said, the spouses named in the suit suffer the same "powerful"  stigma that attaches to other defendants.  </P> <P> Several sources said regulators had been debating internally for a month about  whether to bring racketeering claims and seek to recover of damages from  Keating's assets or sue only for fraud and work out a more certain settlement  with the insurance carrier covering director and officer liability.  </P></p>

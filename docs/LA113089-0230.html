			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PALMER OF 'TODAY' TO RETURN 'ONLY YESTERDAY'  </P> <P> John Palmer, ousted earlier this fall as news anchor for NBC's "Today" show  after seven years, has signed with King World to be host of a syndicated  program to be launched next fall called "Only Yesterday."  </P> <P> The program will be produced by former ABC News executive Av Westin.  Salespersons are already crisscrossing the country on behalf of "Only  Yesterday" for King World -- syndicators of such blockbusters as "The Oprah  Winfrey Show" and "Wheel of Fortune" as well as a revamped (by Westin) "Inside  Edition."  </P> <P> Local sources who have seen the demonstration film say "Only Yesterday"  resembles Linda Ellerbee's "Our World" program for ABC News a couple of seasons  back, featuring nostalgic looks back at several major news stories each day --  followed by updates from participants. Westin produced "Our World" at ABC.  </P> <P> The weekday show will be ready for stations in September.  </P> <P> Earlier this year in a still-debated move to attract a younger audience, NBC  News Senior Vice President Dick Ebersol forced Palmer to switch jobs with "NBC  News at Sunrise" anchor Deborah Norville. That turned out to be the first of a  series of moves that shortly after the first of the year will have resulted in  the departures from the show of not only Palmer but also longtime anchor Jane  Pauley, who has been replaced by the self-same Norville.  </P> <P> Mary Alice Williams reportedly is a leading candidate -- if she wants the job  -- to replace Palmer on "Sunrise," when she returns from a pending maternity  leave early next year.  </P> <P> Palmer, who got a multi-year contract, with options, from King World,  reportedly chose "Only Yesterday" over several attractive options, including  the chance to be an anchor-correspondent for NBC-owned WTVJ in Miami, in part  because it allows the family, which includes three small children, to remain in  New York.  </P></p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / A sense of shock: The uncertainty surrounding Algeria's elections As Algeria's first multi-party elections enter a crucial stage this week, an exercise promoted as a means of rebuilding trust between 25m people and their rulers has turned sour. Its effects may be felt as far afield as Morocco, Tunisia and across the shores of the Mediterranean. In a capital city where reality and fiction are often hard to disentangle, no one doubts that Moslem fundamentalist candidates wearing the colours of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) could well gain two-thirds of the seats in the future national assembly. Nothing else is certain. Not since the Front de Liberation National (FLN) came to power in 1962 after the war of independence have Algerians had such a great sense of history in the making. But whereas in 1962 the mood on the streets was one of unity and hope, today it is deeply divided. So far, the election results have provoked little response from the governing FLN, and stunned silence from President Chadli Bendjedid, whose party has been consumed by damaging in-fighting, corruption and a lack of any clear political and social reforms. Despite economic liberalisation measures the country has been paralysed by the FLN's incapacity to reform a heavily centralised economy in the wake of 1986's collapse of oil prices. In contrast to the government, the FIS is conducting a confident campaign, in which it has harnessed the resentment of many Algerians about their declining living standards and the corruption of the ruling party. In the first round of voting on December 26, the FIS polled 47 per cent of the popular vote, twice as much as the FLN. This stunning figure underlines the extent of the FLN's disarray and its incapacity, since the riots of October 1988 broke its monopoly of power in the streets, to reform itself. For ordinary Algerians the only visible consequences of moves to open up a command economy have been rocketing prices, growing unemployment and a ruling party whose leaders have indulged in public mud-slinging. The FLN and other lay opposition parties have proved no match for the formidable powers of mobilisation displayed by the FIS. Several factors will be at work over the next five days: the shock felt by the middle classes, which carries the risk of reaction particularly if the FIS forms the next government and implements a fundamentalist programme; the likelihood that the constitutional courts will cancel elections in more than 50 seats; the question of how the army will react as it struggles to defend both the Algerian constitution and the will of the people. The sense of shock is not confined to the elite. A programme of education and redistribution of some oil wealth have brought benefits to many Algerians, be they the professional middle classes or workers in industry and the civil service. For many of them, their faith is a private matter and they view the imposition of strict Islamic rule with alarm. They are also concerned at the manner in which voting has been conducted. Allegations of vote-rigging are widespread. More than 900,000 electoral cards went missing and 1m ballot papers were invalid because - in a country where 40 per cent are illiterate - the forms were too complicated for many to complete. The government had also drafted constituency boundaries in such a way that 3.2m votes gave the FIS 188 seats, while 1.6m votes gave the FLN a mere 15 in the first round. This appears to have been the result, as much as anything else, of a profound ignorance on the part of Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali and his minister of the interior, Mr Larbi Belkheir, of political and social realities. While the FLN's 30-year monopoly of power has not left it immune to allegations of similar practices, this time it made a fatal miscalculation. This helps to explain the 42 per cent abstention rate and thus the view of many educated, middle-class Algerians that the first round of voting did not faithfully represent the views of the country. The electoral process could be thrown further into confusion, forcing the government into some kind of third round, if the constitutional courts decide to cancel voting in more than 50 seats. The first two rounds would then have to be held again within the next three months. All this has contributed to the electoral weakness of those who oppose the idea of a theocratic state. The main bulwark of resistance to the FIS is the FLN. However, the Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS), which draws its support from the Berber heartland of Kabylia and certain areas in and around Algiers, could prove pivotal. They are the spearhead for a group of civil servants and professional technocrats who could choose to resist the implementation of FIS policies by paralysing the state. About 300,000 FFS supporters and other lay members of the opposition marched through Algiers a week ago, and they are active on Committees for the Safeguard of Algeria which have sprung around the country. The opposition groups, which exist in their scores, draw support from professional bodies of engineers, doctors and lawyers. They also come from the industrial working class, trades unions, private industry and women's groups. The events of the past two weeks have convinced the opposition that they might be forced to fight to preserve what they perceive as the achievements of the past 30 years - hospitals, factories, roads, schools and universities. They do not want the clock turned back. The model for their fears is Iran, where a revolution overwhelmed the middle classes and destroyed the army in 1979. But unlike Iran, the FIS victory so far has come through the ballot box, and those who oppose their views are themselves either former revolutionaries or the sons and daughters of people who fought against France in the war of independence. They cannot match the message offered by 8,000 of the country's 10,000 mosques which the FIS controls. That message is one that gives hope to the disenfranchised, who feel left behind by modernisation. The FIS argues that the restoration of Shari'a law (segregation in schools, not allowing most women to work, banning alcohol and harsh punishment for thieves and other criminals) is the answer to Algeria's problems. Restoring a strict sense of morality to public and private life is a pre-condition for economic development, the FIS says. One great unknown about the FIS is whether the views of its 'moderate' or its 'hard' wing will prevail if it takes the reins of government. The party's leaders make no secret of their attitudes. 'I respect neither the laws nor the parties which are not based on the Koran. I trample on them. Such parties must leave the country, they must be repressed,' said Mr Ali Benhadj, one of the party's paramount leaders who has been in prison since last June. 'Our fight is between Islamic purity and democratic impurity,' said Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the provisional spokesman for the party. Occasionally, a more pragmatic statement emerges, but the basic tenor of remarks by FIS leaders is uncompromising. Since FIS members won a majority on town councils in the municipal elections of June 1990, some cultural centres have been closed and women teachers and university lecturers abused. Will such behaviour characterise the FIS if it wins control of parliament, or will it choose a more cautious line of avoiding confrontation with the president, whose powers are considerable and who comes up for re-election next year? The FIS may well calculate it can win the presidency, the supreme political prize, if it avoids a fight with some sections of Algerian society. Whether this strategy is possible depends to some extent on the actions of the army, under the defence minister General Khaled Nezzar. There have been persistent military deployments of tanks and soldiers in the past week and senior officers make no secret of their distaste for fundamentalism. But where and when will that army choose to draw the red line? After today's verdict by the constitutional courts, on how many first-round ballots are annulled, it may call for the entire election to be called off. Or it may encourage the president to step down after the second round if it feels he is not defending the Algerian constitution. In the next few days, or weeks, the army might face an agonising choice. If clashes between Algerians who hold such antagonistic views of the country's future be degenerate into civil strife, it will have no choice but to act.</p>

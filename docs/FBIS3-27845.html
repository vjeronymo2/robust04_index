Presiding Judge Yoji Okahisa rejected the suit by ruling  that  "In Pakistan there is no objective reason to fear persecution,  so refugee status does not apply."    "The domestic situation is such that no criminal penalties  would be applied aside from using the name of Islam publicly,"  the court decided.    The six men and two women had filed suit against the justice  minister to be recognized as refugees by the Japanese  Government, saying they feared persecution for their religious  activities in Pakistan.    In 1984, the Pakistani Government pronounced a law that  prohibited the Ahmadi Sect from identifying itself with Islam  and including criminal penalties for religious activities.    The eight plaintiffs arrived in Japan in 1988 with the help  of the sect's Nagoya branch office. Claiming that they feared  being arrested if they returned to Pakistan, the eight applied  for refugee status with Nagoya immigration authorities,  receiving an extension to stay in Japan while waiting for a  decision. Immigration authorities decided, however, there was  no concrete evidence of persecution.    Meanwhile, the extensions to their visas expired while they  pleaded their case from 1990 to 1992 in a series of suits.</p>

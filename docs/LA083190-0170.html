			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'GHOST' SCARES UP THE MOST BOX-OFFICE BUSINESS  </P> <P> The curtain drops on the summer movie season this weekend with the spectral  romance of "Ghost" winning the most moviegoers' hearts, surpassing such  big-budget thrillers as "Total Recall" and "Die Hard 2."  </P> <P> Tom Cruise's "Days of Thunder" faded early. The much-hyped "Dick Tracy" failed  to fire up the box office for long.  </P> <P> Bruce Willis' "Die Hard 2" did well, but wasn't tops. And "RoboCop 2" quickly  ran out of power.  </P> <P> Not even the industry's most prescient prognosticators picked "Ghost" to scare  up the most business.  </P> <P> A modest supernatural thriller starring Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze and Whoopi  Goldberg, "Ghost" today should pass Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall" to  reach the box-office's top spot with more than $115 million at the gate,  Paramount Pictures says.  </P> <P> "It's so far away from what's out there this summer," "Ghost" producer Howard  W. Koch said. "The audience said, 'No more four-letter words. I don't want to  see anybody blown up.' It's about time people can be in love with one another  and not feel embarrassed."  </P> <P> Said Bruce Corwin, president of Southern California's Metropolitan movie  theater chain: "This summer had an abundance of action-oriented films and they  just fought each other. . . . 'Ghost' was huge, a pleasant surprise to  everyone."  </P> <P> In a season loaded with several overblown sequels and richly budgeted action  films, most performed only moderately well.  </P> <P> Paramount's "Days of Thunder," for instance, has made $79 million, just a few  million more than Cruise's 1988 "Cocktail." The studio's "Another 48 HRS.,"  with Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, grossed $78.7 million. Universal's "Back to  the Future Part III" made $83.6 million, compared to the $110 million collected  by "Back to the Future Part II."  </P> <P> As is certain in a season as crowded as this summer, there were a number of  bombs. They included Jack Nicholson's "The Two Jakes," the Middle East drama  "Navy SEALs," Bill Cosby in "Ghost Dad" and "Betsy's Wedding."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP SUMMER FILMS  </P> <P> According to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., this summer's Top 10 films were:  </P> <P> 1. Ghost  </P> <P> 2. Total Recall  </P> <P> 3. Die Hard 2  </P> <P> 4. Dick Tracy  </P> <P> 5. Back to the Future Part III  </P> <P> 6. Days of Thunder  </P> <P> 7. Another 48 HRS.  </P> <P> 8. Bird on a Wire  </P> <P> 9. Presumed Innocent  </P> <P> 10. Arachnophobia  </P></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine gives Budget pledge - Poll Tax Bills MR Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, insisted yesterday that the government would not 'fix' Budget proposals to delay the sending out of poll tax bills until after a general election. Any change to the poll tax would be made on its merits and not to hold up bills, he said on BBC radio. His remarks followed an attack by Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, that in choosing the timing of the election the Tories faced the 'ticking timebomb' of bills being sent out during the campaign, whether the election was on April 9 or May 7. The level of the poll tax was likely to be nearer Pounds 300 than the government's planned target of Pounds 257, Mr Gould said. The government has wide powers to 'cap' local authority spending but it has no powers to limit the increase to the local poll tax councils can make to take account of non-payment in their area. 'I certainly would not be part of a process which sought to gerrymander the arrangements for electoral advantage. What governments determine to do, they determine to do, but not for those sort of reasons,' Mr Heseltine said. Ministers have come under particular pressure to abolish the minimum 20 per cent payment that people on low incomes must make, both because of the collection costs and because the requirement would be abolished when the council tax is introduced to replace the community charge from next April. Mr Heseltine called on the Commons last night to overturn a government defeat in the Lords over subjecting local authorities to compulsory competitive tendering. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the next Labour government would reserve compulsory competitive tendering for circumstances in which a local authority could be shown, over a period of time, to have failed to reach acceptable standards. The Local Government Bill was given a second reading by 276 votes to 221, a government majority of 55.</p>

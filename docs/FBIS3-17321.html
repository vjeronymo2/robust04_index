Shortage  of money for the development of special technologies,  construction of various installations and other jobs, envisaged  by the complex programme, retards the implementation of the  already adopted decisions.    General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive  for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical  weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged  "incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being  reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment,"  Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for  several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult  job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every  opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements,"  Tarasevich noted.</p>

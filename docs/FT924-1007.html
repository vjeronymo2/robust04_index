			<p>921221 FT  21 DEC 92 / Brazil to push for growth THE Brazilian government has decided to give a return to growth priority over combating inflation, in a clear policy shift announced after a two-day ministerial meeting, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. The meeting, called to settle on an economic policy and end instability, ruled out the idea of an economic shock plan rumoured since last week's suspension of the privatisation programme and resignation of the economy minister. The ministers agreed a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) government works programme to stimulate production and employment, and a gradual lowering of interest rates. 'Under this government the population will not wake up one morning to find everything has been changed by some arbritary act,' stressed Mr Paulo Haddad, the planning minister who emerged strengthened from the meeting, having persuaded President Itamar Franco against a sharp cut in interest rates. He is also expected to take on the economy portfolio.</p>

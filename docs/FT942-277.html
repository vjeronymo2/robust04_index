			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Moulinex sets terms of capital increase Moulinex, the French household appliances group, yesterday announced the terms of its FFr1bn (Dollars 185m) capital increase, saying it would issue two new shares for three existing ones, at a price of FFr90 a share. Although long-expected, details of the capital increase pushed shares in the indebted company down FFr5.3 to FFr122. Under the terms of the capital increase, for which subscriptions will be open from July 5 to July 25, Financiere Moulinex DCSM, the holding company, and Finap, the group subsidiary, will subscribe to FFr404m of the capital increase. The balance will be offered to the public. The offer is being underwritten by a consortium of banks led by Credit Lyonnais. In a separate operation, the holding company will raise FFr500m, bringing in a number of financial partners chosen over the past few months to support the company's restructuring. Following the capital increase, Euris, a consortium of investors, will hold 33 per cent of the holding company. The holding company, combined with Finap, in turn will hold 28.8 per cent of Moulinex, with employees holding 10.8 per cent and the public just under 60 per cent. The complex capital restructuring follows a period of protracted negotiations aimed at reinforcing Moulinex's financial structure. The company has been hit by the European recession and by the burden of debts incurred as a result of its acquisition of Krups, a German competitor, in 1991. Moulinex suffered losses of FFr598m in the financial year to the end of March 1993, compared with net profits of FFr41m for the same period in the previous year. The French government said yesterday that it had appointed Credit Commercial de France and the French subsidiary of J. P. Morgan of the US as advisers for the privatisation of Assurances Generales de France. AGF, one of France's largest insurers, is next on the list of 21 publicly-owned groups slated for privatisation and the operation is expected to take place after the summer. But no date has been set for the sale and the timing will depend on market conditions. See World Stock Markets</p>

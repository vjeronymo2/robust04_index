			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Significant Changes Proposed by the Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following discussion reflects proposed significant changes to the existing regulations governing the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies. The changes are discussed in the order in which they appear in the proposed regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate cross-reference to its other appearances. The general format for the discussion of each section is to state the appropriate statutory provision for that section and to explain any provisions that interpret or clarify the statute that the Secretary believes are necessary to implement the statutory provision through regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing these proposed regulations, the Secretary has regulated as little as possible. He has regulated narrowly to the law, except where the Secretary deems further interpretation is necessary. In these cases, either the proposed regulations include the specific language agreed to by negotiators during negotiated rulemaking, if an agreement was reached, or the Secretary proposes language where agreement was not reached. In both cases, the Secretary solicits comments on the clarifications and interpretations included in the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A_General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.1&blank;Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations permit the Secretary to recognize any accrediting agency the Secretary determines to be a reliable authority as to the quality of postsecondary education or training provided by the institutions or programs it accredits. However, section 496(m) of the HEA now authorizes the Secretary to recognize only those agencies that accredit institutions of higher education or higher education programs for the purpose of enabling those institutions or programs to establish eligibility to participate in programs administered either by the Secretary or by other Federal agencies. In &sect;602.1 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary reiterates the statutory provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.2&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the definitions included in the proposed regulations are self-explanatory. Three, however, warrant additional comment based on the discussions that took place during the negotiated rulemaking sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Institution of higher education.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed regulations, the Secretary defines an institution of higher education to be an educational institution that qualifies or may qualify as an eligible institution under 34 CFR part 600, Institutional Eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Some of the non-Federal negotiators, however, pointed out that it is not clear that this definition includes certain types of hospitals and health care facilities. For this reason, the Secretary wishes to make clear that a hospital or health care facility may qualify as an eligible institution of higher education if the hospital or facility satisfies any definition of that term,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a ``public or nonprofit private institution of higher education,'' a ``proprietary institution of higher education,'' or a ``postsecondary vocational institution.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prebaccalaureate vocational education programs and vocational education programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;602.2, the Secretary proposes to define the term ``vocational education program'' based upon the statutory provision included in the definition of various types of eligible institutions of higher education. Thus, the Secretary defines a vocational education program as a program that ``prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.'' (See, for example, section 481(b)(1) of the HEA for a ``proprietary institution of higher education;'' section 481(c)(1) for a ``postsecondary vocational institution;'' and the second sentence of section 1201(a) of the HEA for a ``public and private nonprofit institution of higher education.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This definition, if read literally, could be viewed as including all postsecondary programs. To avoid this overreaching conclusion, the Secretary proposes that the vocational education programs that trigger actions under these regulations are prebaccalaureate vocational education programs. See, for example, &sect;602.24(c). This latter term is defined as a vocational education program that leads to a certificate, degree, or other education credential that is less than a bachelor's degree. The Secretary invites comment on these definitions, as well as alternative definitions, in light of the fact that the non-Federal negotiators could not agree among themselves as to the acceptability of these definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

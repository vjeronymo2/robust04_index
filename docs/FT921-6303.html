			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: A couple of lustrous potters Sutton Taylor makes lustred pots of unforgettable beauty. For years now I have only seen single examples of his pots and looked forward to a major show. The Oxford Gallery has now mounted a large exhibition of more than 30 recently-made pots by Taylor (until March 18: 0865-242731). A self-taught potter, Taylor was born in Yorkshire where he still works. He first became attracted to working in clay while teaching art in Jamaica. Once back in Yorkshire, he experimented with lustreware, digging the local red clay and making his own materials. Now in his forties, Taylor has a keen following and has seen his pots bought for public collections around the world. Lustreware is a famously capricious technique. It involves firing pots three times, the last time creating a thick, sooty atmosphere in the kiln so that the glazes and lustre melt and fuse. If the heat is too intense, instead of settling into the surface of the vessel the metal salts vaporise and disappear. No two pots are ever the same, and botches are horribly frequent. Alan Caiger-Smith, whose work is on permanent show at the Aldermaston Pottery (0734-713579), is the name which first comes to mind in connection with lustred ceramics. Another marvellous potter, it was Caiger-Smith's determination to ignore what was fashionable that eventually made lustreware respectable again among the cognoscenti after many decades of being regarded as 'common' - on a par with liking coloured wineglasses. A Taylor pot could never be confused with a Caiger-Smith, although both potters throw vessels of classically elegant shapes. However, Caiger-Smith's pots are always imbued with his sense of the past, in particular his scholarly appreciation of Islamic and Hispano-Moorish traditions of pottery. He paints pots with the linear flourishes of a calligrapher. Taylor, on the other hand, is like an abstract painter. Often the design covers the whole surface. The palette is subtle and rich, gleaming with the metallic resonance which comes from glazes made from compounds of gold, silver, platinum, tantalum and copper. Stray patches of dull gold glint here and there, and as you tilt a bowl to marvel at its uncanny lightness, it shimmers. On the inside of one big bowl the colour shifts from deep rose to bright blue, an effect caused by copper reoxidising at a different rate over the curved surface. Yet even Taylor's brightest pieces are carefully controlled, never garish. Taylor is a constant experimenter. In this exhibition for the first time he shows porcelain bowls. These, to my eye, are indistinguishable in appearance from the earthenware. However, in technological terms this is an important achievement. It had been considered impossible to lustre porcelain because the glaze requires a higher firing-point than pottery. Lustre, which can only be fired to 750 degrees, was therefore applied to porcelain pieces as a surface enamel. Taylor has managed to reduce the melting-point of glaze on porcelain. However, as one might expect of a canny Yorkshireman, he is not prepared to reveal the secret of how he does it. The small porcelain bowls are red-purple, a favourite shade, with bands of silver on the feet. Among the more exuberant designs I was much taken by a little conical bowl blazing like a sunset with indigo and salmon, and by a delightful bottle, neat as a bullfinch in crimson, black and grey. Sometimes Taylor is clearly inspired by gardens: two plates almost seem to sway with shadowy leaves and grasses, muted in sage-green, greys, blue and lilac.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Tax reform hits shipping sector A PLANNED overhaul of Norway's 80-year-old tax system by the minority Labour Government has disappointed the stock market, and especially the shipping sector. Last week, when the scheme was leaked and then announced, Oslo's all-share index fell by 2.6 per cent to 480.72 and its shipping index by 6.3 per cent. Yesterday, the all-share fell another 2.99 points to 477.73, and shipping by 7.98 to 578.31. In a move to streamline the fiscal system the government proposes to lower the rate of corporate tax from 50.8 per cent to 28 per cent, the lowest of any OECD country. But allowances, which led to an average corporate tax rate of only 20 per cent, will be severely reduced. Shipping companies are likely to suffer most if the proposal is passed by the Storting, Norway's parliament, since the depreciation rate for their assets will be cut from 25 per cent to 14 per cent, against the 20 per cent expected. This will make it unattractive to renew the ageing fleet of the world's third-biggest shipping register. Norway's shippers have a total of 160 ships on order, roughly 15 per cent of the world total, and may threaten to take flight to more accommodating countries like Liberia. According to James Capel, the UK stockbrokers, the change implies a tenfold increase in taxes paid by shippers. Bergesen, Norway's biggest shipowner, is an example: its tax bill for 1990 was NKr15m against an estimated NKr250m under the proposed new system. On a more positive note, the reform also calls for the abolition of double taxation of dividends. This could allow companies to pay out more, but Capel's 1991 yield estimate for the market is only 1.3 per cent. The government also proposes to allow large tax-free gains, accumulated in limited shipping partnerships under the existing system, to be converted into onshore equity investments. They will be allowed to be invested part of these profits in shares of on-shore companies and part of them in non-listed venture companies which invest in on-shore commercial activity. The reform is scheduled to be implemented in 1992. It includes a cut in tax on capital investment from 7 to 5 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Warning: When this restraint is used in a rear-facing mode, do not place in the front seat of a vehicle that has a passenger side air bag. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> and, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Warning: Do not use this infant restraint in the front seat of a vehicle that has a passenger side air bag. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the goal of having the warning be conspicuous, NHTSA proposed that the message be on a yellow background, and be visible when the restraint is installed rear-facing in the vehicle. The agency requested comments on whether the message should be required to be visible to a person in the driver's seat when the restraint is so installed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency received 16 comments on the NPRM. Commenters included child seat manufacturers (Century, Fisher Price, Cosco), vehicle manufacturers (Volkswagen, Ford), state safety agencies (Michigan, New York), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the American Academy of Pediatrics, consumer groups (SafetyBeltSafe, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety), business groups (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, National Automobile Dealers Association), and private individuals. All the commenters generally supported the NPRM; several had suggested changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the comments related to issues about the wording of the label. Comments were also received on the label's conspicuity, and on the proposal that child seat manufacturers provide information about air bags in the consumer instructions accompanying each restraint. In addition, some commenters were concerned about the possible effect of the labeling and informational requirements on the possible development of infant restraints that can be safely used in an air bag-equipped vehicle seating position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Wording of the Label <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters addressed various issues about the wording of the warning label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One issue is whether specific wording should be mandated. The proposed regulatory text contained the exact wording of the label. Like the other safety warnings required by Standard 213, the air bag/infant restraint warning would have to be printed word for word as set forth in the standard. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) believed the exact wording should be specified. ``It would not be appropriate to leave the wording of a safety warning label, which must be concise, clear, accurate, and uniform, to manufacturer discretion.'' Commenters such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Jerome Koziatek and Robert Potter, Jr. conferred that the wording should be mandated, and suggested changes to the wording to improve it. Ford opposed mandating the wording, believing that the prescribed wording may limit the flexibility of manufacturers, especially if it became possible for a child seat manufacturer to recommend use of an infant restraint in an air bag-equipped seating position under certain circumstances. (This issue of the future development of infant restraints is further discussed below.) Ford stated that the wording currently specified in Standard 213 ``can be altered as needed.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific wording of the safety warnings currently required by Standard 213 to be marked on a child seat is mandated. Notwithstanding Ford, all other commenters appeared to understand that the wording of the air bag warning must appear on the restraint as stated in the standard. It is for that reason that comments were requested and submitted on the efficacy and appropriateness of the wording. NHTSA has decided to mandate the wording of the new air bag warning for the reasons explained in the NPRM. Those reasons are consistent with Advocates' view, quoted above, that the wording must be carefully crafted so as to reduce as much as possible the possibility that the warning is misunderstood. As explained in the NPRM: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he message should be brief, alerting consumers to and reminding them about a safety concern without causing ``information overload.'' The message also should not inadvertently induce the consumer to misuse a restraint, such as might happen if the message were so loosely worded that consumers might conclude they could avoid the problem by simply turning the restraint around so that the child is forward-facing when the restraint is used in an air bag equipped seating position. The message also should be conspicuous. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR at 19793. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To further clarify Standard 213's labeling requirements for Ford, NHTSA notes that the safety warnings required by the standard may not be ``altered as needed'' by a manufacturer. If a manufacturer believes the wording should be altered, it must submit a petition for rulemaking to change the requirements in Standard 213. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

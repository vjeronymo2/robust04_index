			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS ON A BEACH BLANKET: WESTERNERS PREFER A LITTLE DISTANCE;  </P> <P> CUSTOMS: CALIFORNIANS FLEE CITIES TO FIND PRIVACY OUTDOORS; EASTERNERS GO ON  VACATION TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER, WHICH THEY DON'T OFTEN DO IN CITIES.  </P> <P> Porpoises ply the waters off both the New Jersey shore and California coast,  but the similarities between the populations inhabiting the two seashores end  there. Even beachgoers differ in the way they lay their blankets down.  Westerners prefer to sit apart. Easterners tend to self-congest, on narrow  strands of sand where all the action is. Perfectly ordinary habits carry  implications, conveying in this instance why cities differ from coast to coast.  Big cities like those of the East have little place in the growing West.  </P> <P> The first boardwalk in the United States was constructed in Cape May, N.J., to  facilitate masses of beachgoers lying cheek to cheek, their umbrellas -- rented  from nearby kiosks -- bumping up against each other. It remains that way today.  Beach tags are required within the city limits, at 10 bucks a season -- cheap  compared with ski lifts, I suppose. The tag inspector walks the sand, checking  out swimsuits, to ensure tags are all displayed under penalty of law. It's a  cushy job, to say the least.  </P> <P> Just a few miles away at Poverty Beach or at the lighthouse to the south,  beaches are sparsely populated. Instead, the loons and herons gather in nearby  marshes, unobserved except for birders. There's no place to promenade or  interrupt a tanning session with arcades, crab cakes and fries.  </P> <P> There's a certain love of tackiness about the Jersey shore. People like to  cluster, buy gaudy trinkets and digest fried fat. They like to promenade and  eat. It's not just Jersey, though. It's that way up and down the eastern  seaboard. It's also true in Europe, where kilometers of deserted beaches are  punctuated by mobs of huddled masses.  </P> <P> I prefer the interstices between resorts, avoiding boardwalks and the crowds. A  California favorite of mine is Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, just north of  Big Sur State Park. At the end of an obscure road dotted with turnouts and  potholes lies one of the world's most spectacular beaches, with waves crashing  through windows in the rocks, seals, gulls and sand dunes. People visit there  in families or with friends -- or even by themselves -- tranquilized by nature  rather than kiosks and arcades.  </P> <P> At the northern end of Pfeiffer Beach, farthest from the road, some sunbathe in  the nude. And lovers occasionally seek out its isolation. Those who engage in  sandy acts of intimacy are not always exhibitionists. They simply look at  nature as a place for privacy. Those who find their privacy behind apartment  doors in eastern cities crowd together on sidewalks, city squares and  boardwalks. Californians take their cities very differently, as public places  to retreat from, finding privacy in the Great Outdoors. Easterners, on the  other hand, gather on vacation to talk with one another the way they would not  often do in the cities where they live.  </P> <P> It isn't really that surprising that people on vacation take a vacation from  themselves -- Westerners withdraw and Easterners engage. But there's more to  this than that. As the population shifts from east to west, city life is  changing too. That change is worth considering as the model American  megalopolis becomes Los Angeles, rather than New York.  </P> <P> Eastern urban anonymity was built against a background of community. As the  communities began to fray, anonymity took over, but the premise still remains  that everyone is part of things. The homeless and the rich are both New  Yorkers. With lessened stress from being on vacation, eastern urban dwellers  return to their native state again, feeling openly comfortable in crowds. So,  they congregate in bunches on beaches or promenade on the boardwalk. The same  thing can be seen in cafes of Paris or piazzas of Italy. This is the way most  European cities and those modeled after them work. All such city dwellers see  themselves as members of a club, whether it be in Boston, Mexico City or  Madrid.  </P> <P> Things are different in Southern California, where the big-city concept does  not hold. Orange County, for example, has no central city. Los Angeles is, at  best, a holding company for several different towns, from Westwood to Highland  Park. The Los Angeles City Council is not the council of a city but only a  committee representing different interest groups, a smaller version of Los  Angeles County's Board of Supervisors. City Hall is more a landmark than a seat  of political power.  </P> <P> As Angelenos and Orange County residents lay their blankets down, their  tendency to lie apart is symptomatic of an inner distance they've achieved.  There is no common city they're a member of. Only on the outskirts of Los  Angeles do real towns remain, like Santa Barbara and Riverside.  </P> <P> It is one thing to be a part of a larger whole that is fragmenting, such as the  fate faced by New Yorkers or suburbanites commuting to a dying urban center. It  is quite another to distance yourself from city identity altogether, not to be  a member of the city where you live. It is this second model that's currently  evolving in Southern California, counties without centers, cities without  hearts. Instead of a European model for city life and city ways, in Southern  California we have created a rather different scene, of neighborhoods and  counties, without big cities in between.  </P> <P> This is an important difference between Southern California and the rest of the  urban world. Once beach-blanket implications sink into consciousness, new  opportunities can be seized for solving urban problems. Big city government can  be de-emphasized in favor of neighborhood councils and regional and county  legislation.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and Orange counties are closer to each other philosophically than  either would dare admit. This offers a solution for our future in Southern  California and other places, too. By abandoning the illusion that we live in  one big city, we might be able to get things done which can't be done back  East, as we retain a sense of local neighborhood while living regionally.  </P></p>

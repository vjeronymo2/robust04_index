			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Peres wins closer Israel-EC trade ties MR Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, yesterday won EC support for closer economic ties with the Community and an updating of the 1975 bilateral trade agreement. After talks with European Commission President Jacques Delors in Brussels, Mr Peres expressed hope for a fresh start in relations between Europe and the Middle East, with the possible formation of a Middle Eastern common market along EC lines. He said: 'We would like to structure the region in a way that the motive for war disappears, we would like to copy the structure of the EC.' He repeated his call for a summit with Syria to push forward negotiations on the Golan Heights, but he said the prospects were not promising.</p>

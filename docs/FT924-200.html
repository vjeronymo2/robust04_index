			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Yeltsin faces powerful opposition to treaty at home THE greatest problem for Russia will not be for President Boris Yeltsin to come to an agreement with President George Bush but to push the deal through possible domestic opposition and then to implement it. Despite recently being accused by one opposition leader of falling into the 'Gorbachev habit' of relying on foreign successes to boost his domestic popularity, President Yeltsin can still count on a measure of public support for signing a treaty which will abolish the world's most threatening class of nuclear weapons. Mr Andrei Kortunov, a defence analyst at the United States and Canada Institute, said however that Start 2 faced a difficult passage through the Russian parliament, whose powerful chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, had already voiced reservations about the treaty. Mr Kortunov also foresaw objections within Russia's still mighty defence industry circles, including highly-placed supporters such as Mr Yuri Skokov, who now heads a special presidential body on Russia's foreign relations. 'It will be a question of bargain-ing - what will they get in exchange (for endorsing the treaty),' he said. 'They will probably want major investment (by the Russian government) in the modernisation of the remaining strategic arsenal.' It was also no surprise that the schedule for implementing the Start 2 treaty is to be tied to the availability of foreign assistance for implementing it. The silos containing the land-based missiles with multiple warheads are concentrated mainly in Siberia and just west of the Ural mountains, as well as near Russia's border with Ukraine. A foreign ministry official said the main bottleneck in dismantling nuclear missiles under agreements reached so far was the storage of nuclear materials extracted from the warheads. He said US and Russian representatives negotiating the use of Dollars 400m (Pounds 267m) credit approved by the US Congress had agreed on the design of a special storage facility to be built in Russia, but now had to agree on the details, including the location. 'We will have to convince a local community to accept such a facility. The population is (environmentally) active nowadays - everybody says 'not in my backyard'.' He also said that talks would have to start with the Ukraine to iron out Ukrainian complaints in implementing its obligations under the Start 1 treaty. Only yesterday a senior Ukrainian official told reporters that his republic needed ten times the amount promised by the US to help it get rid of its long-range missiles - and said that Russia should pitch in too.</p>

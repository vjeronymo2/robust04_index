			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television Before we built a pond in our London garden we had no idea what fun it was to keep frogs. Did you know that frogs from the same batch of spawn can range from yellow through every shade of green and khaki to black? Turn on the sprinkler at the opposite end of the garden and you get a miniature Derby as the frogs leap off in the direction of the water. (How do they know it is there?) According to Wild Britain (8.30 C4) a garden pond is the best hope for amphibians in this country these days since it is unlikely to have been contaminated by agricultural chemicals. To Catch A Killer is a two-part account beginning today (10.00 BBC1) of the pursuit of John Wayne Gacy by Detective Joe Kozenczak. Gacy was known for his charity work and had been named Businessman Of The Year, but he also murdered 33 young men. That is followed by a pilot programme for a new series showcasing comedians so far unknown to television, The Stand Up Show (11.30). The Commonwealth Games begin today in Victoria, Canada. At 8.00 BBC1 offers a preview in Grandstand, and at midnight the opening ceremony live.</p>

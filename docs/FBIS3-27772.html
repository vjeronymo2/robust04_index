The analyst says:    "Radio Free Asia" is a variant of the notorious "Radio Free  Europe."    Through "Radio Free Asia," the United States intends to  foster illusion about the West among the Asian people,  contaminate their spirit and morality, plunge the society into  confusion and disorder and thus stifle the socialist nations in  this region as it did in Europe.    The U.S. ruling quarters want to have such an effect of  "Radio Free Europe" in the Asian socialist countries including  the DPRK and some other countries. Their attempt, however,  stands little chance of success.    The decision of U.S. congress to fix a wave for the DPRK is  an intolerable challenge to the high dignity and sovereignty of  the DPRK. The United States, which has rendered the situation  of the Korean peninsula strained with a hue and cry over  "suspected nuclear development by North Korea," is now  attempting to stifle the DPRK under the slogans "freedom,"  "democracy" and "human rights." This is nothing but a desperate  bid of those scared by the might of Korean- style socialism.    It goes without saying that any false propaganda will have  no  effect in face of the iron will and faith of the Korean people  who are determined to win the righteous fight against the enemy  with the might of singlehearted unity, fully armed with the  chuche idea, and nobody will lend an ear to the bourgeois  propaganda.</p>

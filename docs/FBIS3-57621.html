The Patriot missile was used in the Persian Gulf  war and performed well. Station commentator Yuriy Solton writes  on this:    The Pentagon discussed this matter at the request of the  commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea, though President  Clinton has not approved it yet. Quoting U.S. CIA materials, the  Pentagon is planning to deploy Patriot missiles--which is an  antimissile system--in South Korea because Pyonayang is capable  of attacking U.S. military facilities with [word indistinct]  missiles.    It is difficult to believe that such an attack is possible.  First of all, recently the U.S. CIA said that a North Korean  military aggression is almost impossible. Also, according to a  report by an independent U.S. [word indistinct], the Nodong-1  missile, which is modeled after a Scud-type missile, does not  pose a big threat.    Considering these factors, it can be estimated that the plan  to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea is made to apply  pressure on Pyongyang. It is also estimated that through such a  pressure the United States attempts to lead North Korea to allow  international inspections of its nuclear facilities which have  been under the suspicion of developing nuclear weapons.    Pyongyang should have cleared such suspicion by returning to  the Nonproliferation Treaty. However, the deployment of U.S.  Patriot missiles in South Korea will not be conducive to solving  the nuclear issue. Rather, it will lead Pyongyang to take  countermeasures, thereby further aggravating the situation of  the Korean penisula.</p>

Of the group's Pounds 4.6m annual revenues, exports account for more than 90 per cent. The group's systems are used in Africa, South America and the Middle East, as well as Europe and Antarctica, while its consumer products are sold in most of the developed markets of the world, including Japan and the US. Intersolar is an independent group: 50 per cent of its equity is owned by Mr Philip Wolfe, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Philip Bouverat, commercial director, who says he has been round the world eight times in the past three years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Subchev commentary: "Calculated Chaos"] </F>   [Text] The people of Stara Zagora woke up to find the town  besmirched with fascist symbols and calls to settle accounts  with ethnic minorities. These slogans are nothing new, but  today they arouse particular alarm.    All the actions of the executive and legislative authorities  make increasing numbers of people doubt whether the present  political system is capable of dealing with the lawlessness,  inflation, and unemployment.    Politicians and journalists have described this social chaos  as "the Weimar syndrome."    The comparison with Germany in the 1920's is reinforced by  the appearance of would-be fuhrers, each with his own program  for solving every problem.    At the moment the greatest dreamer with hopes of becoming  the  savior of the nation is Father Gelemenov. The mass media have  contributed to his popularity to no small extent, and this  arouses certain suspicions.    With all his eccentricities, the good father is unable to  gather enough supporters and funds to fulfill his threats.  However, his statements, widely publicized in the newspapers,  create a mood in society that may bring it to accept a really  "strong hand," not only without resistance, but even with  feelings of relief. There are enough examples of this in  Bulgarian and world history.    Accordingly, in this case the militant priest is playing the  role of a John the Baptist, who clears the way for the person  who is to come and "baptize" the nation, and to baptize it "not  only with the Holy Spirit, but also with fire," as the Gospels  state.    As everyone knows, a flame does not only burn tinder, but  consumes everything else as well.</p>

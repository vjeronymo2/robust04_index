			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Tax advisers urged to take tougher line with clients TAX ADVISERS should refuse to submit tax returns on behalf of clients who cannot explain why information has been withheld, and should consider ceasing to do any work for them, two professional bodies recommended yesterday. Advisers are also urged to highlight any items in a client's returns to the Inland Revenue where they have doubts about the tax treatment. The advice comes in guidelines published by the Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The guidance comes after four years of discussion with the Revenue and are based on the experiences of the institutes' members. Mr Philip Hardman of Grant Thornton, one of the accountants involved in drawing up the guidelines, said: 'If you are in any doubt about the tax treatment you should give the Revenue full information and not mislead them. The best advice is to give them full information and not to bury an item.' The guidelines will become particularly appropriate next year when the Revenue introduces a 'pay and file' corporate tax system similar to that used in the US. There the onus is on companies to declare all tax for which they believe they are liable. The institutes have sought legal counsel suggesting that when this level of disclosure takes place and the tax returns are approved by the Revenue, the case cannot be re-opened at a later date. The Revenue argues that it retains this right in certain instances. The guidelines say there is no legal obligation to disclose information, but advisers should use their professional judgment where there is doubt. They add that normal client confidentiality may be overruled where there is a public duty to disclose information. Ethical Rules and Practice Guidelines.

SIX Labour MPs headed by Mr Austin Mitchell, member for Great Grimsby, are demanding independent regulation of the auditing industry, David Owen writes. They cite the sector's lack of confidence 'in the light of the rising tide of financial scandals'. Their early-day motion deplores 'the fact that where auditors should act to protect and warn the public and shareholders, too many have been drawn into a collusive relationship with directors by their desire to sell non-auditing services to firms'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Qatar  early today. Robaina and his delegation had previously  participated in the ministerial summit of the Nonaligned  Movement.    Robaina was greeted by Qatari Minister [passage indistinct]  and Cuban Ambassador Orlando Requena. Robaina told local  reporters that the Cuban Government is interested in developing  ties with Qatar and other Gulf states and that to this end,  diplomatic ties were recently established with Oman and that  there is the political will to do likewise with the rest of the  countries in the region. Robaina added that another goal of the  trip is to study ways to develop bilateral trade in connection  with the results of the trip to Cuba by Qatari businessmen.    In 48 hours, Robaina will fulfill a busy agenda including  meetings with Qatar's head of state, Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al  Thani, and the ministers of foreign affairs, health, and economy  and finance. Robaina will also tour the Umm Sa'id industrial  complex and the petrochemical and steel plants. This occasion  will also serve to officially inaugurate the Cuban Embassy.    Three months ago, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim  Bin-Jabur Al Thani visited Cuba and since then, Qatari  delegations have gone Cuba to inquire about cooperation in  sports, health, and tourism.</p>

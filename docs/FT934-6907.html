			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Teachers scorn workload change The workload for teachers in testing seven-year-olds for the national curriculum in England and Wales has been halved by the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority in a further attempt to persuade unions to abandon their boycott of the tests. But the announcement met scepticism from the unions. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the biggest teaching union, said: 'Our members are used to inaccurate estimates of the time needed to carry out tests being made by government bodies.' NUT members voted overwhelmingly last week to continue boycotting the tests despite concessions already announced by the authority. The other two main teachers' unions, the ATL and the NASUWT, both plan to continue the boycott, which last year forced the government to abandon plans to publish league tables for performance by schools based on the tests. Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the authority, said: 'We want to work with teachers in improving the tests yet further. We have focused on those skills that really need testing. If children don't master these skills then all their future development is built on sand.' He said the tests, which cover English (or Welsh) and mathematics had been simplified administratively, but would in no way be simpler for pupils to answer. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, said the changes were 'a sensible simplification' but added: 'Every parent knows that children progress at different paces. What we have to be careful about is that the tests do not become an annual academic sheepdog trial.' Mr McAvoy claimed that shortening the tests did not necessarily improve their educational soundness.</p>

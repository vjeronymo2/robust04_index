			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: GM to restrict price increases GENERAL Motors yesterday unveiled plans to hold back US vehicle price increases in the 1994 model year to win back market share. The company, in the throes of a restructuring to return loss-making North American operations to profit, said in the 1994 model year, starting in October, it would expand the 'value pricing' marketing idea it initiated on some models in 1993. This involved dropping the price of certain models of vehicles, equipped with popular levels of optional equipment. The idea is to lift sales and run GM's factories closer to capacity, to raise profits. Mr Michael Losh, a GM vice-president, said a value pricing strategy had been a factor behind the resurgence of GM's North American sales this year. The company's share of the US passenger car market fell sharply late last calendar year, to less than 31 per cent, when it cut back sharply on unprofitable sales to fleet buyers. However, it has recovered this year and in June totalled 37.1 per cent, compared with 36.7 per cent a year earlier. However, in the first half of 1993 its car market share was down a point on 1992, at 35.3 per cent. The recovery has been due partly to value pricing and because Japanese competitors, hurt by a strong yen, have been increasing their prices faster than American rivals. Mr Losh said that in the 1994 model year, GM's prices would rise by 1.5 per cent, even though they were fitted with additional equipment. Truck prices would rise by 2.2 per cent and the average price for GM vehicles would go up about 1.8 per cent - about half the rate of inflation. However, the proposed price changes do not include the impact of rebates to consumers given by US car companies to increase sales. Mr Losh said he expected 1994 rebates to be below those of 1993, but the company would alter policy in response to competitors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court acknowledged a petition from the  German courts requesting a series of judicial actions regarding  the arrest and disappearance of three Chilean citizens by German  citizens residing in the Dignidad Colony [in Chile].    The court acknowledged the petition filed by Bonn's attorney  general within the framework of legal proceedings against  Dignidad Colony leader (Paul Schaeffer), suspected of being  responsible for several murders.    Investigations in Germany refer to the murder of Alvaro  Vallejos Villagran, aka Loro Matias; Alfonso Chanffreau; and  Ezequiel Poncio Vicencio.    This information was disclosed by attorney Sergio Corvalan,  who represents the Bonn court in Chile:    [Begin Corvalan recording] Basically, the petition requests  the questioning of witnesses, one of them a German citizen who  is not a member of the Dignidad Colony and the shipment of  attested copies of legal documents, as well as information from  the Rettig Commission archives so it can be officially included  in the case being handled by the German court. [end recording]    Corvalan noted the significance of the Supreme Court's  decision to acknowledge the petition because this is the first  time the Chilean court has not objected to the German court's  desire to investigate possible crimes committed by German  citizens in Chile.    Corvalan added that he will request that (Paul Schaeffer)  appear before the Bulnes Court once again within the framework  of another lawsuit, a civilian one in this case, filed by the  Dignidad Colony against one of its former leaders, (Hugo Bar).    Corvalan explained that (Schaeffer) appeared before the  Bulnes Court on 31 March, but that he had been summoned for  today, which represents an irregularity that annuls the  proceeding.</p>

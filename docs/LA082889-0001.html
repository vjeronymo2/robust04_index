			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Jonas Savimbi, leader of Angola's UNITA rebels, met with South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk to discuss a faltering peace accord with the  Luanda government. In a rare public appearance after the meeting, Savimbi told  a news conference in Pretoria: "I hope peace will get back on the rails." But  Savimbi, who has fought Angola's Marxist government for 14 years, sharply  attacked Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, accusing him of deliberately  misrepresenting a peace pact signed in Gbadolite, Zaire. Each side in the  Angolan conflict has accused the other of violating the cease-fire agreed upon  in the June 22 accord.  </P></p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Heath pours scorn on subsidiarity debate EUROPEAN COMMUNITY leaders should be planning a way out of recession rather than discussing the minute detail of EC decision-making, Mr Edward Heath, former Conservative prime minister, said yesterday. 'For the top brass to spend a day arguing about the minutiae of subsidiarity during an international economic crisis of this severity is ludicrous. We joined the Community to do as much as possible together. Never was it more needed than today,' Mr Heath said. He was speaking at the 20th anniversary gathering in London of the Franco-British Council. Mr Heath said the lesson of the ERM crisis was the need for a single currency. 'If we are not to have our currencies picked off one by one by speculators we must have the strength of one single currency to resist and destroy them,' he said.</p>

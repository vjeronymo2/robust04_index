			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - Why the banks ran out of patience A BOMB WENT off in the heart of London's Docklands when the companies that own Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest new office development, went into administration under UK insolvency procedures. Creditors and tenants were yesterday trying to predict the damage from the initial impact and its aftershock. Bank creditors face losses of Pounds 600m on that project alone. But if the prices of adjacent properties fall sharply, the financial carnage may be much worse. The project's 11 leading bank creditors make no attempt to absolve themselves from responsibility for causing the explosion. At mid afternoon on Wednesday, in the offices of Allen &amp; Overy in the City of London's Cheapside, they decided they would no longer finance the project as a going concern. In the circumstances, there were only three alternatives: liquidation, receivership or administration. They opted for the route that gives Canary Wharf a vestigial chance of being 'brought back to life', in the words of Mr Michael Dennis, a director of O&amp;Y Developments, owner of the Canary Wharf companies. However, some of Canary Wharf's bankers believe the UK government is partly to blame. 'The government's silence cratered the project', one of the lenders to Canary Wharf said yesterday. What that banker meant was that the banks wanted the government to make a public commitment to take space for civil servants at Canary Wharf. The Department of the Environment, the Department of Transport and the Department of Trade and Industry have all been in talks about renting hundreds of thousands of square feet. The environment department in particular is at an advanced stage of negotiations on taking 400,000 sq ft for 2,000 civil servants. The banks believed a government commitment of this sort would have been a sign to other prospective tenants of the government's commitment to press ahead with the redevelopment of Docklands and it would have lifted the overall occupancy rate at Canary Wharf from 60 per cent to 70 per cent - close to the level at which it would be possible to find new outside sources of finance for individual buildings. Yet although the government is keen that the regeneration of Docklands should succeed, it is anxious not to appear to be giving subsidies to a private-sector project. So over the past week, the banks and the government began a game of cat and mouse, with Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, trying to translate the meows and squeaks into a common language. The prime minister, Mr John Major, appointed Mr John Wakeham, the lord privy seal, to co-ordinate all government negotiations with Canary Wharf. Last week, Lord Wakeham told Mr Kent that the government was thinking very hard about moving to Docklands. Mr Kent duly relayed that to the 11 banks: Barclays and Lloyds from the UK; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada; Commerzbank from Germany; Credit Lyonnais of France; Credit Suisse of Switzerland; Kansallis-Osake Pankki of Finland; and, from the US, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover. But the government's good intentions were not good enough for the banks. Although they understood that the government would need time before it could sign heads of agreement to take the space, they still wanted the government to make a public statement that it intended to go to Canary Wharf. Two days ago, Mr Kent then delivered that message to Lord Wakeham. The government felt it could not comply. It sent another coded message that it would take space - but it could not give a firm commitment to do so unless the banks had first agreed to provide sufficient funds to keep Canary Wharf going. The government could not understand why the banks should insist on embarrassing it by forcing it to make a public statement before the banks provided the requisite funds. Anyway, some ministers did not believe the banks would pull the plug - surely the banks had too much to lose. Lord Wakeham was to see the banks on Wednesday to explain in person. Shortly after 2pm on that day, though, it became clear to the banks at their meeting that there was no possibility of their reaching a unanimous agreement on providing the Pounds 500m of new banking facilities that Canary Wharf needed. Unanimity was a condition of the rescue plan going ahead and only four banks - Credit Suisse, Citibank, KOP and Credit Lyonnais - were strongly in favour of providing the new money. In the event, Lord Wakeham was told not to bother to come to the bankers' meeting. Instead, he alerted Mr Major to the imminent explosion.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Hospitals study is launched LONDON UNIVERSITY is to commission an urgent independent financial study into the costs of proposals to rationalise the capital's hospitals. The university, responsible for the training of many of Britain's medical students, says it takes a positive view of aspects of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report on London healthcare but is 'deeply concerned' at the lack of adequate financial analysis. The university's joint planning committee says its report will be completed before ministers reach conclusions on Tomlinson. The study will include an assessment of the extent to which the exercise could be financed by proceeds from the sale of hospital sites.</p>

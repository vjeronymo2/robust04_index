			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Exco chief executive to leave after rift Exco, the money broker which came to market only 11 weeks ago, yesterday become the latest debutant to produce an unpleasant surprise, announcing that it was parting with its chief executive. Its shares fell 15p, or 8 per cent, to close at 179p, slightly above the flotation price of 175p. Mr Ron Sandler, 42, will resign at the end of the year. Exco said yesterday: 'Since the flotation, differences in management style have developed which the board felt could become damaging to the business. A recent flotation should not stop a board from making a hard decision.' Mr Sandler, who joined Exco in April 1993, was on a 12-month contract and will leave with a year's salary of Pounds 297,000. However, his 480,000 share options, worth potentially Pounds 500,000, and at the discretion of the board, are not being granted. He joined Exco from a management consultancy. His role was to guide the money broker, in which institutional investors had taken a majority stake the previous year from the administrators of the failed financial services group British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, to the market. The share issue was 3.2 times oversubscribed, valuing Exco at Pounds 220m. The shares went to 14 per cent premium on the first day's trading, and reached a high of 211p on August 15. Neither Mr Sandler nor any other member of the Exco board was available for comment. A trader at Exco said that Mr Sandler's style 'was not suited to people management and this is a people business'. Another company source said: 'He was not part of the club; his broking experience was limited.' Mr Sandler previously held the post of chief executive of Bierbaum Group, a money broking operation bought by Trio Investments at the end of 1992. Mr Peter Edge, 36, director of global money markets, who has worked for Exco since 1980, will take over from him. Exco repeated yesterday that trading in the third quarter had been 'subdued'. The chairman's statement added that: 'With the caveat that trading volumes are difficult to predict, I believe that Exco's performance for the year as a whole will be satisfactory.' Kleinwort Benson, Exco's broker, downgraded its profits forecast for the current year by Pounds 2m to Pounds 45m and by the same amount to Pounds 50m for 1995.</p>

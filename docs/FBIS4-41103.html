			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Taxes: Game of Hide and Seek"] </F>   [Text] There has been a tax collection shortfall of around  10 percent this year. The lower chamber of parliament was  informed of this by Vladimir Gusev, leader of the State Taxation  Service. The basic reason for this, according to him, is the  nonpayments crisis and numerous cases of tax evasion.    Briefing deputies on progress in fulfilling the Russian  President's Edict "On the Implementation of a Tax Amnesty in  1993," Vladimir Gusev noted that nonpayment of taxes has  essentially become widespread. He cited the following figures:  Since the presidential edict came into force 44,000 corporate  bodies and 2,000 individuals guilty of ignoring tax legislation  have been detected. As a result the exchequer has experienced a  shortfall of 350 billion rubles.</p>

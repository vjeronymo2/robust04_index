			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / MPs told of Imro 'shortcomings' THE FAILURE of the Invest-ment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) to detect the plundering of pension schemes by Robert Maxwell arose from 'shortcomings of implementation', Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons yesterday. 'I do not accept that this case demonstrates that the supervisory structure itself is deficient,' Mr Nelson said. Acknowledging the need to strengthen the regulatory system, he emphasised that the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) had decided to work on correcting key shortcomings rather than withdraw recognition from Imro. He denied that Imro warned the government that it could not carry out its duties properly because of difficulties over the relationship between the Financial Services Act regime and trust law. Mr Nelson rejected further Labour demands that the government should compensate the pensioners concerned. He insisted that no government could accept a duty 'to make good losses resulting from fraud or theft of savings'. Mr Nelson said it was clear that the chain of responsibility had failings at many links. Mr Paul Boateng, a Labour spokesman on Treasury affairs, said: 'SIB was, in its own way, as much to blame in these matters as Imro'. Both bodies, he said, must bear a degree of culpability. Mr Ken Eastham, Labour MP for Manchester, Blackley, warned that it would be years before ordinary working people regained confidence in pension schemes. Calling on Imro to provide compensation, he said: 'I am not talking about petty cash like Pounds 2m or Pounds 3m.' Mr Eastham said some kind of penalty should be imposed on Imro 'for its incompetence and slackness regarding protection of pensioners' interests'.</p>

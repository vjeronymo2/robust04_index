			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: British Gas makes Canadian disposal BRITISH GAS has agreed to sell its 85 per cent stake in Consumers Gas of Canada for CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 612m), three years after it bought Canada's largest gas supply company in its biggest foreign acquisition to date. The sale of the company to Interprovincial Pipeline System of Edmonton, Alberta, will bolster British Gas' ability to take advantage of new opportunities in less mature international markets where returns are higher, according to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive. British Gas shares fell 3 1/2 p to 321 1/2 p, although the sale 'sent the right signal to the market that the company was willing to sell off non-core assets and re-invest in higher return businesses,' said Mr Simon Flowers of Natwest Markets in Edinburgh. British Gas has been under pressure to improve the returns from its non-regulated businesses since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the company began last year. Consumers Gas, which has about 1m customers in Ontario and New York state, was bought in 1990 by British Gas under the Global Gas banner for CDollars 1.1bn. An additional CDollars 46m was injected in 1992, just before a public flotation of 15 per cent of the company raised CDollars 162. Two related companies, worth about CDollars 60bn, are excluded from the sale and will be retained by British Gas. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said the sale proceeds and the removal of Consumers' debt from the British Gas balance sheet would reduce borrowings by Pounds 1.5bn. Gearing, as of the end of September, would fall by about six points to 25 per cent. IPL is buying Consumers because it sees a brighter future in natural gas supply and demand than in IPL's existing business of transporting crude oil. Mr Brian MacNeill, IPL's chief executive, noted that the prospects of finding major new oil reserves in western Canada are slim. On the other hand, he said that opportunities for additional gas reserves appear to be plentiful, while the long-term growth of demand for gas is assured by its environmental attractions. The sale of Consumers will remove Global Gas's main revenue stream, leaving it with a smattering of medium-sized businesses mainly in Latin America and Asia. British Gas officials say that a new strategy to develop its international businesses can only be finalised after the government decides on whether to implement the main MMC recommendation to break up the company.

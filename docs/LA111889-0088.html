			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE, BUT IT'S STILL USC-UCLA  </P> <P> USC vs. UCLA.  </P> <P> Say it and you need say no more.  </P> <P> The images flow: O.J. for 64 yards, Gary Beban to Kurt Altenberg, George Achica  blocking a kick, Frank Jordan getting his kick, Jay Schroeder to Freeman  McNeil, Erik Affholter's juggling catch . . .  </P> <P> National championships and unbeaten records, Rose Bowls and Heisman Trophies --  they've all been at stake in this storied rivalry.  </P> <P> And now, today, it's USC vs. UCLA at the Coliseum for, ta-da, nothing.  </P> <P> Absolutely nothing. The Trojans are already assured of going to the Rose Bowl,  and the Bruins are going nowhere.  </P> <P> Oh sure, city bragging rights will be on the line. And a chance for UCLA to  salvage at least a modicum of respect from its worst season in nearly two  decades.  </P> <P> The Bruins are 3-7. Improving to 4-7 wouldn't begin to right all the wrongs,  but a victory over the Trojans would at least allow the graduating seniors to  leave with a good taste in their mouths and begin the healing process for those  returning.  </P> <P> Out of the bowl picture after eight consecutive postseason appearances, the  Bruins will have to make this their bowl game.  </P> <P> As for USC, 8-2 and eighth-ranked in the nation, it has been a season with two  goals from the start.  </P> <P> The first, a victory over Notre Dame, never happened. The opportunity for the  second, a victory in the Rose Bowl after two consecutive losing appearances,  lies ahead after last week's Pacific 10 Conference title-clinching win over  Arizona.  </P> <P> In between sits UCLA, a 16 1/2-point underdog, but in position to pull an  upset.  </P> <P> "This is a game for pride," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "And the tradition, and  just the fact it's SC and UCLA week.  </P> <P> "This would make their whole season. If we sit back and are satisfied and happy  and all that kind of stuff with what we've achieved, then we'll get our brains  beat out. To me, it's just that simple."  </P> <P> To UCLA Coach Terry Donahue -- stuck in a five-game losing streak, longest by a  Bruin team in one season since 1963 -- there is nothing simple about beating  the Trojans.  </P> <P> "Obviously, our team is going to have to play the best it's played all year, by  a longshot," he said.  </P> <P> Should the Bruins do so, linebacker Marvcus Patton thinks it would soothe some  of the hurt.  </P> <P> "The record will always be there," he said. "But we could say we beat SC. Two  of the most successful (Bruin) teams in the school's history didn't beat them  the last two years, so if we beat them this year, it will make our season."  </P> <P> This is a game that traditionally pits old friends and high school rivals  against each other, and today is no exception.  </P> <P> The most notable confrontation involves the starting quarterbacks, Todd  Marinovich of USC and Bret Johnson of UCLA, rivals since their prep days in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Marinovich, a redshirt freshman, seems to be enjoying all the cross-town talk.  He showed up for a meeting with reporters at USC Tuesday wearing a light blue  shirt and gold pants, the Bruin colors.  </P> <P> Asked if his choice of clothes was more than just coincidence, he smiled,  shrugged and said, "Nope, just feel comfortable in them."  </P> <P> Marinovich has been comfortable from the start in a job handed to him 10 days  before the season opener when starter Pat O'Hara went down from a season-ending  leg injury.  </P> <P> With 2,246 yards passing, Marinovich is only the fourth Trojan -- Rodney Peete,  Paul McDonald and Rob Hertel were the others -- to pass for for more than 2,000  in a season.  </P> <P> Donahue said: "He has the benefit of being on a very dominant defensive team,  which allows him tremendous flexibility and allows him tremendous breathing  room. You know that if things misfire, your defensive team can get you off the  hook."  </P> <P> That it can. USC leads the nation in rushing defense, allowing an average of  just 62.5 yards a game. And only Notre Dame has scored against it on the  ground, the Irish getting four touchdowns rushing.  </P> <P> Johnson, on the other hand, has been part of a team unable to hold anybody back  recently. The Bruins have led or been tied in the second half of each of their  last four games before losing.  </P> <P> Johnson hasn't led his club to a second-half touchdown in its last six games.  Donahue has pulled him in three of the last four and handed the controls to  sophomore Jim Bonds.  </P> <P> Will he do the same today?  </P> <P> "It depends on how the game goes," Donahue said. "But I would say we wouldn't  hesitate to use him."  </P> <P> The repeated collapses seem to have mentally drained the Bruins.  </P> <P> "Before this year, we played with a lot of emotion," Patton said. "We had guys  who got out there and were pumped up and fired up. This year, there's not a lot  to be fired up about."  </P> <P> There is today.  </P> <P> Trojan-Bruin Notes  </P> <P> All 92,516 seats have been sold for today's game. The kickoff is scheduled for  12:30 p.m. . . . The last time the Bruins had a losing record, the Trojans beat  them, 49-14. That was a decade ago. "In 1979, we ran out of players during the  game," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "In 1989, we're having difficulty before  the game."  </P> <P> Since last summer, three Bruin defensive players have been suspended for  disciplinary reasons, another left the team after being arrested, and another  flunked out of school. In addition, defensive tackle Bryan Wilcox left the team  in midseason because of a head injury; offensive guard Lance Zeno had an  appendectomy two weeks ago; Reggie Moore had knee surgery three weeks ago, and  Paul Richardson will be out with a pulled groin, leaving the Bruins without two  of their top four wide receivers. Nose tackle Brian Kelly is out with a knee  injury and will be replaced by Jon Pryor.  </P> <P> Freshman Kevin Williams, who sprained an arch three weeks ago and carried the  ball only twice last week against Oregon, is expected to start at tailback for  UCLA. . . . Trojan defensive back Cleveland Colter, who underwent knee surgery  at the end of last season, had to have fluid drained from the knee earlier this  week but will start. . . . UCLA receiver Mike Farr needs six receptions to  break Mike Sherrard's school record of 128 career catches. Farr hasn't caught  more than five in any game this season but had nine receptions in last year's  game against USC.  </P> <P> In the annual Blood Bowl Friday between staff members of the school's student  newspapers, the Daily Bruin beat the Daily Trojan, 14-8, at USC's intramural  field. According to tradition, the school that wins the Blood Bowl usually  loses in the real game.  </P></p>

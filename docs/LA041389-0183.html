			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE OF CITY MANAGER QUESTIONED  </P> <P> How do you reward a city manager who has been so ineffective that he has lost  the services of every department head in a period of four years? Some  departments had multiple replacements during that brief span. Efficient  management personnel have either resigned or been fired.  </P> <P> Here is the reward the South Pasadena City Council came up with at its April 5  meeting. All but one council member praised the city manager. A huge scroll  with John R. Bernardi inscribed in vivid green lettering was presented to him.  He said he was "speechless."  </P> <P> Only minutes before, the council unanimously approved a 10% salary increase  that Bernardi determined was "commensurate with my abilities. . . ."  </P> <P> If this farce was intended to be an April Fool's trick on South Pasadena  taxpayers, it was four days too late!  </P> <P> ROBERT O. COOK  </P> <P> South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn.  </P></p>

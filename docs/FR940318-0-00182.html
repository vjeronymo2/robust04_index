			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, while most agents submitted under SNAP are relatively effective, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of efficacy assists in the assessment of the availability of substitutes in various niche  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets. EPA intends to accept as many viable substitutes as possible. If, due to technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns such as weight or storage volume equivalency, there are few or no substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available in a given application, EPA must ensure that it does not restrict the few available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choices based on other issues, such as environmental concerns. EPA's primary task in SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to facilitate the move away from ozone-depleting compounds, and this goal cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> served in the fire extinguishing sector without a full understanding of the characteristics of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Agency agrees with the commenters that data sources should be clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified. EPA does not intend to imply that cup burner data for heptane dictates the proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design concentration for all applications and for all fire hazards, nor does EPA intend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imply that a listing of `acceptable' means that an agent may be used in any application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without professional consultation. In this final rule, EPA reaffirms the need for all potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users to consult NFPA technical standards, OSHA regulations, and fire protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals for actual design considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use conditions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In response to EPA's request for comment on whether section 612 authorizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency to set use conditions, several commenters argued that setting use conditions is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the purview of section 612. Some commenters stated that EPA has exceeded its scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of authority under the Clean Air Act, and that EPA should defer regulation of workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety to OSHA, which is the appropriate entity. Other commenters stated that EPA failed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consult with OSHA and thus overstepped its authority by setting workplace conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters feel it is proper for EPA to establish exposure limits on new agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as it will ensure public safety until OSHA regulations are complete, especially where there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> little historical exposure information to rely on.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that section 612 clearly authorizes imposition of use conditions to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe use of replacement agents. EPA's mandate is to list agents that ``reduce the overall risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to human health and the environment'' for ``specific uses.'' Where use of a substitute without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions would increase overall risk, EPA is authorized to find the use of such substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> totally unacceptable. Included in this is the authority to find acceptable the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute only if used in a manner that reduces overall risk, and to find unacceptable its use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in all other cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, EPA's use conditions on workplace safety for halon substitutes will exist only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the interim, until OSHA incorporates specific language addressing gaseous agents in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA law. Under OSHA Public Law 91&hyph;596, section 4(b)(1), OSHA is precluded from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating an area currently being regulated by other federal agencies. EPA is specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deferring to OSHA, and has no intention to assume responsibility for regulating workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety in regard to fire protection. Consequently, EPA's use conditions are effective only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until OSHA acts and will terminate by their own terms once OSHA establishes standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA &sect;1910.162 governs the use of all gaseous agents in fixed extinguishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, however EPA finds that the guidance is not sufficiently explicit on the allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of the different agents. While paragraph 1910.162(b)(3) stipulates that ``[t]he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall assure that employees are not exposed to toxic levels of gaseous agent or its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decomposition products,'' it does not define what a `toxic level' is. In examining paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1910.162 (b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iii), EPA concludes that it is OSHA's intent to limit exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to gaseous agents based upon cardiotoxicity levels. EPA's conclusion was confirmed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions with OSHA. EPA therefore concludes that it is appropriate under the SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to stipulate what the cardiotoxic levels for each agent are, and, until OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporates clarifying language, to impose use conditions that apply OSHA standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1910.162 in its entirety to these agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> References in &sect;1910.162 to a Halon 1301 concentration of 7% imply a cardiotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAEL, and references to a Halon 1301 concentration of 10% imply a cardiotoxic LOAEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this regulation, EPA is clarifying the intent of &sect;1910.162(b)(3) to allow the use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute gaseous agents only according to paragraph (b)(6)(i) through (b)(6)(iii), using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cardiotoxic NOAEL and LOAEL of each agent as the concentration referenced in each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subparagraph. Thus, until OSHA establishes applicable work-place requirements, the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions in this final rule on halocarbon substitutes, using the OSHA regulation as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, will be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Where egress from an area cannot be accomplished within one minute, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall not use this agent in concentrations exceeding its NOAEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Where egress takes longer than 30 seconds but less than one minute, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall not use the agent in a concentration greater than its LOAEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Agent concentrations greater than the LOAEL are only permitted in areas not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normally occupied by employees provided that any employee in the area can escape within 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seconds. The employer shall assure that no unprotected employees enter the area during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agent discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These conditions will no longer apply once OSHA establishes applicable workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will adopt the commenters' suggestion that the use conditions be stated once in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the beginning of each section and will not repeat them for each agent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Narrowed use restrictions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters requested that EPA remove the narrowed use restrictions placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon HFC-23, C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These commenters argue that narrowed use restrictions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary, because the fire protection community (including entities such as NFPA, UL,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FMRC and others) has successfully regulated fire protection historically and remains better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to determine which agents should be selected based on design and use criteria, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental and toxicological acceptability, efficacy, cost, engineering practice and specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not the intent of EPA to interfere with the ability of the fire protection community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use its expertise in selecting agents and designing appropriate and cost-effective systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon technical criteria. EPA congratulates the industry on its excellent record of self-regulation, and seeks to work cooperatively with the regulated community in our efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the phaseout of halon. However, use of fire protection agents is, in fact, already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under federal law, i.e. OSHA, to ensure their safe use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is mandated to evaluate substitutes to reduce ``overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk to human health and the environment'' and to publish lists of acceptable and unacceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes ``for specific uses.'' EPA interprets section 612 as giving the Agency authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit use where there are concerns due to health or environmental factors. Because a primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of the SNAP program as a whole is to speed the market's transition away from ozone-depleting substances, conditional acceptances were accorded to many substitutes which might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unacceptable in the absence of any use conditions. EPA believes that, through the setting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of narrowed use restrictions in the limited cases where they are warranted, it has actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded the list of available options for fire protection experts to choose from.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

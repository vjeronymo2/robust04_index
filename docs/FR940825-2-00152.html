			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming majority of the components that comprise the Index are actively traded, with an average daily trading volume for the period from January 1, 1994 through June 30, 1994, ranging from a high of 2.7 million shares per day to a low of 107,000 shares per day. Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $25.0 billion to a low of $317.8 million as of July 8, 1994, with the mean being $4.86 billion. Third, although the Index is only comprised of sixteen component securities, no one particular security or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, as of July 8, 1994, no one stock accounted for more than 15.79% of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 51.01% of the Index's value. Fourth, at least 90% of the securities in the Index, by weight, must be eligible for standardized options trading. This proposed maintenance requirement will ensure that the Index is substantially comprised of options eligible securities. Fifth, if the Phlx increases the number of component securities to more than 21 or decreases that number to less than 11, the Phlx will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing new strike price or expiration month series of Semiconductor Index options or Index LEAPS. This will help protect against material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the Phlx's obligations to protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS. This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission believes that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the Semiconductor Index in any significant way through trading in component stocks (or options on those stocks) coupled with, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, will help deter such illegal activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Customer Protection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Semiconductor Index options and Index LEAPS, can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the Phlx, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Semiconductor Index options and LEAPS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Surveillance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a security index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading to securities underlying the derivative product is an important measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the Phlx, NYSE, Amex, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31243 (September 28, 1992), 57 FR 45849 (October 5, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See note 16,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  If the composition of the Index should change so that greater than 10% of the weight of the Index would be represented by ADRs ineligible for standardized options trading in the U.S. either because the securities underlying the ADRs are not the subject of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the Phlx or because the U.S. market is not the primary market for the ADRs, then it would be difficult for the Commission to reach the conclusions reached in this order and the Commission would have to determine whether it would be suitable for the Exchange to continue to trade options on this Index. The Phlx should, accordingly, notify the Commission immediately if more than 10% of the numerical value of the Index is represented by ADRs not eligible for standardized options trading in the U.S. Such a change in the current relative weights of the Index or in the composition of the Index may warrant the submission of a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act. In determining whether a particular ADR is eligible for standardized options trading see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31531 (November 27, 1992), 57 FR 57250 (December 3, 1992); and 33554 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5622 (February 7, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 29 Jan (TANJUG) -- I have to say that  after all there is a certain degree of optimism, Momcilo  Krajisnik, president of the people's assembly of the Srpska  republic, said this evening after five hours of talks with Haris  Silajdzic, prime minister of the Muslim government in Sarajevo.    Krajisnik headed a Srpska republic delegation at the talks  with the Muslim side at Sarajevo Airport. He specified that the  two sides had discussed the exchange and release of prisoners  and the situation following the arrest of Serb medical personnel  in the Muslim part of Sarajevo.    "There were certain political topics on the agenda too,"  Krajisnik added. He said that both sides agreed to exchange 85  prisoners each, and that the Serbs again pointed to the problem  of prisons in Gorazde [in eastern Bosnia] and Tarcin [southwest  of Sarajevo].    The talks were also attended by a representative of the  International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC], so it was  agreed that, with the mediation and participation of that  humanitarian organization, a mixed Serb-Muslim delegation should  visit the prison in Gorazde, while, according to Krajisnik,  "there are mutual problems" concerning Tarcin.    He explained that the families of the Serbs held in Tarcin  prevent humanitarian aid convoys from reaching the territories  under Muslim control, making their passage conditional on the  release of the prisoners from Tarcin. It was agreed that a  Srpska republic representative should go to Tarcin with ICRC  officials and, if possible, arrange an exchange of prisoners,  Krajisnik said.    He added that the ICRC got involved in the case of the Serb  doctors held in the Central Prison in Sarajevo, but that the  Muslim side had started making their release conditional on  "reciprocal measures."    "If there are Muslim doctors on our territory who would like  to cross to their territory, we are ready to resolve this matter  immediately," Krajisnik said. He reiterated that the arrest of  the Serb doctors was an extremely unreasonable act, adding that  he was hoping the problem would be resolved soon.    Revealing more details on political topics discussed at the  meeting today, the speaker of the People's Assembly of the  Srpska republic mentioned an idea presented by Silajdzic that in  this phase hostilities should cease, or maybe even complete  peace be restored, separation lines between warring sides be  drawn up along the present front lines, and the civilian  population be allowed to move freely between Visoko and  Sarajevo, Sarajevo and Tarcin, and also along roads leading from  Sarajevo to the Serb-controlled territories.    "I have the impression that the Muslim side wants a  cease-fire, which is encouraging, especially if they adhere to  these standpoints following additional consultations," Krajisnik  stated. According to him, this would not only be an act of  restoring trust, but would also create a climate in which  political negotiations on all contentious issues would continue  in an atmosphere of peace, not under war conditions.    Krajisnik also expressed reservations in this connection,  stressing that he had clearly told the Muslim side that what  might be lurking behind this proposal was the aim of buying time  to obtain certain military advantages such as further armament,  and mopping up the front facing the Croat side. "We shall accept  an invitation for peace, preferably for a permanent peace, but I  clearly told Silajdzic we had doubts about the peace-making  intentions of a part of the Muslim leadership, which is trying  to resolve the situation through the war," Krajisnik said.    The Srpska republic assembly speaker stressed that he had  drawn the Muslim side's attention to the fact that the Serbs  were ready to accept any military challenge, and that they could  not be swindled and cheated. In conclusion Krajisnik said that  an agreement was reached for the two delegations to meet once  again before 10 February, about which they would be in phone  contact as phone lines between the two sides are restored. He  explained that all this is aimed at overcoming distrust through  direct contacts, "so that the atmosphere ahead of the  forthcoming round of Geneva negotiations is as favorable as  possible."</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / India bids to repair trade relations with Russia INDIA'S foreign minister, Mr J N Dixit, left for Moscow yesterday on a mission to improve relations with Russia and the other republics left from the disintegration of the Soviet Union. India, which was the Soviet Union's main ally in Asia, misjudged developments, placing its trust in Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and failing to nurture relations with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. It now finds itself without the preferential treatment it had enjoyed. Relations with Russia and the republics are important not only because the Soviet Union was the main supplier of cheap and advanced defence equipment for India but also because it was a key trading partner. Mr Dixit's delegation includes Mr A V Ganesan, commerce secretary, and Mr N N Vohra, defence secretary. Since Soviet defence supplies dried up several months ago, the Indian armed forces find themselves equipped with sophisticated weapons which could become unusable because of lack of spares. An annual trade protocol between India and the Soviet Union used to be signed every December for decades. It was based on barter arrangements and last year's agreement was worth Rs90bn (Pounds 1.86bn). The protocol for 1992 is still to be discussed with Russia and those for the other republics and are nowhere in sight. Trade has been cut to a trickle and India is short of supplies of Russian oil, natural gas, fertilisers and ferrous and non-ferrous metal which it used to import in mass. Indian exports are also affected and many businessmen have made shipments for which payment has still be made. They are refusing to export more goods without a suitable payments arrangement. Before the trade protocol is signed, the vexed question of the rupee-rouble exchange rate has to be sorted out.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Takeover bid for Manchester City denied MR FRANCIS LEE, the former England footballer who became a millionaire through developing a successful tissue paper business, yesterday denied he was making a takeover bid for Manchester City Football Club, where he was once a famous player. However, he added that he and two colleagues were willing to invest substantial funds in the club if shareholders and supporters wished. It emerged yesterday that it would be almost impossible to mount a hostile bid for Manchester City. Only 4 per cent of shares are in general ownership. Mr Peter Swales, the chairman, and Mr Stephen Boler, a kitchens company owner and close friend, have 38 per cent each. The remaining 20 per cent is owned by Greenall Whitley, the Warrington brewer. Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenall's chairman, is on the Manchester City board and is a close supporter of Mr Swales. The club's 1992 accounts show net assets of Pounds 23m and Mr Swales is predicting profits of about Pounds 1m this year after transfers of players are finalised. Mr Swales has become unpopular with football fans after sacking Mr Peter Reid, the club's manager, following a poor start to the new season. After making it clear yesterday that he would not relinquish control, he said he was prepared to meet Mr Lee at any time to discuss possible participation. Mr Lee has been scathing about the running of the club in the past, claiming that if cups were given for 'cock-ups', Manchester City would by now have a bulging trophy room.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOREROS MAKE FOGARTY WINNINGEST USD COACH  </P> <P> University of San Diego Coach Brian Fogarty is not one to talk much about his  accomplishments, and he even gets a bit embarrassed when someone else does.  </P> <P> Perhaps that is why few people realized that Fogarty was about to become the  winningest football coach in USD history.  </P> <P> After Saturday night's 31-7 victory over Claremont in front of 3,244 fans in  USD's Torero Stadium, Fogarty is just that, wresting the honor from his  predecessor, Bill Williams.  </P> <P> Two games into his eighth season, Fogarty is 35-33-2. Williams was 34-36-1 in  seven years.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know that was the case," Fogarty said. "I guess if you stay some  place long enough, those things happen."  </P> <P> That's not entirely true. Fogarty has done an admirable job recruiting fine  student-athletes without the help of a scholarship lure, and he has made the  transition to recruiting freshman instead of community college transfers. He  also has established a fine, deceptive offense and a dominating aggressive  defense.  </P> <P> After going 15-24-1 in his first four seasons, Fogarty has gone 20-9-1 since  the start of 1987. He has also won nine of his past 11 games, including seven  in a row at USD.  </P> <P> USD (2-0) has also defeated Claremont four consecutive years by a combined  score of 101-35.  </P> <P> Saturday night, USD did it with a running game that pounded out 262 yards. It  did it with a controlled passing game that completed six of nine for 137 yards.  And it did it with a defense that held Claremont to 159 total yards, only 15 in  the second half.  </P> <P> John Eck was the big-play man on offense for the Toreros. Triple-threat Eck ran  for one touchdown, caught another one and added a 39-yard completion on a  halfback option pass to Ty Barksdale.  </P> <P> Eck finished with 86 yards rushing in eight carries and 54 yards in three  receptions.  </P> <P> Eck's two long touchdowns and a 42-yard field goal by Dave Bergmann gave USD a  17-7 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> On the second play of USD's second possession, Eck broke free in the Claremont  secondary after a play-action fake to him in the backfield, and Brendan Murphy  hit him easily for a 41-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> "I was scared I was going to drop it," Eck said. "I was so wide open."  </P> <P> On USD's next play from scrimmage -- 49 seconds later -- Eck broke free on a  counter play between right guard and tackle and rambled untouched 58 yards.  </P> <P> "You could have driven a truck through there," Eck said. "I mean, I have no  wheels, and if I could score on that, anyone could."  </P> <P> As for the halfback pass, Eck was a quarterback at Carson High before coming to  USD.  </P> <P> For the first 19 minutes, USD limited Claremont to 66 yards in four  possessions. That's when the Stags finally got things going, driving 80 yards  in 13 plays covering 6:21. Reed Pangborn dived over from the one to cap the  drive, and USD's lead was just 14-7.  </P> <P> Bergmann, who had missed earlier on a 37-yard field-goal attempt, nailed a  42-yarder from the right hash mark with no time remaining in the first half.  The key play in the 42-yard drive, which started with 1:12 left, was a 31-yard  pass from Murphy to senior Chris Redlew.  </P></p>

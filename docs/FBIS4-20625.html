			<p>CSO     [Text] The Patent Office has decided to assist ASEAN  countries in their training programs designed to develop  qualified corporate patent administrators and agents, beginning  in 1994. This decision is calculated to achieve smooth operation  of intellectual property right systems while, at the same time,  protecting Japanese companies from the onslaught of the  imitation products now flooding the market. The Patent Office  will make arrangements for trainees to be received by private  companies and patent attorneys' offices where they will be given  the opportunities to learn and practice patent administrative  work. The Patent Office is seeking the cooperation of  invention-related groups under its umbrella, as well as that of  private companies. This is the first time the training involving  overseas private sector personnel is supported by the Patent  Office.    With the consent of the Uruguay Round of GATT, ASEAN  countries' intellectual property system and the functions of  related government bureaus are rapidly being reorganized and  improved. For instance, the Thai Government has raised its  intellectual property section to the status of "bureau," while  working on the idea of establishing within the baht economic  sphere (which also includes Vietnam and Cambodia) a copyright  center designed to provide guidance in the matter of copyright  protection. Indonesia, in the meantime, began strengthening its  intellectual property protection measure by establishing its own  copyright-patent-trademark bureau.    In contrast to these governmental actions, very little has  been accomplished by the private sector. This is attributed to  the fact that companies in ASEAN countries, as a rule, do not  have a section devoted to patent administration; moreover,  lawyers or patent attorneys qualified to handle matters related  to patent application and processing as well as protection are  rarely found among company personnel.    For this reason, each country was searching for ways to open  pipelines to private sectors. At the Japan-ASEAN patent  specialist meeting held on January 15, 1994, in Changmai,  Thailand, an overwhelming number of participants urged Japan to  provide assistance in the training of private-sector patent  specialists. The Patent Office, therefore, had decided to  involve Japanese companies and patent attorneys' offices in the  program, arranging them to receive ASEAN trainees and providing  necessary in-service training.    Specifically, using Hatsumei Kyokai (Japan Institute of  Invention and Innovation), (which made a good showing when it  undertook the JICA-based training program), as a point of  contact, and through the Japan Patent Association and the  Society of Patent Attorneys, the Patent Office will request  corporations, patent attorneys' offices, and invention-related  groups to receive ASEAN trainees for in-service training. As for  dispatching patent specialists abroad, the Patent Office already  has sent examiners to Thailand and Indonesia to do consulting  work as special advisors to the bureau chief of each government  for a period of two years. What the Patent Office will do now is  to offer this arrangement to businesses as well.</p>

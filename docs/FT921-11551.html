			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Can't tell a book by its cover DO NOT be over-impressed by business travellers who appear glued to their laptop computers on long journeys. They might just be curled up with a book. The Voyager company, of Santa Monica, California has developed software to enable Apple Macintosh users to call up pages of books on the screen. By pressing a key the pages are turned over and notes can be added electronically to the margin or sections highlighted. There is even an electronic paper-clip to make a specific page easy to locate. Particularly intended for those who have bought the latest Powerbook laptop, the discs display illustrations as well as text. One of the first three books to be put on to disc is Martin Gardner's annotated 'Alice in Wonderland', including illustrations. Sound can also be incorporated. With Michael Crichton's book 'Jurassic Park', for example, when a dinosaur is mentioned the reader can click the name and a picture appears - along with the sound the animal might have made. Voyager: US, 310 451 1383.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> OSHA responded to these issues in a Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication of 5 February 1990 (55 FR 3727), in which the Agency reaffirmed its position concerning effectiveness levels of respirators, pointed out flaws in studies BCTD used to conclude that protection factors are inadequate, and noted that OSHA is revising and updating its general respirator standard. OSHA also noted that implementation of the entire respirator program would result in exposures below the PEL. That was OSHA's final statement of position on these issues and it was not judicially challenged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In evaluating the respiratory protection needs dictated by the new system of ranking for asbestos operations by ``class,'' OSHA has concluded that there are circumstances in which the highest level of respiratory protection must be used. These are Class I jobs for which a negative exposure assessment (i.e. exposures will be less than the PEL) has not been made. Inexperienced workers removing large amounts of TSI or surfacing ACM are at the high end of the risk spectrum and must have additional protection afforded by the supplied air respirator. OSHA notes that joint EPA-NIOSH recommendations would require a supplied air respirator in even more extensive circumstances, i.e., all ``abatement'' work and maintenance and some repair work (EPA/NIOSH Guide, referenced at Ex. 143, p. 69). The Agency''s decision balances the acknowledge potential safety hazards of supplied air respirators with the need for more protection in the most risky asbestos jobs. The Court of Appeals has agreed that such judgments are properly within the discretion of the Agency (858 F2d at 1274). In situations where the competent person makes a determination that exposures in Class I jobs will be less than the PELs, the standard requires that a half-mask air purifying, non-disposable respirator equipped with a high efficiency filter must be used. There are two reasons for this requirement: exposures less than the PEL have been determined to result in significant risk, the record shows that Class I work may result in substantial exposures even when good conditions exist, and the variability usually results in some high exposures. However, although all classes of asbestos work are potentially risky, OSHA has used discretion, and has limited the supplied air respirator provision to the highest risk situations, Class I work where it cannot be predicted that exposures will not exceed the PEL. This approach does not leave workers doing other classes of work unprotected. The respirator selection Table D&hyph;4, applies to all situations other than Class I work. As the worker(s) gain experience in the use of control methodology, and data accrues documenting low fiber levels, use of less protective respirators may be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, OSHA has based this conclusion on the demonstrated variability of exposures in the construction industry (Ex. 143, p. 63, CONSAD report p. 2.18, Tr. 2156, 2157, Tr. 4571, Ex. 7&hyph;57). The contractor Consad reported ``while many of the construction jobs monitored did not produce exposure levels above the proposed PEL of 0. 1 f/cc, these data also provide continued evidence that exposure levels can be highly variable in construction work and can exceed the proposed PEL *&blank;*&blank;* for many of the construction activities examined here'' (Ex. 8, 2.18&hyph;20).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Shipyard Employment Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h). SESAC has recommended the deletion of the qualitative fit test from the shipyard employment asbestos standard. Their rationale is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee has determined that advances in quantitative fit testing instrumentation have made this procedure accessible to shipyards conducting asbestos operations at a cost which is not overly burdensome ($5,000&hyph;6,000 at the low end). Because quantitative fit testing provides a better evaluation of fit among respirators than qualitative methods, and does not rely on subjective determination by the employees, qualitative fit testing methods have been deleted as acceptable alternatives *&blank;*&blank;* (Ex. 7&hyph;77).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

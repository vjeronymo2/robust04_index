			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EVANS DID HER PART FOR TEAM;  </P> <P> SWIMMER CITES EL DORADO EFFORT AS HIGH-WATER MARK  </P> <P> What do you give a girl who has nearly everything? How about a teddy bear?  </P> <P> Janet Evans, world-class distance swimmer, treasures a stuffed animal as much  as the three gold medals she won in the Seoul Olympics last summer.  </P> <P> The teddy bear was a present from one of her teammates at El Dorado High  School. But the entire team presented it to her at the Southern Section 3-A  finals in May.  </P> <P> "It was from my secret pal on the team," Evans said. "Everyone on the team has  one, and we give each other little gifts before every meet. But this one was  from everyone. They all signed a card and gave it to me. It was neat."  </P> <P> For Evans, The Times' Orange County girls' swimmer of the year, the gift marked  the end of an illustrious high school career.  </P> <P> While at El Dorado, Evans competed in four Southern Section championship meets.  Including relays, she won 10 Southern Section titles.  </P> <P> "I've always liked the Southern Section meet," said Evans, who will attend  Stanford on a swimming scholarship in the fall. "It was fun to compete with a  team. I like being with my peers."  </P> <P> Evans has had few of those in the pool, especially on the high school level.  She holds national high school records in the 200-yard individual medley and  500 freestyle.  </P> <P> In the 1989 3-A meet, Evans broke her national high school record in the 200  individual medley with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. She also won the 500  freestyle in 4:38.34, missing her national mark by a second.  </P> <P> Evans also helped El Dorado's 200 medley relay team finish first. The Golden  Hawks finished second at the meet.  </P> <P> The second-place finish is Evans' fondest memory of her high school  competition.  </P> <P> "That was really exciting," Evans said. "It was the highest El Dorado has ever  finished. That was special. I'm glad I was a part of it."  </P> <P> For Evans, the high school season was a welcome break from the rigors of  international competition. It was a chance to be with her friends and have a  little fun. She regularly swam in events other than her specialties in dual  meets, as well as swimming on relay teams.  </P> <P> "I got to swim the 100 backstroke and 100 breaststroke during dual meets,"  Evans said. "I could never do that on the international level. I'm a distance  swimmer; there's no way I could beat the best in the world in the 100-meter  anything.  </P> <P> "In high school swimming, I get to be with my friends. That's the best part."  </P> <P> It may sound odd, but Evans has actually lost a high school race in the  Southern Section championship meet. Of course, that was back in those  pre-legend days when she was a freshman.  </P> <P> Since losing in the 200 individual medley in 1985, she has won every individual  championship race.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it's over already," Evans said. "High school went by so fast.  It's hard to imagine not swimming in high school anymore. It's a little sad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> GIRLS' ALL-COUNTY SWIMMING TEAM  </P> <P> Based on results in Southern Section meets and participation with high school  team  </P> <TABLE

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad  al-Razzaz delivered a statement on the state's draft general  budget for the fiscal year 1994-95 at the People's Assembly at  noon today.    He said the draft budget is based on several principles,  foremost of which is the continuation of the fiscal policies  leading to a gradual decrease in the state's general budget  deficit and the focus on social issues.    The plan also pays attention to enhancing the economic  dimension through an integrated group of investment, monetary,  credit, and fiscal policies that seek to develop the state's  revenues, secure the necessary investment for development and  production, enhance the infrastructure, encourage the private  sector, and take care of production, as well as taking into  consideration current world economic changes.    He said that the total expenditure in the draft budget of  the  year 1994-95 amounts to approximately 70.541 billion pounds  against 65.313 billion pounds in the 1993-94 budget.    The total revenue is 61.977 billion pounds against 56.33  billion pounds last year. Thus the budget's total deficit is  approximately 8.564 billion pounds against 8.983 billion in the  1993-94 budget.    He added that financing through local and foreign loans  amounts to about 8.75 billion pounds and thus the net deficit in  the new budget amounts to approximately 488.4 million pounds  against 1.338 billion in the year 1993-94.    Al-Razzaz said in his statement that the general taxes are  estimated at 16.244 billion pounds representing 44 percent of  the state's total revenue.    He noted that payment of the state loans on time is a  paramount goal of our fiscal policy. Therefore, each fiscal  year assumes its own share of the debt service. The draft  budget allocates 21.146 billion pounds to meet the interest and  installments of the state's local and foreign loans. He said  the interest of these loans amounts to approximately 17.74  billion pounds, of which only 4.1 billion is foreign loans and  the rest local loans.    The value of local and foreign installments due in 1994-95  is  about 4.271 billion pounds, of which 2.33 billion are foreign  loan installments.</p>

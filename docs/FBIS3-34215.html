			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Arab League has asked the international  community and the United Nations for immediate action to halt  massacres of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina perpetrated by the  Serbs, who take advantage of the world silence and the blockade  that prevents any defensive weapons from reaching the Muslims  there.    In a statement made today, the Arab League General  Secretariat called on the Security Council to use all possible  means to restore peace to this republic according to the  principles of law and justice and not the policy of aggression  and occupation.    In its statement, the Arab League General Secretariat  emphasized that it is following with extreme concern the tragic  developments in Bosnia and the Serb forces' continued killing of  unarmed civilians, especially the tragic incident that led to  the killing and wounding of 263 Muslims when Serbs shelled the  capital of Sarajevo yesterday.</p>

The proposed action is to implement management activities that will support the desired future condition for the Nebo Management Areas outlined in the Uinta National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR 219.17 and 219.27. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project area is located south of Payson, Utah, and northeast of Nephi, Utah, on lands accessible from the Mt. Nebo Loop Scenic Byway. The largest concentration of infected timber stands are in the Sheepherder Hill area (Sections 15, 22&hyph;24, 28, 29, T10S, R2E, Salt Lake Meridian). The purpose of this proposed management action is to save the remaining healthy trees by removing the competition that may be posed by dead and dying conifer trees and planting seedlings to accelerate the recovery time for reestablishing a healthy forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of activities to restore a healthy forest condition may require entry into areas designated as roadless in the 1980 RARE II inventory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of the full environmental analysis and decisionmaking process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments concerning the scope of the analysis for this Forest Service proposal should be received in writing by May 10, 1994.

Nebo Wilderness Area, the nature and scope of the decision to be made is affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aerial surveys indicate more than 15,000 acres of timber stands were infested in the Nebo Management Area by the summer of 1993. A biological evaluation of current stand conditions was conducted on 350 acres to assess the magnitude of the problem and potential management options. The biological evaluation indicated that management actions should be considered to reduce the volume of dead and dying trees in the more concentrated, infested timber stands in the area, specifically Sheepherder Hill. In the spring of 1993, an emergency timber sale, the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale, was approved for harvesting approximately 141 acres of highly visible dead and dying timber within the proposed project area, but not within an inventoried roadless area. The emergency sale is adjacent to the Sheepherder Hill area. Since the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale was initiated, many additional fir beetle infestations have been identified and concern about forest health has increased throughout the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scoping of public issues were initiated as part of the Payson Canyon Salvage Sale, which is applicable to this project. The preliminary list of issues identified to be addressed by this project analysis include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Forest health <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Impacts on the roadless characteristics of the project area <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Cumulative impacts of alternatives to this action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Visual impacts to the Scenic Byway <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Fuel build-up/fire and insect disease hazards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Economic feasibility of implemented management actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Implications to wetlands, floodplains and riparian vegetation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Possible impacts to threatened, endangered and/or sensitive species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Land/slope stability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Forest user safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Water quality <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Elk calving vs. the timing of management activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario FRN proves popular The Eurobond market was unanimous in its enthusiasm for the latest debt offering from the Province of Ontario, which eclipsed most other deals in yesterday's active session. Ontario's long-awaited global US dollar FRN, launched only three days after its CDollars 1.25bn fixed-rate 30-year bond issue, met such strong demand that it was increased to Dollars 2bn from the initial Dollars 1.5bn in the early afternoon. The notes - Ontario's first floaters - have a 5 1/2 -year maturity and were priced to yield eight basis points above three-month Libor at the re-offer price. Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch arranged the issue. The pricing of the deal was seen as appropriate, with some traders suggesting it could even have been a little tighter. The day's other US dollar floater was a Dollars 200m five-year issue for Crediop Overseas Bank via CS First Boston. The notes were priced to yield 23 basis points over Libor at the re-offer price, which many observers felt was about five basis points too tight. An official with the lead manager conceded the pricing was aggressive, adding that 'this was a pre-emptive deal - it gave us an opportunity to take a position and wait for spreads to come in'. In the domestic sterling bond market, LAB Investments, a vehicle set up to acquire and hold registered loan instruments issued by local authorities, launched Pounds 85m of 25-year bonds via NatWest Capital Markets. According to the lead manager, the deal met strong demand from UK life assurance companies and pension funds. The issue is secured by debt issued by the London Borough of Enfield, Manchester City Council and the City of York. The bonds were priced to yield 70 basis points over the gilt due 2017; that spread had narrowed to 68 basis points towards the close. In the guilder sector, the Republic of Austria issued Fl1bn of 30-year 6.25 per cent bonds yielding 16 basis points over the Dutch 30-year benchmark bond. The lead manager was ABN Amro Bank. LKB Baden-Wurttemberg issued L300bn of 7.80 per cent 10-year bonds via Credito Italiano. While the lira sector continues to suffer from oversupply, the lead manager reported good buying by Swiss and Italian institutions and said the deal was helped by the paper's yield pick-up over other, recently issued lira bonds. Meanwhile, Portugal is expected to issue an Ecu750m 10-year global bond early next week, with Banque Paribas, Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley tipped as joint lead managers. The bonds are expected to yield 30-35 basis points above the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004.</p>

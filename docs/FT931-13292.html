			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Breaking European crime and unemployment Representatives of EC governments and training organisations are meeting in Belgium today to explore ways of breaking the link between European crime and unemployment, writes David Marsh. The three-day meeting at Louvain near Brussels, organised by the Commission's employment and social affairs directorate, brings together experts from ministries and voluntary organisations from the 12 member countries. The meeting will exchange ideas and information on projects to rehabilitate ex-offenders, highlighting a new approach to tackling the Community's growing law and order problems. In the UK, roughly half of adult males convicted of offences commit another crime within two years - establishing a vicious circle in criminal behaviour. The so-called 'recidivism' rate is thought to be similar in other EC countries. Statistics indicate that ex-offenders with jobs are three times less likely to recommit crimes than those unemployed. EC ministries and training organisations are planning a working party to tap funds for ex-offenders' employment projects and monitor how different countries achieve solutions. The Commission is spending an initial Ecu1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) this year to finance projects connected with rehabilitation. One aim of this week's meeting is to allow national agencies to gain access to training funds from organisations and budgetary programmes elsewhere in the EC. Already the Netherlands and Germany are co-operating on a cross-border programme for integrating ex-offenders. A similar scheme is under way involving Luxembourg and the UK.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CS NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL TEAM RETURNS HOME  </P> <P> Having earned a split on its toughest trip of the season, Cal State Northridge  will play 6 of its next 7 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball games  at home.  </P> <P> But is that good news or bad news for the Matadors?  </P> <P> Northridge (11-5) has lost its past 2 games at home after winning 5 home games  in a row.  </P> <P> "We need to get the feeling of winning at home again," said CSUN Coach Pete  Cassidy, whose team beat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last Saturday after losing at  Bakersfield. "It's our gym, our crowd, our environment. We practice there every  day. We should be as tough as hell to beat there."  </P> <P> Northridge will be short-handed as it tries to regain its form tonight at 7:30  against Chapman College.  </P> <P> Forward Leroy McCullough is academically ineligible and has left the team at  least temporarily in order to concentrate on his studies. McCullough, the team  leader in shooting percentage (57.1%) and blocked shots (10), was fourth in  scoring for the Matadors, averaging 9.1 points a game as a reserve.  </P> <P> Chapman is 8-8 overall and 1-2 in the CCAA, a game behind Northridge, which is  2-1 and in a 4-way tie for second place behind Riverside.  </P> <P> Forward Rog Middleton, a transfer from Utah who became eligible in December,  leads Chapman with a 15.7 average in conference play.

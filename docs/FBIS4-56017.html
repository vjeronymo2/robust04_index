			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report on a statement by Kresimir Zubak, leader of the </F> Bosnian Croat negotiating team, in Geneva; date not given: "`We  Are Not Giving the Corridor to the Serbs'"]    [Text] "We have coordinated our positions with those of  the Muslim delegation and established the starting points for  the negotiations with the Serb side, but we do not expect that  any significant progress will be made in the peace talks," said  Kresimir Zubak, leader of the negotiation team of the Bosnian  Croats, before the three-day peace talks between the delegations  of the three warring sides and the members of the contact group  for Bosnia- Herzegovina that, on the initiative of the United  States, will be held beginning Tuesday evening behind closed  door in Talloires, a French town near Geneva.    The Croat delegation, accompanied by the Croatian ambassador  in Geneva, Dr. Miomir Zuzul, met with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime  Minister Haris Silajdzic on Tuesday morning in Geneva to  establish a joint negotiating position regarding the territorial  demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Zubak said that the Croat and Bosniak delegations would  support the maps established by the Vienna agreement, which  anticipates 58 percent of the territory for the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and 42 percent for the Bosnian  Serbs. The Croat and Bosniak delegations are prepared to  discuss the possibility of a compromise and the division of the  territory into 51 and 49 percent, as stated in the European plan.    With regard to the so-called corridor, the position of the  Croat and Bosniak delegations is that, in principle, the Serbs  being given a corridor is out of the question, as the Croats and  the Muslims would then also demand certain corridors going  through Serb territories, said Zubak. However, he added, if the  international community insists on this, there is a possibility  of introducing free roads in Bosnia-Herzegovina, under UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] control, in accordance with the solutions  contained in the Vance-Owen plan.    As far as the talks on the future political and legal  organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, we are  prepared to discuss all the possible solutions, including the  Serb side joining the federation, or a loose Bosnia-Herzegovina  union consisting of the Croat-Bosniak federation and the future  Serb republic, as stated in the Vance-Owen plan, said Zubak.</p>

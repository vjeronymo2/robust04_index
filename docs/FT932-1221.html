			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ruling on airline deal will stand THE Canadian government will not overturn the National Transportation Agency's ruling allowing American Airlines to buy 25 per cent of Canadian Airlines International for CDollars 246m (USDollars 192m), according to federal sources. The agency, as Canada's air transport regulator, said last month that the American Airlines investment was not contrary to Canada's public interest, though Canadian Airlines would still have to find a way out of the Gemini reservation system, owned jointly with Air Canada. Later, Air Canada appealed to the government to overturn the NTA ruling, saying that Canada would lose control over its domestic airline industry if the American-Canadian deal went through.</p>

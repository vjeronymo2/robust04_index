			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at a news </F> conference to announce the government's new economic package in  Ankara -- live]    [Text] Dear listeners, guests, honorable members of our  press and television: I greet you all respectfully.    We are here before you with Mr. Karayalcin, leader of our  coalition partner, the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP],  and deputy prime minister, to announce a series of important  decisions we have made.    For a long time now, we have noticed that the economic  problems in our country are growing. The prosperity of the  Turkish people is what is important. What is important is not  only the immediate prosperity of all the people in this country  -- the workers, civil servants, farmers, the big masses, and the  shopkeepers -- but their prosperity in the coming months and  years as well. We found that this prosperity was being  mortgaged. Consequently, very difficult and daring decisions  were needed to take measures that would increase this  prosperity. We could have allowed the heap of economic problems  to grow or we could have set aside certain political interests  and be guided by the country's interests in making a series of  decisions together. We opted for the second alternative.  Together, we made a series of decisions that not even one-party  governments dared make. Together, we are determined to overcome  the problems facing the country, to bring prosperity to the  Turkish people, and to clear the way for them in the best  possible manner.    I would like to approach the issue in the following way:  First, to state what these economic problems are, and then to  point out what would have happened had we not reached these  decisions, what the decisions are, and what we can expect from  these decisions.    Let me state clearly that the most important problem facing  the country is the growing public deficit. I think that there  is a consensus on this point in all sectors of our society. Let  us look at the important factors that caused the growth of the  deficit and at certain data.    It can be observed that since 1985, a growing share of the  revenues -- today, it is more than all the revenues put together  -- goes toward paying debts, in the form of the debt itself and  interest. This share used to be half of all tax revenues.  Every year, the share grew at a higher rate than the previous  year, and has reached the current level of 104 percent. In  other words, even if you take all the tax revenues, you cannot  pay all the debts and interest today. The interest we pay alone  is close to 50 percent of our tax revenues. What is left of the  tax revenues is also not enough to pay the civil servants and  workers.    Naturally, such a big public debt means that new loans must  be taken to pay the interest on the old loans. This process has  been going on in Turkey for quite some time.    Another development that contributed to this process was the  fact that the foreign exchange rate was kept at very low levels  after 1987. Interest rates naturally rise under conditions in  which there is such a public deficit if the foreign exchange  rate is to be kept low. When interest rates are high, public  deficits grow in a vicious circle. That is what indeed  happened. After 1988, the growing public deficit contributed to  creating a higher interest rate on the one hand, while the  foreign exchange rate, which was being kept unnecessarily low,  created another short-term capital transfer on the other.    These vicious circles which fed on each other caused the  country to become trapped in a clamp of interest and debts. They  prevented investments and the creation of jobs and also caused a  mounting inflation rate.    Given the fact that the increasing public deficit is at the  core of the problem, I want to briefly talk about what would  have happened had we not taken these measures. Had we not taken  these measures, we would have had to live through the Latin  American example. The inflation rate would have exceeded 100  percent and might have eventually reached 2,000-3,000 percent,  as in Latin America. Furthermore, the growth rate would first  have dropped and then have fallen to negative levels. In other  words, we would have been headed toward a narrowing economy.  Under such conditions, unemployment rates would have grown very  fast and would have been impossible to stop. Unemployment would  have grown not only in the short term but would have continued  to mount. The government would have been unable to pay civil  servants and workers. All these considerations made it  essential to take these measures. Indeed, the radical and brave  measures we have taken can stop all these things from happening.  Let me briefly discuss their essence.    The measures can be grouped into two. The first involves  stability. The second involves measures that will lead to  structural changes.    What is important for stability is to reduce the public  deficit. We will show the public how we will reduce the public  deficit by means of three-month balances and budget figures. In  the first stage, we plan to save 38.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL]  [approximately $1.4 billion]. In other words, we aim at  reducing the TL47.6 trillion deficit to TL9 trillion during the  first three months. We will stand behind these figures. These  are the figures that should be examined when our government  policies are assessed. We thought it would be appropriate to  announce the figures publicly. These figures will be announced  at the end of every three-month period, so that we can assess  the figures together before the public. This is as much a  requisite of openness as it is a requisite of credibility and  trust. If we cannot hit the target and reach these figures,  then we will look for the reasons together and tackle the issue  together again.    We have determined how to tackle the different elements of  the deficit in order to reduce it: The revenues will be  increased by TL16.3 trillion, while expenditures will be reduced  by TL22 trillion.    Along with that, we had to introduce a price and salary  policy. In the first stage, we have had to make price  readjustments. I want to declare here and now that after these  price readjustments, there will be no further readjustments for  six months in some cases, until the end of the year in others,  except for reasons stemming from conditions outside Turkey.    We are aware that increased salaries play an important role  in this vicious circle -- that is, in increasing the public  debt. We are determined to increase salaries as much as  possible within the budget expenditures.    The complementary third leg of the trivet had to involve  the Central Bank. In the coming days, the Central Bank will  announce its monetary program in connection with the budget and  financing deficit for the next three-month period. However,  more important than that, two laws concerning the Central Bank  were submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today.  They involve granting autonomy to the Central Bank and  reducing, gradually every year, the current 15 percent share of  the budget expenditures which go toward short-term advance  payments.    Other than that, besides the monetary program and the  measures to be taken by the Central Bank, the Capital Market  Council will issue a statement tomorrow restricting certain  procedures.    Meanwhile, I think it is necessary to clearly state the  following: We considered it necessary to tackle the issue of  the just distribution of the burden while the stability program  is being implemented; that is, while taking measures to restrict  the budget deficit and financing needs, while being very careful  about raising salaries and readjusting prices -- the second leg  of the trivet -- and while, in turn, the Central Bank declares  its laws and statements. I want to say that all these measures  will be implemented within the following framework: Everything  will be carried out in line with the market economy. No foreign  exchange accounts will be confiscated. Exchange bureaus will  not be closed. An internal debt consolidation will not be made.  In other words, all the rules of the market economy will  continue to function.    Nor are we compromising the big projects of our country.  That is, the projects that are under way within the framework  of the build-operate-transfer principle, and the projects that  are to be financed by foreign capital such as the State Water  Works' Urfa tunnel, Deriner Dam, and Kralkizi Dam, will all  continue. In other words, we will not make any reductions in  the country's technological development, in its important  investments, or in foreign investments.    Within this framework, the market economy will work on the  one hand, and the big investments from foreign sources, mainly  energy, will continue.    We have tried to make everyone share the burden equally.  Accordingly, if you look at page 17, there will be a one-time  tax. This additional tax will be collected from those who pay  income and corporation tax and will be levied on the assets they  declare in 1994. Salaried workers will be exempt from this tax.  An additional low one-time tax will be collected on net income  or assets. An additional one-time tax will be levied on  motorized vehicles for the ground, sea, and air that exceed a  certain insurance value. Those who own more than one residence  will pay an additional low one-time tax.    These are measures necessary for justice and for the just  distribution of the burden.    The stability dimension of the measures is reflected in the  narrowing of the public deficit, in our price and salary policy,  and in the measures the Central Bank will take such as autonomy  and the exchange regime.    However, the third leg of this trivet involves structural  reorganization, a restructuring. In restructing, we will speed  up the privatization of public economic enterprises. In a way,  the public sector will be consolidated and made to function more  efficiently and productively. Every measure will be taken to  ensure this. Our law for privatization was submitted to the  assembly today.    Privatization will be carried out at great speed. We believe  that we can reach a target of $3.5 billion in privatization by  the end of the year. If you consider that during the past 10  years, less that $0.5 billion, some $300 million, was received  in privatization, you will see how large our target is. [figures  in dollars as heard] Within this framework, by the end of 1994,  the following will be fully or partly privatized: Erdemir  TUPRAS, the Petrochemical Holding Company [PETKIM], Turkish  Airlines, TURBAN, HAVAS, the Maritime Transportation Company,  and DITAS.    Furthermore, the Turkish Electricity Authority and the Post,  Telephone, and Telegraph Administration [PTT] will be privatized  in 1995. The preliminary preparations for that will be  completed in 1994. The PTT license for cellular phones and  cable television will also be sold.    The social security institutions will be reformed. We are  working on that with great speed. Within this framework,  private health insurance and private pension funds will be  encouraged.    We all know that the public economic enterprises stopped  being productive and incurred great losses a long time ago. We  will try to make the public economic enterprises fruitful. We  will give this first priority. The work regarding this issue  will be conducted by the concerned ministry and the concerned  institutions at great speed.    We will speed up the sale of the fixed assets, rest homes,  hotels, and lodgings of the public economic enterprises. We  will review the fixed assets of the state pension fund. Hotels  belonging to the fund will be rented or sold.    We will close down installations that are impossible to sell  due to large debts, overemployment, high-cost production, or  technological backwardness. Their capital assets will be sold.  Accordingly, we have decided to close down seven factories  belonging to Sumer Holding Company, the PETKIM installation in  Yarimca, the PETLAS corporation, five hotels being run by TURBA,  the Turkish Electronic Production and Marketing Corporation  installation in Aydin, the Halic, Camialti,and Alaybey  dockyards, and some combines of the Meat and Fish Corporation.  The decision will be implemented within a certain period of  time, given the orders placed with the installations and the  time needed to liquidate their stocks.    Furthermore, unless it can be privatized by the end of the  year, the Turkish Agricultural Equipment Corporation will be  closed down. The State Material Office will be liquidated. The  State Monopolies' Ankara and Bomonti beer factories, and the  Cibali cigarette factory will be closed down until the end of  the year.    The workers laid off during privatization will be  compensated.    We are aware that the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works has had  problems for quite some time. The Iron and Steel Works, which  made great contributions to the development of Karabuk District,  has fulfilled its mission, completed its economic and  technological life, and can no longer compete due to outdated  technology. We expect the installations's losses in 1994 to be  around TL5 trillion. With interest, this places a burden much  higher than TL10 trillion on the public.    Unless it is privatized, production at the Karabuk Iron and  Steel Works will stop at the end of the year. The necessary  preparations will be made.    The workers, if they want, can take over the installations  until the end of the year. All legal rights of and compensation  for personnel -- the retired or those whose service has ended --  will be met in time. In addition, the workers will benefit from  the unemployment indemnities within the framework of the  privatization power law.    The limitations and improvements necessary to increase  production in the Turkish Stone Quarry Organization will be  perpetuated. Within this framework, if no requests are submitted  from the private sector, certain mines will be closed by the end  of the year. The works of the miners in the active mines will  be guaranteed. The legal rights of the miners whose services  will no longer be needed will be taken care of and they will  receive due compensation in time. In addition, they will  benefit from loss of employment indemnities as stipulated in the  privatization law. Maintenance work will be done in the coal  mines where mining is stopped to preserve them in their present  conditions thus enabling them to be reopened in case a bid is  submitted from the private sector. We have it on our agenda to  take every measure possible to minimize the damage to the  Zonguldak Province and Karabuk. Investment and employment  possibilities will be accelerated in Zonguldak Province and we  are continuing to make a series of decisions to that end.    The TL7.6 trillion [approximately $271 million] employment  infrastructure project for Zonguldak Province will be continued.  Organized industrial regions will be established in Caycuma,  Karabuk, and Eregli. This means that three organized industrial  centers will have been established in Turkey during our  government's tenure. Karabuk will become a province and will  have priority status regarding development. In addition, a  university will be established in Karabuk.    Preparatory research having been completed, work will be  started on the Kilyos port project. Kilyos will be declared a  free zone. Training courses will be started, enabling workers  laid off from the TKK [Agricultural Credit Cooperative  Association] and Karabuk Iron and Steel Works to acquire  professional skills. These projects, to be completed within  three years, will create employment possibilities for  approximately 21,000 persons.    We are envisaging new stages in our agricultural endowment  policy. Within the framework of this project, we plan on  expanding the same system applied to cotton, tobacco, and tea.  Our principles from now on will be the same as in the cotton  produce -- supporting the payment of state subsidies directly  the farmer. Free price policy will be applied to fertilizer.  Government subsidies will not go to the firms but to the farmer  directly. This means that state support will go directly to the  farmer. The elimination of intermediary bodies will prevent  losses which in turn will prevent great damage due to the above  losses.    As you can see, a new reconstruction process which  encompasses a large area and different issues will be  perpetuated.    We are going to continue acting swiftly regarding the local  and administrative arrangements of local administrations.    Honorable guests, as you can see, a new phase is starting.  The most important issue in this phase is the trust issue, that  is, the issue of trusting the program. The program has two  footholds. The first one concerns measures regarding stability  and the second one measures concerning reconstruction. We are  announcing the first three-month balance sheet of the measures  on stability. We will have the opportunity to follow and  inspect these measures every three months. However, the most  important issue is to free ourselves from former developments  and draw a line between the past and the future. The coming  three months will be a period of change, a period of transition.  The changes that will take place during this transition period  should not form the basis of our expectations nor form the  framework for our future expectations. The first three months  should be considered a transition period. We must have  expectations only after this first three-month period is  completed. Henceforth, this transition period will be the basis  of all the collective wage agreements, price adjustments, and  other social conciliations. That is, we are going to severe our  ties with the past, the past issues, and the wrongs. Our new  expectations should be crystallized for the period following the  three-month transition period. This is the most important  factor in the success of this program.    We started work with great determination and aspiration in  order to implement this program. Within this framework, all  levels of the society should take part in this privatization and  consensus. We have to accomplish this consensus within all  parts of the society. We have already established a consensus of  this kind in our fight against terrorism. All parts of the  community supported the fight against terrorism.    What we have here is terrorism with regard to economy. The  economic issue is the accumulation of years. We approach this  issue with measures that governments singly did not dare use.  However, this program can not succeed with only one part of the  sector supporting it. This program is based on conciliations  and sacrifices by the entire public. We, as the government, are  going to do everything in our power to render these sacrifices  just. We are going to do this all together. We are going to do  this together and with thought.    We are going to conduct a clear-cut inspection as well as an  essential examination after the completion of each three-month  period. We have to succeed. We have to succeed regarding this  issue. If we fail, what is at stake is not the issue of our  government's success but the issue of our country's economy. We  have to break out of this point reached to this day.    To achieve this break out, we ask for the support of all  parts of our country just as we did in our fight against  terrorism. We want consensus and trust. This trust will be the  trust we will have for each other. I wish all the best for our  country.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State bases its petitions on a demonstration that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions would not contribute to attainment in either area, as allowed for under the test (2) listed above, because such NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions would be in excess of the reductions necessary for attainment. Consistent with the EPA's December 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 182(f) guidance, the State's excess emissions reductions demonstration is tied to the attainment demonstration SIP required under section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State's submission for each petition includes: (1) A letter from Anthony C. Grigsby, Executive Director of the TNRCC, to Jane N. Saginaw, Regional Administrator of the EPA Region 6, transmitting the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption petition; (2) the petition from the TNRCC summarizing the State's UAM attainment demonstration results; and (3) technical reports documenting the State's base case UAM inputs. The State has also previously submitted to the EPA the 15 percent Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) SIPs for the DFW and El Paso areas, as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 182(b)(1) of the CAA. The 15 percent RFP SIPs contain regulations that are estimated to reduce VOC emissions in each area by 15 percent from 1990 levels, net of any growth that may occur. The State of Texas supplemented its petitions by submitting to the EPA in July 1994, two additional technical reports on the UAM for each area, which contained the following: base case performance evaluation, attainment year emissions report, and attainment year modeling report. These additional technical reports provided supplemental detail and documentation on the modeling information already provided to the EPA in the State's petitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 29, 1994, the EPA proposed to conditionally approve the section 182(f) petitions for the DFW and El Paso areas (see 59 FR 44386). The proposed rulemaking notice provides a detailed discussion of the EPA's rationale for proposing conditional approval of the State's petitions and should be referred to. In that notice, the EPA explained that although the State had completed its attainment demonstration SIPs for both areas, the SIPs had not yet been adopted by the State, nor submitted to the EPA. The EPA further explained that the EPA would not take final action to conditionally approve the petitions for each area unless and until the State submitted the attainment demonstration SIPs to the EPA in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TNRCC adopted the attainment demonstration SIP for the DFW area on September 21, 1994, and submitted it to the EPA on October 3, 1994, in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA. Similarly, the TNRCC adopted the attainment demonstration SIP for the El Paso area on September 14, 1994, and submitted it to the EPA on October 3, 1994. The EPA is therefore proceeding to take final action on the section 182(f) petitions submitted by the TNRCC for the DFW and El Paso areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposed action to conditionally approve the section 182(f) petitions for the DFW and El Paso areas. The EPA received 27 letters of support from the utility, transportation authority, metropolitan planning organization and local governments in the DFW area. The EPA received three letters of support from the City of El Paso, a local utility, and a metropolitan planning organization in the El Paso area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three adverse comment letters were received from environmental groups, one of which applied only to DFW, while two of which applied to both DFW and El Paso. One of the letters was submitted by three environmental groups and contained generic comments objecting to the EPA's general policy on section 182(f) exemptions. The three environmental groups who submitted the generic letter requested that it be included in each EPA rulemaking action for each section 182(f) petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One group objected to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a fuel additive in reformulated gasoline. The TNRCC included the use of reformulated gasoline in its 15 percent RFP SIP for DFW as a control strategy to reduce VOC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This comment applies to the State's reformulated gasoline program, and its 15 percent RFP SIP for the DFW area that had previously been adopted by the State and submitted to the EPA. The EPA does not believe that this comment is relevant to the rulemaking action on the State's petition for a section 182(f) NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption, since in this action, the EPA is not taking action on the State's reformulated gasoline program nor its 15 percent RFP plan. The EPA will rule on those control programs in a separate rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One group felt that the UAM model for DFW was flawed from a scientific perspective so as to be inadequate to make sound predictions of attainment. They cited the fact that only three of the four episodes initially analyzed by the State had acceptable performance. In addition, they felt that the emissions inventories were significantly inaccurate so as to discredit the modeling results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA disagrees with this comment that the UAM modeling demonstration for DFW is flawed. Due to the large number of factors that influence ozone formation, the EPA agrees that the UAM model cannot precisely predict the exact relationship between VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and ozone. However, if the model performs within certain bounds of accuracy, the EPA believes that the model can and should be used to develop the attainment strategy since Congress clearly intended that photochemical grid modeling be used to form the basis of a control strategy plan. The EPA has established general criteria to evaluate the relative accuracy of a given modeling demonstration, and believes that models that meet those criteria are accurate enough to form the basis of the attainment strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA's ``Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model'' generally requires that three episodes with acceptable model performance be used in the attainment demonstration. Because Texas had three episodes which exhibited acceptable performance, Texas' attainment modeling is fully consistent with the EPA's requirements. In addition, the EPA's model performance criteria apply to each individual episode rather than across episodes. Therefore, it is inaccurate to conclude that the model was 75 percent accurate because only three of the four episodes exhibited acceptable model performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA disagrees with the comment that the emissions inventories were too inaccurate to produce acceptable modeling results. The EPA evaluated the State's 1990 base year emissions inventories and a final approval was published in the FR on November 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

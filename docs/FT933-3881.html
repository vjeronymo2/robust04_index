			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Clinton hails accord as 'shining moment of hope' THE US formally announced that it would renew its contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday, opening the way for PLO and Israeli leaders to sign an historic peace agreement at the White House on Monday. The announcement followed the signature earlier by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, of a letter recognising the PLO as representing the Palestinian people. Mr Rabin signed the letter after receiving a similar letter from Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, recognising Israel's right to exist in peace and security and renouncing the use of terrorism. Mr Rabin said he was prepared to meet Mr Arafat but he ruled out the possibility of attending Monday's ceremony. Immediately after signing the letter of recognition Mr Rabin said: 'It's an historic moment that hopefully will bring about an end to 100 years of bloodshed, misery between the Palestinians and Jews.' He said the agreement was only the first step towards a comprehensive Middle East peace. 'It's only the beginning but a tremendous, important beginning,' said the former general flanked during a televised ceremony by Mr Peres and Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister who played a critical role bringing the two sides together. Hundreds of excited Palestinians later demonstrated in favour of the agreement in occupied Arab east Jerusalem and, in an unprecedented event, unfurled the banned Palestinian flag over the stone battlements of Jerusalem's old city. In Gaza thousands of Palestinians danced on the streets, celebrating the accord and shook hands with Israeli soldiers. At the White House ceremony on Monday, Israeli and Palestinian representatives are expected to sign a further agreement outlining arrangements for setting up a Palestinian administration in the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said he hoped also to reach a peace agreement with Jordan next week to complete a 'triangle' of peaceful Israeli-Palestinian-Jordanian coexistence which 'would change the entire fabric of the Middle East.' President Bill Clinton, announcing the US decision to resume contacts with the PLO, described the agreement between Israel and the PLO as 'a shining moment of hope for the people of the Middle East and, indeed, of the entire world.' He said the US would 'continue to be a full and active partner in the negotiations that lie ahead to ensure that this promise of progress is realised.' In an attempt to build support for the peace pact, he telephoned Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Lebanese President Elias Hrawi. The US broke off the dialogue it had begun with the PLO two years earlier after a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv in 1990. Mr Clinton said yesterday that the resumption of dialogue was justified by the PLO's commitment to accept Israel's right to exist in peace and security; to renounce terrorism; to take responsibility for the actions of its constituent groups; to discipline those groups which violated the new commitments; and to nullify parts of its charter denying Israel's right to exist. While the US decision stops short of according full diplomatic recognition to the PLO, it is expected to lead to the re-opening of PLO representative offices in the US and will certainly allow PLO leaders to enter the US for Monday's signing ceremony. It led to an immediate meeting in Tunis between US and PLO diplomats at which the US formally invited a PLO delegation to Washington for the signing. Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, is expected to sign for his government, but it was not yet clear yesterday who would represent the PLO. Mr Mahmoud Abbas, head of the PLO's political affairs department, was one possibility. The ceremony is also expected to be attended by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister and Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister. Invitations have been extended to former US presidents and secretaries of state, including Mr James Baker, who was the chief architect of the Middle East peace talks, the framework for which he achieved in eight shuttles to the region starting immediately after the end of the Gulf war. In Jerusalem, right-wing demonstrators outside the prime minister's office branded the peace agreement as treason. Several hundred protesters banged metal cans and signs. Palestinian rejectionists on the PLO executive comittee similarly branded Mr Arafat a traitor and there was a demonstration against him in Gaza. But despite this the Palestinian leader's popularity appeared to be increasing in much of the occupied territories, especially in the West Bank, and PLO leaders meeting in Tunis last night approved the agreement which the organisation is expected to sign in Washington on Monday. The deal gives Palestinians limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

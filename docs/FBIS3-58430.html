			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cesar Camacho: "The `Dance' of the Generals"] </F>   [Excerpts] The minister of defense will have to choose a  new Armed Forces Chief of Staff (CEMGFA) to replace Soares  Carneiro, who is leaving that post on 25 January. The method  prescribed for choosing his successor requires that profiles of  the general officers be previously drafted. This applies to Army  Chief of Staff Cerqueira Rocha, Defense Policy Director  Goncalves Ribeiro, and the head of the Portuguese Military  Mission in NATO, Gabriel Espirito Santo. These last two men are  Army officers.    In the Navy, Admiral Fuzeta de Ponte is the leading  candidate  for the four gold stars, representing the highest level  achievable in a military career. Those next at the starting gate  might be Admirals Moreira Rato and Machado da Silva. The latter  was passed over in favor of Fuzeta de Ponte at the time of the  appointment of the Naval Chief of Staff.    The leading choice within the ranks of the Portuguese Air  Force (FAP) is obviously its current commander, Narciso Mendes  Dias. Not so obvious is whether its second candidate will be  chosen from this branch. The FAP Council of Generals might well  repeat the earlier action that put General Soares Carneiro in  his post as CEMGFA, when it included an Army officer as one of  the two candidates it proposed. Based on this model, there would  then be the possibility of a third recommendation from the Army,  in the person of Goncalves Ribeiro.    Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira has announced a  proposal that the government amend the Defense and Armed Forces  Law prior to the end of the year. The changes envisioned would  modify the mechanisms for appointing the military commanders in  chief. However, because the legislative calendar is so crowded,  it will be hard to get this proposal on the agenda of the  Assembly of the Republic, where it will require the approval of  a majority of two-thirds of the deputies, for debate.    As of the date of General Soares Carneiro's retirement from  this post, it will be filled on an interim basis by Admiral  Fuzeta de Ponte, the General Staff chief who has served the  longest. Fernando Nogueira is known to oppose lengthy interim  appointments, particularly when basic changes are being made to  the military structure.    On the basis of this information, the minister of defense  himself has admitted that the next appointment of an Armed  Forces commander will still come under the provisions of the  current law. It therefore will fall to each military branch to  submit to the Council of Commanders and the minister the names  of two general officers, making a total of six. From this group,  the minister will choose the individual whose name will be  submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers, first, and  to the president of the Republic subsequently.  <H5>  Different Readings </H5>   This provision of the law requiring that each military  branch  submit the names of two three- or four-star generals for  consideration by the government is not interpreted in the same  way by all of the military. According to one interpretation,  regarded as "typically corporative" in some circles, says that  the higher councils in each branch always prefer a choice from  that branch. The Navy chooses naval personnel, the FAP chooses  pilots, the Army chooses from among its own, and the final  choice is regarded as a victory for the branch represented.    According to the other interpretation, which is supported by  certain general officers, reliance is placed in the choice  process solely on "command records, technical abilities, and  diplomatic skills." This means that nothing would prevent the  naval commanders from voting for their counterparts in the Air  Force or the Army, and vice versa.    In the case pertaining to the choice of Soares Carneiro's  successor now under discussion, the present indicators justify  the assumption that the FAP is the military branch least eager  for the four gold stars the CEMGFA post entails, while the Navy  makes no secret of its advocacy of the principle of rotation  among the branches.    An officer on Fuzeta de Ponte's staff made the following  statement. "It has been 30 years now since the highest post in  the Armed Forces has been held by a naval officer. This might  create the impression that we do not have qualified people." In  fact, in the post-25 April era, the post was shared by the Army  and the Air Force. General Ramalho Eanes took over the post of  CEMGFA for himself when he was president of the Republic, and it  then went to Air Force General Lemos Ferreira, and later to  Soares Carneiro, of the Army.  <H5>  The Classic Model </H5>   Technically, all three- and four-star generals are eligible.  The four-star generals are now serving as the commanders in  chief of the branches (Fuzeta de Ponte, Mendes Dias, and  Cerqueira Rocha), and as president of the Supreme Military  Tribunal (Admiral Ceregeiro).    The practice to date has been for each branch to choose its  commander and his deputy as its nominees. An exception occurred  precisely with the appointment of the present CEMGFA. In that  instance, the Air Force broke away from the classic model by  including the name of Army General Soares Carneiro on its list  instead of its deputy commander.    There is nothing to prevent this precedent from being  repeated, nor to bar the Navy from setting its sights on a more  distant target. Continued control of the CEMGFA by the Army,  which is more than an academic hypothesis, may depend on whether  the Air Force decides to include the name of General Goncalves  Ribeiro on its list.    If this scenario should be realized, the minister would have  to choose from a group including three Army generals, two naval  officers, and one from the Air Force. Fernando Nogueira would  certainly not fail to welcome the implicit suggestion made by  the FAP. This is the branch that will have to work very closely  with the Army in the next three years, mainly because of the  rebellion of the Airborne Brigade, and the creation of the Army  Aviation Group.    Fernando Nogueira's advisers at the Ministry of Defense are  saying that it is still too early to comment on the choice to be  made. One thing is certain--the minister will not fail to heed  the opinion of the outgoing chief. Just as he will listen to the  generals nominated by each branch individually. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Gabriel Espirito Santo </H5>   Gabriel Augusto do Espirito Santo received his promotion to  the rank of general on 23 January 1991. In April of that year,  he was appointed to serve as Portugal's permanent representative  on the NATO Military Committee in Brussels. A man of 57, he is a  member if the group of generals who know the Army best. The  posts he has held in the most recent years of his career, have  provided him with skills in the areas of military doctrine and  geostrategy. These skills are also the foundations for becoming  a noted analyst of the political aspects of military and defense  issues.    Espirito Santo is a member of the NATO Defense College, is  experienced in the planning of forces, and has qualified in all  of the General Staff disciplines and the command and leadership  courses. He has already been instructed to return to Lisbon at  the beginning of January. The appointment of his successor in  Brussels will have greatly to do with what turmoil develops in  the Armed Forces when General Soares Carneiro is succeeded by  another officer.    As Gabriel Espirito Santo leaves Brussels, it is highly  probable that the operational command of the Army will be  entrusted to him. The CEMGFA post is not in his future plans.    Since he is the chief advisor to Minister Fernando Nogueira,  it is quite likely that Soares Carneiro will be the director  general of defense policy in the future if his strategy with  regard to his successor has sufficient weight. That post is  currently held by General Goncalves Ribeiro, who is also in a  position to be included on the list of six nominees Nogueira  will read. It is certain that although he is not a candidate for  the post of CEMGFA, Gabriel Espirito Santo has a place on the  board on which the game of choosing a successor is being played.  <H5>  Octavio Cerqueira Rocha </H5>   Octavio Gabriel Calderon de Cerqueira Rocha will be on the  list of recommendations that the Army will make submit to the  minister of defense. The general won his fourth silver star when  he was appointed to serve as Army Chief of Staff (CEME) on 12  October 1992, when he was 60. Two months ago, his only desire  was to continue his reorganization work in the Army. But the  vacancy in Restelo is calling more loudly.    If the government chooses to keep the highest command post  in  the Armed Forces in the hands of the land branch, Cerqueira  Rocha leads the list of probable choices to succeed Soares  Carneiro. An enviable career in the command and leadership areas  and his short term of service as CEME speak well for him.    He is sufficiently qualified technically, and he enjoys a  reputation as a "good negotiator." And he is a man with a great  capacity for human relationships. "He is a person for whom  friendship is a sacred value," says one of his comrades from his  Academy days. But the post under consideration is the most  political of any on the top military leadership level.    Cerqueira Rocha comes from a family with a tradition of  career military service on the paternal side and connections  with arts and letters on the maternal side. The general did not  feel that he shared the talent of his grandfather, Leandro  Calderon, a painter, nor that of his granduncle, Carlos  Calderon, who was one of the founders of the Portuguese Authors  Society. A career in the military won out.    The only things against him would be factors outside his own  personality or professional qualifications. Among these is the  fact that he has headed the Army for just a little over a year,  a term of service he launched with his own three-year program.  <H5>  Antonio Fuzeta de Ponte </H5>   Antonio Carlos Fuzeta de Ponte is 58 years old, and he has  been Chief of the Naval General Staff since 4 March 1991. He was  born in Setubal in 1934, and enrolled in the Naval School at the  age of 18, fleeing the family's dedication to the legal  sciences. While he was still at home, the family pointed him  toward architecture as a career. He also enrolled in the  Conservatory of Music, an experience from which he retains a  love of the piano. He was in Brussels serving as head of the  Portuguese mission to NATO when he was appointed to the number  one post in the Navy.    He has already survived some tribulations in that branch,  both before and after becoming its commander in chief. An  interesting episode is recounted in a short biographical sketch  written by Rosa Pedroso Lima (EXPRESSO). When Fuzeta de Ponte  was serving as civil governor of Setubal in 1977, Valentina  Tereshkova, the only woman astronaut in the then USSR, came to  Setubal as a guest of the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party]. The  sponsors of the event wanted the flag of the USSR hoisted  alongside the national banner, but Fuzeta de Ponte ruled that  this would not be allowed. He was harshly criticized, but  passions eventually cooled.    The most inflammatory incident since he took command of the  Navy occurred recently in the Higher National Defense Council.  General Carlos Azeredo, head of the Military Household of the  President, berated him aloud because of his failure to promote  Commander Homem de Gouveia, his subordinate in Belem. Azeredo  accused him of bending to the will of the political authorities.  His peers say that "Fuzeta has his faults, like everyone. He may  be a vain man, but a stooge he is not! He is disciplined and  competent." It is beyond question that he is fighting for the  post of CEMGFA, from which the Navy has been excluded for many  years now.  <H5>  Narciso Mendes Dias </H5>   Narciso Mendes Dias is a native of Vila de Rei, and will be  58 years old in September. He has been the Air Force Chief of  Staff (CEMFA) since November of 1991, when the minister of  defense decided not to reappoint General Conceicao e Silva. He  is a man who enjoys esteem within the FAP. If any reservations  exist, they are to be found in certain sectors of the Parachute  Troops Corps, which accuse him of "not having tried" to prevent  the transfer of this unit to the Army.    Mendes Dias has succeeded in calming the protesters by  invoking the principle to the effect that national interests  override those of a personal and corps nature. And he has  continued his frequent praise of the military contribution made  by the parachute troops, which he says has added to the prestige  of the Air Force.    His involuntary venture into the corridors of politics  during  the inflammatory days of the revolution failed to shake his  confidence. When in October 1974, at the age of 39, he was  called away from the Nacala Air Field, where he was in command,  to join the National Salvation Council and to serve as the Air  Force Chief of Staff, he accepted. He said that his only  commitment "was to the country and to the military  establishment." A short time afterward, Costa Gomes, who was  then the president of the Republic, dismissed him, citing "lack  of political confidence" as his reason. He is the general least  eager to win the Restelo post for himself. Whenever he has the  opportunity, he tells the minister that "you cannot make an  omelet without eggs." He commands the newest military  branch--that which, to a certain extent, is serving as a model  for the modernization of the Armed Forces.</p>

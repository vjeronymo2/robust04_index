			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: P-E Intl shares decline 12% after tumble to Pounds 160,000 SHARES IN P-E International fell by 12 per cent yesterday, from 58p to 51p, after the management and computer consultancy group revealed a sharp contraction in profits before tax last year and omitted the final dividend. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 160,000 from Pounds 1.62m in 1991 when the outcome was depressed by a Pounds 541,000 exceptional item. The latest results reflected the difficult market for management consultancy and the cost of reshaping the business. Turnover increased Pounds 71.1m (Pounds 68.8m) but operating profits fell to Pounds 572,000 (Pounds 2.56m) reflecting higher selling and administration expenses of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 16.6m) including a Pounds 343,000 pension charge and a Pounds 100,000 write-down of property which has since been sold. Losses per share were 0.22p (earnings 4.9p); the passed final leaves the total at 1p (6.2p). Since taking over as chairman in May, Mr George Cox has instituted a wide-ranging business review and reorganisation of the group and its senior management. Commenting on the results he acknowledged that the level of profits were 'not what the company would like to have achieved,' but said that the third quarter of last year represented 'probably the lowest point of the recession as far as P-E is concerned' and was followed by a stronger final quarter. During the year several small businesses acquired or created in recent years were sold or closed. Aside from recording operating losses of Pounds 427,000 on these businesses, a Pounds 524,000 extraordinary loss, reflecting goodwill previously written off to reserves, was recorded on the disposal of Applied Skills for Management which was sold back to its former owner. While some new businesses have been successfully turned around, other areas are still under review, including Westvries, the group's Netherlands subsidiary, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 394,000 last year. The group has been attempting to develop its overseas revenue as part of its efforts to generate new long term contracts and longer-term revenue sources. Last year, after above-the-line costs of about Pounds 750,000, Mr Cox said 'substantial progress' had been made towards this objective and the proportion of group revenues coming from outside the UK increased from 19 per cent to 27 per cent at the year end. Gearing rose from 22 per cent to 32 per cent and net borrowings increased from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 4m by the year-end. Subsequently borrowings have increased substantially, mainly because of corporation tax payments and the settlement of creditors.</p>

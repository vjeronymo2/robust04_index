			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Major General Nasr Yusuf Tells </F> AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Self-Rule Police's Problems Due to  Starvation and Spread of Specialized Gangs Phenomenon"]    [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Major General Nasr  Yusuf, commander of Palestinian security and police forces in  Gaza and Jericho, has said that the Palestinian police are  currently working in extremely difficult conditions because of  the huge shortage of resources. He added that no more than 10  percent of the required resources are available to the security  forces.    Despite all this, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in a statement to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- before his departure from Tunis, returning  to his work in Gaza, after submitting a comprehensive report to  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat about the security situation  in the self-rule areas -- that the security situation is good so  far and that the continuation of this situation depends on good  performance, the presence of institutions, and laying  foundations for democracy and political pluralism. He stressed  that democracy constitutes "the most important factor for  security, political, and economic stability."    Maj. Gen. Yusuf pointed out that the "more marked problems  facing the Palestinian police are basically the result of the  spread of starvation in the Gaza Strip. This has led to the  spread of the phenomenon of gangs specializing in illegal trade  like hashish, heroin, cocain, and arms."    Asked about the presence of large numbers of Palestinians in  Palestinian jails, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that there are attempts  by some quarters to exaggerate the number of Palestinian  prisoners. He stressed that the real figure does not exceed 20.  It "is not a large number," and most of the charges raised  against them are associated with drugs, arms trading, and  collaboration with Israel.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf categorically denied some quarters' rumors  that these prisoners are subjected to torture and repression.  He said that "all that has been said in this connection is  untrue." He invited observers and those interested in human  rights to visit Hamas member Hani al-'Abid, who was released  recently, to ascertain whether or not he was tortured. He  stressed that al-'Abid "was exposed to nothing that harms his  dignity or humanity."    On the extent of Hamas followers' cooperation with the  Palestinian police, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that "so far we can say  that it is possible to have cooperation between us and Hamas in  the future."    Asked about the truth of the accusations leveled at the  Palestinian police regarding its violation of mosques' sanctity  and harassment of worshipers, Maj. Yusuf said: "We have not  closed mosques nor prevented any worshiper from performing his  religious duty. Mosques are open day and night, and we have not  issued any instructions to do anything at any mosque. There is  a campaign against us from forces that do not want stability for  our people and are working to instigate Palestinian infighting  and thwart the self-rule experiment."    With regard to the issue of collecting the arms from people  and the Palestinian factions rejecting self-rule, he said: "We  have not requested the collection of arms, but, rather, the  control, licensing, and organization of the possession of arms.  So all citizens are required to seek a license for their arms,  because we, like any society in the world, can possess arms, but  within an organized framework lest the arms are used in an  unsound manner. So we are not talking about collecting arms, but  controlling them. As for the factions' arms, we have not  requested them to hand over their arms. We have requested that  [the possession of] these arms be organized."    On Israel's position on the Palestinians' and factions'  possession of arms, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said: "It is an internal  affair, because it concerns the organization of arms possession,  and Israeli society is full of arms."</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television How odd that Michael Buerk, whom I associate with really worthwhile reporting, has got himself enmeshed in 999 (9.40 BBC1). This is tabloid TV, tales of heroism and bravery re-enacted. Perhaps the powers that be see this as the way forward, the low-brow and down-market made more palatable by hauling in respected faces. Forty Minutes (9.50, BBC2) visits an army training camp in Australia where women volunteers learn not to sleep with their teddy-bears if they want to join 31 Platoon. Conceivably this is the first such programme to explore how Army training rescues a bunch of women from the decadence of civvy street and transforms them into disciplined, motivated, worthwhile human beings. Maiden Voyages (8.30 C4) is also about a woman rediscovering herself in Australia. A single-parent mum who brought up children in her teens on a Manchester council estate, flies to Australia and hires a motorbike. She rides across the outback and feels free and generally uplifted. Meanwhile on BBC2, Delia Smith finds fulfilment of a more traditional kind.</p>

Prime  Minister of the Srpska republic Vladimir Lukic and RSK Prime  Minister Djordje Bjegovic confirmed at a news conference that  the new dinar should be officially introduced into payment  operations, which will be unified among the Serbian lands in the  shortest possible time.    According to the latest information, the text of a protocol  has just been completed in Belgrade, to which, among others, the  National Bank of Yugoslavia has also given its consent. It is  thus expected that as of Monday the new dinar will also be the  official means of payment between Krajinas and the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia]. There will be no more postponements, as  this would incur great losses to both Krajinas.</p>

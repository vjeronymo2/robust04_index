RAFA'EL,  which developed the missile with Israel Aircraft Industries for  the Navy, is offering the ground-based version to a number of  countries, and it is estimated that several of them will  purchase it. In recent weeks, a number of very successful tests  of the Baraq missile were held, in the course of which it  destroyed a Gabriel missile. According to foreign reports, Chile  has also purchased the naval version of the "Baraq". At the same  time, "RAFA'EL" is engaged in the development of a ground-based  version, in which the missile is not mounted on a missile boat  but on a large truck (See photograph [not  reproduced]). This system is arousing great interest,  because it is the first one in the world that is based on a  missile that is capable of attacking fast-moving, low-level  targets. A model of the system will be presented for the first  time at the PIDAE [International Aerospace Fair] for defense  equipment, which will be held in March 1994 in Santiago, Chile.  The "Baraq" weighs 98 kg, is 2.1 meters long, and it is capable  of attacking targets such as airplanes and missiles at a  distance of 500 meters to 10 km.</p>

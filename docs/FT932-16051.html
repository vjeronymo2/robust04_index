			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early rise falters in a drab market INVESTMENT confidence suffered a fresh blow on the UK stock market yesterday when Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment group, added to the uncertainty hanging over the pharmaceuticals sector by announcing that it was ceasing development of an asthma treatment project. The news compounded the general discomfiture in the market, which abandoned an early attempt to recapture the Footsie 2,850 mark to close several points easier on the session. It was a drab day for equities, with weakness in stock index futures also undermining sentiment. Shares opened firmly, helped by a better performance from Wall Street overnight, but the Footsie peaked at 2,850.1 when stock index futures opened lower. The June contract on the Footsie lost its nearest support level and remained lower throughout the day. Renewed pressure on BAT Industries, as UK analysts weighed the implications of the cigarette price war opened by Philip Morris, of the US, also depressed the mood. The Fisons news was taken very badly. 'This is a major blow to Fisons - very bad news indeed,' summed up the general view. While some see Fisons as a bid prospect now, others took yesterday's news as yet another blow to a pharmaceuticals sector which has grossly underperformed the broader market this year. At worst, the market was down by 10.2 on the FT-SE 100 scale at 2,828.6. A modest recovery set in when the Dow Average came in with an early gain of 12 in the new Wall Street session but there was little change in sentiment. Scant attention was paid to the announcement of improved UK car sales in March. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,832.2 with a loss of 6.6 on the session. Traders sounded disheartened by the day's performance, which revived fears that the UK equity market, having run ahead strongly at the beginning of the year, must now await more convincing evidence of economic recovery if it is to justify its current ratings. Seaq volume improved slightly to 538.4m shares, after Monday's 438.7m that produced retail business worth just above the Pounds 1bn total which has become the lowest level acceptable to the London-based securities industry. The unimpressive performance by the blue chip leaders was mirrored by that of the second liners. At a final reading of 3,087.4, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was off 3.4. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up about 66 per cent of total equity volume yesterday, just above recent daily averages. There were signs that investors were returning to the policy of moving into solid yielding defensive stocks - water issues provided one of the few firm sectors. Store shares, on the other hand, slipped lower as the chances of a cut in UK base rates appeared as distant as ever. Only a move to reduce rates in Germany can now set the stage for lower base rates, according to analysts in the London market. For the present, UK equities have distanced themselves from the firmness shown both by sterling and UK government bonds. Strong gains in oil shares, ascribed to US buying, had mixed implications for the UK stock market, which has largely taken a negative stance on the sector.</p>

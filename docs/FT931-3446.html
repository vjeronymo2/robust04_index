			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Government admits defeat over contracting-out case THE government has conceded defeat in a court case over the contracting out of public services after legal advice that EC employment legislation which protects the jobs, terms and conditions of staff transferred to the private sector applies more widely than previously thought. The decision comes after a union campaign against contracting out of public services which has in the past led to job cuts and inferior employment terms. The decision to concede defeat has angered contractors which believe that the government will find further progress on contracting out stalled. 'The government has effectively thrown in the towel,' said Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman of Clause 26, a contractors' pressure group. Mr Davis-Coleman said this could mean that Tupe, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981, the legislation which implements EC laws in the UK, will be applied to all public-sector contracts. 'It makes a nonsense of the government's entire market-testing and privatisation programme,' he added. Ministers believe the decision could make it harder for existing staff to bid for their work in future programmes of contracting-out. If the jobs, pay and conditions of staff are protected, there would be no need to invite an in-house bid from the staff. The court case was over a decision by South Glamorgan health authority to contract out the canteens of three hospitals in Cardiff. The health service union Cohse applied for a judicial review over the failure of the authority to apply Tupe. Due to be heard next week, the case has been halted on the instructions of the Welsh Office, after legal advice that the Tupe regulations applied to the contract. Government lawyers are negotiating with Cohse over costs and other details. Ministers accept most contracting out of public services will be covered by the legislation after attempts to have the EC exclude contracting out foundered. Mr Padraig Flynn, EC commissioner for social affairs, said on BBC-TV's On The Record there was no wish to amend the Acquired Rights Directive: 'It must be remembered that we are concerned about the protection of workers and their rights.' Confusion over the scope of the legislation has delayed the government's market-testing programme under which almost Pounds 1.5bn of Civil Service work has been put out to tender. Notices of dismissal to 180 employees of the computing and financial services arm of four London boroughs were rescinded yesterday after the company accepted that the Tupe regulations applied.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER FINDS SCIENCE FAIR A METAPHOR FOR 5TH-GRADERS' LIVES  </P> <P> At the beginning of May, the Science Fair loomed for all of the fifth-grade  classes at Kelly School. According to the rules, the children could form teams  of their own choosing or work alone. Each team or child would choose a topic,  such as dinosaurs or water power.  </P> <P> Finally, each would construct a demonstration, to fit on a table in one of the  gyms for the climactic event, the fair itself.  </P> <P> Part of the plan was to get parents involved. Chris sent home letters, in  English on one side and in Spanish on the other, asking that the parents help  their children with the demonstrations.  </P> <P> Every day during May, Chris gave her students an hour or more to get ready for  the fair.  </P> <P> Many early signs weren't good.  </P> <P> During an early rehearsal, Kimberly, who teamed up with Courtney, told Chris,  "We're gonna put these foods on the table and tell 'em what the things are.  </P> <P> "OK. You have foods on your table," said Chris to the two girls. "Someone comes  by at the fair. What are you going to tell them?"  </P> <P> "Like, this is a potato?" said Kimberly.  </P> <P> "Everyone's going to know what a potato is!" said Chris.  </P> <P> "Like what foods nourish your body?" said Courtney hopefully.  </P> <P> Chris questioned the team of Irene and Mariposa. "Are you just going to have a  bunch of rocks in front of you?"  </P> <P> "We're going to get a lot of rocks from around my house," said Irene. "And  figure out their environment. Like whether they came from a desert. . . ."  </P> <P> "Their environment? Rocks don't have an environment, and I doubt any around  your house came from a desert." Chris' eyes got very wide. "You're going to  have to be more specific."  </P> <P> But there were exceptions, and the most exceptional was Claude.  </P> <P> Chris was astonished. Claude joined up with Pedro and Jimmy.  </P> <P> Chris had to insist that Claude's partners do some of the work. Claude was  clearly the leader. She asked the three boys to describe their project, and  Claude piped up: "It's gonna be like on streams and rivers and how they form.  How they move." Talking fast, shaking a hand furiously, Claude described all  this while Chris ran her tongue around the inside of her mouth, suppressing her  smile.  </P> <P> "That's very good, Claude! I like what I'm hearing!" They were down in the  library. Chris turned to the aide there and said, "Would you help these boys  find some more books on streams and rivers?"  </P> <P> "And ponds and lakes!" declared Claude.  </P> <P> Later, she overheard Claude say to a classmate, "I'm gonna work on my science  project every night!" The next week, he described again for Chris, in  remarkable detail, the birth of rivers.  </P> <P> To the class in general, Chris said, "I hope some of you are as well versed on  your projects as Claude."  </P> <P> For a moment, Chris wondered, "Did I really just say that?"  </P> <P> This was the boy who, a month ago, when Mrs. Zajac was putting the heat on him,  said he felt mixed up and wanted to go home. Now he raced around, making a  chart for his project. The chart was incredibly neat.  </P> <P> Among a generally disappointing bunch of written science reports, Claude's  looked pretty good.  </P> <P> High-pitched voices echoed in the gym. The end of May had arrived, and the fair  had begun. The noise was like one unremitting, collective scream, which could  only get worse, because to converse in the gym one had to add to the clamor by  shouting.  </P> <P> "Today," Chris predicted, "will be a four-Tylenol day."  </P> <P> Chris decided to look at the projects from other classes first. She found a  pretty good water wheel on one table. At the next table a boy from another  class sat, looking hopeful, behind an exhibit that consisted of a rose, still  encased in cellophane and planted in the top of an empty soda can.  </P> <P> "What's your project on?" shouted Chris. She leaned across the table, cupping  an ear to catch the reply.  </P> <P> "Flowers," said the boy, nodding earnestly.  </P> <P> She visited another boy, from another class, who said his project was on  electricity. "It comes from plugs," he explained.  </P> <P> Chris felt a secret relief. She had awakened one night not long ago imagining  children from other classes standing behind wonderful homemade rocket ships and  expounding on physics, while her students explained to fair-goers, "This is a  potato" and "These are rocks."  </P> <P> Chris told herself now: "At least I don't feel too embarrassed. Mine aren't any  worse than anyone else's."  </P> <P> But then she stopped at Jorge's table, and her amusement began to wane.  </P> <P> Jorge, from her low math group, often looked exhausted. He had tried to do a  science project, a model of a laser made out of colored paper, an electric  light, and a cardboard box. Jorge had gotten the idea from a book. He'd  followed all the instructions, he told Mrs. Zajac.  </P> <P> "But it doesn't work," he said. Jorge had been heard to say a few days before,  "I can't get too much help at home." An understatement. The floors of his  family's apartment were covered with their dog's excrement. He wore the same  clothes day in and day out, and even now, standing across the table from him.  Chris could smell the sad odor, like rotting fruit.  </P> <P> Arnie's father had arrived. Chris smiled broadly. She extended her hand.  Arnie's father clasped it shyly. Chris noticed that his pants were torn and  dirty. An unmistakable, sweetish odor of liquor came from him. It was only  about 10 in the morning. Chris visited Arnie's table. On it lay a store-bought  example of an electric switch. Arnie smiled at her.  </P> <P> Other parents had arrived.  </P> <P> There, behind her homemade model of the solar system sat Arabella, smiling  sweetly, looking chipper and healthy and confident, telling the judges all the  names of the planets, their approximate distances from the sun, the main  characteristics of each.  </P> <P> And there, in his electrician's uniform, moving from table to table and  correcting the mistaken notions of the various children who had done projects  on electricity, was the explanation for the care behind Arabella's project and  for the progress that Arabella had made this year -- Arabella's father.  </P> <P> Alice's father wore a necktie and blue blazer. The team of Alice, Judith and  Margaret had done electrical generation. Alice's father had taken them to the  Holyoke water power plant a few days ago. Through a friend he'd arranged a  special tour for the girls. Their display, a model town on a large piece of  plywood, didn't show how power got generated, but it was the nicest-looking  project in the gym.  </P> <P> Chris questioned them. The girls knew their stuff. Chris chatted briefly with  Alice's father. She thanked him for helping his daughter and her friends so  much.  </P> <P> She meant those words.  </P> <P> But she couldn't look around the gym now without feeling sad. The children  whose parents had come to the gym -- for the most part neatly dressed,  confident-seeming adults -- had the best projects and knew the most about their  subjects.  </P> <P> In general, the forlorn projects belonged to the children with no parents on  hand, such as Courtney and Kimberly, who stood behind a table displaying a box  of oatmeal, a hamburger bun, a piece of white  </P> <P> bread, a carton of milk, an egg, two potatoes and a remnant of iceberg lettuce  growing brown.  </P> <P> Chris wished she could call a halt right now.  </P> <P> The whole event looked like a rigged election, distressingly predictable, as if  designed to teach the children about the unfairness of life.  </P> <P> She saw one bright spot, though. There was some room in an unfair world for  individual achievement. She walked up to Claude's table.  </P> <P> She felt rescued from this day, for a brief time, when she looked at what  Claude had done: on the table, his thorough and neat diagram of a river rising  in mountains and flowing to the sea; and behind that, Claude's model river. He  had built his model on a metal serving platter. Little stones were piled up at  one end, from which a chute of aluminum foil descended, depicting a waterfall,  which led to the river itself, which had banks described by more small stones  and a bed of aquarium gravel, and water, too.  </P> <P> In the water lay a little rubber crayfish and a little rubber fish, which if  you squeezed it (as Claude would for fair-goers) spawned several smaller rubber  fish from its nether end. She'd never dared to hope for this much from him. And  the best was still to come.  </P> <P> "All right, Claude," she shouted over the din, "tell me about rivers."  </P> <P> And Claude, who for six months hadn't managed to complete more than a few  homework assignments, delivered a lucid description, even better than during  rehearsals, of the birth of rivers.  </P> <P> He seemed to know enough to talk all morning. Chris had to move along. "OK,"  she said. "Thank you, Claude."  </P> <P> Hazy sunlight filtered through the gym's high, frosted windows. The noise,  sharp and concentrated, made her feel as if her hands were vibrating, like  tuning forks.  </P> <P> Chris looked around. Where was Robert?  </P> <P> Robert had come to school this morning without his science project, saying that  he had left it at a convenience store. The counselor had taken him to fetch the  project. Chris had told Robert that when he got back, he should come down to  the gym right away. But he was nowhere in sight.  </P> <P> Chris sent Courtney back to the classroom to see if Robert was there. Courtney  returned in a few minutes.  </P> <P> "Robert says he's not comin,' " she said.  </P> <P> Chris lowered her eyebrows. "Oh, he isn't, is he."  </P> <P> From "Among Schoolchildren," by Tracy Kidder. Copyright, 1989, by John Tracy  Kidder.

She didn't especially like Robert. On the day of  Kelly's science fair, she would learn how badly she had failed Robert.  </P> <P> </P></p>

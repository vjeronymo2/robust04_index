			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (1): A watershed in economic development - Chile's success is equated with high growth and hefty capital gains - policymakers now seek to scale down expectations without losing investor confidence. Although the country has not yet achieved full democracy, the December elections may prove a landmark NINE years of consecutive growth, topped by the best overall performance in Latin America last year, have brought Chile to a watershed in its economic development. The country which pioneered so many of the reforms now galvanising Latin America - the export-led strategy for growth, privatisation, debt-equity swaps and private pension funds - is now confronting the limitations of its chosen model of development and the social and environmental costs of success. Politically, too, 1993 will be a landmark. Presidential and congressional elections in December will restore the democratic succession broken by the 1973 coup which toppled the late Dr Salvador Allende. President Patricio Aylwin, elected in 1989 after 16 years of military rule, will have thus fulfilled his main ambition: to revive Chile's democratic institutions and bequeath power to an elected successor. Economic continuity undoubtedly played a role in Chile's smooth transition from dictatorship to democracy. But without Mr Aylwin's negotiating skills and the cohesion of his government, Chile would not be basking in the prosperity and political stability it enjoys today. So stable is it that seven months ahead of general elections it is already a foregone conclusion that the ruling coalition, the Concertacion, will form the next government and that Senator Eduardo Frei, a Christian democrat like Mr Aylwin, son of a popular statesman of the 1960s, will be Chile's next president. The country's economic fortunes are less easy to predict. The days of exponential export growth and huge capital gains are probably over. Finance ministry officials are predicting that Chile will feel the pain of the international recession this year. Export revenues are expected to grow by a 'modest' (in Chilean terms) 7 per cent in 1993 to about Dollars 10.6bn, compared with almost 12 per cent in 1992. Traditional exports - copper, fish meal and cellulose - are being hit by a slump in international commodity prices. The global downturn has affected Chile's cellulose producers in particular; they had recently invested more than Dollars 1.5bn in new state-of-the-art pulp mills. Most of the mills are currently operating at a loss. Further expansion plans have been shelved. The Dollars 1bn-a-year fresh fruit business, where exports have doubled since 1987, is facing trade barriers in Europe and stiff competition from other southern hemisphere producers such as Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa. Fedefruta, the fruit growers association, says it is exporting apples and kiwi fruit to the European Community this year at a 'suicidal loss'. It has called for a halt in shipments. The most dynamic area of export growth - an eclectic mix of manufactured goods and new products such as jeans, shoes, wine, fresh salmon and exotic flowers - is finding competition harder as a result of a 13 per cent revaluation of the peso since 1990. There are signs that exporters are already adapting to the tougher international environment by introducing new technologies and paring down costs. Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry, says that much of the 30 per cent increase in private sector investment last year went into modernising plants and improving productivity. Despite the diversification of Chile's exports, the global recession has exposed the vulnerability of the export-led model of growth. Exports now account for almost 30 per cent of GDP, but more than 70 per cent of foreign earnings are still commodity-based, and sensitive to the vagaries of international prices. Economists, however, see no alternative course for small countries such as Chile. 'We either pursue export-led growth or no growth at all,' says Mr Vial. This explains the importance Chile attaches to trade liberalisation, whether through multilateral forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or bilateral agreements. Chile has signed free trade accords (FTAs) with Mexico and Venezuela, and hopes free trade negotiations might soon begin with the US, its biggest trading partner. 'An FTA with the US would be our insurance policy against trade wars if the international environment deteriorates,' argues Mr Vial. Following last year's 10.4 per cent growth in GDP, which now borders Dollars 40bn, Chile's autonomous central bank is planning a soft landing for the economy. 'Such exceptional rates of growth are not sustainable over time,' says Mr Roberto Zahler, the bank's president. But shifting economic gear will require an important change in Chilean business culture. Bankers and entrepreneurs have grown accustomed to annual 30 per cent returns and more on assets. Stock prices in 1991 more than doubled in value. Santiago's wealthy suburbs are sprouting luxury condominiums and crawling with expensive imported cars. Yuppies are alive and well in Chile. In the minds of Chile's business elite, success is equated with high growth rates and hefty capital gains. This creates a problem for Chile's policy makers, who must now try to scale down expectations without provoking a loss of investor confidence. The central bank's president has scolded Chileans for being manic-depressives: a good economic year caused euphoria and self-adulation, but a single poor indicator was enough to plunge the entire establishment into terminal depression. He called for a more realistic assessment of Chile's strengths and shortcomings. The strengths arise from a consensus, now deeply ingrained in Chilean society, on economic fundamentals: the need to preserve macro-economic balances, to curb inflation, to keep government spending in check. The most heated discussions revolve around regulation, environmental protection and how to alleviate the poverty that still engulfs 4m Chileans - one third of the population. Chile should have a new capital markets law before the end of the year. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, calls it the 'deepest and most complete reform to the domestic capital markets' since the early 1980s. The law, which will widen the investment horizons of Chile's private pension funds and insurance companies, also includes tighter rules to prevent insider trading and other conflicts of interest. These provisions are hotly opposed by the financial community. Bankers are protesting against what they perceive as excessive regulation and the government's reluctance to sanction new lines of business - such as foreign branches, pension management and life insurance. Environmental issues are also climbing up the political agenda as the Aylwin administration makes incipient attempts to protect natural resources from excessive exploitation. The challenge here is not implementing legislation, but enforcing it. Conaf, the forestry commission, says it would need an army to police Chile's 7m hectares of virgin forests against the predatory action of wood-chippers (exports up 38 per cent last year to 3m tonnes). Fishing fleets resent the frequent bans imposed to safeguard stocks. Mining smelters are only now being forced to implement clean-up plans, and Santiago's reviled buses prefer to go on strike rather than convert to cleaner fuels. Poverty alleviation has been a main concern of President Aylwin's government. Tax reforms in 1990 raised an extra Dollars 800m in fiscal revenues to finance social projects: low-cost housing, health clinics, primary schools. Real wages have risen by 12 per cent since 1990 - and the minimum wage by 36 per cent in real terms. Pensions and family benefits have been improved. The government's social programmes, however, are in jeopardy. Mr Foxley has warned congressmen that if the present tax regime is not upheld, the unpopular task of cutting Dollars 800m of social expenditure from the 1994 budget will be their responsibility. There will be other political battles this year. Government attempts to reform the judiciary are far behind schedule. The judiciary is arguably the weakest link in Chile's new democracy - a Byzantine institution tainted by corruption and negligence in the defence of human rights. The government wants to dilute the power of Pinochet appointees to the supreme court by expanding the number of chief justices. It has also promised more resources and better pay to overworked magistrates, some of whom handle upwards of 5,000 cases at a time. Still pending are the length of the next presidential term - eight years if the constitution is not changed - and the electoral system, which heavily over-represents the right-wing opposition. The government has linked the two reforms in congressional debates. The government failed earlier this year to get an important package of constitutional reforms through congress. One important change would have abolished the nine non-elected senate seats (these senators were chosen by General Pinochet before he stepped down, to deprive the Concertacion of a majority in the upper house); another reform would have devolved the president's power to sack commanders-in-chief of the armed forces. The reforms failed because they struck at the heart of General Pinochet's political legacy. And while the Concertacion is committed to getting rid of the authoritarian fetters written into the military's 1980 constitution, the right defends the charter as Pinochet's proudest achievement. General Pinochet's power is also felt in the long arm of military courts (these can prosecute civilians for 'offences against the armed forces', a crime as broad as it is vague), and in the impunity army officers enjoy against the human rights violations of the dictatorship. 'We are far from having a full democracy,' President Aylwin admits, reviewing his three years in office. But however far from perfect, Mr Aylwin's tactful handling of the armed forces has eliminated the threat of another military coup. It will be the task of the next political generation to heal the wounds of the past.</p>

Its planned  capacity is 400,000 TV sets a year, and it will employ 160  persons, then 350 persons in 1995. Initially, the cathode ray  tubes will be supplied by European manufacturers. Beginning in  1995, they will be produced by the future plant for which Daewoo  recently laid the first stone at Longwy. These two units will  enable the Korean firm to strengthen its position in the  European markets, while shedding their label as "assembly  plants."</p>

The conference is scheduled for April 2 to coincide with a  city conference of the Russian Communist Party. According to  Chernyakhovsky, the initiative was supported by representatives  of the Union of Communists, the Russian Communist Workers'  Party, the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the  Lenin Opposition in the Russian Communist Party (Richard  Kosolapov). "The separation from the Russian Communist Party is  final," he said.    Meanwhile the Russian Communist Party headed by Gennadiy  Zyuganov gained 12 per cent of votes at the recent elections and  formed a major parliament faction, more orthodox parties and  organizations who called for boycotting the elections are  fighting for survival.    In the words of Chernyakhovskiy, there are two reasons for  differences between the Communist Party leadership and "other  Communists".    Firstly, in the opinion of orthodox communists, Zyuganov and  his associates "have taken a conciliatory stand, abandoned  communist principles and turned nationalistic". Secondly, the  Russian Communist Party does not want to be "part of the Soviet  Communist Party" and refuses to encourage double membership of  Communists in the two organizations.    Chernyakhovsky said the organizational committee will be  supported by no less than one fourth of Moscow rank-and-file  communists as well as many Communists in Russian regions. He  thinks it may become the basis for a single Communist  organization, an alternative to the Russian Communist Party.    "It is the apogee mutation of the left-wing communists,"  member of the Russian Communist Party's Central Executive  Committee Grigory Rebrov told ITAR-TASS today, commenting on the  organizational committee.    "It is a sectarian, left-wing force that has failed to unite  with the Communist movement and made the last step towards a  split. They have no future," he added.</p>

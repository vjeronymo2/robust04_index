			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- Statistics released by the  State Statistical Bureau showed that industry maintained steady  growth last April with state-owned industry stopping its slide  and registering a rebound to some extent. The trend of  stockpiling of products, worsening losses and acute shortage of  capital still go upwards.    The national industrial production was 20 percent up last  April over the same period last year and 1.4 percentage points  faster than the average growth in the previous three months. Of  the gain, state-owned industry made up five percent, collective  industry 31.4 percent and industry of other kinds 42.5 percent.    The rebound for state-owned industry in recent times is  mainly due to a slight lessening of short-term loans given to  enterprises by banks since last March. They played a role to  some extent in pushing forward enterprise production. Deep  seated contradictions suffered by state-owned enterprises,  however, still existed.    As the market demand is relatively insufficient, sales of  industrial products are far from ideal. The sales of industrial  products last April was 2.2 percentage points lower than the  growth in industrial production. The inventory of industrial  products tended to go upwards month by month as a result. The  value of stockpiled products by industry at the level of  township and above showed a net gain of RMB [Renminbi] 20.6  billion late last March over late last February. The inventory  of oil-bearing items, steel materials, some industrial chemicals  and electro-mechanical items registered a rise of 20 percent  over earlier this year. Shortage of capital, slow sales and  serious debt have not yet been alleviated.    Losses suffered by some enterprises tended to grow worse  mainly because of sluggish sales, stockpiling of products and  shortage of capital. There are to date some 25.7 percent of  enterprises running in the red with state-owned enterprises  making up 45 percent. Losses made by medium- and large-sized  state-owned enterprises last March was put at RMB 16.6 billion,  RMB 5.9 billion up from the previous two months.    State-owned industry showed relatively slow growth when  compared with the rapid gain of overall industry in spite of its  rise to some extent last April. State-owned industry finds it  difficult to stand stiff competition with some of them operating  under capacity. The number of enterprises either stopping  production or in a state of a semi-halt to production increased  while some of enterprises failed to pay wages, affecting  workers' living and doing harm to social stability.</p>

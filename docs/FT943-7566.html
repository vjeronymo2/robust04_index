			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Dairy trade to challenge new system for milk supply Britain's dairy trade is to challenge the government in court over its handling of the deregulation of the milk market, warning that retail prices could be forced up and thousands of jobs lost. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processors, said it was seeking a High Court judicial review because the government had allowed the creation of 'a monopoly supplier of milk without proper regulation or control'. The government gave the go-ahead to the Milk Marketing Board in June to set up a voluntary dairy farmers' co-operative, Milk Marque, to succeed it when the market is liberalised on November 1. Milk Marque has already signed up farmers supplying 65 per cent of milk in England and Wales and the dairy trade says this control over the market is allowing it to raise prices by up to 25 per cent under its auction-based selling system in preparation for the new regime. The federation said the price rises would cost dairy companies collectively some Pounds 250m a year, more than the industry's entire current annual profits. 'Consumers could see the prices of some dairy products rising by as much as 18 per cent, adding nearly 0.2 per cent to the retail price index,' said Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, federation president. Simultaneously, the two biggest dairy companies, Northern Foods and Unigate, warned their operating profits would be hit by the increase in costs, leading to job losses and a 2p increase in the price of a pint of milk. Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, said he would meet both sides in the dispute on Thursday. He did not rule out referring the new arrangements to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as the dairy trade is demanding. However, he said it was hard to tell if the present difficulties were 'more than the inevitable transitional strains, or whether they represent the misuse of marketing power by Milk Marque'. The federation, representing an industry with annual retail sales of Pounds 7bn and a workforce of 70,000, plans to seek leave for judicial review within the next two weeks. If it is granted, it hopes the hearing would take place by early October. The move brings fresh uncertainty to the timing of deregulation, which was scheduled for April 1. Concern last year from the European Commission and the dairy trade over the potential monopoly position of Milk Marque forced the Milk Marketing Board to amend its plans. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, yesterday accused the dairy companies of exaggerating the increases and said the largest rise  - for cheese manufacturers - was about 12 per cent. 'The prices we've arrived at have not been determined by us but by the bidding behaviour of the customers,' he added. 'They've indicated they're prepared to pay that amount.'

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers adopt a flexible image Computer screens which display three-dimensional graphics are relatively commonplace, but manipulating the image so that it can be viewed from the side or the top can involve complicated procedures with a keyboard or mouse. Japanese electronics company NEC has overcome the problem with a screen which is suspended from a flexible arm. By moving the screen - changing its angle or height - the angle or viewpoint of the image on the screen changes also. By physically moving the screen closer to the viewer the image is magnified; by moving the screen away the image decreases in size on the thin film transistor (TFT) display.

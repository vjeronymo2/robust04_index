			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYST REPORTS '88 STATE DEFICIT, SEES SAME IN '89  </P> <P> The Legislature's top budget analyst on Wednesday told the Assembly Ways and  Means Committee that the state not only ended the last fiscal year with a  deficit but also faces more red ink this year.  </P> <P> Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill, disputing contentions by Gov. George  Deukmejian that the state will show small surpluses each year, claimed that the  state ended the 1987-88 fiscal year with a $200-million deficit and probably  will finish the current budget year $126 million in the hole.  </P> <P> "We feel that you're banking on money that just is not going to be available,"  Hill warned the legislators, who are starting to review the governor's already  precariously balanced $47.8-billion budget proposal for the fiscal year  beginning July 1.  </P> <P> With the governor already proposing to balance spending in the new fiscal year  by making deep cuts in many health and welfare programs, Hill's assessment only  complicates the Legislature's problem. If she is right, the Legislature might  have to approve even deeper cuts in spending. Her assessment is in line with  earlier warnings of a deficit that were issued by Controller Gray Davis.  </P> <P> Later in the day, recently confirmed Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes backed up Hill's  contention that the state had a deficit last year, declaring that it could be  as high as $97 million.  </P> <P> Hayes, a Deukmejian appointee who took office Jan. 6, played down the  seriousness of the problem, attributing it to a difference in accounting  methods used by the Administration and other budget analysts.  </P> <P> Hayes, speaking at his first meeting as chairman of the Commission on State  Finance, said that since the state doesn't use a uniform method of accounting,  "we are always going to have differences between reporting agencies." But he  told reporters after the meeting that he thought the state's AAA credit rating  is secure. "I don't think the sky is falling," he said.  </P> <P> The commission, in a quarterly update of state revenues and expenditures,  disagreed that there would be a deficit in the current budget year. The panel  said it expects the state to end the current fiscal year $79 million in the  black. Deukmejian's budget anticipates ending the year with only $3 million in  reserve.  </P> <P> Gail Lyle, the commission's executive secretary, said she expects state tax  receipts to come in $366 million above Deukmejian Administration forecasts,  largely as a result of a healthier economy. She said the state may even be in  the unusual position, for such a tough budget year, of taking in $174 million  more in revenues than it can legally spend under an expenditure limit approved  by voters in 1974.  </P></p>

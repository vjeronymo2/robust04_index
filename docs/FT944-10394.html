			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / NZ party leader resigns The New Zealand political outlook changed dramatically early today when Mr Jim Anderton announced his surprise resignation as leader of the left wing Alliance party. Mr Anderton had been widely expected to lead the party, a grouping of left wing and green parties, to victory in the 1996 election. A former president of the Labour party, he resigned because of Labour's right wing economic policies in 1988, to form the Alliance. Until recently it had enjoyed top poll ratings among political parties. Mr Anderton's daughter committed suicide during last year's election campaign, and at a press conference today he said he wished he had resigned then. Mr Anderton said he would stay as MP until the next election and work for an Alliance victory.</p>

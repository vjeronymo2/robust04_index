			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MARROW-TECH TO RELOCATE IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Marrow-Tech, a New York-based biotechnology firm that has developed  laboratory-grown versions of human skin and bone marrow, is moving its  operations to San Diego, company officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Marrow-Tech has signed a five-year lease for a 20,000-square-foot facility in  the Calbiochem Center in La Jolla, said Arthur J. Benvenuto, the company's  president and chief executive officer. Marrow-Tech plans to complete its move  by the end of January.  </P> <P> The company will augment its staff of 20 employees, but Benvenuto declined to  say how many new workers Marrow-Tech will hire once the company relocates. He  said he is recruiting primarily research-and-development and manufacturing  technicians.  </P> <P> "We opted for San Diego because it's one of the major hotbeds of biotechnology  research in the country," said Dr. Ron Cohen, Marrow-Tech's vice president of  corporate and government affairs. "There are also several institutions, for  example UCSD and the Salk Institute, that are sensitive to the need of  nurturing companies like us. They also offer a great pool of talent that we can  draw from."  </P> <P> Marrow-Tech, founded in January, 1986, held its initial public stock offering  in June, 1988, raising $6 million, and has yet to generate revenue except for  interest income. Next year, the company will introduce its first line of  products: laboratory-grown human skin that will be used by manufacturers to  test cosmetics, drugs and chemicals.  </P> <P> Manufacturers have been under increasing pressure from animal-rights activists  to find alternatives to laboratory animals in conducting tests to determine  whether a product is safe for humans.  </P></p>

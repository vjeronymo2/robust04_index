			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Peanuts that cost peanuts It pays to have a sense of humour when you fly by Southwest Airlines, the Dallas-based carrier leading the low-cost revolution in US air travel. Herb Kelleher, the 62-year-old chairman, is a man who likes a joke, and encourages a similar attitude among his staff, writes Richard Tomkins. Flight attendants have been known to astonish passengers by concealing themselves in luggage lockers and springing out unexpectedly into the aisles. Passenger announcements are invariably tinged with levity ('Please be aware all seating is unassigned,' people are told as they board an aircraft in Dallas. 'Y'all sit yourselves anywhere, just like in church.') Southwest can afford to be funny. Indeed, as virtually the only US airline to have stayed consistently profitable over the past few years, it is laughing all the way to the bank. Stock market analysts are predicting it will increase pre-tax profits by more than 50 per cent to Dollars 140m in the year just ending - not a vast sum by US corporate standards, perhaps, but enough to make it the nation's most profitable airline. How is that an upstart like Southwest can make money while its bigger rivals prove so adept at losing it? The answer lies in its low cost structure. The airline specialises in short-haul, point-to-point services with frequent flights, no frills and fast turnrounds, and its workers are hard-working, flexible and enthusiastic. Result: its operating costs per available seat mile are 26 per cent lower than the average for the big carriers. That cost structure has translated into rock-bottom fares that have enabled Southwest to trounce the competition. Spreading across the south from its home territory in Texas, where it is easily the dominant carrier, it has become the biggest operator of flights within California and has driven American Airlines out of the short-haul market in the south-west. In September it began an assault on the north-east by offering flights on the Baltimore-Chicago and Baltimore-Cleveland routes at fares up to 85 per cent less than those available from existing oper-ators. Taking a flight by Southwest Airlines is a novel experience for passengers accustomed to elaborate checking-in rituals, fawning service and endless parades of drinks and meals. Southwest has quite deliberately trivialised the ritual, making it a bit like catching a bus but more fun. Passengers just turn up, and if they miss the aircraft, it doesn't matter, because there will be another one along in a minute. Refreshments might be limited to a bag of peanuts and a soft drink, but the light-hearted banter from Southwest's staff leaves most people feeling much better at the end of their journeys than any number of in-flight meals. Best of all, the flights are cheap. The low-fares strategy has proved highly addictive to the US consumer. People are not only deserting other airlines to fly by Southwest: they are also choosing to fly rather than drive, or to undertake journeys they might not otherwise have made. One question inevitably raised about the Southwest formula is whether its success will last. After all, people are bound to trade down in a recession. Maybe, as the US economy picks up, passengers will want to pay more and go back to the old-fashioned levels of service traditionally associated with air travel. But not even Southwest's bigger rivals believe that. They openly acknowledge that Southwest and its ilk have changed US flying habits for good. According to American Airlines, most passengers will now happily put up with lower levels of in-flight service if it means they can afford to spend another couple of days at their desti-nation. 'Basically, the American public is saying: 'Strap me in that metal tube and get me there for 59 bucks,' ' the company says. Or as Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, told a US newspaper: 'Even the wealthy are concluding that they should buy a lower-priced ticket on Southwest and use the difference to buy a eucalyptus tree for their home.'</p>

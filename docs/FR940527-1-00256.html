			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Financing Policy Adjustment_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's capital update frame work includes a financing policy adjustment to account for the effects of changes in interest rates on hospital capital costs. In ProPAC's view, interest rate fluctuations should not be reflected in the market basket. If they were, such changes might lead to volatility in updates, overcompensation of hospitals in some circumstances, and undue risk for facilities at other times. Instead, ProPAC recommends an explicit adjustment to the capital update factor to account for significant changes in interest rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The financing policy adjustment reflects interest rate changes that might otherwise create a significant financial burden for hospitals, as well as those that would produce substantial reductions in capital costs. It would raise payments to compensate hospitals faced with disruptive effects of extreme interest rate increases and allow the Medicare program to share in some of the savings resulting from lower interest rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Though relatively high compared with short-term rates and in light of expected inflation, long-term interest rates are anticipated to remain stable through fiscal year 1995. The Commission believes it is not appropriate to adjust capital payments for forecasted changes in interest rates at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scientific and Technological Advances_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC recognizes that future hospital capital investments may include more costly, quality-enhancing medical technology. The capital update framework adjusts payments to allow for scientific and technological advances. (See Recommendation 9.) The Commission recommends a 0.9 percentage point adjustment for the capital component of scientific and technological advances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Productivity Improvement_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC recognizes the need to adapt the capital stock of hospitals to a health care environment with less demand for inpatient services through its productivity adjustment. This adjustment serves as a target for improvement in productivity due to more efficient use of plant and equipment and purchase of cost-decreasing technologies. The Commission recommends an adjustment of ^0.7 percentage points to encourage more efficient use of existing plant and equipment and the purchase of cost-decreasing technologies. (See Recommendation 9.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Case-Mix Change_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Medicare uses the same DRG definitions and relative weights for both operating payments and capital payments. As a result, capital payments, respond to changes in the CMI in the same way as do PPS operating payments. Thus the adjustment to capital payment rates for CMI change is identical to that made to operating payment rates. (See Recommendation 9.) The net adjustment for case-mix change is zero percentage points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 11: Single Operating and Capital Update Factor <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recommends that when the transition to fully prospective capital payments is complete, a single update factor be used for adjusting PPS operating and capital payment rates. Based on ProPAC's recommended updates to the operating and capital payment rates, the total increase to a fully prospective combined payment rate would be 2.8 percent for fiscal year 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes there ultimately should be one payment for hospital inpatient operating and capital expenses and a single annual update to that payment. ProPAC recognizes that a combined capital and operating update factor cannot be used until the transition to a fully prospective capital payment system is complete. This is because the update applies only to the prospective portion of capital payment rates. Further, the operating payment update is currently set by law, while the Secretary has authority to establish capital prospective payment updates through annual rulemaking. The Medicare program, however, should move to a single update approach for inpatient operating and capital payment rates as soon as possible. Despite the separate payment methods, hospitals do not distinguish between their operating and capital payments. Operating payments may be used to defray capital shortfalls and vice versa. Separate update factors for operating and capital expenses do not reflect the way hospitals actually use their revenues or make investment decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC therefore recommends the development and use of an update framework that includes capital and operating components for fiscal year 1995. Like the operating update use by ProPAC, the combined update approach should incorporate operating and capital market baskets to measure changes in prices, as well as adjust for productivity, scientific and technological advances, and case-mix change. This would ensure that updates to both operating and capital base payment rates reflect increases in the costs of the goods and services that hospitals require to produce inpatient hospital care efficiently. Ultimately, operating and capital components should be included in a single market basket and set of adjustments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A combined fully prospective update would yield an average payment rate increase of 2.8 percent under the Commission's recommendation. The total payment rate increase, however, would be about 3.7 percent, because of expected increases in the CMI (see Table 2&hyph;3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 12: Update Factor for Hospitals Paid on the Basis of Hospital-Specific Rates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes payments based on hospital-specific base-year costs for sole community hospitals should be updated by the average update given to all hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommendation would result in an update to the hospital-specific rates of 2.7 percent for fiscal year 1995, consistent with the Commission's recommendation on the PPS update. Since the update is based on current projections of the fiscal year 1995 increase in the market basket index, its effective value may be modified as more recent forecasts become available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA 1989 provides that certain hospitals be paid on the basis of the PPS rate, their own 1982 base-year costs updated to the current year, or their updated 1987 base-year costs, whichever would yield the largest payment. Sole community hospitals, which meet certain criteria based on distance from other hospitals or market share, qualify for this special treatment. Provisions affecting small rural Medicare-dependent hospitals, which were defined as rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds and at least a 60 percent Medicare share of total discharges or inpatient days, expired with cost reporting periods ending on or after April 1, 1993. However, OBRA 1993 restored this provision for cost reporting periods ending before October 1, 1994. For fiscal year 1995. Medicare-dependent hospitals will no longer be paid on the basis of hospital-specific rates and will be treated like other rural hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2(0,,),p0,8/10,i1,s10,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  2&hyph;3._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Estimated Fiscal Year  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1995  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Average Increase in Per Case Payments Under Fully Prospective Rates_Percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Operating update factor  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Capital update factor  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=4 --> Total average update  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2.8 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Estimated case-mix index change (fiscal year 1995)  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.9 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=4 --> Total average increases in PPS payments*  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.7 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> *The total average increase in PPS payments reflects the multiplicative effects of the total average update and case-mix index change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Current law requires that the hospital-specific rates for these hospitals be updated at a rate equal to the expected average update for all PPS hospitals. ProPAC concurs with this provision. Sole community hospitals are accorded special treatment under PPS because they may face higher historical costs due to their special circumstances. Nevertheless, these hospitals should be able to control their cost increases as other hospitals do. Last year, the Commission recommended that the update for rural areas be applied to the hospital-specific rate, on the grounds that other rural hospitals are the appropriate comparison group for these hospitals. However, this year's PPS update for rural hospitals (including sole community hospitals) is substantially higher than the average for all hospitals. The Commission believes the average increase for all hospitals provides a reasonable update for the hospital-specific rates available to these facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> Recommendation 13: Update Factor for PPS-Excluded Hospitals and Distinct-Part Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> For fiscal year 1995, the largest rates for PPS-excluded hospitals and distinct-part units should be updated by 2.7 percent. This recommendation accounts for the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The projected increase in the HCFA PPS-excluded hospital market basket, currently estimated at 3.7 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An adjustment of zero percentage points for the difference between the projected ProPAC and HCFA market baskets; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

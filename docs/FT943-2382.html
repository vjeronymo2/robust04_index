			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Chretien launches drive on separatism Canada's prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, is launching an offensive to defuse Quebec's drive towards independence. In a speech delivered in Quebec City yesterday, he outlined several federal government initiatives and said he intended to campaign vigorously for national unity ahead of the independence referendum which the francophone province's newly-elected separatist government has promised to hold next year. The Parti Quebecois won 77 out of 125 seats in last week's provincial elections in Quebec. PQ leaders indicated during the campaign that they will seek to persuade Quebeckers of the advantages of independence by relentlessly pointing out the inefficiencies of the present federal system. The first front in the referendum campaign opened yesterday with the recall of Parliament in Ottawa. The Bloc Quebecois, the PQ's federal counterpart which holds 54 seats in the House of Commons, is expected to use its position as the official opposition to press the separatists' case on the national stage. Mr Chretien said that the federal government would release long-awaited proposals in the first week of October to overhaul Canada's costly social-security system. He also promised an 'economic update' later this autumn, which is expected to outline a range of measures to bring down public spending. According to Mr Chretien, sweeping changes will be unveiled to eliminate and scale back some government programmes, and transfer others to provinces, municipalities and the private sector. Despite reports that the government is far off-target in meeting its deficit-reduction goals, Mr Chretien reaffirmed that it would do 'whatever is necessary' to bring the federal deficit down to 3 per cent of gross domestic product in the year to March 31 1997.</p>

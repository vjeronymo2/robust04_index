			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Branson scorns latest olive branch MR Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic's chairman, last night dismissed British Airways' apologies and assurances that no similar campaign would ever take place again, writes Michael Cassell. He remained dissatisfied with BA's efforts to draw the 'dirty tricks' saga to a swift close. But he is to postpone by one week a decision on whether to pursue his dispute with BA through the courts. Mr Branson said the 'key issue' for Virgin was the commercial damage which had been inflicted upon the airline by BA's undercover activities. He disclosed that Virgin and BA would be meeting, at BA's request, within the next few days to establish if there were any grounds for ending the affair. He said Virgin would then take 'whatever action it feels appropriate' in the light of the discussions. Virgin executives will go into the talks expecting BA to provide a detailed blueprint for improved commercial relationships between the two airlines but, as importantly, will demand negotiations on cash compensation for the damage it alleges was inflicted by BA's activities. The Virgin camp indicated that BA would have to go to considerable lengths in offering recompense to its competitor if the issue is not to become the subject of action on alleged anti-trust grounds in the US and possibly in Europe.

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Portable pension I HAVE retired early and live on a pension and investment income. I have been considering the tax implications of our future plans. When my son leaves school, which will be in June 1994 or 1995, my wife and I plan to travel abroad for a lengthy period. We would not necessarily take up residence in one country but might spend say, a year in the US followed by a year in Australia. I would like to establish myself as a non-resident for tax purposes during this period and need to know how to do this. I shall not, of course be in full-time employment and I believe this affects the issue. Our house would either be let or at least available for letting while we are abroad. What points should I consider in order to establish myself as non-resident for tax purposes during the period I plan to be overseas? What is the minimum length of time I need to remain abroad and for how long, and under what conditions would I be able to return to the UK during this period without jeopardising my non-resident status? When I first retired (May 1987) I was told that my pension could be paid to me overseas without deduction of tax, as most of my employment was with an international bank and had been carried out overseas. Would this again be possible if I became a non-resident? I seek the information so far in advance partly so that I can formulate our plans in more detail, and partly because it occurs to me that if I switch the quite considerable amount I now have invested in currency funds into an offshore roll-up fund, which I either cash or bed-and-breakfast while enjoying non-resident status, I could considerably reduce my tax bill. You may not, on the bare facts outlined, actually be able to secure the agreement of the Inland Revenue that you have both (or either) ceased to be resident and ordinarily resident in the UK during your extended holiday. Although it is partly out of date, it is worth asking your tax office for the free pamphlet 5R20 (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). At the same time, you could ask for the free booklet of extra-statutory concessions, IR1. In looking at the concessions for non-residents, bear in mind the warning at the front of the booklet that a concession will not be given in any case where an attempt is made to avoid tax. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

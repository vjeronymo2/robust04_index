			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Observer: Broke away Is the writing now officially on the wall for the profession of broker's analyst? The Society of Investment Analysts, after 37 years, has changed its name to the Institute of Investment Management and Research - a clear sign that it thinks its future lies with investment managers on the 'buy' side of the investment world, rather than with the brokers on the 'sell' side. The shift of emphasis has been under consideration for a decade, says the institute's current president Chris Davis, himself an analyst at BZW. Although the 2,000-strong membership is split equally, a look at student enrolments finally made up the new institute's mind. Seven of every 10 of them are employed by investment managers, while only 30 per cent work for brokers.</p>

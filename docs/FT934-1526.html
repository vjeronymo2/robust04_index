			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / BA plans Heathrow cargo expansion British Airways plans to invest Pounds 150m expanding its cargo facilities at London's Heathrow airport in a joint development with BAA, the site operator. Yesterday BA said the project would be the airline's largest single investment in an airport construction venture and would more than double its cargo handling capacity at Heathrow by the year 2000. The BA and BAA boards have approved the project in principle. Final approval is expected by the end of next year. The scheme will involve three phases which, when completed, will increase BA's Heathrow cargo handling capacity from 451,000 tonnes a year to about 1m tonnes a year in the year 2000. Details of the development and funding of the new cargo terminal are still being worked out. BAA also regards the scheme as an important part of its efforts to boost freight activities at Heathrow. Developed around the existing World Cargocentre on the south side of the airport, the new terminal will be a third of a mile long with a floor area of 600,000 sq ft compared with the current floor space of about 425,000 sq ft. The new centre will replace the old facilities built for BA's forerunners, BEA and BOAC. Construction of the first phase is expected to start by the end of next year and should be completed by late 1996. The second and final phases are expected to be ready in 1998 and 2000. Mr Kevin Hatton, managing director of BA's world cargo division, said the airline intended 'to take advantage of the latest, proven technology to achieve maximum auto-mation of handling func-tions'. BA said the old terminal operation was mainly manual and its facilities for handling premium products needed improvement. Mr Hatton said there would now be a unit to handle premium products.</p>

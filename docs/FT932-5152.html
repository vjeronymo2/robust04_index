			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Democrats face loss of Texas Senate seat PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has already learned to his cost that the 57-43 Democratic majority in the Senate is not enough for him to be confident of getting legislation passed. With today's by-election in Texas, however, his margin seems set to shrink further. Mr Bob Krueger, appointed to fill the Senate seat left open when Mr Lloyd Bentsen became treasury secretary, has been trailing far behind his Republican challenger, Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, and despite a last minute assault on her character and ethics, is expected to lose in a landslide. Mrs Hutchison, the current state treasurer, has stuck to campaigning against higher taxes and against Mr Clinton. Although she appears to have made little headway among black and Hispanic voters, she has gained some ground among younger voters, especially women, who have not always relished the right wing rhetoric of Texas's other senator, Mr Phil Gramm. She has also won the support of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, although Mr Perot's United We Stand organisation, attempting to tread a tortuous course in order to preserve its tax-exempt status as a supposedly non-political organisation, insisted that this did not amount to an endorsement. Mr Krueger, who has lost two Senate elections before, is an uninspiring former English professor with neither the conservative gravitas of Mr Bentsen nor the tough-talking populism of other successful Texas Democrats. Indeed, Mr Krueger's expected loss may prove less of an embarrassment to Mr Clinton - although he already has troubles enough - than to Governor Ann Richards, who anointed him as the Democratic candidate by picking him to be Mr Bentsen's interim replacement, and who herself faces re-election next year.</p>

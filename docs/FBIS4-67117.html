			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports from 28 April-5 May on antinarcotics  operations in countries monitored by FBIS London Bureau.  Sources are given in parentheses at the end of each report.  <H5>  France </H5>   French custom officers seized 15 kilos of heroin at Roissy  airport in two separate seizures on 19 and 26 April. On both  occasions the drug was hidden in boxes containing scientific  equipment on its way to Africa. (Paris France-Inter Radio  Network in French 1200 GMT 3 May 94)  <H5>  Portugal </H5>   Police in Portimao arrested seven people and seized about  270  doses of heroin, a car, household electric appliances, cameras,  car radios, hi-fi equipment, watches, money, and gold. The  operations followed antinarcotics investigations in Western  Algarve last week. The police believe they have broken up two  drug trafficking gangs that operated in the region.

Two days earlier a  Polish citizen was arrested in Ystad after customs officers  discovered 10 kg of amphetamines hidden in his car. Both  smugglers face sentences of at least five years in prison.

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Chance in China - Legal briefs City solicitors Lovell White Durrant are justifiably proud of having been chosen as one of only five overseas law firms to be awarded a licence to practise in Beijing by the Chinese government. But, given the current state of relations between the UK and China over the future of Hong Kong , it could be said that, apart from the prestige, there is little practical benefit for a British law firm in such a singular honour. Not so, says Mr Christopher Smith, head of Lovell's China practice. Even without a privatisation programme, China is attracting more foreign investment than the combined privatisation programmes of central and eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia attracted less than Dollars 1bn in its first round of privatisations; Russia hopes to attract up to Dollars 5bn over two years. In the first six months of 1992, China attracted commitments of Dollars 10bn, more than 80 per cent of it from China's 50m expatriates in south-east Asia who are believed to have Dollars 2,000bn in liquid assets ready to invest. None of the countries of central and eastern Europe have this kind of expatriate resource. Even the Japanese, with 100m people, are thought to have only Dollars 3,000bn in liquid assets. Eventually large sectors of Chinese industry will be controlled by expatriate Chinese, says Mr Smith, forcing the government to open up investment possibilities in the state sector in order to modernise it while keeping a measure of control, and encourage investment from other nationalities. All of which means lots of work for lawyers - particularly those already there.</p>

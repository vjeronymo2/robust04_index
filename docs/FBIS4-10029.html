			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 4 Apr (PL) -- Today, official sources  reported Argentine Secretary of State Alberto Lestelle is in  Cuba to sign an agreement on drug addiction and drug trafficking.    The National Information Agency reports that Lestelle said  the Cuban and Argentine Governments agreed to sign a formal  mutual assistance protocol in which both parties will be jointly  responsible in combating this problem, which transcends their  national borders.    The Argentine leader said that, after months of working  together with the Cuban Justice Ministry, Argentina has  identified points of mutual interest in which they can cooperate.    He added that Argentina has been implementing a mutual  assistance program on the American continent and many  governments have requested assistance to train specialized  personnel.    He noted that this has been done in Costa Rica, Guatemala,  and the Dominican Republic, and he announced this will soon be  established in Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Heavyweights of power slug it out - Winning is everything for three giants in generating equipment A NEW power struggle is developing in a business where the global battle for contracts has never been one for the faint-hearted, and where victory is always a heavy blow for the losers. Europe's big three suppliers of power generating equipment - GEC Alsthom, Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri - are slugging it out, with the help of powerful allies, for leadership of the world market for combined-cycle gas turbine power stations, the fastest-growing sector of the thermal power generation market. Widespread availability of natural gas, environmental pressures, and the need for greater efficiency and shorter lead-times have turned combined-cycle generation into the preferred system of power supply for many utilities in the 1990s. Spurred indirectly by heavy spending on aerospace gas turbines, the combined-cycle process uses the waste gases from a heavy-duty gas turbine to power a secondary steam turbine, raising thermal efficiency well above 50 per cent. For the first time, therefore, large power stations are producing more power than they lose - the best coal-fired plants typically have a thermal efficiency of about 40 per cent. All three companies are spending heavily to remain competitive in a market with big growth potential. Mr Klaus Riedle, head of Siemens' KWU power generation business, says worldwide orders for combined cycle could reach 250 gigawatts this decade - around four times the power output of the electricity companies in England and Wales. So far this year there has been a spate of combined-cycle orders for power stations from North Wales to Jakarta, and most of the laurels have gone to GEC Alsthom. Last week, the Anglo-French group announced it had been chosen as main contractor for PowerGen's 1,360MW station at Connah's Quay in North Wales. That followed closely on another big UK order in east London, and a contract for a 1,700MW station in the north of the Netherlands, one of the largest outside Japan. The fourth big order this year, for a 1,170MW combined cycle oil/gas fired plant near Jakarta, went to ABB. Executives of GEC Alsthom and their 90 per cent-owned European Gas Turbines (EGT) unit are cock-a-hoop about their run of victories, claiming they are establishing a clear lead with the help of the world's largest turbine, a 212-226MW machine developed jointly with General Electric of the US. Mr Kelvin Bray, EGT's chairman and chief executive, believes the company has a technology lead of some two years over its rivals, and says the GE-GEC Alsthom 9F turbine is the most efficient in the world with a 54 per cent rating. Rivals agree that the odd 1 per cent of thermal efficiency could make a difference in markets where orders are decided on technology rather than availability of finance, but neither Siemens and ABB are willing to accept GEC Alsthom has established a lead. At Siemens, Mr Riedle shrugs off the loss of the Connah's Quay order as 'merely technical.' The German company had snapped up two large contracts from PowerGen over the past two years, but all utilities, he says, like to spread their orders. Mr Goran Lundberg, head of ABB's power plants business, says the Swiss-Swedish group is at the same level as GEC Alsthom in thermal efficiency. 'We will be up to 55 per cent in a while,' he says. 'We remain rather confident.' The arguments over efficiency might yet turn into a sterile propaganda war with few returns for any of the three players. None of them, after all, expect it to be easy to push efficiency much beyond 55 per cent. Even so, utilities which are particularly responsive to technology arguments could still be persuaded by a small thermal efficiency advantage, says Mr Riedle. The three European rivals cannot, perhaps, be blamed for trying to establish technology leadership when there is little to chose between them otherwise. 'I don't think anybody's going to be dominant,' says Mr Robert McCoy of McCoy Power Reports in the US. 'Their technologies are fairly close, and nobody has leapfrogged. They all have a solid base of experience, modern manufacturing capability, and about the same delivery times.' All three, too, have plenty of experience in turnkey contracting, which is becoming increasingly important for customers who no longer want the responsibility and financial risk of such a role. And they all have links, to a greater or lesser extent, with aerospace turbine research, which some believe gives them an advantage over the other big world player, the Mitsubishi/Westinghouse partnership. If the forecasts prove correct, there will be plenty of opportunities for all four rivals to score some points over each other. But GE and GEC Alsthom are emerging as the team that the others have to beat.  ------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE'S BIG THREE SUPPLIERS  ------------------------------------------------------------- Major combined cycle orders since the beginning of 1991 Company             Site                          Power                                                 rating (MW)  ------------------------------------------------------------- Siemens             Rye House, UK                 450                     (Units 11-13)                     Belawan, Indonesia            150                     (Unit 2)  ------------------------------------------------------------- GEC Alsthom         Eems, Netherlands            1700                     Connah's Quay, UK            1360                     Didcot (UK)                  1360                     Barking Reach (UK)           1000  ------------------------------------------------------------- Asea Brown Boveri   Tanjung Priok, Indonesia     1170                     Deeside, UK                   500                     Orlando, US                   120                     Chania, Greece                120  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

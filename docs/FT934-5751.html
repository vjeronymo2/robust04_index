			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Labour warns on Welsh agency LABOUR yesterday claimed the government was putting the future of the Welsh Development Agency in question because of asset sales and cuts in its grant. The party was setting out a new agenda for the agency in the wake of the highly critical Commons Public Accounts Committee report earlier this year. Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, and Mr Rhodri Morgan, frontbench spokesman on Wales, welcomed the WDA's new chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, and what they described as the board's 'swift no-nonsense disciplinary action'. They added: 'We hope a line can now be drawn under this episode.' They told a Commons press conference a much bigger shadow was now being cast over its future. They said: 'By forcing the agency to sell off land and factories on a massive scale, and by cutting its government grant, John Redwood (Welsh secretary) has thrown the WDA's whole existence into question.' While this year, they said, the agency was committed to a budget of Pounds 171m, 'less than half the budget, Pounds 78m, is from Welsh Office coffers. The WDA has to raise Pounds 50m from land disposals and Pounds 29m from land rental to make up the programme. Projections for next financial year make grim reading.' Mr Davies and Mr Morgan called for the WDA to be given a clear development strategy and a secure financial plan. The agency should be rebuilt as 'the engineroom of the Welsh economy' with less emphasis on inward investment and more on indigenous investment, and freed 'from the political stranglehold of the Welsh Office'.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Norwegian bank returns to black SPAREBANKEN NOR, Norway's biggest savings bank known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, reported yesterday that it had returned to profit in the first half, helped by a reduction in operating costs and improved income. Operating profit in the first six months was NKr3m compared with a NKr284m (Dollars 49m) operating loss in the same period last year. Operating profit, before credit losses, rose to NKr658m, or 1.58 per cent of average assets, from NKr408m, as credit losses dipped to NKr643m from NKr689m. The bank said that calculated on an annual basis, credit losses represent 1.85 per cent of gross loans which were put at NKr75.06bn, a NKr13.6bn increase over the same period last year. For the whole of 1991 credit losses comprised 2.2 per cent of gross loans. Net interest income was up to NKr1.34bn from NKr1.29bn. Sparebanken Nor said operating costs were cut to NKr1.19bn from NKr1.35bn and that staff had been reduced by 9 per cent this year. 'Work with further staff and cost reductions continues,' it said.</p>

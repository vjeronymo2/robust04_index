The discussion is  being held behind closed doors.    Before the doors closed, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin  reported that Egypt is introducing difficulties in the  multinational talks on the nuclear issue. He said the Egyptians  try to raise the issue of nonconventional weapons at every  international forum.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Beilin defined  Yasir  'Arafat's failure to condemn the 'Afula murders as stupid.</p>

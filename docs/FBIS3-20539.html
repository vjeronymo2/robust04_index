			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Ze (2612 3419): "Job-Seeking Peasants Pour </F> Into Cities"]    [Text] In recent years more and more rural workers have  been pouring into cities and economically developed areas in  search of jobs, creating a large-scale interregional migration.  In the days following the Spring Festival each year, in  particular, wave upon wave of peasants come flooding in,  overburdening the rail system across the nation and filling bus  and train stations in large and mid-sized cities to capacity,  forming a "rural migrant upsurge" that cannot be held back. The  "upsurge" in rural migrants started in the late 1980's and grew  explosively after 1990. There is no sign at all it will  diminish. At present about 50 to 60 millon rural migrants are on  the move each year, with 24 million of them from the six  provinces of Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui  alone.  <H6>  I </H6>   One of the direct causes of the "rural migrant upsurge" is  China's huge rural population, which creates a massive  oversupply of rural labor in absolute terms. Since the switch  from agriculture to other sectors of the economy without leaving  one's village cannot absorb all the many redundant workers, the  outward migration of some peasants in search of jobs is  inevitable. Secondly, the small scale of farming, the widening  price scissors between industrial and agricultural products, the  overburden on peasants, and other factors have depressed the  profitability of agriculture, particularly farming. Unable to  get rich by working the land, some peasants have hit the road in  search of money-making opportunities.    The "rural migrant upsurge" is also caused by a more  deep-seated reason, namely that in China urbanization lags  behind industrialization severely. Typically, as a nation  becomes more and more industrialized (as demonstrated by the  growth of the secondary and tertiary sectors as a share of the  national economy), the level of urbanization too rises steadily  (the main indicator being the percentage of the nation's total  population that is urban). This is the outcome of changes in the  employment structure, which, in turn, are caused by changes in  the industrial structure. It is also a result of the operations  of the market mechanism in the process of resource allocation.  All developed nations in the world without exception achieved  industrialization at the same time as they underwent  urbanization. Today those countries are about 80 percent  urbanized, above 90 percent in Britain and the United States. In  developing nations, the figure is 40 percent or so. In China the  extent of urbanization is only 28 percent. (Footnote 1) The  ratio between industrial output value and agricultural output  value is now 7.5:2.5, in contrast to the 3:7 recorded in the  early days of the PRC. At the same time, however, the balance  between the urban population and rural population remains stuck  at 2:8, a unique phenomenon in the world. Apart from a soaring  birth rate, this state of affairs was mainly caused by the fact  that for many years in the past, industrialization in China took  place independently of urbanization in an environment of mutual  urban/rural isolation. Through the exchange of unequal values  between industry and agriculture, between the city and the  countryside, agriculture provided urban industrial development  with a steady flow of accumulated funds. Meanwhile, the  permanent residence registration system, food supply system,  employment system, education, health care, and insurance system  worked to keep large numbers of workers in the countryside,  further skewing the existing dual social structure. China has  now put together a full line-up of industries, but the failure  of urbanization to catch up with industrialization has saddled  the nation with a heavy social burden. Modernization in China is  comparable to a hobbling pony with a big cart hitched up to it.  Already the "rural migrant upsurge" reflects the social crisis  brought on by the lag in urbanization.  <H6>  II. </H6>   The "rural migrant upsurge" has disrupted and impacted  China's economy in ways profound and varied. On the positive  side:    1) It has spurred the economic development of cities and  developed areas. By leaving their villages and taking jobs or  engaging in business elsewhere, redundant rural workers have  made good the labor shortages in migrant-importing areas,  thereby aiding their economic construction with low-cost labor.  Nowadays a host of peasant workers are heavily involved in a  range of fields, including urban construction, the textile  industry, transportation, commerce, the catering industry, and  domestic services, making themselves indispensable to the  effective operations of the cities. Most peasant workers are  employed in jobs that involve hard tiring work in filthy  conditions. They satisfy the labor demand in those lines of work  and fill the gaps in the lineup of industries of the host  locations, at the same time making the lives of local residents  easier. A leading comrade on the agricultural commission of  Guangdong Province once commented that the contributions made by  male and female workers from other provinces to the economy of  Guangdong should be written into history.    2) Rural migrants bring back to their villages funds,  technology, information, and managerial experience, injecting  new doses of energy into the rural economy. Studies show that  peasant migrants from the six provinces of Sichuan, Jiangxi,  Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui alone generated 25 billion yuan  in incomes for their villages in 1992. Even more significant,  peasant migrants become more conscious of the market economy and  have a chance to broaden their outlook, overhaul their thinking,  and improve their quality.    3) Migrant workers have relieved the competition for jobs in  migrant-exporting areas and created the conditions for the  introduction of scale management in agriculture. In China, a  populous nation with little land, land has been operated on a  small scale with limited efficiency, which has become the  principal impediment to the modernization of agriculture. The  only way to modernize Chinese agriculture is to channel the  surplus labor into the secondary and tertiary industries and  introduce scale management. After taking up jobs or going into  business elsewhere for many years, some peasants are eager to  contract out their land, creating a rare opportunity for the  circulation and concentration of land and the application of  scale management to land. If only we take effective measures and  provide proper guidance, the scale management of land will be  accelerated.    Undeniably, the current interregional migration of rural  workers has also inevitably caused a string of social problems.  For starters, it has intensified the pressure on the  transportation system and heightened the demand for urban  infrastructural facilities and services essential to daily life.  According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Railways,  railroads across the nation carried an average of 3.2 million  passengers daily between late January and early February this  year, an increase of 300,000 over the daily average for the  15-day period before the Spring Festival. Of the total number of  passengers, 74 percent were rural migrants. The excessive  increase in passenger traffic meant reduced freight transport  capacity. Secondly, rural migrants have put social law and order  under enormous strains. Many criminals have found their way into  the army of rural workers on the move and disrupt law and order.  Thirdly, the lack of effective ways to manage the floating  population also means a loss of control over this segment of the  population as far as family planning is concerned.  <H6>  III. </H6>   The effective operation of the socialist market economy  requires the free circulation of elements of production,  including labor, between different industries and different  localities. In this sense, the inter-regional movement of rural  workers and the resultant rural migrant upsurge have their  raison d'etre and inevitability. For this reason, we cannot hope  to solve the inter-regional movement of rural workers,  particularly the rural migrant upsurge, simply by blocking it;  it is not to be blocked. A few years ago many cities had these  migrants surrounded, tried chasing them away, or kept them out;  however, the migration of rural workers has never been totally  banned. As a special form of the movement of rural manpower, the  rural migrant upsurge will remain part of the overall  industrialization and urbanization of the Chinese countryside.  We should be fully prepared ideologically for this and respond  with the right policy. Making the most of the situation, we  should lower the costs to the individual and society of the  interregional movement of labor and the risks associated with  it, thus minimizing the negative impacts of the rural migrant  upsurge.    In dealing with the "rural migrant upsurge," we must adhere  to the principle of "tackling both the underlying cause of a  disease as well as its symptoms" and choose the appropriate  strategy based on what the main problem is at a given time in a  given place.    In the near term, our principal strategy should be to  eliminate the haphazardness and spontaneity of interregional  labor movement and make such movement more orderly and better  organized by nurturing a labor market and creating a new  mechanism for the circulation of labor. Specifically:    1) The government should step up the macroguidance and  coordination of the interregional movement of rural labor. The  central government should set up an authoritative body devoted  exclusively to the macromanagement of the interregional movement  of labor or put an existing agency in charge of such management.  The duties and functions of the new body should include:  Gathering, analyzing, and disseminating data on the labor  markets in the migrant-importing and migrant-exporting areas;  balancing labor supply with labor demand on a regional basis;  and drawing up policies, laws, and regulations to promote and  protect labor movement. Level 1 provinces, particularly the  principal labor-importing and labor-exporting areas, should set  up inter-regional labor coordination centers and begin active  cooperation in labor matters. By entering into inter-provincial  labor cooperation with eight provinces and regions including  Sichuan, for instance, Guangdong has moderated the flood of  rural workers pouring into it from the eight provinces and  regions. This it accomplished by providing information on the  job market in Guangdong and intensifying market guidance.    2) A mighty effort should be made to develop a variety of  intermediate labor service organizations, gradually forming a  socialized service system that includes information  dissemination, consulting, job referral, and training. Such a  system is critical to broadening the scope of market regulation  and lowering the costs and risks of the de-agriculturalization  of rural manpower. Intermediate organizations, particularly  job-referral centers, should allow and even encourage private  groups and individuals to go into business on their own. China  has a vast pool of surplus labor; the government alone cannot be  relied upon to solve the whole problem by itself. But government  departments can play a leading role in providing information and  consulting services. Nobody makes money providing these  services, yet they do a lot of social good. Most private  organizations have neither the capability nor the will to  provide those services. By making full use of existing organized  resources and information tools, government agencies, in  contrast, are in a position to collect and transmit  authoritative information on the supply and demand of labor.    3) Regional labor supply-demand exchanges should be set up  at  major transportation hubs and in the leading cities of areas in  demand of labor. A labor supply-demand exchange, on the one  hand, will bring together the two parties at either end of the  labor supply-demand equation as well as intermediate  organizations. Its operations may also help identify wage levels  and obtain and transmit information.    4) Law- and regulation-making should be accelerated as  appropriate and the management of the labor market must be  improved, including the protection of the legitimate rights and  interests of the workers, hiring enterprises, and intermediate  organizations, as well as the regulation of their conduct; the  preservation of fair market competition; and the effective  management of the floating population through the introduction  of a registration system for workers entering or leaving a  jurisdiction, for instance.    In the long haul, solving the problem of rural worker  migration at its root entails, for one thing, the inclusion of  the issue of rural employment into the scope of national  economic and social development planning and the elevation of  the realization of full employment in the countryside to a major  policy goal for governments at all levels. Secondly, it involves  searching for a path to rural industrialization and a rural  labor de-agriculturalization model suited to China's national  conditions. To do so is to stem the rural migrant upsurge at its  source.    Rural industrialization is an inescapable stage in China's  modernization. Taking a lesson from successful industrialization  in countries around the world, particularly industrialized  nations, and bearing in mind what we have learned from the  course of industrialization in China itself since the founding  of the PRC, rural industrialization in this nation should  include the following basic elements and requirements:    1) Township and town enterprises were and remain the  principal vehicle for rural industrialization in China as well  as the main conduit through which the rural work force leaves  agriculture for other sectors of the economy. Already by late  1992 township and town enterprises had absorbed 108 million  workers. In more recent years, though, with technological  advances accelerating in township and town enterprises, the  trend of capital replacing labor has become increasingly more  notable and labor absorption has slowed. How can township and  town enterprises continue to absorb large numbers of redundant  workers while maintaining fast growth? The key is to find the  right technological mix and create the right industrial  structure based on the resource situation and economic  conditions. As far as technological mix is concerned, because  China has an ample labor supply but little funds, township and  town enterprises should remain predominantly labor-intensive for  many years to come. This is the fund-accumulating business  start-up stage when enterprises should substitute capital with  labor to the greatest extent possible and increase employment  opportunities. Such a development no doubt will have positive  practical implications for most areas in China, particularly  those in south and central China. We are not ruling out the  possibility of developed areas and some enterprises taking the  lead in upgrading the industrial structure or technological mix  ahead of others. As for the industrial structure, special  emphasis should be put on the development of the agricultural  byproducts processing industry and the tertiary industry so as  to reverse the trend of growing structural convergence between  township and town enterprises and urban industry, and optimize  industrial distribution. At present the agricultural byproducts  processing industry accounts for less than 20 percent of the  gross agricultural output value, while the corresponding figures  in developed nations usually double or triple that. Rising  living standards among urban and rural households in the future  will translate into bright and growing prospects for the  agricultural byproducts processing industry. The size of the  tertiary sector as a share of the national economy reflects the  degree of modernization of a nation. In a developed country, the  tertiary sector makes up 60 to 70 percent of domestic output; in  a developing nation, between 35 and 40 percent on the average;  and in China, 27 percent, including a mere 14 percent in the  countryside. Any substantial expansion of the tertiary sector  will greatly increase job opportunities.    2) Industrialization in China should take the road of  appropriate concentration so that rural industrialization and  rural urbanization will proceed in tandem with each other.  Concentrated distribution economizes on land resources and  investments in the infrastructure. With concentrated  distribution, we can also make the most of regions, create a  "critical mass" effect, and build up urban centers from which  funds and technology can flow to the surrounding areas. Even  more important, concentrated distribution helps spur the  formation and development of cities, stimulate the growth of the  tertiary sector, and close the gap between the city and the  countryside characteristic of a dual social structure. The  majority of China's township and town enterprises are widely  scattered among the countless villages and hamlets and are  closely interwoven into the fabric of their rural communities.  The result is a pattern of distribution in which "every little  village has its own enterprise." This fragmented pattern of  distribution is the product of a specific set of social and  economic conditions, primarily the support in the form of cheap  land and low-cost labor an enterprise could derive from its  community and other people connected to it by blood or local  ties. This kind of support is often of critical importance to a  fledgling enterprise. Needless to say, the drawbacks of  fragmented distribution are obvious. For one thing, it is  immensely wasteful of land resources. Secondly, these  enterprises have little access to information and are not  located on major transportation routes. The web of relationships  and ties within rural society and communal administrative  interference combine to push up business costs to an excessive  level. Thirdly, the fragmented distribution of township and town  enterprises does nothing to bring about a modernized  industrialized society or create an industrial civilization  while retarding urbanization. A communal rural society lacks the  environment and conditions conductive to the formation of a  modern enterprise system. For this reason, once they have grown  and matured, enterprises do their best to congregate in  townships, freeing themselves from the restraints of communal  interests and achieving external economies. Given the conditions  in China, concentrated distribution and fragmented distribution  will continue to coexist in the future. In the vast interior,  especially south and central China, the development of township  and town enterprises is still inseparable from communal support.  In the long run, however, concentrated distribution will replace  fragmented distribution to become the dominant model for rural  industrialization and the de-agriculturalization of rural labor  in China. Governments at all levels should create conditions for  the relative concentration of township and town enterprises to  make sure that rural industrialization and urbanization proceed  at the same pace. Henceforth township and town enterprises may  develop revolving around cities. In view of the fact that large  cities in China are already severely overcrowded, most township  and town enterprises should be concentrated in small and  medium-sized cities, county towns, and their surrounding core  market towns. Urbanization being a gradual process, we must be  careful not to over-build with no regard to the circumstances. A  workable method is to take the county as the unit and single out  for special assistance a number of selected townships or market  towns that have a geographical, economic, or human-resource  edge. Scientific planning should also be practiced.    3) Gradually reform the dual permanent residence  registration  system that separates the city from the countryside, thereby  creating the conditions for the free movement of labor between  industries, between the city and the countryside, and between  regions, and for the formation of a unified nation-wide labor  market. A permanent residence registration system that divides  the city from the countryside does not satisfy the requirements  of the development of a modern market economy. Under that  system, being a peasant or a city resident becomes hereditary,  something passed from one generation to the next. The  possibility of a peasant becoming a city resident is almost  non-existent, fundamentally blocking the road leading to the  urbanization of the rural population and impeding the free  movement of labor between the city and the countryside and from  one region to another. For this reason, the existing irrational  permanent residence registration system must be reformed and  ultimately abolished. Considering China's national conditions  and the countless contradictions accumulated through the years,  we must reform the permanent residence registration system in  stages in order of priority. In the short haul, we must first  deregulate residence registration in the seats of county towns  and rural townships. Peasants should be allowed to raise funds  among themselves to build a township where they should be free  to settle down. Moreover, permanent residence registration  management should be significantly relaxed in small and  medium-sized cities. Since a majority of small and medium-sized  cities in China have not reached an appropriate scale, the  absorption of some peasants will help them boost their economies  of scale tremendously. Thirdly, deregulate in a small way some  industries in large cities so as to make good the labor  shortages in those trades that involve hard and tough work amid  filthy conditions and accelerate the rationalization of the  urban economic structure. Fourthly, apply a flexible residence  registration system to the floating population in order to solve  some of its problems, such as having more children than allowed  and order-and-order problems. Regarding rural workers who have  signed contracts lasting over a year with hiring units  elsewhere, we must allow their residence registration to move  with them and go where they go. They should register as  temporary residents of the jurisdiction where their jobs are  located and submit to the management of the local authorities  and receive social welfare in accordance with the law.</p>

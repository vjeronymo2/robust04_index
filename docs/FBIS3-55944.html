			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Kaverin: "Justice Ministry Ignored </F> `Pamyat'"]    [Text] Yesterday, the Justice Ministry officially turned  down an application by D. Vasilyev, leader of "Pamyat," a  well-known monarchist movement, to register his organization.  The reasons are clear: "Pamyat's" extremist program is at odds  with Russian laws.    In his first public appearance literally two hours after the  incident, Mr. Vasilyev described this decision by the Justice  Ministry as "genocide against the Russians" -- "the Justice  Ministry has been registering all conceivable pornographic  organizations, but has not registered ours, a national-patriotic  one!"    Vasilyev's words were echoed by V. Bogachev, chief of the  European Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP] (it turns out that we  have a party like this, too -- S.K.). V. Bogachev called on all  patriotic forces to write "an open letter against the Justice  Ministry." As a matter of fact, the ELDP does not have any  relation to V. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia, a fact Mr. Bogachev was swift to confirm by calling the  latter a fascist party and expressing his astonishment that it  was registered by that same Justice Ministry.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report "communicated by the government secretary"] </F>   [Text] Today, (Wednesday) 25.5.94, the government  unanimously decided to accept the recommendation of REFA'EL  [Armament Development Authority] general manager, Brig. Gen.  (ret.) Yitzhaq Gat, and a commission led by Prof. Yehoshu'a  Yortner to take steps to turn REFA'EL to a government-owned  company. Part of the company will be profit oriented and  operated on a government provided budget. REFA'EL, the Armament  Development Authority, is currently a division of the Ministry  of Defense.    To carry out its decision, the government assigned the  Ministries of Defense and Finance to create a steering committee  and subcommittees to deal with as soon as possible funding,  equity, property, land, manpower, legal, economic, and contract  issues. The government appointed REFA'EL management to  negotiate with the workers in order to reach work and salary  agreements.</p>

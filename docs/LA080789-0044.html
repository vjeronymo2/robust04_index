			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS SEEK OUTSIDE BRADLEY PROBE  </P> <P> In their first plunge into the controversy over Mayor Tom Bradley's financial  affairs, a coalition of Los Angeles homeowner organizations demanded Sunday  that an independent counsel be appointed to investigate the matter.  </P> <P> Citing the need to remove politics from the inquiry, about 40 community  activists -- most from suburban areas -- gathered on the front steps of City  Hall to ask that an impartial lawyer take over the investigation from City  Atty. James K. Hahn, whose ties to the mayor, they complained, will compromise  any final report.  </P> <P> "No disrespect, but we feel that Inspector Clouseau might do a better job than  Jimmy Hahn," said Norton Halpern, representative of the Hollywood Homeowners  and Tenants Assn. "This is not an attack on Mayor Bradley but an attack on the  system."  </P> <P> Federal, state and local agencies are looking into Bradley's stock transactions  and whether his influence resulted in the deposit of city funds into Far East  National Bank, for which he was a paid adviser. He has denied using his  official position to benefit himself or business associates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Organized by Valley Groups  </P> <P> Sunday's press conference was organized by a coalition of 10 Valley homeowner  groups that had mailed out 400 letters last week to invite other community  organizations. About 15 groups were represented, only one from South-Central  Los Angeles and none from the Eastside.  </P> <P> The organizers vowed to expand their campaign for a special investigator, speak  before City Council committees and launch a telephone campaign targeting  members of the council.  </P> <P> The coalition called on the City Council to appoint a special counsel,  preferably from outside of California, who would use the council's subpoena  powers to obtain sworn testimony from witnesses as part of an independent  investigation.  </P> <P> So far, the coalition charged, the inquiry has been sidetracked by the  political agendas of a few council members who, in turn, have neglected the  daily, pressing business of the city.  </P> <P> "Everything has been whitewashed so far," said Salvatore Grammatico, head of  the Coalition of Concerned Communities, which is based on the Westside. "It's  time we know what is really going on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Cloud of Suspicion'  </P> <P> Steve Hunter, a Hollywood community activist, said that he has been a faithful  supporter of Bradley but that the mayor has "come down a couple of pegs" in his  estimation.  </P> <P> "As long as the cloud of suspicion hangs over City Hall, the city of Los  Angeles cannot move forward," Hunter said. "And the only way to clear the  suspicion is an independent investigation."  </P> <P> Most of the members of the coalition have not been Bradley supporters in the  past. Several are veterans of fights against airport noise, mass transit lines  and other development issues that have aligned them with Bradley rivals such as  Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Nate Holden.  </P> <P> But they insisted that they were not after the mayor.  </P> <P> "We must get the final answer, if Mayor Bradley is guilty as charged or  innocent," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners' Assn.  "I think (an independent investigation) is his best shot at having his  reputation restored."  </P> <P> Despite the deepening crisis Bradley faces, the mayor continues to receive  shows of support. Hours after the homeowners' press conference, Bradley was  honored at the Nisei Week Grand Parade in Little Tokyo, where later in the day  Japanese-American community organizations were to observe Tom Bradley  Appreciation Day.  </P> <P> "He's been a very good mayor to our community," said Tosh Terasawa, president  of the Japanese American Cultural Center.  </P> <P> Last week, a Watts organization presented Bradley with a plaque that carried  the signatures of several hundred supporters. And on Saturday, about 30 of his  closest backers pledged to help him raise $300,000 for legal fees.  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Hahn on Sunday were unsuccessful, but he has said that a  special investigator is not necessary. Bradley also has said he believes the  appropriate agencies are already involved.  </P> <P> Some City Council members, though leery about taking on an investigation, have  expressed interest in hiring an independent counsel if needed, once Hahn's  effort is completed.  </P></p>

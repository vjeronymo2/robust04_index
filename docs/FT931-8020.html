			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / IG Metall warned over pay demand MR Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of the Gesamtmetall engineering employers' association, yesterday said IG Metall, Germany's big engineering union, was pricing its members out of the market and would face more unemployment if it insisted on a 26 per cent wage increase this April for the five east German states. In an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost, Mr Gottschol said Gesamtmetall would stick to its offer of a 9 per cent wage increase for east Germany's 300,000 IG Metall members. The union is demanding a 26 per cent increase, as agreed in a contract with the employers' association in March 1991. The contract envisaged bringing east German wages up to west German levels by April 1994. But the employers now insist they can revise the contract because of the deteriorating west and east German economies. East Germany's inflation rate jumped by 6.7 percentage points in January, against a 1.8 point rise in December and an annual inflation rate of about 11.2 per cent in 1992. Union officials, who will open arbitration talks with Gesamtmetall in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania today, are expected to argue that a wage increase is even more justified in the light of the inflation figures. Talks aimed at reaching a compromise have already broken down in four of the five east German states. 'IG Metall must finally weigh up the cost (of the wage increase) with the economic reality,' Mr Gottschol said. Gesamtmetall officials have said that a 9 per cent wage increase would cost the employers DM1.4bn (Pounds 590m), while a 26 per cent increase would cost DM3.9bn. IG Bergbau und Energie, the energy and utilities union, last week accepted a pay increase of 9.3 per cent for its 60,000 east German members.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Hong Kong to ponder airport plan HONG KONG'S government is to consider whether to try again for an agreement with China on the colony's proposed HKDollars 100bn airport project. This follows the failure at the weekend of 10 days of talks in Peking started when Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign minister, visited the Chinese capital. Sir David Wilson, the governor, held emergency meetings yesterday with two senior UK diplomats involved in the Peking talks. He will now consult the colony's executive council. No agreement was reached because China is insisting on having effective control or veto powers over detailed issues on the airport, which would set precedents for it to interfere in other subjects.</p>

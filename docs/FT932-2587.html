			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: OECD concern on position of punt THE devaluation of the punt in January caused by last autumn's currency crisis has restored the competitive position of Irish exports and helped re-establish the basis for economic expansion, the OECD says in its annual report on Ireland published today. The underlying rate of inflation should therefore re-stabilise at about 3 per cent, while real incomes and personal consumption should continue growing at about the same rate, it says. The OECD warns, however, that a renewed divergence in monetary conditions in the UK and Germany, with the former's rates falling and the latter's remaining firm, could put renewed pressure on Irish interest rates and the punt. '(Ireland's) link to the D-Mark may imply that Ireland could continue to experience monetary conditions tighter than required by domestic needs,' the report says. The credibility of this link and the government's macroeconomic strategy of convergence under the Maastricht criteria will depend upon Dublin's commitment and adherence to the target of keeping the exchequer borrowing requirement under 3 per cent of gross domestic product and making further progress in reducing the debt/GDP ratio. The report forecasts a deterioration in the employment rate by almost 3 percentage points during this year and next, and says that, although the growth rate in manufacturing 'has generally tracked that of the OECD at large, the increase in employment in private services has been much slower'. Tax incentives to attract high-technology industries to Ireland have distorted the tax structure, it says, placing a higher burden on labour. This should be eased by a reduction of a tax bias in favour of property investment. The report calls for greater emphasis to be placed on vocational training. Restrictive practices 'associated with barriers to entry and other trading restraints' in telecommunications, transport, financial services and the professions are also 'imposing a deadweight on the rest of the economy'.</p>

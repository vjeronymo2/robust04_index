			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, April 25 (CTK) -- This afternoon, Premier  Vaclav Klaus and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim signed  an agreement on economic cooperation and the mutual granting of  most-favored nation status. The agreement calls for cooperation  to increase trade turnover between the two countries, to  diversify goods traded, and to share expertise and technology in  the production of machines and equipment. It also provides for  the mutual exchange of information on future investment programs.    Brazil, thanks to its large and unsaturated market, is one  of  the Czech Republic's most important Latin American trade  partners. Trade relations between the two countries date back to  1918.    However, trade with Brazil has been decreasing over the past  three years. In 1991, trade amounted to $90 million, but last  year it reached only $45 million. Exports from the Czech  Republic over the past three years remained relatively stable,  amounting to $13 million per year. On the other hand, exports  from Brazil decreased from $77 million in 1991 to $32 million  last year.    One of the reasons for this situation is that many  industrial  enterprises have ceased to use the services of foreign trade  companies and are trying to penetrate the Brazilian market  directly, according to Karel Klima of the Czech Embassy in  Brazil, who met with Czech business people in Rio de Janeiro.  Businesses desiring to sell on the Brazilian market but lacking  familiarity with the country should take advantage of trade  fairs and the services of commercial chambers to establish  contacts in Brazil.    The Czech Republic supplies mostly whole plants to Brazil.  At present nine large electricity plants and 10 cement plants  built by Czechoslovakia are operating in the country. During  their stay, representatives of Prerovske Strojirny hope to reach  an agreement on further supplies of cement plants, according to  sources from the Czech trade mission. Brazil exports to the  Czech Republic include mostly soy groats (39 percent of total  exports), coffee, tobacco, animal hides, iron ore, and fruit.    The agreement signed today also calls for the creation of a  commission to increase trade and economic cooperation between  the Czech Republic and Brazil. The commission is to submit to  the two countries' governments proposals concerning the  development of relations, to propose new cooperation projects,  and to support the exchange of economic information. The  commission will meet once every two years, alternately in Prague  and Brasilia.    Klaus also discussed today with Brazilian President Itamar  Franco cooperation in the field of international politics and in  the United Nations.</p>

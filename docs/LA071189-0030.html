			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CONTROL DATA OFFICER STARTING OWN FIRM  </P> <P> Carl Ledbetter, former president and chief executive of the Control Data Corp.  supercomputer subsidiary that was closed in April, has left Control Data to  form another company.  </P> <P> Ledbetter, who headed ETA Systems in St. Paul, Minn., said he briefly explored  the possibility of purchasing ETA's assets from Control Data. But he and former  ETA executive Al Moschner decided to start a new Twin Cities company, he said.  </P> <P> The new company will make special-purpose, high-performance computers,  Ledbetter said, adding that its product line will not resemble a  general-purpose supercomputer, which was the ETA product.  </P> <P> Ledbetter, who presided over Control Data's effort to challenge  Minneapolis-based Cray Research in the world supercomputer market, was removed  from the helm of ETA last October in a restructuring that folded ETA into the  parent company.  </P> <P> He was reinstated at ETA in February, when Control Data reversed its earlier  plan. That prompted speculation that ETA was for sale or seeking an investor  and that Ledbetter was a key ingredient in that strategy. ETA was closed after  losses of more than $100 million last year.  </P> <P> While ETA fell victim to its own technological delays and to Control Data's  worsening financial problems, Ledbetter became well-known in the supercomputer  industry and was credited with having fought an uphill battle to make ETA a  competitor.  </P></p>

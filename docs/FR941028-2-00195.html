			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pressure-measuring devices should sense the room pressure just inside the airflow path into the room (e.g., at the bottom of the door). Unusual airflow patterns within the room can cause pressure variations; for example, the air can be at negative pressure at the middle of a door and at positive pressure at the bottom of the same door (Figure S3&hyph;4). If the pressure-sensing ports of the device cannot be located directly across the airflow path, it will be necessary to validate that the negative pressure at the sensing point is and remains the same as the negative pressure across the flow path.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pressure-sensing devices should incorporate an audible warning with a time delay to indicate that a door is open. When the door to the room is opened, the negative pressure will decrease. The time-delayed signal should allow sufficient time for persons to enter or leave the room without activating the audible warning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d292 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:graphicsen28oc94.007 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

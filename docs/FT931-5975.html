			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Swiss bourses to embrace reporting standards code SWITZERLAND's bourses are likely to adopt a code of reporting standards later this year which would require the vast majority of Swiss companies to improve information they make public on their financial health, Reuter reports from Zurich. Mr Giorgio Behr, president of the special commission for recommendations on reporting practices (FER), said: 'With the exception of some 10 groups, all Swiss companies currently quoted on the bourse will have to change and improve their reporting practices.' Switzerland's three bourses are now considering the FER standards and are likely to adopt them this year, he added. The standards, which are based on International Accounting Standards and European Community guidelines, aim to improve the standard of Swiss corporate reports, more renowned for what they hide rather than reveal.</p>

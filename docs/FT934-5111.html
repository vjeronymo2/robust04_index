			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Publishers and retailers united by 'relief factor' - Value Added Tax The chancellor's decision to leave value added tax unchanged was welcomed by many industries yesterday - and by none more enthusiastically than publishers of newspapers, books and magazines, food manufacturers and makers of baby clothes. All these sectors had lobbied hard against the ending of the zero-rated VAT status of their products, which, they argued, would have dampened demand, reduced profits and even driven some companies out of business. There was relief among retailers that the chancellor had ruled out an increase in the standard rate of VAT, which could have damaged consumer confidence during the Christmas season. Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said there could be a 'relief factor' among consumers who had put off spending because of Budget uncertainty. Publishers were pleased by the continuation of zero-rating on reading material, though several fear the VAT issue may return. Mr William Sitwell of the Periodical Publishers' Association said: 'The fight will have to continue.' Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said that if 17.5 per cent VAT had been imposed, national newspapers would have lost 10 per cent of sales and two titles might not have survived. The Publishers' Association said book sales would have fallen 15 per cent. The Food &amp; Drink Federation said the continued zero-rating of almost 80 per cent of food products was 'good news for consumers and the economy' and would particularly benefit poorer people. The Confectionery Consortium for Fair VAT, backed by chocolate makers Cadbury, Mars and Thorntons, expressed disappointment. The companies had wanted VAT to be extended to all food at a special rate of about 8 per cent, to end alleged discrimination against confectionery, which is taxed at the standard rate. Retailers and the textile industry, meanwhile, were celebrating the chancellor's decision not to extend VAT to children's clothing. Storehouse, the retail group which owns BHS, Mothercare and Blazer, said such a move would have been 'bad news for our customers and not terribly good news for us.' A quarter of Storehouse's turnover comes from children's clothing.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Dynamism thrust upon it: The chances of a continued - if sometimes faltering - UK economic recovery are high 'The green shoots of economic spring are appearing once again.'  - Norman Lamont, October 9 1991 'All that Britain is waiting for to achieve recovery is the confidence a Conservative victory will bring. So vote Conservative on Thursday and the recovery will continue on Friday.'  - John Major, April 7 1992 'We are beginning to see recovery. I think it is self-evident from what businesses are saying.'  - John Major, April 22 1993. Green shoots are sprouting. The frost of the UK's long economic winter is thawing. Naturally, the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer are delighted. They even behave as if they were entitled to take credit for this good news. Either they have remarkably short memories or, more likely, they hope the electorate has. Was it not Mr Lamont who argued as recently as August 1992 that devaluation was fool's gold and would lead to higher interest rates, not lower ones? Fortunately for the economy, the chancellor has so far been wrong, not an unprecedented event. But there is one important person, Mr Jacques Delors, who hopes he was right last August. The president of the European Commission is worried about what would happen to the European Community's move to economic and monetary union if the British wagon were to reach stable non-inflationary growth after uncoupling from the train and taking a siding as well. He must be praying the economy goes into the buffers. The people of the UK are bound to view matters rather differently. After a peak-to-trough decline of 4 per cent in non-oil gross domestic product and a recession lasting two and a half years, they feel they have earned their relief. Their travails may have been nothing compared to the collapses in central and eastern Europe, but this has been the longest UK recession since the 1930s. The evidence of recovery is clear. Non-oil GDP was up 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year over the last quarter of 1992, according to preliminary estimates; the volume of retail sales rose 1.6 per cent between the same two quarters; manufacturing output was up 1.2 per cent in the three months to February over the preceding three months; car production has reached its highest March level for 19 years; activity in the housing market has increased at last; business confidence has improved; and seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by 52,000 between January and March, a performance that seems too good to be true, but must mean something. The recession has ended, which is hardly surprising. Over the two years of membership in the European exchange rate mechanism, base rates of interest fell from 15 to 10 per cent. They have fallen by a further 4 percentage points since sterling left the ERM, while the depreciation of the effective exchange rate has been 15 per cent. Moreover, the yield curve now slopes upward, with the redemption yield on 20-year gilts 2 1/2 percentage points above base rate. The loosening of monetary policy has been superimposed on a relaxation of fiscal policy both longstanding and remarkable. The general government financial balance has moved from a surplus of 1 per cent of GDP in 1988-89 to the deficit of 9 per cent forecast by the Treasury for 1993-94. Moreover, about 4 percentage points of this deterioration is structural, not cyclical, according to the February economic survey of the UK by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Some economies are born dynamic; some achieve dynamism; and some have dynamism thrust upon them. The British economy of 1993 falls into the third category. But perhaps, like Malvolio, it is being flattered to be deceived. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, stressed last weekend that Britain is heading for a recovery that would be modest compared with that of the 1980s, though he also hoped it would be better sustained. His view is in line with the latest Treasury forecasts, which are far more cautious than those of a year ago. These are for growth in non-North Sea GDP of 1 1/2 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94, followed by 2 1/4 per cent in 1994-95, 2 3/4 per cent in 1995-96 and 3 per cent in 1996-97. According to the Treasury, the GDP of 1989-90 would not be regained until 1994-95. Some forecasters are still more nervous. The February report from the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters included a lowest forecast of 0.2 per cent for growth between 1992 and this year, followed by a lowest forecast of 1.4 per cent for 1994. Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming (a member of the 'Liverpool six' group of economists, who opposed sterling's membership of the ERM, and the most accurate City forecaster of GDP growth in 1992), argues that there will be no growth between 1992 and this year and 1.1 per cent in 1994. Excellent reasons can be supplied for such caution: the hesitant recoveries of debt-laden industrial countries such as Australia and the US; the German recession now blighting continental Europe; the doubling of UK personal indebtedness in the 1980s and the resultant unwillingness of private individuals to borrow; the roughly 1.7m households with negative housing equity; the losses of commercial banks and consequent unwillingness to lend; the recent sharp reductions in the interest income of the unindebted; and the lost incomes of the unemployed, the principal victims of the recession, not to mention the reduced spending of the millions more who fear unemployment. Many of these sources of weakness are reflected in the low growth of broad money (see chart). Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research - who has won attention by belabouring his seven fellow Treasury panellists over the role of money in the economy - wrote in the February panel report that 'the very low rate of broad money growth now being recorded, combined with the bleak outlook for the world economy, argues that the current weak revival of demand will not be maintained'. Slow monetary growth may not prove that binding a constraint on demand. First, the ratio of broad money to nominal GDP doubled in the course of the 1980s. But recent declines in the real return on money must have reduced the willingness of people to hold this bloated stock. Any such desire for lower holdings of money is likely to leak into demand. Second, the government can always inject additional monetary stimulus. Chances of a continued - if sometimes faltering - recovery must be high. If household demand proves inadequate, the government can relax monetary policy, something that declining interest rates in continental Europe should make relatively easy. Indeed the government's problem is more likely to be an excessively strong currency than a weak one. The benign effects of any normal recovery on unit costs, combined with annual increases in underlying earnings as low as 4 1/2 per cent, should also facilitate recovery, by keeping underlying inflation down, notwithstanding the devaluation. But the fundamental reason why inflation should remain subdued is that output is well below its potential, though nobody knows how far below. Estimates vary hugely, with Patrick Minford of Liverpool University (another Treasury panellist) setting the non-inflationary level of unemployment as low as 1m, which is 2m below its current level. One extreme indication of how far below potential output the economy might be is given by the 2.4 per cent annual growth trend between the cyclical peaks of 1979-80 and 1988-89. Output in these peak years was unsustainable. But if the economy's underlying trend in the last cycle were sustained into the present one, this line, which is 13 per cent above this year's output, ought to be approached before the next downturn. Meanwhile, the OECD estimates that fourth-quarter 1992 GDP was 6.9 per cent below its underlying trend. On either view, the economy ought to be able to grow at some 3 per cent a year for more than a decade. Mr Minford and Mr Congdon argue that with prudent monetary policy the economy can readily sustain such performance. Others, such as Wynne Godley of Cambridge University (another Treasury panellist) and Bill Martin of Phillips &amp; Drew (a member of the 'Liverpool six'), are not so sure, the danger, in their view, resting with one or both of the UK's 'twin deficits', but above all with the external deficit. Judged by the flow of revenue and expenditure, the UK's fiscal position is the worst it has ever been in peacetime. The primary fiscal deficit - the general government borrowing requirement, less interest payments - is 6 per cent of GDP, 2 percentage points higher than in 1974-75 and 1975-76. The present fiscal position simply cannot be sustained for many years. Economic growth and firm control over public spending are the best ways to cure the fiscal disease. Under the Treasury forecasts, the PSBR falls to 3 3/4 per cent by 1997-98, while the ratio of net public-sector debt to GDP almost doubles between 1991-92 and 1997-98. This must be about as bad a performance as the government can hope to get away with. Economic growth will itself help cure the hole in the fiscal accounts. But any recovery led by domestic demand would considerably increase a current account deficit that was already 2 per cent of GDP at the bottom of a deep recession. If the external balance were to deteriorate, there would come a point, many critics fear, when financial markets would panic, sterling would tumble, inflation would soar, the government would be forced to raise interest rates and - hey, presto - the economy would be back in the stop phase of a severe stop-go cycle, for the fourth time since the early 1970s. Whether or not there is a 'balance of payments constraint' is both a controversial and a complex question. But some points should be accepted by any cautious policymaker. First, large swings in real exchange rates are disruptive, principally because output of tradable goods and services cannot be switched on and off like a tap. Second, market expectations can be perverse. Less than five years ago, after all, financial markets were trying to push sterling above DM3.30. Third, making the exchange rate the main tool of disinflation is risky, since the real appreciation inherent in the policy is certain to distort the economy. For this very reason, the policy may also fail to provide a durable route to low inflation. The question is how far the government can manage either the exchange rate or the external account. The answer is that it can do less than many critics believe. But it is not helpless. It can, for example, buttress the exchange rate with other disinflationary instruments: fiscal tightening is the obvious one right now. It can also both stress and take into account the effects upon the real exchange rate of developments in pay and productivity. A real depreciation entails a lowering of the cost of labour relative to the prices of tradable goods and services. A nominal depreciation implies a once-and-for-all rise in the price level. The government should therefore at least articulate its inflation target in terms of underlying domestic costs, not consumer prices. Renewed inflation is what threatens to put an end to growth. The good news is that underlying inflationary pressure is more subdued than for perhaps a quarter of a century. The bad news is that the economy has become exceptionally unbalanced. Domestic demand-led growth would improve the fiscal position, but make the external position worse. In purest theory, the external account might not matter. In practice, it is all too likely to do so. The structure of the economy needs to change in ways that only export-led growth can bring about. This depends, in turn, on sustaining the increased competitiveness granted by devaluation. Sustained recovery is feasible. But the chances of long-term success depend, as always, on the wisdom of the government and the flexibility of the labour market. There must be people willing to bet their shirts on what seem to be two long shots. But how many want to risk going shirtless, even in the spring?</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Arts: Three Shouts from a Hill - Theatre During the 1930s, Sean O'Casey wrote three one-act farces, or as Shakespeare said, 'tedious-brief' scenes of 'tragical mirth'. The three have been gathered by the O'Casey Theater Company, and are touring as Three Shouts from a Hill. The Lilian Baylis Theatre offers a plain setting for the traditional, realistic sets which O'Casey favoured. The acting is lively and precise and Shivaun O'Casey's direction well paced. But it takes a singular view of laughter to smile at any of this. Nor is it the fault of play or players, merely the genre. The idea of farce here is Henri Bergson's: that the comic in life emanated from human lack of control over self or surroundings. Thus the banana skin, and thus Samuel Beckett's best Irish banana joke in Krapp's Last Tape. When Beckett saw these plays, he applauded 'the triumph of the principle of knockabout'. The first, The End of the Beginning is piece of light rural hilarity about Darry and his wife Lizzie. They reverse roles. She mows the meadow while he tackles the domestic chores. Darry sets to, but his brother appears, distracts him, and things get out of control. Crockery smashes, lights fuse, oil leaks, and a heifer is tethered to a precarious slope by means of a rope down the chimney and lashed to a chair. This farce knows how to waste time and shows other people wasting it, frittering away their lives by the minute. Much better is the second piece, A Pound on Demand, a short sketch set in a Pimlico Post Office. This amounts to a one-line joke teased into a thirty-minute scene of excruciating delay. Two Irishmen, one drunk, lurch into this Post Office and ask for 'A Pound on demand' from their savings account. But the drawer is too drunk to sign his own name, and spends the entire scene trying to write. O'Casey's sense that drunks hold bystanders universally responsible for institutional rules is sharp and accurate. The Post Office staff, customers, and an inevitable policeman compound the situation. Bedtime Story lies pillowed in the arms of Catholic guilt about sex. The boarding-house or bachelor flat is familiar O'Casey territory. Johnjo Mulligan, a clerk, meets Angela Nightingale, a gay lass; Daniel Halibut, clerk and friend to Johnjo, and Miss Mossie, the lodging house keeper, look on. A policeman and nurse wait in the wings. The plot moves forward predictably. After their bedroom assignation, Angela works on Johnjo's sexual guilt, claims she has lost her handbag, and waltzes off into the night with his money, coat and umbrella. The distraught Johnjo pursues, but Halibut and Mossie think he's sleepwalking, and summon the authorities. This is never more than mildly amusing, nor meant to be, but does cast up some funny lines: 'This isn't disarray, Mr Halibut, it's an upheaval.' Lilian Baylis Theatre until October 17; then Glasgow, Belfast, New York and Philadelphia.</p>

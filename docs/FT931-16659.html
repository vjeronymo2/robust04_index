			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Old ways dull the call to a new Ukraine: Chrystia Freeland and Edward Balls on reluctance to reform ONE OF the former Soviet Union's few military-industrial enterprises that could make a relatively smooth transition to the market economy is Ukraine's Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev. But its director, Mr Yuri Makarov, seems in no hurry to usher in the new era. Mr Makarov is reported to be giving no encouragement to western companies keen to place million-dollar orders for double-hulled oil tankers with the shipyard. 'Tankers are just empty boxes with nothing like the technical sophistication of an aircraft carrier,' Mr Makarov says, with a disdainful nod toward the bulky oil tankers which can fetch Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m) a piece. Instead, with fond memories of the shipyard's more glamorous past, he says: 'Building an aircraft carrier - now that's true technology.' Mr Makarov, a bulky, genial man edging towards retirement, finds it difficult to accept that, with little prospect of military orders from Ukraine's bankrupt and inflation-plagued government, the days of building giant aircraft carriers are gone - at least for the foreseeable future. Low labour costs and an upsurge in demand for double-hulled oil tankers in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill might just make it possible for the Black Sea Shipyard - in a leaner and partly privatised incarnation with a foreign partner - to make a profit. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considering offering finance and help in the restructuring if the shipyard spins off its tanker and marine production facilities into a separate private venture. The EBRD estimates that if the privatised arm of the factory were to sell three tankers and 2,500 tonnes of marine chain a year it could operate profitably while more of its plant is converted to non-military production. 'Military conversion is a priority area for the EBRD,' says Mr Ron Freeman, first vice- president for merchant banking. 'But, as you can see from the Nikolayev project, management commitment is paramount before anything can go ahead.' The yard's deputy director, Mr Boris Goldberg, is eager to adopt the EBRD plan, despite the hostility of the director, and says he is ready to lay off up to 40 per cent of the workforce to make the factory more efficient. He has powerful supporters. Mr Anatoli Kinakh, the Ukraine government's regional representative in Nikolayev and a man of considerable influence in Ukraine's centralised polity, backs the partial privatisation and conversion of the shipyard and insists the deal will go ahead. The yard itself is littered with piles of metal, the remains of an aircraft carrier which took six years to build - and six months to dismantle for scrap. Towering over them is the graceful but unfinished Variah, the Viking, which was 65 per cent completed when the Ukrainian government decided to stop pouring money into a ship that it was unlikely ever to use or sell. A minority of the workforce is building trawlers for which no market exists, but most are idle and absent. 'This is what conversion means for us,' Mr Makarov says as he walks across the abandoned, rusting skeleton of the Variah. 'Everything is lying dead.' The profligate ways of Mr Vitolv Fokin, Ukraine's recently ousted prime minister, have given the Black Sea Shipyard, like the rest of the country's lumbering state sector, the luxury of hesitation. Over the past six months, the Black Sea Shipyard has received Rbs3bn in unbacked bank credits at an interest rate of 5 per cent a year, according to government officials. These cheap loans allow Mr Makarov to pay his 25,000 employees the generous salary of Rbs18,000 a month and mourn the passing of the cold war. Mr Makarov's story is a familiar one in Ukraine. Over the past year the government has issued more than Rbs1,100bn in credit to prop up the inefficient state sector and prevent politically difficult bankruptcies and lay-offs. The result is the creeping hyperinflation, now more than 30 per cent a month, which threatens to undermine Ukraine's fledgling currency, the coupon. 'If net credit emission does not soon cease, it will seriously undermine the government's stabilisation policy,' says Mr Oleh Havrylyshyn, deputy minister of finance. Mr Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's new and reform-minded prime minister, has said large-scale credits to state industries must stop. But Mr Havrylyshyn suspects that in November, while Mr Kuchma was recovering from a thyroid operation, the central bank ignored his moratorium on the emission of new credit. Moreover, last month the government issued a further Rbs229bn in subsidies to coal and agriculture which will push the budget deficit toward 40 per cent of gross domestic product for 1992. Such monetary credits would have to be stopped if Ukraine is to bring inflation under control and meet the strict monetary targets the International Monetary Fund is demanding as a condition of western aid. Ukrainian officials say the IMF, which recently sent a mission to Kiev, wants Ukraine to pare its budget deficit down to 6 per cent of GDP next year and inflation to 3 per cent in the last quarter of 1993. Yet chastened by the political difficulties provoked by orthodox monetary policies in Russia, Ukrainian reformers are worried about the political consequences of forcing state factories to break their addiction to government subsidies overnight. World Bank economists in Ukraine, say that a combination of stabilisation, liberalisation and western aid is needed to finance the budget deficit without printing money. But for the 50 or 60 largest enterprise in the country, in particular the large loss-makers, the government should prepare individual plans to phase out subsidies gradually, thus giving the private sector time to grow and soak up unemployment.</p>

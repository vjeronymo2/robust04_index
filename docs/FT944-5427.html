			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Chancellor closes loophole  -Index-linked securities A recently-discovered tax loophole, which could have allowed investors to make unlimited tax-free capital gains from UK share price movements, was one of the casualties of the Budget. The chancellor acted swiftly to prevent further investment managers following the path beaten by Fidelity last month when its Special Values investment trust issued equity index-linked loan stock. The stock - used to provide gearing for the trust - was structured so that it was both a qualifying corporate bond, making it exempt from capital gains tax, and a qualifying indexed security, which meant that gains were exempt from income tax, too. Most qualifying indexed securities are linked to the retail price index, or some other measure of inflation, but the present rules also allow for linkage to a UK equity index. The Fidelity stock was linked to the FT-SE-A All-Share index, so that the value of each unit moved up and down in line with the index and the interest payments on the stock reflected the index's present yield. This made it very attractive to private investors, particularly those who use up their annual CGT allowance. Such loan stocks are a simple, low-cost, relatively low-risk way to track UK share price movements. And - until this week - any gains would have been exempt from both income tax and CGT although interest payments were taxable normally. Accountant Price Waterhouse said: 'This was an ingenious idea, but it is not surprising that it has not lasted very long.' Explaining the measure, the Inland Revenue said: 'Securities linked to a UK share index have been issued which can benefit from both the qualifying corporate bond exemption from capital gains tax, and the deep gains exemption for qualifying indexed securities. 'The result is that profits on disposal of such securities would generally not be liable to tax. This could lead to significant loss of tax and to distortion in the investment market.' So, the rules are to be changed so that securities linked to a share price index cannot qualify as corporate bonds. The loophole has been closed with immediate effect, and even those who bought the loan stock before the Budget will have to pay CGT when they sell it. It is, of course, still possible to make use of your annual CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800, rising to Pounds 6,000 next year. Fidelity was the first to spot and exploit the loophole, but it is believed other investment managers were thinking of using it. Other investment trusts have issued index-linked loan stock structured differently, so gains are liable either to CGT or income tax. Index-linked loan stocks are still attractive if you are looking for a low-cost index-tracking instrument, as they do not carry the sort of annual charges made by index-tracking unit trusts. But private investors generally should avoid the type of loan stock where gains are subject to income tax.</p>

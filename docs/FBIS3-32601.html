Therefore, we ask that those parties, the government, the  Army, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80], accept the following  commitments as a peace mechanism:  <H5>  Commitments by the Army </H5>   1. Immediate suspension of offensive military actions in the  country's northern area.    2. Withdrawal of soldiers currently deployed in the northern  area to the area headquarters.    3. Appointment of a team of high-ranking officers comprised  of at a maximum three who are not on duty in the region to form  a special committee to investigate and clear up publicly any  complaints regarding human rights violations in the north.    4. Establishment pari passu of a plan for the gradual  withdrawal of the soldiers assigned to the northern area, to  include the disarmament of FN 3-80 personnel.    5. Public commitment to guarantee the lives of those who  have laid down their arms and the personal safety of FN 3-80  personnel.  <H5>  Commitments by the FN 3-80 </H5>   1. Immediate suspension of offensive military actions in the  country's northern area.    2.

Public commitment to permanent reintegration into  civilian life.  <H5>  Commitments by the Government and Social Action Ministries </H5>   1. Increase the number of National Police personnel in the  northern area, and prepare them technically, civically, and  morally to improve security guarantees and public order in the  area.    2.

Creation of a core development area in the north with  clearly established fiscal resources to alleviate poverty and  reactivate productive activities.    4. Appointment of a team of high-ranking officials to form  the special committee mentioned above designed to investigate  and elucidate publicly complaints regarding human rights  violations in the north.    Commitments by the CIAV-OAS, Cardinal Obando y Bravo's  Verification Commission, the Permanent Committee for the Defense  of Human Rights, and the  <H5>  Nicaraguan Human Rights Association </H5>   1. Active participation in negotiating and supervising full  compliance with the agreements.    2. Participation in the peace activities promoted by the  special committee, which will be comprised of civilians chosen  by His Eminence Cardinal Miguel Obando in addition to all other  personnel mentioned above.    3. The Special Pro-Peace Committee will act as a mediator  with other armed groups so that they sign similar agreements,  thus attaining complete understanding among residents of the  northern area.    If all parties endorse said commitments and accept  implementation of this peace plan, we will solemnly celebrate  this event, which we hope will make history, in the presence of  those people who have contributed their reflections and  experiences, as well as representatives of countries and  international organizations that have expressed their intention  to contribute to this peace plan.

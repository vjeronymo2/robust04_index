			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODER ON FEDERAL DEBT AND POLITICS  </P> <P> How surprising that, as Broder writes, the Washington media have finally  discovered that our politicians are dismantling our government infrastructure.  All in the name of the Reaganite slogan: "The government is the problem, not  the solution." On the one hand, using governmental apparatus to freeze out  services and dismantling programs, while with the other hand, rewarding the  super-rich with steep tax cuts, and opening the door to greedy henchmen.  </P> <P> But, Broder myopically puts the blame on all politicians, forgetting that the  Democratic Party standard-bearers were defeated in three straight presidential  elections for proposing taxes where needed. The Republicans mercilessly  describing them as wanting to "tax, tax -- spend, spend."  </P> <P> He should put the blame where it belongs: "Read my lips -- no new taxes!"  </P> <P> JOSEPH SIMON  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

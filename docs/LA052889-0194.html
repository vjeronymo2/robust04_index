			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW WAY TO GET CAMPING SPACES  </P> <P> Prospective campers at California state parks and visitors to Hearst Castle may  now use an Automatic Teller Machine card to make reservations. (Contact your  ATM provider to make sure that it is participating.)  </P> <P> A deferred payment plan allows phone-in reservations without use of a credit  card. This plan is used like credit card reservations through Visa or  MasterCard, except that no credit card is necessary.  </P> <P> The person making the reservation phones the Mistix reservation number, (800)  444-7252 in California, and asks for a deferred payment reservation. For more  information on the deferred payment plan, call the Mistix customer service  office at (619) 452-5956.  </P> <P> All phone-in reservations for family campsites or Hearst Castle tours may be  made as early as eight weeks in advance. Reservations also may be made as late  as the day before the proposed date. But deferred-payment reservations must be  made no later than 10 days before the reservation date.  </P></p>

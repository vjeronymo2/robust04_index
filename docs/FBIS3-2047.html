			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Mu (1728 3092): "To Implement Decision By the CPC </F> Central Committee, the Government Work Report to NPC Session  Will Announce a 20-Character Guideline"]    [Text] The Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC], scheduled for 10 March, is an important  meeting designed to implement the "Decision on Several Issues  Relating to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  Structure" (the "50 Articles"), which was adopted by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to  nominate 1994 as a year of crucial importance to reform. It is  also a large- scale policymaking meeting designed to keep the  economic growth momentum stable, strive for resumption of  China's status as a GATT signatory state, expand cross-strait  relations to make innovative advances, and accelerate the  construction of the Shanghai, Bohai Bay, and Three-Gorges  Projects.  <H5>  Why Did All Party Elder Statesmen Make Public Appearances? </H5>   The current session will place greater stress on the  principle of "doing two types of work simultaneously, attaching  equal importance to both," upholding social stability and the  correct guidance of public opinion and, while taking economic  construction as the center, maintaining the position of the CPC  as a ruling party, ensuring the steady and orderly progress of  political structural reform, and preventing the emergence of  unnecessary social disturbances. Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun,  Peng Zhen, and other CPC elder statesmen made public appearances  one after another before and after the Spring Festival. Let me  keep comments on what effects their public appearances produced  to one side for the time being. The public appearances were  intended to clarify rumors about the leaders and stabilize the  overall situation.  <H5>  The New Stage of Rapid Growth </H5>   In recent years, while maintaining a peaceful environment  with surrounding countries and the rest of the world, the CPC  has done its utmost to maintain the mainland's stability,  prevent errors and ups and downs in policymaking, and to  gradually improve the operational mechanism of the market  economy by deepening economic structural reform to ensure  implementation of Deng Xiaoping's line on reform and development  and to strive for a relatively long period of sustained and  rapid development. It is believed that this policy decision  will certainly be accepted by the deputies of the NPC and  members of the CPPCC National Committee. Nevertheless, there  are bound to be lively discussions on such issues as reform  intensity, development priorities, interest readjustment,  anticorruption, and clean government.    During the last 10 days of February, Premier Li Peng held a  State Council plenary session to solicit opinions on the  "Government Work Report." Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the  State Council Research Office, took charge of drafting the  report. It is believed that after broadly soliciting the  opinions of leaders of various party, government, and army  departments, democratic parties and organizations, and various  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the report  will undergo repeated revisions. The gist of the report  is the 20-character principle guiding the work for 1994, which  was decided by top CPC leaders through repeated discussions, the  principle of: "Grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening  wider, promoting development, and stabilizing the overall  situation [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, guoda kaifang, cujin  fazhan, wending daju 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245,  2368 1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 4489 1353 1129  1444]. This principle will be unchangeable.  <H5>  Three Tasks for This Year </H5>   It has been reported that the CPC authorities have made  a plan for this year's economic development: The growth  rate of the national economy will be 9 percent; the general  level of retail price rises will be kept within 10 percent and  the total amounts of currency issued and investment will be kept  lower than last year's increased amounts; financial deficits  will be minimized; and the previous quantitative type speed will  be transformed into a combined speed and efficiency type and the  planned economy based on quota management will be transformed  into a market economic structure based on supply management.    Li Peng holds that the arrangements this year,  though aggressive, allow room for maneuver. It is  necessary to concentrate our attention on the overall  development of the rural economy, efficient operation of  state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises, and the  intensification and improvement of macroeconomic regulation and  control. To make proper arrangements to implement all the  major reformatory measures with the aim of establishing and  perfecting the macroeconomic regulation and control system,  focus should be placed on the reform of the financial and  taxation system and of the banking system; it is necessary to  actively, steadily, and appropriately carry out price reform;  and it is necessary to establish a modern enterprise system that  suits the needs of the developing socialist market economy.    All countries believe that China is bound to emerge as a  first- rate world power in the next century so long as it can  keep the momentum of wholesome development. The American  scholar of Chinese descendant and Nobel Prize for Physics winner  Chen-ning Young said: If China has the qualified personnel it  needs, can maintain discipline, be determined, and has economic  support, it will enjoy greater development. For China, the  first three conditions mentioned above are available in this  century. I am confident that all the four conditions will be  available by the 21st century. For this reason I am absolutely  optimistic about China's prospects for development of science  and technology in the 21st century.  <H5>  Seeking a Balance Between Reform and Stability </H5>   The CPC higher leadership maintains that the most  important task for the forthcoming NPC session is seeking a  harmonious relationship between reform, development, and  stability. While putting forward a major reform plan, it  is necessary to properly solve the problem concerning relations  between the central authorities, on the one hand, and localities  and various departments, on the other; to avoid widening the gap  in income between different localities and strata; to persist in  the long-term effort to fight corruption and promote clean and  honest government; to cope with local eventualities; and to  conscientiously improve public security and social order.  CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau Standing Committee members Li Peng and Zhu  Rongji, and other policy-makers, have reiterated time and  again: the workload will be very heavy this year, and  there will be quite a lot of difficulties. One must be fully  mentally prepared for this. It is necessary for us to work more  cautiously and in a down-to-earth manner. We must solve,  through reform, new problems arising in our way ahead.  Reform is the means, development is our goal, and  stability is the basis. We must make every effort to  stabilize the market, make things convenient for people in their  daily life, and satisfy people's daily needs. Once the supply  of daily subsistence to the people is not ensured, the community  will become unstable. At the moment, we are facing an excellent  situation. But in the meantime, we have seen a lot of "sparks"  too. For instance, evacuation of residents from one site to  another and the migrant laborer tide, as well as other  incidents, may very easily arouse chaos if we fail to pay enough  attention to them on the outset.  <H5>  Public Opinion Should Be Prepared To Be Favorable to Reform </H5>   The CPC held a national meeting on ideological and  propaganda  work in late January. This was not only the first meeting of  this sort ever held over the past 15 years since the reform and  opening up process was initiated, but also the most important  national conference on ideology held since 1957. Jiang Zemin,  Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding Guangen, who is a member of the  CPC Political Bureau and the director of the CPC Central  Committee Propaganda Department, all delivered important  speeches at the meeting. All of them stressed that propaganda  should mainly be dedicated to positive aspects, and should serve  economic construction, and it is necessary to pay attention to  the efforts to guide public opinion and safeguard a political  situation characterized by stability and unity.    Deng Xiaoping repeatedly reminded his colleagues: "We  certainly must attach great importance to work on the  ideological front, this must be done conscientiously and in real  earnest, and it brooks no slackness." "The work on the  ideological front as a whole must be intensified." He demanded  that the party's leading organ devote most of the time and  resources to ideological and political work, while taking charge  of formulation and implementation of principles and policies and  employment of important cadres. At present, as China is  shifting from the planned economy to the market economy, cadres  at different levels have somewhat slackened ideological and  political work, and some problems regarding party style and  general social mood badly need to be dealt with. Jiang  Zemin pointed out: Many party members have failed to keep  up with the new situation, meet the requirements of new tasks,  and keep abreast of rapidly developing and changing objective  reality. Some party members are wavering in their ideals and  faith, and swerving from their former world outlook and value  concepts, while indulging in money worship, creature comforts,  and extreme egoism. Corrupt practices, such as seeking personal  interests by abusing official power, graft, and bribery, have  been spreading. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen and  improve education for party members. It is necessary to  strengthen education with specific aims in mind, uphold the  principle of integration of positive teaching and  self-education, uphold the principle of education according to  the needs of different types of folks and different strata, and  uphold the principle of integration of intensifying education,  tightening administration, and strictly enforcing party  discipline. The CPC authorities demand that ideological  and propaganda work does not create confusion nor cause trouble,  but helps promote economic construction and other works by  enlisting popular support. A million-strong force composed of  theoreticians, journalists, publishers, writers, artists, and  grass-roots propagandists will be formed to serve as the  propeller for reform and opening up.    The rural economy in Shandong province has grown  substantially in recent years. The key to the province's  success is said to lie in intensification of socialist education  in rural areas. This year the province is to start its fourth  round of rural socialist education drive. The province has been  praised by the CPC higher leadership for efforts in this aspect.  This indicates that the CPC is striving very hard to retain the  socialist system with a view to securing its ruling party status  in the long run and preventing a Soviet-type political avalanche  and political evolution. It cannot be denied that this attempt  to stabilize the political situation has been quite effective,  owing to the success in the economic structural reform and  marvelous achievements in economic construction.    This year is the crucial year to determine the prospects for  reform in China through the turn of the century. Deeply  impressed by their past experience in reform, CPC leaders noted  that whenever a major reform of a deep-rooted structure is to be  launched, some members of the public will always anticipate  another round of price hikes, thus starting another round of  panic purchasing. In this connection, Zhu Rongji demanded that  leading cadres at all levels concentrate their efforts on  publicizing and explaining the major reform measures that were  to be introduced, properly prepare public opinion for reform,  dismiss misgivings among the public, iron out conflicts and  resolve problems, enlist the support of the broad masses of  people for reform, and encourage them to play a part in reform.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Is a Gordian Knot </H5>   At present, for the CPC, the Gordian knot of the reform  still  lies in whether a macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism  can be perfected. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "To make the  reform a success, we must carry it out in an organized and  orderly manner. If we fail to do so, the reform will be plunged  into chaos, and everybody will act his own way. This just  cannot be tolerated." And, "to achieve macroeconomic regulation  and control, the central authorities must do what they have said  they would do." "If the CPC central leadership and the State  Council have no authority, they will not be able to keep the  situation under control." Now that we are introducing the  tax division system and reforming the monetary investment  structure, the existing interests distribution pattern will no  doubt undergo a massive restructuring. In the latter half of  last year, the macroeconomic regulation and control operation  under Zhu Rongji's leadership curbed some symptoms of overheated  economic growth and stopped the trend toward "bubble economy"  stemming from the craze in real estate and development zone  projects. Since the "pumping-the-brake" and "soft landing"  strategies were adopted, drastic economic growth and slumps were  avoided and tremendous losses were saved. However, this has not  fundamentally changed the existing investment, banking,  financial and taxation structures under macroeconomic regulation  and control, and the country's capital investment scale remains  colossal. It is reported that 15 international airports are  going to be built in the Zhu Jiang Delta area alone. These are  duplicate construction projects, and running so many projects at  the same time is beyond the country's financial capacity.    Zhu Rongji said: This year, we still have to  continue to intensify and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control measures, and then we will develop a regulation and  risk-control mechanism for investments in fixed assets. The CPC  authorities have decided to assign the newly founded National  Development Bank to exercise centralized control over the volume  of credit extended to finance capital construction projects and  key basic industrial projects. Those projects that have been  suspended and put off as ordered last year must not be restarted  without approval. This year, in principle, no more applications  for starting new projects will be approved. On the other hand,  all localities and departments are required to adopt practical  and effective measures to tighten macroeconomic regulation and  control of investment; they must concentrate their financial and  material resources to ensure completion of key projects; they  must prevent further expansion of construction scale--any  organizations which have started projects without approval, and  their people in charge as well, will be held responsible for  their acts; no financial institutions are allowed to divert  inter-bank loans they have in hand to finance any fixed asset  investment projects; it is necessary to strengthen regular  administration over the capital market, and no financial  institutions are allowed to expand the scale of bond  distribution and the scope of joint-stock system pilot projects;  investments in real estate construction projects and the  financing of such projects must be put under the state plan  regarding investment in fixed assets and related financing; it  is also necessary to strengthen guidance and regular  administration for direct investment projects run by foreign  businessmen. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of  seeking truth from facts and that of acting according to one's  capacity, set store by efficiency and returns, and always bear  in mind the country's overall interests.    Of course, it is necessary to make every effort and  concentrate all resources available to accomplish those  infrastructure projects that have a bearing on the overall  interests and are to meet the urgent needs of economic  development. It is the CPC higher leadership's belief that only  in this way will China be able to seize the opportunity; will it  be able to plan, run, and manage infrastructure projects well in  a centralized manner, based on a rational distribution; and thus  squeeze the greatest returns possible out of the socialist  economy.    Judging from the present situation, the Pudong  development of Shanghai, the economic zones situation on the rim  of the Bohai Bay, and the 3-gorges project are eye-catching key  projects and hot topics.    Under Deng Xiaoping's direct concern and encouragement,  Shanghai municipal leadership has proposed speeding reforms and  development, has taken the lead in constructing a socialist  market economic operating mechanism, and is spearheading reform  and opening up in an attempt to turn Shanghai into one of the  centers of international economy, finance, and trade. Municipal  leaders have also said that they would "train 100  high-ranking party and government leading cadres, 1,000  high-level management talents, and a large number of various  experts."  <H5>  The "Treasury Vault" Around Bohai Bay </H5>   The Bohai Bay Rim region includes the six provinces and  cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, and  Shanxi, all of their economic achievements and growth rates  ranking first in the country. The average GDP of this region is  well over four times the national average; its average social  output value is 4.5 times higher than the national average.  Turnover of its major ports account for 38 percent of the  national volume; steel output 37 percent; crude oil output 41  percent; and agricultural output 24 percent, while it has only  18 percent of the country's farmland. Experts around the world  look at the Bohai Bay rim region as a "treasury vault" with the  greatest value for future economic development. The total  deposits of iron, petroleum, and natural gas, and three of the  110 kinds of minerals discovered so far, respectively account  for 44 percent, 37 percent, or 24 percent of the country's  totals; while deposits of gold and diamonds amount respectively  to 20 percent and 97 percent of the country's totals. Here there  is a first-rate air, sea, and land transport network, and here  is the golden zone connecting East and North Asia, not to  mention the 4.2 million or so scientists and technologists, who  make the region a place with the highest concentration of  scientific and technological talents in the country. The  Bohai Bay rim zone is estimated to become the "spearhead" for  economic development in China's northern region.    The 3-gorges hydropower nexus project--reputed to be a  first-  class world engineering feat--is now in the early-phase work  preparatory stage. Development, resettlement, investment,  works, and management offices have moved onto the site, and the  official inauguration of construction is not far away. Li Peng  stressed that it is a world first-class project and must have  first-class work quality and modern management.  <H5>  Legislature No Longer a Rubber-stamp </H5>   As a range of significant reformist programs are going to be  unveiled this year, corresponding legislative work has also  picked up speed; especially reformist legislation revolving  around the construction of a modern corporate system, finance,  taxation, banking, foreign trade, and the planned investment  system; and establishing a market circulation and social  security system--all these will be submitted to the National  People's Congress [NPC] and its standing committees for  deliberation. This will correct the phenomenon where  legislation work falls behind.  <H5>  Why Was the Meeting Advanced </H5>   There have been reports that the bills the current NPC will  deliberate on include "a state budget law," "protection for  Taiwan businessmen's investment," and so on. A casual perusal  will tell us that the Eighth NPC session had been advanced more  than once from the date when it was usually convened in the  past--it has been moved from the second to the first half of  March. It is understood that the reason behind this was that  the NPC session last year did not end until the middle and  second half of April, and almost six months had passed before  delegates returned to their provinces, cities, and counties.  From this we know that the state plan and financial revenue and  expenditure budget had been conveyed to all levels when it was  being tabled at the NPC. The deliberation and adoption of the  budget at the session therefore did give one the feeling of a  "rubber stamp." Many NPC delegates shared such a view. And  strengthening NPC legislative functions is one of the major  agendas in Deng Xiaoping's political reforms. Slowly advancing  the NPC session convening date to such a time, when effective  supervision can be pursued over the annual economic plan  proposed by the State Council--this is aimed at establishing the  authority of the country's highest legislature. There have been  reports that in the future the convocation of the NPC session  may be advanced to as early as early in the year.</p>

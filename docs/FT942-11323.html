			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US-Canada beer deal The US and Canada yesterday settled part of their long running dispute over beer when Canada agreed to allow US brewers to bypass the government distribution system and deliver their products to private stores in Quebec. Agreement was also reached on changes to British Columbia's policies on beer warehousing and distri-bution. The two sides were unable to settle on a minimum price for beer in a number of Canadian provinces, although they agreed to continue trying to resolve the dispute.</p>

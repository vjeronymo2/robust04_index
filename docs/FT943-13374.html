			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Roads agency to shed 500 jobs The Highways Agency, the organisation set up just three months ago to manage England's motorways and trunk roads, yesterday announced plans to cut both its staff numbers and budget by more than a fifth. The agency, which is responsible for the implementation of the Pounds 2bn annual road-building and maintenance programme, is to shed 500 jobs as part of a cost-cutting programme aimed at saving Pounds 20m a year. It will close 13 of its 21 regional offices. Managers will be hardest hit with 30 per cent of senior posts abolished. Less than 20 per cent of junior staff jobs will go. Most of the reductions in the workforce of 2,400 should be achieved by voluntary redundancy. The result of these moves will be to reduce the agency's annual budget of Pounds 83m by Pounds 20m in 1996-97. The restructuring will be completed in the first half of next year. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the re-organisation was the final stage of a programme aimed at speeding up the planning and construction of roads. The agency suffers from high overheads because of the complexity of its regional structure. Communications between departments are slow and it is inflexible in responding to the peaks and troughs of highway works. A single office to oversee the road-building programme will be set up in the west Midlands, replacing the 10 offices used at present. Four regional offices to manage and maintain the road network will be established. These will be in Leeds for northern England; in Bedford for central England; Dorking in Surrey for southern England, with a branch office in Exeter, Devon; and in London. Offices which will close include Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, Bristol, Nottingham and Coventry.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STATE DELAYS DECISION ON SAN ONOFRE DISCHARGE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD MAY HOLD A JOINT HEARING  WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE POLLUTION VIOLATIONS.  </P> <P> The state Regional Water Quality Control Board on Monday tabled a decision  about whether the San Onofre nuclear plant is violating its federal  pollutant-discharge permit.  </P> <P> The status report briefing was prompted by a presentation made in October by  two students from the Environmental Law Clinic of the University of San Diego  School of Law, who asked the water board to respond to the findings of a  15-year, $46-million study that show the plant is violating two sections of its  discharge permit, which the water board has the power to issue or revoke.  </P> <P> The students requested that the water board revoke San Onofre's permit until  Southern California Edison reduces the amount of sea water sucked into and  spewed out of the plant -- now 200 million gallons a minute -- by building  cooling towers.  </P> <P> Instead, the water board resolved only to consider holding a joint hearing on  the issue with the California Coastal Commission, which created the Marine  Review Committee in 1974 to compile the extensive report on the nuclear plant.  The commission is weighing a variety of options to soften what the report found  to be substantial environmental damage caused by the nuclear plant.  </P> <P> The briefing room for Monday's meeting quickly became a battleground, however.  </P> <P> On one side were two Edison officials and four paid Edison consultants, as well  as one of the report's authors, who was assigned to the committee to represent  the utility's interests. On the other side were the two law students and  another of the report's authors, who represented the environmentalists' views  on the committee.  </P> <P> Frank L. Melone, an Edison environmental affairs spokesman, suggested that the  Marine Review Committee study would not withstand the scrutiny of the  scientific community at large, and he compared it to the work of two Utah  scientists who recently claimed that they had discovered cold nuclear fusion --  a contention that is now largely dismissed by physicists.  </P> <P> "The work those two individuals had done has since that time undergone peer  review, and their claims just didn't hold up," Melone said, clearly suggesting  that the MRC study could meet the same fate.  </P> <P> But Dr. William W. Murdoch, a biologist with the University of California at  Santa Barbara and one of three authors of the study, called Melone's assertion  ludicrous.  </P> <P> "That's silly. If you're going to argue with science, you should argue by  bringing in results that support your view," he said, pointing out that the MRC  study was conducted by more than 100 scientists and reviewed independently by  another 100 biologists and other marine experts before the final report was  released in August.  </P> <P> And Dr. Rimmon C. Fay, who represented environmentalists' interests on the  committee, said the report's results are accurate.  </P> <P> "Enough samples were counted that you could have confidence in the results  according to statistical data," he said. "So it's good evidence."  </P> <P> Among the adverse effects the report found is a 60%, or 200-acre, reduction in  the area covered by the nearby San Onofre kelp bed. The report also found that  the plant's cooling system sucks up and kills 21 tons to 57 tons of fish  yearly, then discharges debris-filled water into the ocean, reducing natural  light levels on the ocean floor by as much as 16%.  </P></p>

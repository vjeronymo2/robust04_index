			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / US plans increased access to phone lines THE Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken a big step towards stimulating competition in the monopolistic local telephone system with a proposal which would force service providers to allow rivals to plug into their networks, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The FCC, which oversees the US telecommunications industry, would like to see the plan adopted within the next year. It would primarily benefit independent telephone companies which have sprung up in cities and which use new fibre optic lines to link businesses and long-distance telephone carriers. The independents allow customers to connect to long distance networks much more cheaply that the local monopolies, which rely on long distance charges for much of their revenues. The plan will initially cover private, or 'special access" lines used by companies to connect their own buildings.</p>

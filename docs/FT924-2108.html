			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Dean Smith &amp; Grace to close THE managing director of Dean Smith &amp; Grace, the Yorkshire machine tool company due to be closed by its US owner in June, is trying to organise a management buyout. Ohio-based Monarch Machine Tool said last week it planned to relinquish ownership of the Keighley-based company, which was founded in 1865 and is one of the great names of the UK machine tool industry. Dean Smith &amp; Grace is best known for its computer-controlled lathes. It employs 82 people in its factory, but that is being reduced to 60. It also has a foundry at Keighley employing 41 people. The company employed more than 300 staff in 1990, but is heavily dependent on the UK market and has suffered badly in the recession - sales last year were Pounds 3.5m against Pounds 10m in 1989. Mr Richard Hole, managing director for the past 17 years, is talking to financial institutions in Leeds about a possible buyout. Mr Hole said yesterday that trading had been sluggish since the company completed two large orders in the UK, but in the past six weeks he had detected 'the odd flicker' of life in the UK machine tool market. The company had a Pounds 1m-plus order book. The company has recently been successful with sales to the Middle East oil industry, helping to reduce dependence on the UK to 70 per cent.</p>

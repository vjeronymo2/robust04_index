			<p>BFN     [Text] A correspondent of the Yemeni News Agency, SABA',  has reported that our Armed Forces, which are defending unity  and constitutional legitimacy, are eager, in the course of their  confrontation and pursuit of the remnants of secessionists and  separatists, to deal with the residents of the areas in which  military operations are carried out in a friendly, fraternal,  and humane manner.    The agency's correspondent, who is currently stationed in  the  axis of Abyan-al-'Alam-Aden, added that he noticed that our  Armed Forces operating in the battlefields in this axis are  eager not to harm our people in these areas, which are being  purged of separatist forces. The correspondent went on to say:  Our forces are making a deliberate effort to avoid damage to  vital and service facilities that serve people in these areas.  He pointed to the damage caused to economic installations, as  well as the destruction of all vital facilities carried out by  the secessionist gang so that citizens may not benefit from  them. For example, in the first days of the secessionist gang's  unleashing of the crisis, it cut off the power supply feeding  Abyan from Aden in retaliation against its heroic sons for the  nationalist unity-orientated positions they have taken, for  their confrontation of this gang's secessionist plan, and also  for the support they have lent to the forces of unity and  legitimacy, which are valiantly confronting the destructive  secessionist plan announced by the war criminal, agent, and  traitor 'Ali al-Bid. Furthermore, several other economic  facilities and service installations became targets of  aggressive bombardment by the secessionist and separatist forces  when they were compelled to retreat and withdraw from their  positions. This reflects the malicious spirit and destructive  instincts of this criminal secessionist gang.</p>

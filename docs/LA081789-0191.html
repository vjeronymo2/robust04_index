			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON WHEELS: SOME LOOK FOR GAS PRICES, JUST IN THE KNICK OF TIME  </P> <P> My gas tank may be nearly empty, as usual, but at least my mailbox is full.  </P> <P> Orange County drivers still have plenty to say on several subjects that we've  discussed in this column recently, including fueling up: when, where and how we  do it, and what can happen if we don't.  </P> <P> "I hate spending time waiting in gas lines, so I drive until I'm almost on  empty," writes Ping Gee of Anaheim, a woman after my own heart. Since she  traded in her old car for a new -- and unfamiliar -- one a couple of months  ago, she says: "I'm not too sure where 'empty' actually is. The manual says 15  gallons, but the most I have put in is 14.08 gallons." (If that's true, Ms.  Gee, then I would say that you run it down way below "almost empty.")  </P> <P> "I use the trip odometer," Gee continues, "to gauge how far I actually drive  between fill-ups, so fortunately I won't really run out of gas." (Hey, my  philosophy is, if you've still got .92 of a gallon stashed away, you're good  for a week.)  </P> <P> Gee says she always pays cash, pumps her own gas and usually sticks to one  brand because "they tend to have the cheapest name-brand gasoline." However,  she has found price variations of several cents per gallon even within that  same brand, so she tries to avoid the pricier ones, unless she's desperate.  </P> <P> "My husband just rolls his eyes when I point out which gas station we should go  to when we're out and about, but I figure, why should we pay up to 10 cents  more per gallon of gas, when one of the cheaper stations is in the vicinity  that we're headed to? Of course, he always points out that the most I'm going  to save anyway is about 60 cents. Big deal! But 60 cents per fill-up is a big  deal when I'm filling up once every 10 days. Since my work commute is only six  miles, most people would save a lot more than I do, since they commute  further."  </P> <P> But Marilyn Vanderwarf of Garden Grove points out that not everyone has the  choice of saving with self-serve. "It is impossible for me to use self-service  due to rheumatoid arthritis. Prices per gallon of gas for full-service are much  higher; the difference between full- and self-service is as much as 10 to 30  cents per gallon. Consequently, the customer who cannot use self-service is  penalized by the high cost of full-service.  </P> <P> Good point. We make spaces for people with handicaps to park their cars, so why  couldn't some gas stations offer assistance and/or a price break when they fill  up?  </P> <P> Several readers wrote about the times when they tried to keep going on nothing  but fumes. Henry C. Meyer of Laguna Beach remembered the time that he and his  friends, Howie and Stu, were on the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles, climbing  up Sepulveda Pass.  </P> <P> "About a hundred feet from the crest . . . the big car began to buck and  stutter. 'I forgot to get gas!' Howie exclaimed. Stu let out a long wail.  'Howie,' I yelled, 'put her in neutral; maybe we can coast over the top.'  </P> <P> "That's what he did and pulled over to the far right lane. Slower and slower  the overpass approached. Would we make it? 50 . . . 45 . . . 40 . . . 35. We  all hunched over forward, like cutting down the wind resistance. At 25, we  groaned. Would we make it, already in the shadow of the overpass? 25 . . . 20 .  . . 15. We were over!"  </P> <P> Fortunately, there was a gas station at the bottom of the hill, and they  coasted -- "neat as you please" -- right up to the pump.  </P> <P> After enduring my lecture on seat belts, Jeff Draugelis of Newport Beach wrote  to say that he's a true believer in buckling up. Draugelis says that he  believes that "driving with seat belts can make one a better driver. Not to  insist that there is an absence of a threat of harm, but to declare a  different, assured attitude toward the art of driving. I feel more confident  and certain of my actions and reactions."  </P> <P> Draugelis says he comes from a family of bucklers. "I do believe it is a  genuine example of both intelligence and concern for one's self and for others  with whom one shares the highways."  </P> <P> He says he began to appreciate seat belts about 10 years ago when he delivered  cars all over Southern California for a leasing company. Buckling up, he says,  gave him a "relaxed assuredness" whether he was behind the wheel of a Fiesta or  a Ferrari.  </P> <P> "I have owned three automobiles. . . . I tend to keep them quite a while and  maintain them well. Just as each car was unique in its road manners, each had a  different type of seat-belt system," Draugelis says. His first, a 1970 Cutlass  Supreme, had a three-point, two-strap setup. "I really liked this one. A driver  truly got the impression he was buckling up for a 'race' for sheer survival.  Though the belts hampered freedom of normal movement, they made up for that  deficiency by making their presence absolutely known."  </P> <P> His two other cars have had passive restraint systems, which Draugelis prefers.  "I have yet to drive a vehicle with the new, motorized belts that 'entrap' you  -- not my terminology or sentiment. But I'm looking forward to such an  encounter."  </P> <P> Ken Daily of the California Highway Patrol's San Juan Capistrano station passed  along some new seat-belt statistics. In case the other arguments for seat belts  haven't swayed you, here is one that might: CHP officers wrote 616,701  citations in 1988 -- more than 50,000 a month -- for violations of the  seat-belt law. (The fine is $20 for the first offense, $50 for a subsequent  offense -- plus court costs and assessments, which can be several times the  amount of the fine itself, depending on the court and the judge.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking Like New  </P> <P> Do you wash your car often? Or do you wait until the kids can write graffiti in  the dust? We would like to know about your car-cleaning habits, inside and out.  Do you wash it yourself? What kind of cleaner works best? Do you insist on a  chamois or will paper towels and rags do just as well? Maybe you go to a  carwash. Or do you prefer having your car detailed?  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Little Road Music  </P> <P> What's the sound track for your daily commute? Do you prefer rock to get you  going, or easy-listening to calm your nerves? Maybe you keep it on the all-news  channel. Tell us what you like to listen to when you drive and why.  </P> <P> Send your comments to Life on Wheels, Orange County Life, The Times, 1375  Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.

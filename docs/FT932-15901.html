			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / ICL profits halved by competition ICL, the UK-based computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, saw profits before tax almost halved last year because of the price competition and harsh market conditions afflicting almost every computer manufacturer today. Revenues, however, rose 32 per cent and the company generated net cash flow from operations of Pounds 240m. Profits before interest and tax were Pounds 60.6m, compared with Pounds 78.9m last year, a decline of 23 per cent. Profits before tax were Pounds 38.6m, compared with Pounds 62.4m last year, a down 38 per cent. Revenues rose Pounds 2.48bn from Pounds 1.87bn last year. Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, said most of the growth was the result of the consolidation of acquisitions including Nokia Data and Sorbus. Organic growth was probably only 5 per cent. The overall market, however, was either flat or in decline, implying the company had performed well to show growth at all. ICL spent Pounds 242m on research and development in 1992, 8.5 per cent more than in 1991, chiefly in the development of new personal computer models manufactured by the Nokia data subsidiary. It is now a significant player in the European PC market. Net debt at December 31 was Pounds 94.2m, equivalent to a gearing of 35 per cent after capital expenditure, acquisitions, rationalisation costs and financing charges. ICL's results are of more than academic interest to the London market because of Fujitsu's intention to float at least 25 per cent of the company at a minimum price of 225p a share by 1995. Plans for the flotation are still on track, Mr Bonfield said. Advisers and merchant bankers had been appointed. Mr Keith Todd, director of finance, said operating expenses had been driven down from 25 per cent in 1991 to 23 per cent last year and further improvement was expected in 1993. Lex, Page 20</p>

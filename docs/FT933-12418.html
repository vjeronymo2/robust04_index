			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Hyundai Motor compromise on pay accepted WORKERS at Hyundai Motor yesterday approved, by a slim margin, a compromise wage agreement that is likely to end action that has disrupted South Korea's largest industrial group for 50 days. Hyundai Motor is the largest of nine Hyundai companies that have been on strike since early June. The other companies are expected to end their disputes next week. The wage pact followed an 11th-hour agreement reached after the government ordered workers to suspend their strike and threatened to impose a settlement. The government has been angered by the long strike, which has caused almost Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) in lost exports and Dollars 1.25bn in lost production, when most other companies' workers have agreed to accept moderate pay increases this year as part a programme to revitalise the ailing economy. The lukewarm response to the Hyundai Motor agreement, which was approved by a bare majority of 50.09 per cent of the company's 29,500 workers, reflected dissatisfaction that many of their demands were not achieved. The Hyundai Motor workers, who are among the highest paid in South Korea, were forced to accept the company's pay offer of a 4.7 per cent increase instead of the 16.5 per cent they sought. In exchange, they received increased fringe benefits, including longer holidays and housing subsidies and other allowances. The workers were also forced to drop proposals to increase their bargaining position, including the introduction of a union shop and a greater say in management and hiring policies though the Hyundai trade unions are among the most militant in the country.  The government has also blamed Hyundai's 'authoritarian' management style for the persistent labour problems affecting the group. Mr Chun Song-won, president of Hyundai Motor, said he would try to improve management-labour relations, as a result of the dispute. The remaining Hyundai companies engaged in industrial action include Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, Hyundai Electrical Engineering, Hyundai Wood Industries, Hyundai Pipe, Hyundai Construction Equipment and Korea Flange.</p>

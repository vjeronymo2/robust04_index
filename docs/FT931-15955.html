			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Markets: Tied agents and 'best advice' - Serious Money PREPARE to strengthen your letterboxes. National Westminster customers will already have received some mailshots from their bank's new life arm, and more are sure to follow. With more than 1,400 unit trusts in existence, the world is not crying out for another nine, but that is what NatWest is giving us. The range is much as you would expect: UK general, UK income, UK equity growth, gilt and fixed interest, Japan, Far East, Europe and North America, with a fund of funds on top. But cost-cutting initiatives in charging have passed NatWest Life by. Initial charges are 5.25 per cent across the range (even on the gilt trust, where many managers have cut upfront fees or even abolished them). Annual fees are mostly 1.25 per cent with the exceptions of the gilt fund, where the annual fee is only 0.5 per cent, and the fund of funds, where a 0.5 per cent charge is levied on top of the fee imposed by the underlying trusts. Other trusts, such as Gartmore's. impose lower fees and aim to track the index. Since most actively managed funds have failed to beat the index in the past, one might imagine that an adviser giving 'best advice' would find it hard to recommend the NatWest unit trusts ahead of lower charging trusts, or indeed trusts with exceptional long-term track records such as Capability Special Situations (see pIV). Under a section 'How do I choose a unit trust?', the NatWest brochure explains: 'A meeting with your NatWest adviser should give you the necessary information to help you determine a suitable choice.' However, elsewhere in the brochure, we learn: 'Your NatWest adviser is only able to supply information on the packaged products of the said marketing group'. In other words, your adviser can only 'advise' on products offered by NatWest Life. So if, in a year's time, NatWest's unit trusts are bottom of the performance tables, the 'advisers' will still be recommending them. 'Best advice' is, as you can see, a strange concept. I suppose a second hand car salesman could call himself a 'motoring adviser' on the basis that he makes comments such as: 'I shouldn't go for a Fiat, mate, you can't get the parts. You're always safe with a Ford'. But he would never advise you to go to 'Honest John's used cars' instead. In the world of finance, there are people who can recommend the best products from a range of companies - they are called independent financial advisers. It would be better for the consumer if tied agents (salesmen in plain language), were not allowed to use the same term. To be fair to NatWest, its new policy is the same as that followed by other big banks. And it will retain a independent advisory arm to which customers can be referred. NatWest also says its tied agents will tell people, where appropriate, that they might be better off in, say, national savings, even though the agent cannot do the deal. I would be keen to hear from NatWest customers if they do indeed get such unbiased recommendations. In April, I wrote about the investment theories of Michael O'Higgins*, a US fund manager who had developed a way of beating the Dow Jones index, which can be easily used by the small investor. It involved circling the 10 stocks in the Dow (which has 30 constituents) with the highest yields and then ticking off the five of those with the lowest share prices. Those five become the portfolio for the year; after a calendar year, the whole process was repeated. If stocks did not reappear in the list they were automatically sold. O'Higgins found that between 1973 and 1991 a portfolio chosen in this fashion had produced average annual returns of 19.4 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent from the Dow Jones. I tested this theory for the UK, using the FT-30 index and found that between 1979 and 1992, an O'Higgins portfolio achieved annual returns (including income reinvested) of just under 22 per cent, compared with around 17.5 per cent from the All-Share. In April, the five stocks indicated by the system were Asda, Lucas, Royal Insurance, Hanson and BP. Had investors bought those stocks then, their capital growth to date would have been 29.7 per cent, compared with a rise in the All-Share of 7.4 per cent over the same period. Thus encouraged, I thought it was worthwhile conducting the exercise for the start of 1993. The exercise produces the following stocks: Blue Circle (199p, 7.5 per cent); British Gas (291.5p, 6.1 per cent); Forte (188p, 7.0 per cent); Hanson (233.5p, 6.3 per cent); and Lucas (132p, 7.1 per cent). The figures are from the FT of January 2. Four important caveats. These are definitely not the FT's share recommendations ; the O'Higgins method does not claim to beat the Index every year, only over a period of time; the method only works if you buy all five stocks, not just one or two; and just because it has worked in the past, does not mean it will in future. *Beating the Dow by Michael O'Higgins with John Downes, HarperCollins, 10 East 53rd Street, New York NY 10022.</p>

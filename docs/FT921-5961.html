			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Pressure mounts on Lloyd's chief: Commons trade committee chairman attacks credibility of insurance market POLITICAL PRESSURE on Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, intensified yesterday when an influential Tory backbencher publicly attacked the insurance market's credibility. Lloyd's 'must get its act together on the world stage', said Mr Kenneth Warren, chairman of the all-party Commons trade and industry select committee. 'It must be seen to be taking every action possible to assure the world investment market that it is determined to have feasible credibility and capability,' he said. His remarks come a week after Lloyd's appointed Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, to investigate alleged malpractice. Over the past month, MPs from both main parties have supported allegations that market insiders have benefited, to the detriment of outside Names, by making use of privileged information. Names are the individuals whose assets provide the market's capital. Mr Warren also released details of an exchange of letters between himself and Mr Coleridge which, he said, left him 'deeply concerned'. The Lloyd's chairman's reply, he said, 'does not convey to me the breadth and depth of urgency which the problems of the Names demands. 'Indeed, the problem extends beyond the enormous losses suffered by many outside who do not appear to have enjoyed the same stature as those inside Lloyd's,' he added. In a letter dated February 14 1992, Mr Warren expressed concern about the relationship between Names, agents who handle their affairs and manage syndicates, and underwriters. 'I would like to be assured that a responsibility is placed on those who handle the commitments (of Names),' he said. 'I would have expected that commitments would be required to be transparent so that all who have a right to see what is going on can do so.' In his response, dated February 21 1992, Mr Coleridge said Lloyd's did not hold the data about transactions entered into on behalf of Names. Useful information about the risks and commitments undertaken on behalf of Names can only be provided by the managing agent of the syndicate. 'That agent maintains all of the books and records in which those transactions are recorded,' Mr Coleridge said. This latest row will stir the already heated debate at Lloyd's about the relation between the insurance market and parliament. Mr Robin Warrender, chairman of London Wall Holdings, one of the largest agency groups at Lloyd's, believes that 'relations are deplorable. Lloyd's just hasn't got the right sort of parliamentary representation,' he said. Lord Kimball, a former Lloyd's Council member, disagrees. 'Since 1982 Lloyd's has done an immense amount of bridge-building. It has introduced itself to MPs of all parties. It is disappointing there has not been a better payoff.' Lloyd's tragedy, Page 4</p>

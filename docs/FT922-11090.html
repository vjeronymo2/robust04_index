			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Agache profits rise sharply FINANCIERE Agache, one of the French luxury goods groups linked to Mr Bernard Arnault, saw net profits rise sharply to FFr1.82bn (Dollars 330m) in 1991, from FFr230m in 1990 writes Alice Rawsthorn. Agache experienced a slight fall in sales to FFr27.65bn from FFr29.08bn because it ceded control of the Conforama chain to the Pinault industrial group. The Conforama sale was largely responsible for the exceptional credit of FFr1.99bn received by Agache last year, an significant increase on the FFr109m credit for the previous year. The level of consolidated net profits rose 59 per cent to FFr6.01bn in 1991, from FFr3.78bn in 1990.</p>

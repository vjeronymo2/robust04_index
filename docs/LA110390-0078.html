			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N., RED CROSS DISCUSS RESUPPLYING EMBASSIES;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: SECRETARY GENERAL IS SEEKING A COMPROMISE TO AID THE BESIEGED  ENVOYS.  </P> <P> U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met Friday with a high official  of the International Committee of the Red Cross as part of a quiet U.N.  diplomatic effort to seek a compromise solution to resupplying the besieged  U.S. and British embassies in Kuwait.  </P> <P> Red Cross officials said the plight of the remaining handful of diplomats, as  well as citizens of other countries, still in Kuwait was discussed. A State  Department official in Washington confirmed that the use of the Red Cross is a  preferred option for funneling badly needed food and other vital necessities to  the beleaguered Foreign Service personnel.  </P> <P> Underscoring the seriousness with which the United States views the situation  at the embassies, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and John R. Bolton,  assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs, met later  with the secretary general.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Bolton said Perez de Cuellar is very concerned about the  plight of all foreign citizens in Kuwait and is continuing his efforts to try  to find a way under U.N. auspices to resupply the embassies.  </P> <P> "The Iraqis persist in stonewalling and in their continued inhumane treatment .  . . of diplomatic personnel," Bolton said.  </P> <P> The State Department official said Iraq's ambassador in Washington had been  summoned repeatedly by the Bush Administration to protest the plight of the  diplomats and private citizens in Kuwait.  </P> <P> "We have seen no progress," Bolton said. He added, "So far, the Iraqis have  shown no inclination whatsoever to stop their uncivilized treatment of our  diplomats."  </P> <P> Pickering's and Bolton's meeting with Perez de Cuellar was well publicized and  came as the Administration considered a number of options for resupplying the  U.S. Embassy. These include a landing in Kuwait by an unarmed ship carrying  provisions under the American or U.N. flag; an overland convoy from Baghdad  under U.N. auspices, or forcible entry by Marines in helicopters.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, an official of the International Committee of the Red  Cross met with State Department personnel in Washington. On Friday, Perez de  Cuellar also met with Jean de Courten, the International Red Cross' director of  operations.  </P> <P> Whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would accept a resupply convoy under Red  Cross sponsorship is highly uncertain. In the past, he has rejected such  suggestions in discussions between Red Cross officials and Iraqi authorities.  </P> <P> On Aug. 20, Iraq ordered all embassies in Kuwait to close by the end of that  week, and two days later the United States announced it would defy the order.  </P> <P> In the weeks that followed, other Western embassies, facing severe shortages of  food and other items, were forced to cease operations. Only the British and  U.S. diplomats remain in their embassies in Kuwait city.  </P></p>

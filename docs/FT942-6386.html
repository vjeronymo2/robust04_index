			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Why Brussels bent its own rules on aid Of all the European Commission's activities, few are more likely to set it on a collision course with EU governments than its policing of their financial support to industry. The commission has autonomous powers to prohibit state aids when it judges they threaten free competition. But the exercise of that authority can expose it to pressure from governments backing projects of interest to sensitive political constituencies at home. The Hualon case was no exception. In an effort to secure a favourable decision, the UK mounted one of its most active Brussels lobbying campaigns in recent memory, involving a barrage of visits and telephone calls by ministers, MPs and MEPs. The commission's decision was made more difficult by the fact that, in this case, its own rules oblige it somehow to seek a balance between two incompatible sets of criteria. One set, intended to foster regional economic development, permits exceptionally large state aid for investments located in the EU's poorest areas. Belfast is one such area, and the UK government's proposed subsidy to Hualon fell within the limits laid down by Brussels. However, the particular nature of the project meant it also had to pass another stiff test. Under EU rules, all state-aided investments in synthetic fibres, along with those in cars, steel and shipbuilding, receive special scrutiny by Brussels. These sectors have extensive excess capacity. The commission frowns on new subsidised investments in these sectors because it fears they will unfairly drive other producers out of business, disrupt markets further and impede orderly industrial restructuring. The Hualon plan immediately set red lights flashing. Indeed, commission officials say that if the project had been assessed purely on a strict interpretation of the sectoral rules, the UK government aid would have been found illegal. Objections from sector experts in the commission's industry directorate, whose views were sought by watchdogs in the competition directorate once the investigation started, were particularly strong. The industry experts rejected the UK government's claim that the plant would make 'innovative products'. In reality, they said, the products were mature and already in over-supply from within the EU. The experts also rejected UK arguments that output from the plant would substitute for imports from outside the EU and help reverse a shift of manufacturing to Asia. Instead, they concluded, the plant would simply add to existing excess capacity. These findings - from which the competition directorate did not initially dissent - left Mr Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner, with a problem. He sympathised with the need to create jobs in Northern Ireland and recognised that was made more urgent by the delicate peace process under way  -a point of which he and other commissioners were repeatedly reminded by UK political lobbyists. Commission officials say they included Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and technology minister, and Mr Tim Smith, Northern Ireland economy minister. as well as Ulster MPs and MEPs. Some of them also lobbied Mr Bruce Millan, the British regional affairs commissioner. According to officials in Brussels, at least one unnamed minister told Mr van Miert that if the project were blocked, it would have political consequences not just in Belfast, but also in London. The officials said this remark was never clearly explained, but that they took it to refer to the balance of political power at Westminster. Mr van Miert is said to have spent months agonising privately over how to come up with a proposal to his fellow commissioners which would enable the Hualon project to go ahead without breaching his own guidelines on state aid. The escape route was found in a renewed examination of the project, which persuaded Mr van Miert and his colleagues that it was an extremely low-technology operation. 'It was unique. Every other producer in Europe trying to survive in this market is investing in high-tech equipment,' said one official in Brussels. Although that conclusion conflicted with Hualon's public assertions that the project would use advanced automation to cut costs, it enabled the commission to argue that the plant would not disrupt the market because its technology meant it was not competing directly with existing output. When Mr van Miert put the argument to the full commission earlier this month, along with the political case for helping Belfast's economy, the decision went through un-opposed. Even Sir Leon Brittan, the liberal-minded trade commissioner - who, when competition commissioner, called for 'a bonfire of the subsidies' - is said by colleagues to have raised no objection.</p>

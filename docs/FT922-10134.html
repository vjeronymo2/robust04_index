			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Trust dividends WHAT IS the tax liability on distributions made by the American 'Tri-Continental Corporation' Investment Trust? Is it true that in addition to quarterly dividends this trust, at each financial year end, declares a surplus payment depending on the gains made during the year and that this may be taken as shares or as cash? The quarterly dividends would be liable for income tax in the normal way, but is it also correct that the surplus distribution would not be subject to income tax if it were taken as shares, but would be subject to UK income tax (but not US with holding tax) if taken as cash? Yes, you are right. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

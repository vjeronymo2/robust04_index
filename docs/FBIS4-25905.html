			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter today passed through the heavily-fortified border  village of Panmunjom on his way to Pyongyang for talks with  President Kim Il- song over the nuclear issue.    Carter arrived here on Monday [13 June] in a prelude to his  visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for  possible mediation in Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons  program.    During his stay here, the former U.S. president respectively  met with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, deputy prime  minister and National Unification Board (NUB) Minister Yi  Hong-ku and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu.    Carter is likely to convey to the DPRK the position of the  U.S. and South Korea on a settlement of the nuclear problem.    His visit to the Korean peninsula comes at a time when the  DPRK decided to quit the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency while  South Korea, the U.S. and Japan are stepping up their effort  towards U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang.    The DPRK has reportedly banned inspectors of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples  of nuclear fuel to determine whether it has been diverted  secretly to make atomic weapons.    The DPRK insists that its nuclear program is strictly  peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to  accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war.    Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula  would be a private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the  important issues of the day with leaders of the area," he said.    The former president will return to Seoul via Panmunjom on  June 18 to brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam on the  results of his talks with DPRK leaders before heading back to  Washington.</p>

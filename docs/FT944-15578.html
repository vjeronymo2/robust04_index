			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Career guidance for pupils attacked Too many sixth-formers attempt inappropriate academic courses after receiving inadequate careers guidance, two government inspectorates say today, John Authers writes. The Further Education Funding Council for England and the Office for Standards in Education, which monitors schools, said higher priority should be given to work-related activities and opportunities for students to take on 'adult responsibilities', rather than academic A-levels. They also found that students wishing to move into further or higher education received better support and help than those seeking work. The inspectors recommended that colleges should give more attention to action plans based on students' experience, and that performance indicators should be used to evaluate careers guidance. General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) were piloted as an alternative to A-levels last year, and can be used either for university entrance or for moving straight to employment. The government hopes this route will attract those who are unlikely to succeed at A-level. Students arrive at university with an inadequate grasp of how to manage money, says a survey by the National Westminster Bank and the University of Exeter. Most do not count a student loan as a debt, and have unrealistic expectations of their future earnings.</p>

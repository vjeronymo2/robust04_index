			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Pozdnyakov, deputy minister for </F> nationalities affairs and regional policy, by Oleg Bondarenko;  place and date not given: "How to Warm Up the Permafrost  Region?"]    [Text] Having been until recently deputy chairman of the  State Committee for the Socioeconomic Development of the North  [Goskomsever], Aleksandr Pozdnyakov was directly responsible for  the normal functioning of the most remote and inaccessible parts  of our country. There had always been plenty of problems there  even in quiet times, but now there are all the more. During the  recent government reorganization the problems for which the  Goskomsever had been responsible were transferred to the new  Russian Federation Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and  Regional Policy, where Pozdnyakov is deputy minister.    "Does this mean that concern for northerners is taking more  and more of a back seat?" I asked Aleksandr Mikhaylovich.    [Pozdnyakov] Our former state committee was tasked above all  with making maximum use of the brief summer shipping season to  provide timely shipments of prime necessities to remote areas  and to ensure that people could work uninterrupted during the  long winter period. If there is any disorganization in this  area, it will not be possible to avoid a major disaster -- after  all, for most of the year these areas are cut off from the rest  of Russia.    The Goskomsever also considered it its duty to protect  before  the federal authorities the interests of all those who find  themselves remote from the "mainland." But it protected them on  the basis of its actual abilities and in its own way -- most  often it asked for additional funds to be allocated for certain  measures. Problems were driven underground and covered up by  additional spending, instead of eradicating the root cause that  had given rise to them in the first place.    With our broad powers within the ministry today we are  entirely capable of investigating all problems of territorial  development and of resolving them by combining both local and  federal interests. The first major discussion on our problems  was conducted at a recent conference in Tambov.    Taking part in it were representatives of major  interregional  associations covering the historically established economic  areas of the country. These include the center of Russia, the  Northwest, the Volga, the North Caucasus, the Urals, Siberia,  and the Far East. Within the framework of the associations they  set up several years ago, republics, krays, oblasts, and  autonomous okrugs have already amassed experience of  cooperation, but the associations' relationships among  themselves and with the federal authorities have still not been  properly organized. The conference distributed the spheres of  powers for each structure.    The government has not imposed its will on Federation  components, but has consulted with them about how to be more  successful in resolving the tasks of the country's further  economic development. As a result, all the conference  participants signed a document designed to avoid in the future  the disappointing confrontation that has sometimes occurred  between Moscow and a territory.    [Bondarenko] Some time ago the major Siberian Accord  association was accused of having certain separatist tendencies.  To what extent was this true?    [Pozdnyakov] I am well acquainted with the Siberians and I  can assure you that they had no intention to engage in any kind  of isolationism. The fact that statements by some of their  representatives have voiced alarm and resentment about the lack  of attention paid to their vital needs by the center is merely a  reflection of reality. The unduly temperamental tone of the  statements is also entirely explicable, and, indeed, it did have  an effect. One way or another, both sides' positions have  converged to a considerable extent.    [Bondarenko] How do you view the attempt by the leaders of  the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk Okrugs to secede  [obosobitsya] from Tyumen Oblast, of which they were part?    [Pozdnyakov] They can, of course, be understood. After all,  the [oblast] center is in the south of the oblast, and the  okrugs are in the permafrost region. Even though working and  living conditions in the North are immeasurably more difficult,  the lion's share of the okrugs' revenue from oil and gas  previously went, apart from the capital, to Tyumen. But we are  talking about natural resources -- a national asset rather than  just the property of the extraction workers. It would hardly be  right to close our eyes and pretend that there is no problem. A  well-judged balance of interests should be maintained everywhere.</p>

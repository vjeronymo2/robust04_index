			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Petit: Defense Wrestles With Half a </F> Billion Deficit"]    [Text] The Defense Ministry is facing a budget deficit of  500 million guilders. Top military officials fear that, partly  as a result of new cutbacks, the restructuring of the armed  forces will be jeopardized.    UN operations are costing much more than estimated, the sale  of redundant army equipment has proved disappointing, and the  Defense Ministry is no longer benefiting from index-linking.  This year, the department has to save 241 million guilders.  Over the last four years, a total of 8 billion guilders has  been saved.    Further considerable defense savings are expected next year,  as Minister Ter Beek constantly repeats that "the savings from  the peace have been exhausted." The CEC [Central Economic  Commission] has suggested a cutback of 500 million guilders in a  confidential report submitted to those responsible for  conducting government negotiations.    In order to reduce the deficits to some extent, the Army has  already cut back drastically on military exercises. Fewer  people are also being called up for national service.    Ter Beek has also submitted a claim of 150 million guilders  to the government to fund peacekeeping operations. He wants  other ministries to help pay the bill. The costs of such  operations are estimated to already amount to 350 million  guilders, but are likely to increase further. The government  had allocated 125 million guilders to peacekeeping operations.    In addition to savings on military exercises, the Defense  Ministry also wants savings on equipment purchases. Secretary  of State Frinking welcomed the purchase of 33 combat helicopters  rather than 40 for the light mobile brigade, the showpiece of  the new, modern Army. Other, smaller projects have also been  downgraded.    Ter Beek, who is considered unlikely to be included in a  future government, cannot count on his own party. The PvdA  [Labor Party] believes it can save at least another 900 million  guilders over the next four years in his department.    Although defense is not yet a "hot item" in current  negotiations with the party leaders on a possible "purple"  coalition [comprising the PvdA, the D66 (Democrats 66), and the  VVD (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy)], specialists are  still concerned about prospects of arriving at a joint defense  program.    The D66 and the VVD do not want any further defense cuts.  Calculations by the CPB [Central Plan Bureau] based on the party  programs show, however, that the D66, like the CDA [Christian  Democratic Appeal], will seek to achieve savings of 600 million  guilders, the VVD 300 million and the PvdA as much as 1.4  billion.    In VVD circles in particular, questions are being raised as  to whether these enormous differences will be bridged. Minister  Ter Beek himself believes that although it is not easy, it is  "solvable."</p>

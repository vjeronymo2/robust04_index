			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> IDOL WORSHIP: Billy Idol is still in the hospital, recovering from a nasty  motorcycle spill. But Chrysalis Records says plans to release the rock singer's  new album, "Charmed Life," remain on schedule.  </P> <P> Due out April 17, the aptly-titled record features "Cradle of Love" (due out as  a single), "Prodigal Blues," "Trouble With the Sweet Stuff," "License to  Thrill" and a remake of the Doors' "L.A. Woman." Idol's "Cradle of Love" will  also be on the Elektra soundtrack to "Ford Fairlane," the Andrew (Dice) Clay  film due out this summer. . . . A Truth in Advertising Raspberry to KLOS-FM,  which had replacement deejays tell listeners that morning hot-shots Mark &amp;  Brian were off-the-air last week, allegedly because of a dispute over a  disciplinary memo from management. The clever ratings ploy was in perfect sync  with the duo's bad-boy image -- and kept listeners tuning in daily to see if  the jocks had returned. The reality? Mark &amp; Brian were simply on vacation.  . . . And our Blunder of the Week goes to Hollywood Reporter reviewer Jeffrey  Jolson-Colburn, who expressed "disappointment" in his Monday review of the  recent Tears for Fears concert that the group "didn't perform a few of the  tunes they created with (Liza Minnelli) for her brilliant 'Results' album . . .  " Only one problem: Liza made "Results" with the Pet Shop Boys, not Tears for  Fears.  </P></p>

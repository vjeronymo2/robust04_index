			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: GUS decision could be spur for others to follow GREAT UNIVERSAL Stores' decision to enfranchise its non-voting shares will be a spur for those other remaining companies which have two-tier share structures. Non-voting and limited voting shares, although common years ago, are now regarded as anachronistic. Under the terms of the GUS enfranchisement, holders of the voting shares, which currently make up a mere 2.2 per cent of the total capital, will receive an extra four shares for every five they hold as compensation. The holders of the voting shares will then have 3.9 per cent of the enlarged capital. After that all shareholders will receive a 3-for-1 scrip issue. Morgan Stanley International and SG Warburg have recommended these terms as fair and reasonable on behalf of the voting and non-voting shareholders respectively. About half of the voting shares are held by the Wolfson Foundation, the family and other charitable trusts. The remainder are mainly held by a number of institutions. GUS's move follows years of speculation, during which time the company has repeatedly said it was reviewing its position. The timing of its decision has no particular significance, the company stressed yesterday. It also follows that of Austin Reed, another retail group, in April to enfranchise its non-voting shares and the announcement in May by Hammerson, the property company, that it would equalise the votes on its two classes of shares. GUS said it was responding to the 'evident wishes of the company's shareholders and the market' although saying that there was no shareholder pressure to change. The two classes of shares performed much in line until about the mid-1980s when the voting shares began to outperform the non-voting shares. It also said it was 'conscious of the impetus towards globalisation of securities markets and EC views on the subject'. The Stock Exchange told companies 10 years ago that if they had non-voting or limited voting shares they must be clearly described as such. There has also been a feeling - although nothing has been written down - that the Stock Exchange frowned on the issue of new non-voting shares, for example through a rights issue or acquisition. The EC is due to publish a directive - although many think it will not happen - which is expected to encourage companies towards a unified share capital. While two-tier share structures are still common in many European countries, they are less usual in other markets such as the US. Non-voting or limited voting shares often arise where a family controls or has a large stake in a company. Other well-known companies with two-tier share structures include Whitbread, the brewer, WH Smith, the retail and wholesale group and John Laing, the contracting and construction group. Such share structures have been used by some companies to frustrate takeovers. The famous case is that of the Savoy Hotel, which for years repulsed takeover attempts by the then Trusthouse Forte which owned a large majority of the shares but a minority of the votes. There is no suggestion, however, that GUS is about to receive a takeover approach.</p>

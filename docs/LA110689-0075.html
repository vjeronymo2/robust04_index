			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO WEIGH ELECTION MEASURES  </P> <P> The City Council will consider three measures regarding elections at its  meeting tonight. First, it is expected to vote again on whether to move local  elections from April to November. After much debate and public comment, it  approved the change by a 3-2 vote last month but must re-introduce it to make a  technical change.  </P> <P> At the suggestion of Councilman Earl J. Prescott, the council also will  consider putting an advisory measure on the issue on the November, 1990,  ballot.  </P> <P> "I just don't think that any three council members should have the opportunity  to play yo-yo with the voting dates," said Prescott, who along with John Kelly  voted against moving the elections from April.  </P> <P> And, at the request of Kelly, the council will consider asking voters to decide  whether to increase the number of council members from five to seven and  whether to elect council members by district. If Kelly's suggestion is  approved, the measure would be before voters in the November, 1990, election.  </P> <P> "This goes along pretty much with the idea of open government and fair,  equitable representation throughout the city," Kelly said. "When I first began  running for office (in 1980), four out of five council members lived in Tustin  Meadows and Peppertree." SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA April 10 -- Nearly 8,000 projects  throughout the country have got loans of about VND [Vietnamese  dong] 420 billion from the national fund since the launching of  a credit programme two years ago, it was reported by the Central  State Treasury. As a result, the programme has helped create  335,000 jobs nationwide. Leading the programme was Ho Chi Minh  City which gave loans of VND 36.13 billion to 317 projects,  creating 16,500 jobs. Next was Hanoi which lent VND 24.29  billion to 229 projects attracting 19,622 workers.

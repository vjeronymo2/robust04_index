			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax victory prompts new guidelines - Revenue moves to pay back tax on benefits EMPLOYEES WHO receive benefits from their employers should start examining their tax returns with extra care as the implications of a concession from the Inland Revenue sink in. More than 130,000 people with in-house benefits can expect to receive refunds as a result of a long-contested court battle which was concluded in November. The Revenue has already shown itself eager to hand back Pounds 550m a year in tax on share dividends and bank interest in the last few weeks with a new Pounds 2m advertising campaign. Now it is sheepishly admitting that it will be paying out up to Pounds 30m to employees who have been over-taxed on benefits. Many who have been taxed through pay-as-you-earn or on their assessments will be able to claim refunds as far back as the 1986-87 financial year. The reason behind the change is an embarrassing and unexpected defeat for the Revenue in the House of Lords late last year concerning John Hart, a schoolteacher at Malvern College, and ten of his colleagues. The Revenue had argued that Hart and his fellow teachers should pay tax as a benefit on any reduced-rate private school fees for their children below the average cost of tuition - the total costs divided by the number of pupils. Hart argued - and won - on the grounds that he should only be taxed on any amount they were paying below the marginal cost of tuition - the additional cost of teaching one extra person, to include items such as books, laundry and food. After several weeks to think through the implications of the Law Lords' decision, the Revenue has now issued guidance on the ruling. The groups which are likely to be affected are employees receiving goods and services provided by their employers free or at a discount from within their business; and those able to use business assets partly for private use. The ruling will have no effect on many benefits, including a number covered by separate legislation such as company cars, beneficial loans and living accommodation. The largest of these groups are employees of British Rail and London Transport, which are offered concessionary travel. These are so large that the Revenue is making special arrangements, and employees need not contact their tax office directly. Others likely to be affected - aside from concessionary tuition fees for private school teachers - include employees of travel companies, airlines and ferry companies who may have been taxed based on the average rather than marginal cost. The Revenue has laid down some guidelines on marginal cost. It says it accepts that there is no, or negligible, cost for rail or bus employees on terms which do not displace fare-paying passengers. There will equally be no tax on goods sold at a discount at least at the wholesale price; teachers paying at least 15 per cent of a school's normal fees; and professional services which do not require additional employees or partners. Some fixed costs on the private use of assets - such as the road tax for a fitter's van - will no longer be taken into account as part of the assessment of taxable benefit. On mobile phones, the Revenue states that the cash equivalent of the benefit is Pounds 200. It is reduced to nil if the employee does not use the phone for private use, or makes good the full cost of any private use. As a result of the House of Lords judgment, it has determined that the employee should not have to pay a proportion of the standing charges of the phone, such as line rental. Tax practitioners are busy considering the implications of Pepper vs Hart on behalf of their own clients. Ms Leslie Ferrar of KPMG Peat Marwick, adds the possibility of the annual subscription rate on corporate credit cards and the insurance premiums on rental vans as among the other benefits which may now be subject to less tax by employees. The Revenue says that anyone claiming a refund should apply to their local tax office, and will be able to process claims more quickly if taxpayers bring their national insurance number and details of the years in which they paid tax on in-house benefits. Those expecting this new taxing regime on benefits to remain unchallenged in the future should not be too optimistic. The Revenue has a habit of influencing ministers to change the law when it is defeated in court.</p>

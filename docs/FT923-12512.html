			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Pol Pot's quiet wait for power: The Khmer Rouge has a stranglehold on the UN peace plan PERHAPS it was not surprising that the birds released this week at a ceremony to disarm 2,000 Cambodian guerrillas were not pure white doves of peace but a motley collection of black and white pigeons reluctant to fly more than a few yards from their cage. The ceremony in northern Cambodia to disarm fighters of the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces was overshadowed - like the entire Cambodian peace process - by the continuing refusal of the leftist Khmer Rouge to co-operate with the UN peace plan agreed by the four Cambodian factions and the superpowers last year. According to the Dollars 1.7bn plan, 450,000 troops and militiamen from all the factions should have been regrouped by July 11, but the Khmer Rouge has not begun the cantonment process and has not even allowed soldiers of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) access to its territory. The Khmer Rouge has also repeatedly broken the ceasefire which was supposed to begin after the signing of the peace agreement in Paris last October: this week Khmer Rouge guerrillas launched a series of attacks in the north and captured six villages from the existing administration installed by the Vietnamese after they invaded in 1978 and overthrew the Khmer Rouge. UN officials have also learned that the Khmer Rouge leadership is offering bounty payments for guerrillas who shoot down UN aircraft. Seven have been hit already. UN officers were therefore not surprised to see that most of the weapons surrendered by the KPNLAF were rusty and unusable rifles, or to hear KPNLAF generals declare that they needed to keep their best equipment for self-defence. One UN official said there was 'a lot of monkey business' in the limited cantonment and disarmament which has so far occurred. The UN suspects the various guerrilla armies of hiding equipment in arms caches, sending untrained teenagers with old weapons to cantonment areas and keeping their best soldiers in the field. Repeated warnings by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of Untac, and other UN officials that 'time is running out' for the Khmer Rouge are beginning to wear thin. Untac's inability to enforce Khmer Rouge compliance is not only playing havoc with a timetable which should lead to elections in the first half of next year but also undermining the credibility of the most expensive and ambitious peacekeeping operation in UN history. The next step to increase the pressure on the Khmer Rouge is likely to be a UN Security Council resolution condemning the organisation for failing to abide by the terms of the peace plan. But China, one of the principal backers of the Khmer Rouge, may use its status as a permanent member of the council to soften the resolution. More important are Mr Akashi's negotiations with the government of neighbouring Thailand to try to bring economic pressure to bear on the guerrillas. He is expected to visit Bangkok this weekend. The weakness of this approach is that the Khmer Rouge's lucrative exports of tropical timber and gems across the Thai frontier - and its imports of supplies - are controlled not by the civilian government but by the Thai army. By necessity rather than design, Untac is engaged in a waiting game which its critics say plays into the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Despite its grim record in power - an estimated one million Cambodians died under its reign of terror between 1975 and 1978 - the Khmer Rouge has recently struck a popular chord with the two conditions it has set for co-operating with the peace plan. First, the Khmer Rouge is demanding UN verification that no Vietnamese troops remain in the country, and secondly, it insists that the Vietnamese-installed government be dismantled and real power be transferred to the Supreme National Council (SNC) - the body including all four factions which is charged with implementing the peace plan in association with Untac. Although there is no proof of a continuing Vietnamese military presence, Vietnam is Cambodia's traditional enemy, and Cambodians resent the arrival of thousands of Vietnamese builders and other artisans taking advantage of the reconstruction boom to find work in Cambodia. As for the status of the SNC, diplomats acknowledge that Untac and the SNC have been slow in imposing a neutral civilian administration: foreign dignitaries, for example, are still greeted by the old government instead of the SNC. The longer it takes the UN to impose its will on the Khmer Rouge, the more money the Khmer Rouge will earn for its war chests from the gem mines and forests in its territory and the more chance it will have of regaining some sort of political legitimacy in Cambodia. Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader known as Brother Number One, is waiting quietly in the wilderness. 'They have money, they have arms, they have men, and they have China and Thailand,' says Mr Ek Sereywath of Funcinpec, the royalist faction. 'The Khmer Rouge dream of returning to power.'</p>

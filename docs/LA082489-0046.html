			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: AZTECS TESTED BY AIR FORCE IMPERSONATORS  </P> <P> In preparation for its football season opener against Air Force Sept. 2, San  Diego State went through a full-contact "game" Wednesday against the scout  team, which was running the Falcons' plays.  </P> <P> "We were ragged," Coach Al Luginbill said. "Fortunately, we don't have to play  a game until a week from Saturday. Our scout team gives us a heck of a look.  It's great for our defense. Our men have to get used to going against a good,  solid scout team, and that has not been the history of this program."  </P> <P> The scout team ran Air Force's best plays with the Aztec defense in its weakest  positions.  </P> <P> "We tried to put ourselves in vulnerable situations," said Barry Lamb,  defensive coordinator. "The cards were marked a little, but better that than to  make it easy."  </P> <P> Defensive end Steve Matuszewicz (bruised knee) and running back Kip Jeffries  (sprained ankle) were injured in Wednesday's early practice. Receiver Patrick  Rowe (knee) did not participate but has been practicing since Monday.  </P> <P> GOLF  </P> <P> Phil Mickelson of San Diego shot a two-under-par 68 and finished a shot behind  medalist Eoghan O'Connell of Ireland at the U.S. Amateur Golf Championships at  Ardmore, Pa.  </P> <P> The field of 312 was cut to 64 for match play after 36 holes of medalist play.  Mickelson, who will be a sophomore at Arizona State, finished with a 138.  </P> <P> Jerry Michals of Vista (161) and Mike Levy of Escondido (166) did not make the  cut of 149.  </P> <P> Chris Riley of San Diego shot his second consecutive 77 and is 10 shots behind  the co-leaders after the second round of the PGA Junior Championship at the PGA  National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Two Floridians -- Bobby Collins  of Atlantis and Briny Baird of Miami Beach -- lead at par 144.  </P> <P> In the girls' tournament, Leta Lindley of Carlsbad was nine shots behind the  leader with a two-round total of 158. Vicki Goetze of Hull, Ga., leads with a  149.  </P> <P> TENNIS  </P> <P> Scott Patridge of La Jolla and Kelly Jones and Todd Nelson of San Diego won  first round singles matches in the qualifying tournament for the U.S. Open at  New York.  </P> <P> Nelson upset Chris Pridham of Canada, seeded 10th, 7-6, 6-4. Kelly, seeded  16th, defeated Nevio Devide of Italy, 6-2, 6-3, and Patridge defeated Shelby  Cannon of Gainesville, Fla., 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Greg Failla of Ramona and Martin Barba of Carlsbad both lost first-round  matches. Sixteen players will advance to the main draw.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SEOUL HAILED, TOKYO HIT ON TRADE  </P> <P> U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher assailed Japan today for closing  its markets to American goods and services but praised South Korea for opening  its markets wider.  </P> <P> Mosbacher told South Korean businessmen that Washington applauds Seoul's spirit  of cooperation in response to trade pressure, imposed in particular through the  1988 U.S. Trade Act.  </P> <P> But he was critical of Japan's efforts and promised to voice his criticism when  he visits Tokyo on Tuesday after his three-day visit to Seoul.  </P> <P> "We opened our markets. And we worked to create a trading system that would  allow for everyone to prosper. Now it's Japan's turn to show the same kind of  commitment to the world trading system," Mosbacher said.  </P> <P> "Thankfully, I don't have that kind of message to deliver in Korea today," he  said.  </P></p>

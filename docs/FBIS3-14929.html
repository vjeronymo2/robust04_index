			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report under the "Resignation" rubric: </F> "Annual Replacement of Special Service Head"]    [Text] The Russian president's press service has advised  that Colonel General Nikolay Golushko has been relieved of his  duties as Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] director.  As has been the case more than once, FCS personnel were the  last to learn about this -- and from INTERFAX reports. The FCS  Public Relations Center, therefore, finds it hard to comment on  this event. Observers give as the reason for so sudden a step  the recent release of the "Lefortovo inmates." Onlookers refer  to the existence of a certain document forwarded to the heads of  power agencies by presidential structures which indicated  bluntly that no release of the opposition leaders was  admissible. Golushko has been "punished" for everybody.  Officials in the presidential staff state in this connection  that the president had long been dissatisfied with incoming  information.    Another possible version of Golushko's dismissal is "the  Ames  affair," because some reports speak about the presence in the  FCS of foreign agents of a similar level. It seems to us,  however, that the more probable cause for the dismissal is its  "having been planned." It was obvious to virtually all experts  that this person was temporary, and the president availed  himself of all the sensational events of recent days as a  pretext.    Current first deputy Sergey Stepashin is being named as the  more probable candidate for Federal Counterintelligence Service  director. It is possible, however, that an outsider will be  appointed to this post. I have in mind former KGB generals who  are not on the FCS staff but who are in the civil service and  who have to do with the top echelons of power. The appointment  of a civilian to this position is seen as unlikely.</p>

He said the straits are of vital importance to Russia as  they  are the only way for Russian ships to reach the Mediterranean,  and his country understands Turkey's concern concerning  Istanbul's security.    Turkey has prepared a new regulation draft which aims at  bringing to the minimum any risks that may threaten ships and  environmental security, and which brings new regulation for  ships passing through the straits.    Chernyshev also said that Russia is in principle not against  a possible Baku-Yumurtalik (in southern Turkey) pipeline to  transport Azeri oil from Azerbaijan and former Soviet republics  to Europe, adding however that there are two important criteria,  which are economic and political feasibility.    A framework agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan was  signed on March 9, 1993, stating that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline  would be the most economic way to bring Azeri oil to world  markets.    The pipeline has a design capacity of 40 million tonnes per  year. Azeri oil production over the next few years is not  expected to exceed 25 million tonnes per year.    The extra capacity has been incorporated into the pipeline  to  attract oil transportation demand from Central Asian countries,  mainly from Kazakhstan.    Turkey has made plain its opposition to oil being  transported  by tankers through the Bosphorus, a route suggested by some,  because of the risks of environmental damage and the potential  dangers to Istanbul whose ten million plus residents live on  both sides of the busy strait.    Commenting on the Azeri-Armenian conflict he said his  country  sees Turkey as a country that can politically contribute to the  solution of the problem.    On the European Conventional Arms Reduction Agreement, he  said Russian demands should not be seen as threat against  Turkey, adding it is not targeting any country.    On the nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's remarks  targeting Turkey he said the former has no political future.    Chernyshev said a planned visit by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin expected to take place in March will bring a new  dimension to Turkish-Russian relations, adding a number of  agreements are expected to be signed between the two countries  during this visit.</p>

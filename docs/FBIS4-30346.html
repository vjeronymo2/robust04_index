			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The heads of Japan's two  biggest opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party  of Japan -- SDPJ] met Monday morning to discuss the political  impasse after the resignation of the cabinet of prime minister  Tsutomu Hata, SDP party officials said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters after the  43-minute meeting he and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed on an  early settlement of the political chaos following the wholesale  resignation of the minority cabinet. Prior to the start of the  meeting, the SDP leadership meeting decided they will not  discuss forming an alliance or a new government to replace the  Hata cabinet, SDP officials said.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori also told reporters the  two parties are not entering policy talks toward setting up a  new government. The SDP is also seeking a meeting with Prime  Minister Hata, the representative of the ruling coalition, the  officials said. The LDP proposed the meeting with the SDP on  Sunday.    SDP Chairman Murayama said Sunday during a television  interview he would consider a tie-up with the LDP. However, SDP  Secretary General Wataru Kubo appeared to favor returning to the  ruling coalition, party sources said.    The SDP withdrew from former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's coalition cabinet in late April to protest the  formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition partners  that excluded the SDP. The move forced Hata to form the first  minority government in nearly four decades.</p>

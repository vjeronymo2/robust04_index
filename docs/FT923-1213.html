			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Israelis optimistic over US aid packages: Military co-operation and ratification of Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees look likely ISRAEL is confident of securing two substantial economic and military aid packages from the US in the next two weeks which would consolidate its position as the biggest recipient of US foreign assistance. Congressional ratification of Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees - attached to the 1993 fiscal year foreign aid bill which includes Dollars 3bn in direct economic and military grants for Israel - is expected by October 1. Israeli defence officials are meanwhile negotiating a military co-operation package with the Pentagon aimed at retaining Israel's technological edge over its Arab neighbours and which is likely to include a US commitment to preposition military equipment in the country. The talks follow the Bush administration's decision to sell up to 72 advanced F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia. Israel and its supporters in the US see the military talks as evidence that the US-Israel relationship, frayed last year by political differences between the Bush administration and Mr Yitzhak Shamir's Likud government, has been fully restored since Mr Yitzhak Rabin's election as prime minister last June. Israel and its backers reject suggestions that the extra aid has been provided to help Mr Bush recoup support among American Jewish voters before the November presidential election. 'They signify a fundamental understanding of Israel's needs, not just election politics,' said one lobbyist. Policy analysts in Washington agree the underlying relationship with Israel is strong. Although its Cold War role of bulwark against Soviet influence in the Middle East has gone, they say the US values strategic and political co-operation with Israel in what remains an unstable region. But there are signals in the US that the historically high levels of financial assistance to Israel may be threatened by Washington's general budgetary pressures. One American participant in a recent seminar for senior US and Israeli policymakers said: 'There were stark messages for Israel. The (US) willingness to regard the aid to Israel as an entitlement has disappeared. It is too attractive a target not to be hit over time.' But Israel will not feel the squeeze for the next year at least. The 1993 foreign aid bill includes Dollars 1.8bn in military aid and Dollars 1.2bn in economic aid from total foreign aid spending of Dollars 13bn. These totals are non-repayable grants paid up front, allowing Israel to earn interest on them. The loan guarantees provide the full amount requested by Israel to help it absorb Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The US president can, under the terms of the guarantees, subtract amounts spent on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Other conditions are fairly loose, including no specific requirements for structural reforms to Israel's economy. The US offered the total of Dollars 10bn - which is just Dollars 2bn short of the total value of US-provided guarantees to all Arab countries in the last five years - despite Israel's admission that a recent slowdown in the rate of immigration means it may not need to borrow to the full total. The guarantees enable Israel to borrow on preferential terms. Israeli officials are pleased that the level of risk capital which must be set aside in the US budget to underpin the guarantees was set at 4.5 per cent, not 7 per cent as originally proposed by US officials. Israel has agreed to pay this amount. The military co-operation deal under negotiation is expected to detail the transfer of Dollars 700m in used US equipment to Israel and Dollars 200m in pre-positioned US equipment. The deal is likely to cover greater co-operation in both intelligence and early warning, along with development of high-tech weaponry. Israel is also seeking to spend more of its US military aid on domestically produced weapons to bolster its hard-pressed military industries.</p>

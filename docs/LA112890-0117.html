			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HEADING BACK: Three minutes after election of Britain's new prime minister  (A1), Sir Eldon Griffiths (above) was phoning Orange County, saying he'll be  back here by Sunday.  </P> <P> Griffiths, a Conservative member of Parliament from Suffolk and president of  Orange County's World Affairs Council, was recalled to London to vote for prime  minister. . . . The result seems "very brutal, but it is very efficient. In two  weeks, we changed from a longstanding prime minister who was getting into  trouble to a man who has the support of the entire party. If you have a  President who falls out of favor, you're stuck with him." Jerry Hicks and  Jeffrey A. Perlman  </P></p>

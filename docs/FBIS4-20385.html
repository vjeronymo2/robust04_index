			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cai Ping (5591 5493): "Problems in the </F> Agricultural Product Pricing and Circulation Systems and Some  Solutions"--the authors are affiliated with the Ministry of  Agriculture's Comprehensive Planning Department]    [Text] Looking back at the 15 years of reform of the  agricultural product pricing and circulation systems, especially  the very vigorous reform in the last two years, we have had  amazing results, but there are also some problems. The major  problems are seen in the following areas:    1. There are conflicts between small productions and the big  market:    A basic condition existing in the agricultural sector at  this  stage is the contradiction between small productions and the  big market. In 1992, we had 224.89 million peasant households  nationwide. They had production, circulation, and management  autonomy, but limited and constrained by transportation and  information and other conditions, the small-scale production  management mode of individual families and households cannot  really meet the needs of a nationwide big market. Every time  the wind blows and the grass rustles -- at the slightest sign of  trouble -- there will be serious supply and demand problems.  They often lead to all kinds of buying and selling "hardships"  which obstruct circulation and in turn jeopardize and dampen the  peasant production enthusiasm.    2. The "price scissors" between industrial and agricultural  products have widened in recent years, and the peasant real  income have been slow to increase:    In 1989, the retail price index of rural industrial products  rose 18.7 percent; the procurement price index of agricultural  and sideline products rose 15 percent -- the price scissors  between industrial and agricultural products widened by 3.2  percent in a year. Meanwhile the peasant per capita net income  was 601.51 yuan, 1.6 percent lower than in the previous year.  This was the first time the peasant income showed negative  growth since reform began. In 1990, due to lower negotiated and  market prices of grain, the agricultural and sideline product  price index fell to 97.4 percent, 2.6 percentage points below  the 1989 level, and during the same period, the rural industrial  product price index rose 4.6 percentage points; the "price  scissors" between industrial and agricultural products widened  by 7.4 percent. In the same year, the peasant per capita net  income was 686 yuan, and discounting the price factor, it only  increased 1.8 percent over the previous year. In 1991,  agricultural and sideline product procurement prices fell 2  percent compared to the previous year, but in the same period,  rural industrial product prices went up 3 percent; the peasant  per capita net income was 709 yuan, and discounting the price  factor, income rose only 2 percent compared to the previous  year. In three years, the peasant per capita net income only  rose an average of 0.7 percent a year, but based on constant  prices, the rural population's per capita agricultural output  value was rising at an average rate of 5.4 percent per year:  Agricultural output value was increasing much faster than the  peasant net income. Under the Seventh Five-Year Plan, peasant  per capita net income rose 9.6 percent, but in the first two  years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, their income only increased  6.9 percent; the rate of increase has clearly slowed. In 1992,  the peasant per capita net income was 784 yuan, and discounting  the price factor, their actual income was 5.9 percent higher  than in 1991. Agriculture's lack of productive momentum  seriously undermines agricultural input.    3. Because of the shortage of procurement funds, the lack of  storage facilities, and departmental separatism and local  blockades, the circulation of agricultural products is often  plagued by "hardships" the handing out of "IOUs" and other  blockages in the circulation system, and the situation is  becoming increasingly serious.    Statistics show that in the fall of 1992, the nation needed  more than 90 billion yuan in grain and cotton procurement funds,  and there was a 50-60 billion yuan shortfall. Many localities  had no cash at the time they weighed and bought the grain and  cotton and could only hand out "IOUs." According to the Ministry  of Agriculture's statistics, at the peak, as much as 3.7 billion  yuan's worth of "IOUs" were handed out last year for grain and  cotton procurement nationwide. This seriously dampened the  peasant and the masses' productive enthusiasm.    4. Too large a percentage of the main crops are put under  state-set prices and centralized management, and their prices  are too low:    Currently, of all the agricultural products procured by the  state, the prices of five types are set by the state. In some  cases, the power to set prices have been handed down by the  higher authorities but not at the lower levels; some prices are  decontrolled in name but not in fact, and sometimes the central  government has decontrolled prices but the provinces have not,  or the provinces have but not the cities. The mandatory nature  of those prices has not changed. Take grain prices for example.  Even though 28 provinces and municipalities nationwide have  partially or completely decontrolled the procurement prices; in  fact, grain procurement prices must still comply with the  state-set minimum protection prices and cannot really move up or  down according to market supply and demand conditions. The power  to set prices for cotton and tobacco is still in the state's  hands, which does not mobilize the productive enthusiasm of the  localities and the peasants. In addition, there is no price  differential to account for the major farm products' quality  difference, which does not give expression to the pricing  principle of higher price for better quality and lower price for  poorer quality. This does not facilitate high yield, high  quality, and high efficiency in agricultural production.    5. The way the state sets prices causes the peasants to be  inflexible about demanding higher prices:    In recent years, in the wake of the significant increases in  the price of agricultural means of production, the cost of farm  production has also been rising at a rate of 10 percent a year.  The peasants have become increasingly vocal in demanding the  state to set higher cotton, tobacco, and other agricultural  product prices. Even though the state has raised cotton prices  four times since 1987, because of plant diseases and insect  pests, the comparative advantage of planting cotton has steadily  declined. In 1992, some localities have shown negative growth in  the after-tax, per-mu net profit, and the peasant clamor for  higher cotton procurement price has grown louder. Shandong and  other localities have even demanded raising cotton price by  100-150 yuan per dan; otherwise cotton production will continue  to slip. Although the state readjusted grain procurement prices  in 1992, many peasants are still complaining that the prices of  capital goods are increasing too fast and grain prices are still  too low. Constrained by its financial strength, the state cannot  raise agricultural procurement prices year after year, and this  has exacerbated the conflict and contradiction between the  state's and the peasants' interests.    6. There are big loopholes in the pricing mechanism,  especially in the double-track pricing of some agricultural  products.    When the market price of agricultural products is higher  than  the state-set procurement price, not only the peasants look at  the price differential as an invisible burden and are unwilling  to fulfill their fixed quota procurement responsibilities but  even some procurement departments and management units, acting  in their own interests, will down-grade the products to lower  prices and dock the peasants' pay and re-buy and resell the  planned and extra-plan goods to make a profit and add to the  confusion in the circulation domain.    7. Price management of most decontrolled agricultural  products is in a state of confusion:    By the end of 1992, after more than a decade of price  reform,  about 90 percent of the prices in the retail sector have been  decontrolled. More than 75 percent of the agricultural products  procured by the state now either follow the state's guidance  prices or market-regulated prices. From the point of further  reform of the agricultural pricing system in the future, the  proportion of state-set prices will continue to shrink, and the  share of market regulated prices will continue to grow, and  eventually, all prices will be decontrolled. But in the interim,  the state has not yet set up an indirect macroeconomic  regulation and control mechanism to regulate market prices, and  when market prices surge or plunge, it can only resort to even  more administrative measures to intervene; it cannot truly give  play to the economic, legal and regulatory, and other  macroeconomic regulation and control measures.    8. In recent years, in the wake of bumper harvests of grain  and cotton and other major crops, the conflicts between the  production and sales areas are further exacerbated.    In years of bumper grain harvest, the warehouses in the main  production areas are filled to the brim but cannot transfer the  grain out while the sales areas are not stocking grain but will  transfer grain in as their stock is depleted. When cotton  production is low, out of their self-interest, the production  areas often ignore the state's allocation and transfer plan,  forcing the mills in the sales areas to shut down as they wait  for raw materials. Conversely when there is a bumper cotton  harvest, the sales areas will ignore state plans to transfer  cotton in a timely manner, and as a result, cotton is stockpiled  in the production areas, slowing the fund turnover rate.    9. The existing grain policy does not mobilize the peasants'  enthusiasm in developing agricultural production:    Even though China has adopted a protective price system in  grain procurement this year, judging by actual results, these  prices have not really protected the peasants' rights and  privileges. The scope of protection is too narrow: It is limited  only to the original state contracted grain procurement and  special grain reserve; other grain purchases at negotiated  prices are not protected by the state. Moreover, most grain  produced by the peasants still do not qualify as commodity, and  under this kind of double-track grain pricing system, when there  is plenty of grain, the state is unable to buy up everything,  and it down grades the product to lower prices or issue "IOUs"  when making purchases, so that the peasants are in effect  subsidizing the purchases, and when there is a grain shortage,  the state wants to "monopolize" everything, and the peasants are  again short-changed. In addition, the state financial subsidies  are rising sharply year after year, and even though grain sales  have been made at the procurement price in the last two years,  state expenditure on subsidizing the circulation of farm  products has continued to rise. Both the state and the peasants  are losing money.    10. The surge in the prices of means of production has  seriously dampened the peasants' production enthusiasm.    In 1992, the agricultural product price index rose 3.4  percent while the price of agricultural capital goods went up  3.7 percent and the cost of living for peasants rose 4.7  percent. Even though the state has set a maximum ceiling price  for chemical fertilizers and other means of production this  year, their prices have continued to surge. The price of  state-allocated urea rose from 538 yuan a ton in 1991 to 662  yuan in 1992, a 23 percent increase. The composite price of urea  rose from around 880 yuan last year to around 1,040 yuan this  year, rising more than 10 percent. Locally produced small  batches of carbonic ammonium tanan also rose from 300 yuan last  year to 340 yuan this year. Meanwhile, the prices of grain and  cotton and other farm products the peasants sell to the state  have remained relatively low. The outcry that farming does not  pay, that farming is a money-losing business has grown  increasingly loud.    11. The market system is unhealthy:    Currently, the agricultural product circulation market has a  small radius; the market's role is seriously curtailed.  "Hardships" take turns in plaguing the buyers and the sellers,  and prices either surge or plummet. The bartering position and  trading conditions for peasants have further deteriorated; the  cost of exchange and the price of information have risen  sharply. The price hazards are borne entirely by the state and  the peasants.    The only way to solve the above problems is to deepen the  reform of the agricultural product pricing and circulation  systems and further decontrol prices, decontrol management, and  decontrol the market, so that the market mechanism truly plays a  role in regulating supply and demand as well as prices. However,  this does not mean that the state should wash its hands of  everything; instead it should continue to strengthen the  macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as management of  the decontrolled farm products, and gradually set up a sound  state agricultural reserve system and hazard regulation fund  system and other price protection systems. Only in this way can  we gradually set up a new system compatible with the socialist  market economy and develop the new and necessary agricultural  product pricing and circulation systems.    1. We should continue to implement a contract procurement  system for key agricultural products:    Currently even though grain and most agricultural product  prices have been decontrolled and are regulated by the market,  the thousands and hundreds of thousands of peasant households  who are accustomed to the product economy are having trouble  adjusting to this sudden transition from the product economy to  the market economy. The state must provide guide the peasants'  production management activities to help them cope with the  risks and the income fluctuations brought by the market economy  as soon as possible. As far as the state is concerned, it needs  a relatively stable supply of commodities in order to avoid the  hazards brought by market volatility. Therefore, the state both  wants to and also needs to implement the contract procurement  system with regard to grain and cotton and other major crops  that affect the national economy and the people's livelihood.  The contracts should be signed by the peasants with the state on  a voluntary basis and in accordance with the principle of equal  exchange and fair negotiation. The state should guarantee  purchase of agricultural products under contract to further set  standards for the peasants' production behavior.    2. We should continue to implement the agricultural product  protection price and a host of preferential policies and  measures:    This year, 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions nationwide have partially or completely decontrolled  their grain procurement prices. Because of reduced output of  cotton last year, the state's cotton reserve is low and it will  continue to sign contracts for fixed quota procurements.  However, as three of the provinces piloting the reform of the  cotton circulation system, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu will  open up their markets after fulfilling their nationwide  procurement contracts. In the future, the state should continue  to expand the pilot project to reform the cotton circulation  system, striving to decontrol the management, the market, and  the price of cotton by 1995, and it should gradually set up a  new system under the state's macroeconomic regulation and  control which makes market regulation the primary means of  regulation, links domestic and foreign trade, and creates a  highly efficient and smooth cotton circulation system. But in  order to guarantee the sustained and steady development of  agricultural production, the state must install supportive  prices for grain and cotton and other major crops that are vital  to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Each year,  before the peasants begin planting, the state should announce  the minimum protection price, and if the market price is higher  than the minimum price, procurement should be made at market  price, and if the market price is below the minimum protection  price, the minimum price should prevail so as to truly protect  the peasants' interests. The purchased grain and cotton should  primarily be put into the state's reserve.    3. We should set up a key agricultural product price hazards  fund or price regulation fund system:    Setting up a major agricultural product price hazards fund  or  price regulation fund is one of the important measures the state  can use to regulate and control price fluctuations. To impose  supportive price or protection price for the major agricultural  products, it is necessary to have a price hazards fund or price  regulation fund as safeguard; otherwise it would be difficult to  impose those prices. The funds should be financed primarily by  the state, and a secondary source may be the local governments.  In addition, with the elimination of price subsidies for grain  and cotton and other important crops, the state can use the  money earmarked for the subsidies to finance the regulation or  hazard fund.    4. We should gradually set up a three-level--central,  provincial, and prefectural (county)--reserve system.    Nature still plays a critical part in China's agricultural  production. Natural disasters and market supply and demand  conditions have tremendous impact on farm output. Bumper  harvests often create large stockpiles; the crops cannot be sold  at the set prices, which results in lower income for the  peasants, and this in turn diminishes their production  enthusiasm. When crops failed, it often leads to panic buying of  farm products, causing an upsurge in prices and severe ups and  downs and highs and lows in farm production which have an  adverse effect on agriculture's sustained, steady, and smooth  development. Setting up a three-level--state, provincial, and  prefectural (county)--reserve system for the major crops will  play a positive role in the state's macro market regulation and  control, in guiding farm production, and in stabilizing the  agricultural product markets and product prices. Currently, the  country already has a reserve of more than 70 billion jin of  grain, more than 20 million tons of cotton, and more than 2  million tons of sugar, but they fall far short of the needs of  the development of the socialist market economy. As the economy  continues to gather strength, the state must further expand and  increase its grain, cotton, oil, sugar, and other key  agricultural product reserves in order to promote steady  increase in agricultural output. Only in this way can we  promptly regulate the disequilibrium in the supply and demand of  grain and cotton and other key agricultural products so as to  stabilize the market and curb price increases.    5. We should further strengthen the macro management and  regulation and control of the decontrolled agricultural products.    In the wake of the ever-deepening reform of the agricultural  product pricing and circulation systems, the absolute majority  of the farm products have turned to the market and are regulated  by the market. Therefore, the state must further strengthen its  macro management and regulation and control of the decontrolled  agricultural products, further standardize their market  behavior, strive to strengthen the supervision and management of  the agricultural product market, and use legal means to manage  and rectify market order. It should formulate and announce a  guidance-oriented plan for the major crops each year and make  market forecasts, and it should promptly announce the  guidance-oriented prices and commodity supply-demand information  each year before the peasants begin production, so that it can  correctly guide the peasants' production management activities,  standardize the commodities exchange activities, and advocate  fair competition, and it can prevent price gouging, deceptive  and predatory market practices, and monopolistic behaviors.    6. We should actively nurture and develop all sorts of  country fair markets and wholesale markets for agricultural and  sideline products.    Agricultural production management must turn to the market  and implement market regulation. Amid intense market  competition, we must ascertain the changes in market demand and  develop products that sell, that are of high quality, high  yield, and are highly efficient, and by continuously developing  the primary processing and deep processing of agricultural  products, we an increase their added value and continuously  raise the input-output ratio. This would require us to nurture  and develop all types of agricultural product country fair and  wholesale markets, and through these markets, we can guide the  flow of goods, so that the products truly flow smoothly, and  then we can promote agricultural development and upgrade the  product-mix.    7. We should actively promote the integration of planting,  breeding, and processing; commerce, industry, and agriculture;  peasants, workers, and businessmen and further strengthen the  socialized system of services to fully coordinate the  production, supply, and marketing of agricultural products.    Actively promoting the whole series of services to integrate  or seriate planting, breeding, and processing; commerce,  industry, and agriculture; peasants, workers, and businessman is  one way to properly resolve the uncoordinated production and  sales of agricultural products, the separation of town and  country, and the contradiction between small productions and the  big market. On the one hand, the leading enterprises and the  peasants will be guaranteed their own fairly stable source of  goods and marketing channels, which will greatly relieve the  "hardships" in the buying and selling of agricultural and  sideline products. On the other hand, by processing and changing  the agricultural and sideline products and increasing their  added value, the peasants can steadily increase their income.    8. We should continue to implement the policy of setting  maximum ceiling prices for chemical fertilizers, diesel, and  other important agricultural means of production.    To maintain the sustained, stable, and smooth development in  agricultural production and make sure that the peasants do  benefit from growing crops, in the next few years, the state  must implement the policy of setting maximum ceiling prices for  chemical fertilizers, diesel, and other important agricultural  means of production, so as to truly protect the peasants  interests. The policy of setting maximum ceiling prices should  not be limited to factory-exit prices but should extend to  retail prices too. Today, a ceiling price only applies to the  factory-exit price but not to the retail price, and this in fact  cannot curb price increases but actually causes prices to go up.  Therefore, so long as the prices of factors of production have  not merged tracks with international prices, we must continue to  set maximum ceiling prices for chemical fertilizers, diesel, and  other important means of production. After setting maximum  prices, the state should subsidize the chemical and industrial  enterprises that have incurred losses as a result.    9. We should continue to perfect the two-tier contract  management system that integrates centralization and  decentralization and further develop coordinated services  before, during, and after production.    To resolve the peasants' small production management style  which is based on a single household or a single family, we must  further deepen the reform of the rural economic system. In  particular, we should further perfect the two-tier contract  management system that integrates the centralization and  decentralization of agricultural products. We should continue to  launch a series of coordinated services before, during, and  after production, so that we can gradually attain economies of  scale in agricultural production and escape or resolve the  contradiction between the individual households' or families'  small-farmer production and the socialist unified great market  circulation. We should gradually set up a comprehensive,  coordinated service system extending the entire agricultural  production process, so that the peasants can adjust to the  transition and changes from planned agriculture to market  agriculture as soon as possible. Of course, we will fall short  if we rely only on the above measures to resolve the  contradictions in the agricultural product pricing and  circulation realms. The state must continuously increase its  investments in agricultural production, improve agricultural  infrastructure and capital construction, strengthen  agriculture's fundamental role, and increase agriculture's  comprehensive productive capacity. Only in this way can  agricultural production continue its sustained, stable, and  smooth development.</p>

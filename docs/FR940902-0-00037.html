			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters expressed the concern that the regulations were too prescriptive in requiring OJT in higher skilled occupations. The language of &sect;627.240(b)(2) of the interim final rule was merely intended to encourage the use of OJT in higher skilled occupations. Language is added to the redesignated &sect;627.240(b)(5) to make this clear. Other commenters were concerned that the 6-month limitation was inconsistent with providing training in very high skilled occupations. The Department agrees that there are some higher skilled occupations for which OJT training may not be available because of the 6-month limitation. Nevertheless, that limitation is statutory and cannot be ignored. The Department believes that there are still a number of higher skilled occupations for which OJT is appropriate and that it is consistent with both the nature of OJT and with the intent of the Act that States and SDA's seek to use OJT to provide training in those kinds of occupations. Therefore, the language encouraging OJT in higher skilled occupations remains in the final regulation. The Department wishes to acknowledge several comments by noting that, while it encourages OJT in high-skilled occupations, this is not a strict requirement. Also, while OJT contracts may recognize training times that are longer than 6 months, JTPA reimbursement to the employer is limited to 6 training months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters wanted to know how the 500 hour exception to the 6-month limitation works. First of all, it should be repeated that the overall limitation on the duration of OJT is 6 months, not 500 hours. This exception will apply in only a limited number of situations, such as in the cases of individuals who are disabled, who have limited employment availability due to child-care or other needs, or who must work a limited or part-time schedule. The final rule makes it clear that individuals who have not received 500 hours of OJT within 6 months may receive 499 hours of OJT, even if this results in OJT in excess of the 6-month duration. The 499 hour figure is used because it reflects the ``less than 500 hours'' language contained in the Act. For example, if an individual works for 15 hours a week and 6 months later has only been in training for about 360 hours (roughly 60 hours a month for 6 months), the participant could be continued in OJT for up to another 139 hours. The objective is to assure that participants who must work limited or part-time schedules receive up to 499 hours of OJT, in situations when up to 499 hours of training is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to a comment that the interim final rule unnecessarily requires that the regular training duration provided for in a standard reference be reflected in the participant's ISS, the final rule provides that the training time for OJT must be reflected in the ISS only when the training time varies from the average training time for the occupation, using the methodology adopted for computing training time. Thus, when greater or lesser OJT periods than those provided in standard reference works are necessary, the variation must be reflected in the participant's ISS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters noted that the language in paragraph (c)(1) of the interim final rule regarding employer payments is more restrictive than the provisions in the Act. In response to these comments, the final rule is revised to use the language of the Act, which provides that payments shall not average more than 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to such participants. This change provides the SDA with some flexibility in structuring OJT contracts with an individual employer for multiple participants. Compliance with the statutory requirement is based upon the total allowable wage base (i.e., regular wages and scheduled increases reflected in the contract) for all JTPA participants. Additionally, in response to comments which questioned the wage basis for OJT reimbursement, the final rule clarifies in paragraph (c)(2)(ii), that OJT reimbursement may be based upon regular pay and scheduled increases, and not, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii), on overtime, shift differential or other premium pay. The Department believes that regular pay and regular scheduled pay increases reflect the wages specified in the Act and that overtime and shift differential do not imply a greater level of training cost to the employer. Finally, to clarify a longstanding issue in regard to OJT, paragraph (c)(2)(iv) indicates that payments are not to be based on time when the participant is not in training such as on holidays. Such time may also be excluded from the calculation of the duration of OJT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 141(g)(1) of the Act provides that payments to employers ``are deemed to be'' in compensation for the extraordinary costs associated with training JTPA participants. Section 141(g)(3)(A) of the Act provides that each contract ``specify the types and duration of on-the-job training and other services to be provided in sufficient detail to allow for a fair analysis of the reasonableness of proposed costs *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This latter requirement was reflected in the interim final rule. Some commenters raised a question about the apparent conflict between these provisions, and the Department wishes to clarify this area. The final rule prohibits the imposition of a requirement on employers to document extraordinary costs. The Department believes that payments to employers should not produce a recordkeeping burden on employers by requiring the documentation of extraordinary costs that would unnecessarily make OJT a less desirable training option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of &sect;627.240(d)(1) of the interim final rule was to reflect the requirements of section 141(g)(3) of the Act. It was not intended to require specific documentation of an employer's extraordinary costs. The Department views the final rule as requiring no more recordkeeping of an employer than is already required of the employer for other purposes, (e.g., an employer would have to maintain payroll records to demonstrate that a participant worked the number of hours that were billed, but payroll records are already required to be kept for a variety of other federal and state purposes). Rather, the Department believes that the intent of this requirement is that the contract accurately reflect the basis for the contract costs, including the number of participants, occupations, wage rates, training content and the duration of training, provisions for adjustment (such as scheduled wage increases), and the basis for any other payments (such as separately scheduled classroom training as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

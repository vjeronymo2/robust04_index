			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IRS and Treasury believe that abuse could occur if the ``private to public'' exemption from the normally applicable rules were of unlimited duration. Accordingly, new &sect;1.162&hyph;27(f)(2) provides that the exemption will apply for the duration of a reliance period that lasts until the earliest of the expiration or material modification of the plan or agreement; the issuance of all employer stock or other compensation that has been allocated under the plan; or the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the initial public offering occurs. A taxpayer may rely on this exemption for any compensation received pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right, or the substantial vesting of restricted property, if the grant (as opposed to the exercise or the substantial vesting) occurs before the close of the reliance period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS and Treasury have decided that the ``private to public'' exemption should not apply to a subsidiary of a publicly held corporation, where the subsidiary has been spun off or has otherwise become a separate publicly held corporation. This is because those subsidiary corporations are considered to be publicly held before the spinoff under the affiliated group rule of &sect;1.162&hyph;27(c)(ii). However, the IRS and Treasury recognize that it may be difficult to obtain shareholder approval of otherwise performance-based compensation in some of these situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, new &sect;1.162&hyph;27(f)(3) provides alternative rules for satisfying the requirements for performance-based compensation in the context of a spinoff or similar situations. The first alternative prescribes the method for applying the existing rules to satisfy the performance-based compensation requirements for compensation paid after a spinoff (or similar transaction) pursuant to a plan or arrangement established before the spinoff (or similar transaction). The second alternative provides relief from the shareholder approval requirement during a transition period that ends with the first regularly scheduled meeting of the shareholders of the new publicly held corporation that occurs more than 12 months after the date on which the corporation becomes a separate publicly held corporation. This alternative may be necessary where shareholder approval of compensation is not obtained before the spinoff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Earnings on Deferred Compensation Payable Under a Binding Written Contract <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(h)(1)(iii)(B) is amended to conform to changes made to &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iii)(B) (with respect to permissible increases in the amount of compensation where payment of compensation has been deferred).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Special Transition Rule for Outside Directors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(h)(2) is amended to extend the transition relief for the treatment of disinterested directors (as defined in &sect;1.162&hyph;27(h)(2)) as outside directors until the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs on or after January 1, 1996. Thus, for example, if disinterested directors establish a bonus plan (that satisfies the performance-based compensation requirements of &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)) for 1996 before that first shareholders meeting, and the plan is approved by shareholders at that meeting, payments under the plan will satisfy the performance-based-compensation requirements if the compensation committee comprised of the new outside directors certifies that the performance goals have been satisfied prior to payment of the bonuses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Portuguese slowdown worse than expected PORTUGUESE economic growth was smaller than expected last year, with investment and industrial activity showing clear signs of slowing down, according to Portugal's National Statistics Institute (INE). The INE figures were published at the weekend in Semanario Economico, the leading economic and business weekly newspaper, which will publish a full report on the economy later this month. The figures suggest that gross domestic product grew by only 2 per cent in 1991, compared with previous official estimates of 2.7 per cent. The new figure is markedly lower than the 4.2 per cent growth achieved in 1990, and while it remains above an estimated 1.3 per cent average growth for the European Community last year, the extent of the slowdown is more pronounced than had been thought. There was a smaller than expected rise, of about 2 per cent in real terms, in investment, down from a rise of 7.3 per cent in 1990, while the use of industrial capacity is calculated to have declined by between 2 and 3 percentage points. According to INE, exports grew by only 1 per cent, while imports rose by 6.4 per cent with a strong increase in consumer goods imports. These latest figures underlie Portugal's difficulties in maintaining a high growth rate when its most important trading partners are in recession. They will worry the authorities, whose aim is to maintain growth well above the Community average while sharply cutting inflation  - which was 11.4 per cent last year  - in an effort to bridge the gap between Portugal and its richer EC partners. Central bank officials said at the weekend they were maintaining their estimate of 2.7 per cent growth for last year, though other economists suggested growth could turn out to have been even lower than the 2 per cent envisaged by INE.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> DARMAN HITS 'WONDERLAND POLITICS' OF DEFICIT;  </P> <P> BUDGET NOMINEE SAYS HE WANTS TO END 'GAME' WHERE 'CUTS ARE INCREASES'  </P> <P> Richard G. Darman, nominated as George Bush's budget director, told Congress  today that he hopes to replace the "wonderland politics" that brought about  huge federal budget deficits with realistic deficit reductions.  </P> <P> Darman, in prepared testimony for his Senate confirmation hearing, said it was  essential that the federal deficit be reduced.  </P> <P> "We must end the game of wonderland politics where cuts are increases and going  down means going up," Darman said.  </P> <P> Under questioning by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Darman said the  President-elect does not plan to weasel out of his pledge not to raise taxes by  calling a tax increase something else.  </P> <P> He said he expects Bush will abide by the "duck test" -- if it looks like a tax  increase, it is a tax increase.  </P> <P> Bush "meant 'no new taxes' as it would ordinarily be understood by ordinary  Americans and the duck test should be applied," Darman said. "If ordinary  people think it is a tax increase, it is a tax increase."  </P> <P> He specifically included in Bush's "read-my-lips" pledge against tax increases  a boost in the gasoline tax, higher levies on alcohol and tobacco, removal of  home mortgage interest deductions and taxation of currently exempt employee  fringe benefits like health insurance.  </P> <P> Concerned that Darman was opening the door to tax increases by some written  answers to advance questions, several members of the committee questioned him  about possible new taxes.  </P> <P> In his written responses Darman had said that under some circumstances a boost  in taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and liquor could be viewed as "user fees." He  had also suggested that higher taxes on Social Security benefits might be  described as a "benefit reduction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serious Calamity  </P> <P> During the questioning today, Darman said that a serious economic calamity  caused by the huge budget deficits might force him to recommend that Bush  violate his pledge.  </P> <P> But he emphasized that he did not foresee such a recommendation, in large part  because it is important that a new President not lose his credibility by  reneging on a campaign promise.  </P> <P> Asked how many years Bush's no-tax pledge was good for, Darman replied, "We  might as well assume forever -- certainly for some extended period of time."  </P> <P> Darman, the point man in Bush's battle to reduce the deficit, was widely  praised by committee members for his government skills and is expected to win  confirmation easily as director of the Office of Management and Budget.  </P> <P> Darman is in many ways similar to David Stockman, President Reagan's first  budget director. Both men have been described as brilliant political  strategists, but they have also been accused by critics of being abrasive and  intellectually arrogant.  </P> <P> Darman's role as head of management and budget will put him more in the  spotlight than he was during the Reagan years, when he served as one of the  Administration's top behind-the-scenes strategists, first as a top White House  aide and then as deputy Treasury secretary. In both posts, he worked closely  with James A. Baker III, nominated by Bush to be secretary of state.  </P> <P> Darman resigned from the No. 2 job at Treasury in April, 1987, to take a job  with the investment banking division of Shearson Lehman Bros. He was lured back  into politics last year when he joined the Bush campaign.  </P></p>

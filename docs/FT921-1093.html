			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Dismay at US stance in Gatt talks on services THE threat by the United States to withdraw large chunks of its services sector from multilateral fair trade rules met an angry response yesterday from trading partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The European Community said on Monday the US move set back the chances of reaching agreement on liberalising trade in services in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks and would make it more difficult for the EC to compromise on farm subsidies, still the central issue blocking completion of the Round. At yesterday's meeting to review progress in the detailed country-by-country negotiations on liberalising services, other nations joined the EC in expressing dismay at the US position. The US says it will refuse to guarantee access to maritime transport, civil aviation, financial services and basic telecommunications on a 'most-favoured-nation' basis - equal treatment for all trading partners - unless other countries come up with better offers to open their services markets to foreign suppliers. Defending Washington's stand, Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the US wanted a successful services agreement but that market-opening offers by trading partners were not sufficient to ensure a balanced accord. The US argues that the US services market is basically an open one, so that guaranteeing MFN treatment to trading partners will freeze its market open and those of other countries shut. However, Mr Yerxa made it clear that the exemptions the US is seeking for maritime transport and civil aviation were not negotiable. Sweden was among those countries which said that if shipping was not to be part of the services liberalisation accord it would have to review its own offer. Shipping is also a key area for Japan, and for EC members such as Greece. Trade officials fear the US tactics may backfire, leading to a withdrawal of market-opening offers already made rather than making countries more forthcoming. The mood yesterday was pessimistic. Little progress has apparently been made in recent days in bilateral talks, with both the US threat on services and the continued impasse between the US and the EC over farm subsidies holding back final concessions. The next stock-take on services has been fixed for April 3. Gatt members have set an Easter deadline for finishing the Round as a whole. Mr Yerxa denied that the US than other countries in its services proposals. The EC has said it too might need to take MFN derogations if other countries' offers were not improved. Of 21 Gatt members presenting MFN exemption lists, ll included exemptions for financial services, 14 for maritime transport, 10 for audio-visual services and 5 for telecommunications.</p>

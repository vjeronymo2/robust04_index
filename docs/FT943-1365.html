			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Josephthal acquires D Blech assets The assets of D. Blech, a New York broking firm forced to close on Thursday due to an inability to meet regulatory capital requirements, were taken over yesterday by another firm, Josephthal, Lyon &amp; Ross. It was not clear whether Josephthal would continue to make markets on Nasdaq in all the stocks which had been traded by Blech. The firm had specialised in small biotechnology stocks, having taken a number of companies in the sector public. The shares of many of these companies plunged on Nasdaq on Thursday as rumour spread that Blech would close. The assets taken over by Josephthal did not include Blech's inventory of stocks. The firm said it had agreed to take on the firm's brokers, analysts and traders, along with its accounts. It is also planning to take over two of Blech's four offices, based in New York and Boca Raton, Florida.</p>

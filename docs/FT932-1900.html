			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Bristol print sackings raised in European parliament AN INDUSTRIAL dispute at a Bristol printing company was raised in the European parliament yesterday by Mr Ian White, the Labour MEP for Bristol and Bath, as an example of what he said was one of a series of attacks on the rights of workers in the UK. One hundred and twenty two members of the GPMU print union were dismissed on April 26 by the family company of JW Arrowsmith after voting for industrial action in pursuit of a Pounds 6.50 a week pay rise. They were subsequently sent letters offering re-engagement at their previous levels of pay but were told that the company would no longer recognise the union and there would be personal contracts. Since then only six workers have been re-employed and the company, founded in 1854, has been picketed by the dismissed staff. The union says the average length of service is 20 years. Mr John Price, a union branch official, said: 'It is an old family firm with loyalties you don't find in big companies. It has been a very flexible workforce and this is their reward.' Mr White yesterday presented a petition signed by the sacked workers to the European parliament together with a written declaration condemning the UK government for allowing such action by employers. 'This is not just an isolated incident,' he said. 'The problems at Arrowsmith's are just part of a series of attacks on the rights of workers in the UK.' He said the practice of derecognition of trade union negotiation procedures, and the issuing of individual employment contracts, set UK workers apart 'as potentially the most exploitable in the community'. Miss Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown, chairman and managing director, said the company had suffered since January from an unofficial overtime ban before the industrial action vote was taken. She said neither the union nor the chapel (local union branch) had behaved responsibly. 'I think the chapel's view was: 'We have to have a wage increase, never mind whether the company can afford it'.' JW Arrowsmith, which mainly prints technical journals, says it has suffered from the recession and made a loss of Pounds 201,000 last year on a turnover of Pounds 4.6m. Miss Arrowsmith-Brown said that because there had not been a good return to work after the dismissals, the company had restructured itself with a much smaller staff. It employed 55 people, and did not expect to increase that above 65 or 70. 'For us, it is no longer a dispute. There is no resolution to be achieved.'</p>

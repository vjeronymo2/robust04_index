			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London Metal Exchange COPPER prices were buoyed up yesterday by market talk, confirmed after the close, of a force majeure at the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea. Traders said sizeable orders came from both sides of the market during a busy afternoon session and three-month copper closed at Dollars 1,649.75 a tonne, up Dollars 7. Ok Tedi produces about 200,000 tonnes a year of copper in concentrates but has had difficulty shipping cargoes since August because of low water levels in the Fly River. 'All important customers will have been aware of the situation for a while. It could cause a bit of a squeeze on smelters, but buyers have had time to take action,' said one trader. World OIL prices held much of the gain made in an explosive rally earlier this week. December futures for the world benchmark Brent Blend of crude oil traded late in London's afternoon around Dollars 16.15 per barrel. This was down from Wednesday's closing Dollars 16.22 but comfortably above Dollars 15.60, the low from which the Wednesday rally began. SILVER closed in London up 17 cents at Dollars 4.415 an ounce and PLATINUM gained Dollars 6.35 an ounce to Dollars 375. Compiled from Reuters</p>

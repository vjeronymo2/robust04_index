			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Direct Line It is hard to begrudge Mr Peter Wood his millions, since he has built the UK's largest motor insurer from scratch. Unlike notorious growth stocks of the 1980s, Direct Line's success is based soundly on its position as the lowest cost producer in an otherwise sleepy market. Plans to expand in home insurance and the risky end of motor insurance make sense. Buyers are paying unnecessary expenses - such as building societies' commissions on house structure policies. Low costs should prove a big advantage. Insuring risky drivers is not a commodity business, so the decision to set up a new venture in this area also looks wise. Yet with decent computer systems it should be possible to keep close tabs on claims. The US experience suggests good profits can be made in this area. With around 6m riskier motorists to aim at, and 15m insurance-buying households, the Direct Line formula has plenty of mileage left. Royal Bank of Scotland has little incentive to demerge its progeny. Direct Line should be self-financing within 18 months. A high level of reinsurance cover reduces the risk of a hurricane blowing a hole in the bank's profits. With an expense ratio well below the competition - and falling as it pushes more business through existing systems - Direct Line could follow prices lower through the underwriting cycle and still remain profitable. Applying a growth-stock multiple to this year's likely earnings results in a market valuation comfortably above Pounds 1bn. Even after yesterday's rally, Royal Bank shareholders should continue to feel the benefit.</p>

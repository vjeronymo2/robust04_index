			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The cuts run deep for London Underground AN AIR of gloom pervaded the headquarters of London Transport yesterday as managers applied themselves to the task of cutting Pounds 600m-worth of investment in the Underground over the next three years. Nothing in the speculation that preceded the chancellor's Autumn Statement had prepared London Transport for the shock that hit it on Thursday afternoon, when it learned of swingeing cuts to its budget. Government funding next year will fall from Pounds 1.39bn to Pounds 1.01bn, and in the year after from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 960m. The new figure set for 1995-96 is a lower-than-expected Pounds 950m. The reductions hurt all the more because London Transport was the only transport operator to suffer an attack on its budget. The roads programme survived unscathed, while British Rail won a modest increase in its funding. Mr Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's chairman, made no attempt to disguise his anger. 'I am hard put to understand, even in these tough economic times, why the pain of these cuts should be uniquely visited upon London,' he said. The London Regional Passengers Committee, the statutory watchdog for the capital's public transport users, said the cuts were all the worse for coming on top of a fare increase of twice the rate of inflation. One positive element of the London Transport settlement was that the budget for the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line extension to Docklands escaped the cuts. This means that if Canary Wharf's administrators and their banks can come up with Pounds 400m towards the line's construction costs, the project might yet go ahead. But good news for Docklands means bad news for the rest of London, since the Jubilee Line funding appears to have survived largely at the expense of the rest of London Transport's budget - most of which is consumed by the existing Underground railway. The result is that the budget for Underground investment will fall from Pounds 700m-Pounds 750m a year to Pounds 500m-Pounds 550 a year. A range of planned improvements for passengers will be lost along the way. For example: The badly needed modernisation of the Northern Line, due for the second half of the 1990s, will be postponed to the next century. Modernisation of stations on the Central Line to accompany the replacement of track and trains will no longer take place. The Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly Line will close because there is not enough money to replace the lifts at Aldwych station. The planned East London Line extensions to Highbury and Islington in the north and East Dulwich in the south will be indefinitely postponed. Plans to build an interchange at King's Cross linking the deep-level Victoria and Piccadilly lines with the surface-level Metropolitan and Circle lines will be abandoned. The replacement of the escalator link between Bank and Monument stations in the heart of the City is unlikely to go ahead. The cut in London Transport's budget comes less than 18 months after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report criticised the government for starving the Underground of investment. That resulted in a big - and, as it turns out, short-lived - increase in funds last autumn. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said London Transport would still receive much more money for the next three years than it had for the past three. Besides, he noted, more was being spent on the Underground than all the nation's schools put together. Mr David Bayliss, London Transport's director of planning, observed that this was a fairly meaningless comparison. 'Personally, I think the government should be spending a lot more on schools,' he added. 'But not at our expense.'</p>

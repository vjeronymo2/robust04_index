			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: City finds new hope amid apparent crisis - Fund managers pour money into equity market THE STEEP rise of the equity market yesterday might appear a perverse reaction to an apparent economic crisis, but to people in the City the jump in shares was entirely logical. The volume of share trading was huge as fund managers poured money into the market. 'It is one of those very rare occasions in one's life when the world does change overnight,' said Mr Nick Knight, equity strategist at Nomura Research Institute. Mr Knight has been one of the most bearish stock market commentators in recent months, but overnight he became optimistic. He had not had time for detailed analysis but said: 'Forget the numbers. We're bullish]' Mr Knight expects a cut in UK interest rates from 10 per cent to 8 per cent, perhaps today. The reversal from the 15 per cent interest rate mooted only 24 hours earlier could hardly be more dramatic. 'On Wednesday morning the policy was low inflation at any price,' he said. 'Today (Thursday) it is growth at any price. 'Up till 2pm on Wednesday the government's performance had been incredibly bad. 'The first sensible thing they did was push rates from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. The next sensible thing was to walk away from it that evening, and the third was to cut to 10 per cent.' Mr Alun Jones, UK equity research analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, was not quite so dramatic in his remarks, but he, too, said he believed that the whole basis for looking at the market had changed. He had expected the government to try to defend sterling with higher interest rates for longer than a few hours, although he had assumed the end result would be the same. He too said he was looking for an interest rate cut - though perhaps only of 1 percentage point - by the time of the Conservative party conference, which starts on October 5 in Brighton. Cynical analysts suggested that the best hope the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer had of regaining support in the Conservative party was to cut interest rates before the conference begins. An interest rate fall needs to work through to a reduction in mortgage rates before consumers' willingness to spend is likely to recover. The equity market is now looking for a recovery in company profits, firstly from the effect of translating profits made abroad into sterling at a lower exchange rate. Then comes the benefit of a weaker pound to companies that export and those which compete with imported goods. After that, a resumption of growth in the economy expected from lower interest rates should begin to feed into company profits. An immediate boost will come for companies that translate their overseas profits into sterling at year-end rather than average exchange rates. Mr Jones said that whereas a week ago stockbrokers were forecasting lower profits for the market as a whole for this year, it was now possible to look for a small rise. In 1993, UBS P&amp;D thinks, a 10 per cent devaluation in sterling would add 6 per cent to industrial profits. Further, a revival in the economy should be possible without an immediate increase in inflation. 'The economy is so weak that inflationary pressures are snuffed out for quite a while,' it said. The equity market had been a little uncomfortable about the idea of persistent low inflation. Equities have been regarded as a hedge through the high-inflation years, and performed well relative to fixed interest securities. Favoured sectors and stocks are those with big overseas earnings or which compete internationally, and among mainly domestic companies, those in cyclical industries. During the recession, fund managers shifted the weighting of their portfolios away from cyclical stocks to the so-called defensive sectors  - companies that should do well even in more difficult times, such as drug companies, food retailers and utilities such as water and electric companies. Yesterday the switch back began. As Mr Knight put it: 'Sell defensives; there is nothing to be defensive against.' Rises were seen in the share prices of companies with large US earnings, such as Tomkins, Siebe and United Biscuits. Coats Viyella gained both from its dollar exposure and because it competes in the UK with imports, as does British Steel, another gainer. Also well ahead were companies in the building sector, such as Blue Circle, which would benefit from lower interest rates, and, in furniture stores, MFI rose strongly. Defensive stocks were left behind in the general surge. A few shares even fell yesterday, particularly in UK-oriented companies and utilities such as Northern Foods, Sainsbury, British Telecom and some water stocks. Marks and Spencer shares rose less than the market. Also gaining were some of the banks, whose exposure to bad debts is now perceived to be less serious. There were dramatic increases in the prices of smaller property companies, such as Stanhope and Rosehaugh, which had been regarded as high-risk investments when the outlook was for interest rates to remain high.</p>

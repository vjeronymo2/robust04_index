			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by John Spira] </F>   [Text] Armscor's [Armament Corporation of South Africa] net  income declined by R44.4 million [rand] to R40.2 million in the  year to March.    The bulk of the decline stemmed from a R29.6 million  reduction (to R196.5 million) in the government's allocation for  operating and technology expenditure, with the balance coming  mainly from additional spending in the areas of market  promotion, legal proceedings and upgrading of computer network  cabling.    Sales were static at R110.2 million.    The net value of group assets rose by 15.6 percent to R338.1  million.    Armscor is a public corporation and its financial results  are  therefore of interest primarily to the taxpayer.    It is an acquisition organisation and the financial results  therefore do not reflect the scale of the activities in which it  is involved.    Thus, for example, the acquisition cash flow for which it  was  responsible in 1993-94 totalled R4.5 billion.    A major portion (2.5 billion) of this cash flow went towards  its aerospace portfolio, with the balance accounted for by  vehicles and weapons, and electronics and maritime.    Because of reducing allocations of state funds for defence,  Armscor is examining various areas to enable it to retain its  capabilities, among them:     -  Making its acquisition services available to other public  organisations.    -  Offering its counter-trade capabilities to South African  industry at large.    -  Becoming involved in regional co-operation on defence in  African and southern Africa.    -  Providing acquisition support to defence forces of other  African states.        Chairman I.J. Moolman notes: "The proven capabilities of  Armscor to determine client needs, to establish technology, to  obtain military systems and equipment, both locally and abroad,  and to provide life-cycle product support will be indispensable  to the local security forces, as well as within the southern  African region."</p>

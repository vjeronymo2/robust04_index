			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER VIETNAMESE AND FORMER CIA CHIEF  </P> <P> After reading "Ex-CIA Chief Defends Role of Vietnamese in Little Saigon" (April  17), and not exactly being an admirer of William Colby, I resent Colby's  reference to the attitude toward the Vietnamese mirroring the one toward  Italian immigrants. There is no comparison between the Vietnamese and the  Italians.  </P> <P> Remember, an Italian discovered America -- not a Vietnamese -- and the Italian  has a greater right to be in this country. What have the Vietnamese contributed  to the United States?  </P> <P> Their presence is a constant reminder of a very dark page in American history  when our young men died needlessly so some Vietnamese can immigrate here and  proceed to satisfy his greed for wealth.  </P> <P> The inscription at the foot of the Statue of Liberty reads "Give me your poor,  your hungry . . . yearning to be free" and not "yearning to get rich." These  people will never be accepted by the rest of us who worked so hard to make this  country what it is today.  </P> <P> SAL GIARDINO  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

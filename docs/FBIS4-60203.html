			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 22 (AFP)--Northern forces on Sunday  captured the southern military base at 'Ataq, the capital of the  oil- producing province of Shabwah, a military spokesman said  here.    "All of the base's facilities are in the hands of the legal  (northern) forces," the spokesman told the north's official  SABA' news agency.    The northern forces, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih,  also shot down a southern MiG 21 fighter plane above Shabwah and  "seized large quantities of weapons and munitions in storage  areas in the province."    "Shabwah's citizens actively contributed to the success of  the legal forces," the spokesman said.    In Lahaj Province to the west of Aden and Abyan Province to  the east, northern forces "cleaned up several pockets of  resistance," the spokesman said.    "Large quantities of weapons were seized" during these  operations, including an abandoned helicopter, he said. The  north's air force has continued "to carry out its missions,  hitting targets with precision."    The claims could not be independently verified.    Before the war broke out on May 5 the areas of Shabwah and  Masilah produced 140,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd),  accounting for almost all of the south's output. Another  195,000 bpd is produced in the northern Ma'rib region.</p>

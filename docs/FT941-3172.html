			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Absence of biographies of modern business leaders Sir, It is not surprising that your March Review of Business Books does not contain a biography of a success-ful leader of a modern business. A visit to any large bookshop will similarly fail to unearth among the lives of politicians, film stars, novelists and sporting idols, any accounts of how the leaders of today's successful companies reached the top and created wealth and worth in getting there. Why is this? Are the plutocrats and dynasts of industry uniquely modest, or is there no human interest in how their power is manifest? There is great educational value in disseminating the art of business leadership, both to managers in work and to a general readership who are the customers of their enterprise. Perhaps the Financial Times could bring together the leaders of the publishing world with those of our most successful retailing, financial and manufacturing companies. P V Zealander, head of employment and remuneration, Post Office Counters, Drury House, 1/16 Blackfriars Road, London SE1 9UA</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Caretaker world trade role seen for Sutherland: Early decision on his successor is unlikely Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is believed to be ready to stay on in a caretaker role as head of the future World Trade Organisation if the contest for his successor remains deadlocked. Mr Sutherland, whose official term ends in July next year, has stated he will not be a candidate for director-general of the WTO, which is expected to begin work on January 1. It now appears unlikely that a decision on his successor will be made by early next month, when Gatt members are due to endorse the appointment. This will make it virtually impossible for the new head to start in January. Although no formal proposal to stay on has yet been made to Mr Sutherland, it is being discussed by trade diplomats anxious to assure a smooth transition from Gatt to the more powerful WTO. However, some officials hope the decision on the choice of WTO chief can still be made by next month. A third round of consultations among Gatt members on the appointment will be held in Geneva this week. Trade officials said yesterday they expected the outcome to be a continued three-way split on regional lines between Mr Renato Ruggiero, the EU candidate, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the outgoing Mexican president who has US and Latin American backing, and Mr Kim Chul-su of South Korea who has Asian support. Although Mr Ruggiero is ahead numerically, the eventual decision must be made by consensus. Delays in ratifying the WTO and the associated Uruguay Round of global trade accords, the continued stalemate over the next OECD secretary-general and the lack of engagement of the US in the WTO race are all seen as obstacles to consensus. To these must now be added uncertainty over the outcome of the Uruguay Round vote by the US Congress in three weeks' time. A rejection by Congress would certainly kill the WTO, which could not operate effectively without the participation of the world's biggest trader. Of Gatt's 124 members, only about 30 countries have so far ratified the world trade pact, and they do not include any of the Quad group of leading traders - the US, the EU, Japan and Canada. Most have been awaiting the US decision. The mid-term elections and the impending Uruguay Round vote have also kept the US out of the active horsetrading that will be a part of an eventual deal.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Karmit Gay, </F> Sheli Yehimovich, and Shlomo Raz on 13 April; place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Yehimovich] The Jewish  settlers were once favored by the government, even when your  party was in power before. Now they have been somehow pushed  into a corner. Naturally, they are not all made of one skin.  They are not all Barukh Goldstein. Many of them have a  different world view. Do you intend at any stage to resume a  dialogue with them, to hold a closer and more frequent dialogue  with them?    [Rabin] In a democratic state, it is legitimate to support  or oppose the government policies. Staging legal demonstrations  is legitimate. It is not legitimate to make threats or issue  warnings about use of force. It is certainly not legitimate to  issue halakic decrees urging soldiers to disobey orders. To me,  this is most grave. It is inconceivable to call on soldiers of  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] -- which, as the military, is  subject to the democratically and legally elected government  which issues legitimate orders -- to disobey an order. Had we  accepted the principle that anyone may decide for himself what  is right and what is not -- whether he is a rabbi or a public  figure -- hundreds and thousands of soldiers would have refused  to serve in Lebanon and hundreds, if not thousands, would have  refused to serve in the territories.    I believe the Jewish nation has a right to settle in Eretz  Yisra'el, but according to a concept. When I was prime minister  between 1974 and 1977, I prevented the establishment of a Jewish  quarter in Hebron. I believed it to be a mistake. This is what  Qiryat Arba' is for. I opposed setting up Jewish settlements in  areas densely populated by Palestinians. I agreed to the  establishment of settlements in the 'Etzyon Bloc, in Qiryat  Arba', in the Jordan Rift Valley, and on the outskirts of  Netanya, such as Alfe Menashe and Elqana. I never wanted  settlement in the heart of the Palestinian population in Judaea  and Samaria, between Ramallah and Nabulus.    Jewish history mentions Nabulus but, for example, Ashqelon,  Qiryat Gat, and Ashdod are situated on historical Philistine  land. Today, they are rightfully part of the State of Israel. I  do not suggest that we view the Bible as the book of maps of the  Jewish state. To me, the Bible is the book of religion, real  values, real codes, tradition, and the history of the Jewish  nation. This is how I studied it, and not as the book of the  precise maps of the Jewish state. [passage omitted]    [Raz] Does the way the settlements are spread out not make  it very difficult for the current government to make decisions  regarding the future of the West Bank?    [Rabin] This is the reason we chose the path we did. The  path started at Camp David, with the idea of autonomy for the  Palestinians, and continued in the negotiations at the Madrid  conference, where the word autonomy was erased, not by us, but  by the Arab side at the very beginning of the negotiations that  led to the convention of the Madrid Conference. The word  autonomy does not feature in any of the papers that accompanied  the letter of invitation to the Madrid Conference. The word  autonomy does not appear in any paper presented by Israeli  Governments -- and I stress governments in the plural -- during  the negotiating process. It was replaced by Self-Government  Arrangements for the Palestinians. This is what we are dealing  with.    I believe our approach is correct. I know there is a serious  problem. We must change the reality on the ground before we  approach the issue of the permanent solution. I believe that  the reality of settlements located in areas densely populated by  the Palestinians -- and I am not referring to Greater Jerusalem,  the 'Etzyon Bloc, or the Jordan Rift Valley -- the reality in  which settlements are spread out among such a dense population  does place a burden on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], which  must provide them with security. If I take the size of the  force currently situated in Hebron.... [pauses] This is no  simple matter. Nonetheless, it is our duty to defend all the  Jewish settlements. This is also in accordance with the  Declaration of Principles for the interim period. We have  reached an agreement with the PLO that the Jewish settlements  will remain in place, and we....    [Gay, interrupting] But there is a settlement in the heart  of Hebron which you personally said is a mistake....    [Rabin, interrupting] I opposed it, but now it exists. I  have said this before, and I am willing to repeat: Given a  militarily strong Israel, I would not want to remove a  settlement for security reasons, but I am willing to remove  settlements for peace. There is a precedent. In order to  achieve peace with Egypt, we not only returned everything we had  conquered from Egypt in the Six-Day War, down to the very last  inch of sovereign Egyptian soil, but we also uprooted every sign  of Israeli presence in the Sinai: the entire area of the Rafah  enclave, Yamit, Ofira, and so on. The precedent of the price of  peace was determined, to a large extent, when we made peace with  Egypt. We hope to change it. Again, given our military might  and even if the price is a painful one, I say yes to evacuating  settlements for peace and no to evacuating for security reasons.  [passage omitted]</p>

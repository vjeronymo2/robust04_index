			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> As the 28-year-old father of twin boys, I am outraged at the promotion trailer  for Chevy Chase's "Christmas Vacation." What is wrong with critics who by  praising the film seem to be condoning a family pet being electrocuted?  </P> <P> Where was the SPCA when such a disgusting scene was even being considered for  filming? Probably taking another coffee break.  </P> <P> GRANT McCULLOGH, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

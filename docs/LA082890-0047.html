			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A Horse Is a Horse: About 200 people milled around Sunday under a wild cherry  tree in Tahlequah, Okla., where Mr. Ed, the 1960s television star, is said to  be buried.  </P> <P> But there's no record of his death because Mr. Ed was a horse, of course. A  5-foot granite monument, with a picture of the "talking horse" sticking his  head out over a barn door, was unveiled on the farm of Danny and Darlene  Snodgrass. In another version of Mr. Ed's demise, a person associated with the  show said the horse died in 1973 and was cremated, and his ashes strewn over  Hollywood. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The eighth working-  level contact between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  (DPRK) and South Korea closed unfruitfully at Panmunjom today,  without setting a date for the next round of contact.    The eighth contact held at the truce village was designed to  arrange for inter-Korea exchange of special envoys, but it only  lasted for one hour, the shortest of the eight contacts made  thus far.    Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK delegation, told reporters  after the talks ended that the major cause leading the contact  to failure was the south's "sudden change in its attitude".    The south side declared that it would "take a strong  position" against the north, restore the suspended Team Spirit  '94 joint military exercises with the United States, advance  with its plan on the deployment of "Patriot" missiles in the  south, and take part in international sanctions against the  DPRK, Pak said.    This showed that the south side did not intend to realize an  inter-Korean exchange of envoys, the chief DPRK negotiator said.    He added that the north side had demanded the south change  its tough position, but had received no response.</p>

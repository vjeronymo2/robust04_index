			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Clinton may intervene in Mideast peace talks US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is considering calling a personal meeting with the heads of the Arab and Israeli negotiating teams in Washington shortly in a renewed American effort to breathe life into the Middle East peace process. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, said in Damascus yesterday this indicated the importance that the US attached to the peace efforts. Earlier Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, had damped down hopes of quick progress in the ninth round of the talks and warned that negotiations could 'blow up' if references to the final status of the occupied Arab territories was put on the agenda. His remarks were primarily directed at Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, who on Sunday said Israel faced a decisive two weeks of negotiations and called for the pace of the talks to be accelerated. Mr Peres, a long-time rival of Mr Rabin within Israel's Labour party, said he favoured an eventual confederation between Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Mr Rabin, in an Israeli newspaper interview, retorted that the only way to complete negotiations quickly would be by giving the other side everything that they demanded. 'I do not intend to do that,' he said. The prime minister also ruled out Mr Peres's proposals on confederation saying that meant conceding a Palestinian state. As the negotiations entered the second week of the present session, Israel and Syria appeared deadlocked over the core issue of the 'full peace' which would follow a 'full withdrawal' from the occupied Golan Heights. Israel is insisting that Syria must specify in detail what it means by a 'full peace' before it will indicate how much of the Golan it will return. Mr Rabin insisted yesterday the onus was on Syria to break the impasse. The lack of progress achieved in any of the sets of talks, which also include Lebanon and Jordan, appear to have dashed earlier US hopes that all the delegations might agree to remain in Washington for an extended period.</p>

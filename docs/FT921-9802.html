			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Levy challenges Shamir for Likud leadership MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, faces an important pre-election test of strength within his own Likud party next week following the weekend decision by Mr David Levy, the populist foreign minister, to run against him for the party leadership. Mr Levy, whose more conciliatory approach to the Middle East peace talks has deepened a long-running rivalry with the hardline prime minister, represents the less privileged Sephardi, or Oriental, Jews within the Likud who have recently criticised Mr Shamir for not doing enough to combat economic hardship. Mr Shamir is expected comfortably to defeat both Mr Levy and Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister 'hawk' who declared some weeks ago, when the leadership vote is held at a meeting of the Likud's 3,000-strong central committee on February 20. The committee will prepare for the general election on June 23. But the three-way race will test the support within the party for the 76-year-old prime minister's controversial leadership and provide a pointer to who may succeed him when he eventually steps down. The day before the Likud vote, the main opposition Labour party, struggling to close a five-point Likud opinion poll lead, will ballot its members on a challenge to the leadership of former prime minister Mr Shimon Peres. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, himself a former premier and defence minister, stands a good chance of unseating Mr Peres in what has been an acrimonious battle between them. The respective leadership contests have provided the early domestic focus of the election campaign in which the main issues will be the economy, staggering under the weight of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union, and Israel's stance in the peace talks. The two issues have already come together in Israel's request for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees from the US to help finance immigration. Washington is refusing to grant the assistance without securing a halt to new building of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. At a meeting in Washington on Friday, Mr Zalman Shoval, the Israeli ambassador, failed to reach agreement on the issue with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state. They will hold more talks. Meanwhile, a joint US-Israeli committee is to be formed to agree economic terms for the loan guarantees. The US is pressing for accelerated reforms in the still state-heavy Israeli economy. Mr Shamir wants to be able to tell the electorate he won the loan guarantees without making a humiliating retreat on his commitment to expand the settlements. Labour, by contrast, would freeze settlements to secure the aid and help secure a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Mr Levy's stance is much tougher than Labour's. But his body of supporters within Likud, many in peripheral 'development' towns where unemployment is 10 per cent or more, tend to be more concerned about economic difficulties than the ideological issue of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. An immigrant from Morocco in the early 1960s who made his way from the construction site to the cabinet, Mr Levy's background could hardly have less in common with that of Polish-born Mr Shamir, a flinty Ashkenazi, or European, Jew. He was goaded into running by the decision of Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, to challenge his number two position in the party. Mr Shamir and Mr Arens, who are allies, apparently hope a decisive defeat will undermine Mr Levy's future leadership aspirations. Mr Levy has cast himself as a champion of the peace process within Mr Shamir's cabinet, urging a spirit of compromise on his colleagues. But the balance of power within the Likud central committee remains weighted in favour of Mr Shamir.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Executives close ranks behind Tories - Business support LEADING business executives are closing ranks behind the Tories in an unprecedented show of support at such an early stage of an election campaign. Industrialists say senior party figures such as Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, have played an increasingly important role in galvanising business support in recent weeks. However, in a letter to The Times today, 38 Labour-supporting business people welcome the Opposition party's 'innovative and prudent' shadow Budget unveiled this week. The group is led by Lord Hollick, managing director of financial services group MAI. Other signatories include Ms Carmen Callil, managing director of publisher Chatto and Windus, Mr Paul Hamlyn, the publisher, and Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of engineering group Caparo. Conservative fundraising efforts among business people, led by its deputy treasurers Lord Laing of Dunphail and Sir John Cope, have been stepped up in recent months. A senior political and public relations adviser to several large companies that support the Tories said: 'After flirting with the Labour party, people now realise the race is serious. Money has been pouring into the party over the past few weeks.' He said Mr Patten had recently moved to rebuild the party's relations with businessmen closely associated with Mrs Thatcher, the former prime minister, after initially taking a 'cavalier approach' to Thatcherite business supporters following Mr Major's election as party leader. Mr Bob Worcester of Mori, the polling organisation, said: 'Business is playing a more assertive, more prominent role in this election because the contest is so close. In 1983 and 1987 the Tory party went into the election with a comfortable lead so it was less necessary for business to make its position clear.' The strength of business support for the Conservatives suggests that Labour has largely failed in its attempts to woo industrialists. Today's letter supporting Labour comes in response to a letter from 43 leading businessmen supporting the Conservative party published in The Times yesterday. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, the international foods, drinks and retailing group, who organised the earlier Times letter, said he had circulated a draft of it to about a dozen friends two weeks ago. Other industrialists volunteered to sign. Sir Allen said that had the publication been delayed for a week, more than 100 executives would have signed it. He denied that Conservative central office had encouraged the group to write the letter. Observer, Page 18</p>

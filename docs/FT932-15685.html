			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: 3i Yet again 3i's shareholders have delayed the company's slide down the slipway. Their indecision is puzzling. It has also sparked the abrupt departure of 3i's recently-installed chairman who had been entrusted with completing the flotation. There is certainly no pressing need for shareholders to sell. Midland's once-desperate need for capital has been reduced following its takeover by HSBC. Other bank shareholders too have seen their financial pressures lessen. They believe they can realise greater value by waiting for the upswing. Since its disappointing interim results, 3i has reported that its investments have risen strongly. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of new investment applications. But the stock market has already anticipated much of the recovery. In recent months there has been a marked narrowing of the gap between asset values and share prices in the quoted investment trust sector. 3i's size and reputation could have perhaps ensured a flotation price just 10 per cent below its asset value. Given that 3i was only going to be partially floated, it is difficult to believe it could much improve on that. The suspicion must be that the delay does not simply signify a change in market tactics but also a reassessment of strategy. The banks should clarify their intentions. Otherwise they will damage the company now and make it harder to float later.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Dow to invest in east Germany Dow Chemical of the US intends to take control of the core of the former East German chemical industry in a deal which will bring DM2.9bn (Dollars 1.87bn) of investment from the Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency. Through its subsidiary Dow Deutschland, Dow intends to buy majority stakes in the steam cracker at Sachsische Olefinwerke in Bohlen, the electrochemical units and derivative operations at Buna, and the intermediate chemical operations at Leuna. The three units formed the basis of the old East Germany's chemical industry before unification. Since then, the Treuhand has been planning to hive off the entire industry to private investors. It has been engaged in a big restructuring programme aimed at attracting investors to install a new steam cracker facility and oil refinery in the region. The Treuhand has been providing generous financial investment incentives for the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical sector, in which 68,500 people had been employed before 1990. This figure has fallen sharply to 12,300 through closures, redundancies and early retirement schemes. The Treuhand will invest DM2.9bn to modernise the polyolefin complex at Buna and to build a pipeline from the east German northern port of Rostock. This line will ship gas sold by Gazprom, the Russian state-owned utilities company, to Buna. Treuhand officials said that majority control of the Buna complex's equity would pass to Dow over time. The Treuhand would retain a 49 per cent stake for several years. Dow would eventually acquire 76 per cent of Buna's equity, with Gazprom taking the rest. Buna is this year expected to have a turnover of DM800m and losses of about DM300m. However, Treuhand officials said Buna could move into the black in four years and the investments would be completed by the end of the decade.</p>

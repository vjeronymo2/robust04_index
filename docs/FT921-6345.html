			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Hills looks for 'options' to spur action by India MRS Carla Hills, the US trade representative, has asked an interagency group to 'develop options' for dealing with India's failure to provide 'adequate and effective' patent protection. While praising India for progress made in its efforts to provide copyright and trademark protection, Mrs Hills said serious problems remain with its lack of product patent protection for pharmaceuticals, its 'excessively short-term protection and overly broad involuntary licensing provision'. She is prepared to continue to work bilaterally and multilaterally with India in hopes of avoiding US sanctions. According to the trade representative, India has agreed to submit legislation to its parliament to provide for rental rights for videos, improve protection for sound recordings and tighten enforcement of copyrights. It has guaranteed national treatment to foreign owners of trademarks. New legislation, to be submitted to the Indian parliament, will provide statutory protection for service marks and make other improvements in the law, she said.</p>

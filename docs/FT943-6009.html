			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Two radio stations to open today Five new large regional commercial radio stations capable of reaching more than 15m people are being launched over the next fortnight, the first two going on air today. The FM stations, aimed at adults, are staging the UK's largest number of virtually simultaneous radio launches. The stations should boost commercial radio's 47.4 per cent share of total listening, put further competitive pressure on the BBC, and encourage growth in radio's 4 per cent share of total advertising. The largest of the new stations, JFM 100.4 Northwest, launches today with a mix of blues, soul, rhythm and blues and jazz. It will be able to be heard by about 6m people in the north-west. Mr Peter Salt, managing director of the new station, which is a subsidiary of Golden Rose Communications, said yesterday he had received more than 800 letters of appreciation from people who had heard test transmissions. Heart FM, which will launch on September 6, will specialise in soft adult contemporary music. Up to 3m people in Warwickshire and the west Midlands will receive the station. Heart, which is owned by Chrysalis, the media group, has already taken more than Pounds 300,000 in advance advertising bookings. Century Radio, a wholly owned subsidiary of Border Television, will be aimed at the north-east. It also launches today with a mixture of speech, music and well-known broadcasters such as Simon Bates and James Whale. Galaxy Radio goes on air on September 4 with a mixture of classic and contemporary dance music and local and national news to about 2m listeners in the Severn estuary area in the south-west. The last of the five to go on air will be Scot Radio on September 16, broadcasting to central Scotland. The station, whose main shareholders are Border and Grampian Television, should be able to reach 70 per cent of the Scottish population with a mixture of music, and news, phone-ins and conversation during the day.</p>

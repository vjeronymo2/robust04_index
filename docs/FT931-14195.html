			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Debate on Bosnian peace plan adjourned THE Bosnian Serb parliament last night adjourned a crucial debate on the Geneva peace plan as a midnight deadline passed for acceptance of the constitutional proposals for a new Bosnian state. The debate, which is to resume this morning, took place as international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen prepared to fly to Zagreb and Sarajevo today. The Bosnian Serb assembly, meeting in Pale, was to debate the proposed framework, under which Bosnia would remain a unitary state, but would be divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, last week accepted the plan, on condition that it was approved by his assembly, and after he had been subjected to strong pressure by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president. During a pause in last night's debate Mr Karadzic expressed confidence that the measures would be approved. However the 7 1/2 -hour session included many speeches from opponents. Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for Lord Owen and Mr Vance, said they had been invited by President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia in an attempt to bring an end to the flare-up of fighting between Moslems and Croats, nominally allies in the conflict with the Serbs. The two men will have talks with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Bosnian Croat leader Mr Mate Boban in Zagreb, after meeting Mr Izetbegovic but will not go to Pale. It is clear that the Bosnian Serbs interpret the peace proposals differently from their authors, who see them as a guarantee against the creation of an independent Serb state within Bosnia, which would have the freedom to decide on a union with Serbia proper. In Pale, Serb officials, in an attempt to justify their expected approval of the constitutional framework, said they viewed it as similar to the UN peace plan for Croatia: a means to consolidate their territorial gains in Bosnia. Far from restoring Bosnia-Hercegovina's territorial integrity, the officials said the plan opened the way to a de facto recognition of a Bosnian Serb republic. AP adds: 'The atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Moslems pale in comparison to the sheer scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and other abuses committed by Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian Moslems,' the US State Department said yesterday in its annual human rights report to Congress.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Uphill fight in the high street / Chart the continuing struggle of Britain's consumer services sector as it fights to survive recession South Molton Street's designer clothes stores shut up shop for a few hours yesterday in a protest against a proposed rent rise. The threatened rent rise looked the last straw for the stores on one of London's most fashionable shopping streets. Like other retailers, travel companies and leisure groups that make up the consumer service sector, they are struggling against the worst recession most of them have known. Several companies have gone bust. The collapse of International Leisure Group (ILG) and Lewis's department stores alone cost nearly 4,000 jobs. Other companies can only hope that they can cling on until the autumn when economists expect the outlook to be brighter. Why has this sector, once seen as the key to Britain's economic resurgence, suffered so severely in this recession? Are its difficulties purely a product of short-term economic pressure, or are they related to longer-term changes in consumer markets? And what will the sector look like after the recession? Consumer services were relatively resilient in the last recession of 1980-81. This was because real interest rates were comparatively low - in that base rates were lower than inflation - and companies had been run cautiously after the oil shocks of the mid-1970s. There was relatively little expansion in leisure, entertainment and even in retailing. Video shops, theme parks, superstores and multiplex cinemas were all in their infancy in the early 1980s. This recession is different. Real interest rates are high and the consumer sector is far larger. The latest unemployment figures show that employment in the service sector (which includes commercial as well as consumer services) fell by 82,000 to 15.76m in the final quarter of 1990. Marks and Spencer, which is today expected to disclose static profits, recently announced 850 redundancies. Moreover, many consumer service companies are burdened by high borrowings after a decade of expansion. When interest rates rose and consumer spending declined, companies such as ILG and Lewis's could no longer afford to pay the interest on their debt. Brent Walker, the troubled leisure group which owns William Hill betting shops and Brighton Marina, is still struggling to restructure the Pounds 1.4bn debt amassed in its acquisitions of the 1980s. Certain areas of consumer services have emerged unscathed. This is mainly because some groups of consumers are better off thanks to high interest rates, notably the over-50s, with low mortgages and high savings, and the under-25s, who have few financial commitments. The companies that service these particular customers are still faring well. Blackpool Pleasure Beach is busy, partly thanks to its popularity with the over-50s. The beach has invested heavily in new attractions for them, such as the afternoon karaoke 'sing-alongs' in the Cabaret Rooms. So far this season, despite rain and recession, attendance levels are 14 per cent higher than last year. The cinema is flourishing too, partly because of its appeal for the under-25s. Cinemas enjoyed their best year for a decade in 1990 with average weekly admissions of 1.88m people. So far this year, they have fared even better with average admissions of 1.94m a week in the first quarter. But pleasure beaches and cinemas are the exceptions. The worst-affected companies are those catering for the 25 to 40-year-olds, the 'yuppies' of the 1980s, many of whom bought property near the peak of the housing market and are now saddled with hefty mortgage repayments and credit card debt. The 'designer' shopping centres that opened in the 1980s, such as Tobacco Dock in east London, are littered with boarded-up windows. Restaurants are suffering too. Mr Alistair Little, who runs the eponymous restaurant in London's Soho, first noticed the slowdown towards the end of last year. His regulars have since been eating out less often and spending less on their meals. Companies linked to the housing market have also suffered. Home furniture, one of the first areas to be affected, saw sales fall by 6 per cent in real terms to Pounds 4.7bn last year. This was devastating for Lowndes Queensway, one of the biggest furniture retailers which had just completed a Pounds 450m leveraged buy-out. Last summer, Lowndes called in the receiver. In general, the recession has accentuated the difference between the stronger and weaker players. In the pubs market, Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive of Whitbread, one of the biggest brewers, has noted the difference between 'good pubs in large premises with decent facilities' which are still doing well and the 'bad pubs in run-down areas' which are 'finding life very difficult'. When the end of the recession comes into sight later this year, the critical question for the consumer service sector is what its long-term consequences will be. Some areas of consumer services are unlikely to return to their pre-recession buoyancy. The designer shops and expensive restaurants in the 'yuppie' market would probably have contracted even without the economic downturn. The self-indulgent young adults of the 1980s are now settling into the responsibilities of family life as they enter their 30s. Other areas will return to growth once the economy recovers. In furniture retailing, where rationalisation has been severe - the number of stores has fallen by 600 to about 14,000 in the past five years - there is sure to be scope for re-investment. The established companies, such as Magnet and MFI, are so burdened by debt that new investors may move into the market. Argos, the catalogue retailer, has been studying furniture retailing for several years and now plans to open four stores. Ikea, the Swedish group which already owns three UK furniture stores, plans to accelerate its expansion by opening up to 15 stores by the mid-1990s. In other markets such as pubs, where rationalisation has been less intense, the recession has tended to accelerate existing trends. The brewers have speeded up the process of closing down their smaller, scruffier pubs in favour of concentrating investment on more promising premises. Whitbread shut 350 of its 6,650 pubs last year and spent Pounds 250m on new pubs and restaurants such as Wayside Inns, its upmarket traditional country pubs. But all consumer service companies face the challenge of getting to grips with the long-term changes in the marketplace. One important issue is the change in demographics: the decline in the number of teenagers and the corresponding growth of the elderly population. This poses obvious problems for businesses like fashion shops and theme parks that depend on the teenage market. Burton, which owns the Top Shop teenage fashion chain, is in the middle of a strategic review of all its operations. Sears, which owns Miss Selfridge and Dolcis, is reshuffling its retail portfolio. The focus of its investment is now on 'family' concepts such as Adams children's wear shops and the Olympus sports chain. Alton Towers, the Staffordshire theme park owned by Pearson (which owns the Financial Times), is concentrating its investment on enhancing its appeal to families. In the past, it has relied on 'white knuckle' rides to attract the thrill-seeking under-25s (who represented two-thirds of its 2m visitors last year). It is now spending Pounds 6m on two new family rides - the Haunted House and Runaway Mine Train - in the hope of attracting more family groups to lessen the blow of the shrinking teenage market. Demographic changes will also intensify the financial pressure on the sector, notably on retailers and fast food chains, which have traditionally depended on a regular influx of teenage employees on low wages. These companies are already examining alternatives. McDonald's, the fast food group, is developing a programme for part-time managers so some employees, notably women with children, can return to work after career breaks. It is also recruiting older managers who have spent most of their careers in other industries. The shortage of teenage recruits will almost certainly force companies to offer higher pay, thereby increasing overheads at a time when they already face rising property costs due to rent and rate reviews, like those on South Molton Street. Demographic and financial pressures aside, the chief challenge for the service sector is to respond to the continuing demand from consumers for higher quality in terms of products and service. This was one of the main trends of the 1980s and has continued, despite the recession, as the pattern of trading in pubs suggests. In some markets, the drive towards higher quality means the successful companies will be those that continually invest in improving their products. The brewers will carry on upgrading their pubs. A recent study by the Brewer's Society suggested that as many as 8,000 of Britain's 80,000 pubs will close over the next decade so the brewers can concentrate resources on their larger, more modern pubs. Similarly, food retailers will continue the process of closing their old supermarkets to concentrate investment on new superstores, the giant stores selling everything from avocados to ankle socks. M and S, which already runs eight edge-of-town clothing and food stores, plans to open up to 25 over the next few years. Tesco has identified 200 prospective sites, many of which will be superstores. However, Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco's chairman, said it also plans to stay in the high street by developing 'high-quality neighbourhood stores'. In other markets, the quality trend could create opportunities for expansion. These will be the less 'mature' markets, such as restaurants and hotels, that have been constrained by the comparatively unsophisticated taste of British consumers. The British undoubtedly became more cosmopolitan during the 1980s but most Britons have never tasted pizza and still stay at home for their holidays. This means that companies like Forte, the hotel group, can expect to expand by 'converting' new consumers, in its case the people who do not usually stay in hotels. One of Forte's most successful concepts is the five year-old Travelodge budget chain. Travelodge, which offers a standard package of a double room for the fixed price of Pounds 29.95, is designed for the leisure travellers who cannot afford luxury hotels but are wary of the poor facilities in bed and breakfasts. There are now 81 Travelodges. Forte plans to open 40 a year at least until 1995. Forte may be right and the British will have become converts to hotel holidays - and pizza eating - by the end of the 1990s. But in the meantime, Forte, South Molton Street and the rest of the consumer service sector face at least another six months of financial pressure as they wait for the end of the recession.</p>

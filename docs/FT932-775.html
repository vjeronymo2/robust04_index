			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: David S Smith David S Smith has negotiated the recession like a traveller crossing a river, hopping from stepping stone to stepping stone. While profits from Smith's cyclical paper division have collapsed from Pounds 15m to next to nothing, the Pounds 24m contribution from the Kayserberg acquisition has kept it moving nicely ahead. With recession in continental Europe now lapping around Kayserberg, Smith has leapt again in buying Spicers for Pounds 95m. Its contribution, combined with strengthening UK paper demand, should save Smith again this year. With the Kemsley mill likely to prove its worth by mid-decade, Smith's growth prospects will be considerably enhanced. After months of disappointment, its shares have some room to run. The Spicers acquisition, though, is not without worries. The company's foray into France has proved disastrous. It may take much time and effort to disentangle. The growing power of stationery retailers also poses a long term threat to Spicers' wholesaling market. A nasty price war in the envelope market is only just cooling down. Still, an exit multiple of little more than 11 is hardly demanding. Moreover, the risks are lessened by Mr Peter Williams' familiarity with the business. Having unloaded Spicers to SCA for some Pounds 300m three years ago at the time of the Reedpack acquisition, Mr Williams is now buying it back again at book value for Smith.</p>

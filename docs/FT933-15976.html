			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ruhrgas feels impact of recession RUHRGAS, western Germany's leading natural gas importer and distributor, started feeling the impact of the domestic recession this year as first-half sales dropped by DM600m to DM6.3bn (Dollars 3.72bn). In volume terms, gas deliveries fell 1.4 per cent for the six months to 290.5bnkWh. The company, whose shareholders include Bergmann, a mining and machinery group with 35 per cent, the German subsidiary of British Petroleum with 25 per cent and Brigitta Erdgas und Erdo, Germany's largest natural gas producer, also with 25 per cent, said the drop in sales stemmed mostly from a fall in the industrial use of gas because of the slowdown in the German economy. Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the board, said he remained confident that sales for the year would reach their 1992 level.</p>

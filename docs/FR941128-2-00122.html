The denial notice was issued on September 13, 1994 and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 4, 1994 (59 FR 50628). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation findings show that the workers produce rebuilt auto parts. The Beech Creek plant produces waterpumps, starters, clutches and alternators while the Lock Haven plant produces carburetors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Its claimed that the company has lost market share because competitors are either importing components or importing the final product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation findings show that the decreased sales or production criterion and the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act have not been met. The findings show that sales at the subject firm increased in 1993 compared to 1992 and in the first six months of 1994 compared to the same period of 1993. Other findings show that the layoffs are the result of a corporate decision to consolidate their operations by shifting production to other domestic facilities. A domestic transfer of production would not form a basis for a worker group certification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The findings also show that Champion takes broken and worn out parts and rebuilds them into working parts. Other findings show Champion imports only when a worn out or broken part is not available to rebuild. These company imports account for a very small portion of Champion's sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Signed at Washington, DC, this 14th day of November 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Victor J.

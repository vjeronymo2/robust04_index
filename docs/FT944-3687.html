			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Ilva Laminati Piani - Other Companies Potential buyers have until noon today to table their bids for Ilva Laminati Piani, the flat steels subsidiary of Italy's state-owned steelmaker. IRI, the Italian state holding company which owns Ilva, set a deadline in the hope of satisfying the European Commission, which must enforce last year's EU ministerial agreement that Italy's state-owned steel industry should be privatised by December 31. Likely buyers have found it difficult to put together solid consortia for the purchase of ILP, the biggest part of the Ilva group.</p>

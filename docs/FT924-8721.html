			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Dairy Crest sells Dales creamery THE HAWES creamery in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, has been sold for more than Pounds 300,000 in a deal that means the continuation of the dale's 800-year cheesemaking tradition, Chris Tighe writes. Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board manufacturing subsidiary, yesterday announced the sale of the creamery and the Wensleydale Dairy Products distribution business to a group including four former members of the Hawes management. Most of the money for the purchase has come from Mr John Gibson, a businessman based at Masham, on the edge of Wensleydale. The four former managers, who between them have more than 60 years of cheesemaking experience, mainly at Hawes, provided the rest of the cash. Mr Gibson said that the team hoped to move next week into the premises, which closed in May. They plan to restart production before the end of this year. Target turnover in the first year was 'several million pounds sterling', he said. The business aims to employ 25 people by the middle of next year. The creamery will concentrate on making small Wensleydale cheeses for the speciality market. Purchase of the Dairy Products distribution wing provides a 400-strong customer order book on which to build, Mr Gibson said. The new business will also lay greater stress on marketing, and develop a visitor centre for tourists at the creamery. The news, following months of uncertainty, was warmly welcomed in Hawes, where the closure cost 59 jobs. 'It's wonderful news. Everybody's delighted,' said local businessman Mr John Blackie, part of the Hawes Dairy Rescue Committee which campaigned to save the creamery.</p>

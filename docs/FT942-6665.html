			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Bad advice victims get a lifeline - But do pension audit services offer real help Former company pension scheme members who transferred their benefits to personal plans after getting bad advice may be tempted to pre-empt the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) guidelines on how those responsible should assess the financial damage and award compensation. Even when the guidelines are published in July, SIB thinks that if all 500,000 potential cases of bad advice are investigated, it could be a year or more before the last one is settled In the meantime, several firms of financial advisers are offering a 'pension transfer audit' service. This claims to provide tangible evidence to help transfer victims pursue a case for compensation. Clearly, though, those who have lost money through pension transfers should not part with any more unless their case looks certain and the adviser can demonstrate independence and pensions expertise. One pension consultant, Lexis*, offers a free fact sheet to help individuals assess if they should investigate past advice. Should the answer be yes, the firm's pension audit costs Pounds 50. If the case then goes to court, Ringrose Wharton, a financial services litigation specialist, will act on a no-win no-fee basis. Ringrose Wharton proved its mettle by making successful compensation claims for more than 1,000 victims of home income plans. Tempting though it is for victims to seek a speedy resolution, SIB points out that pension audits may prove simply to be another bandwagon for advisers. It says its own investigations should lead to maximum compensation in deserving cases - and the service will be free. The timetable Earlier this month, SIB published details of the priority transfer cases and urged advisers and providers of personal plans to negotiate full reinstatement in occupational schemes for all opt-outs - those who belonged to them at the time of transfer. In addition, where the transfer related to deferred benefits - those pension entitlements left behind when an individual changes jobs - SIB identified these priority cases: Those who have died. Those who have started to draw their benefits. Women 50 or over and men 55 or over at the time of transfer. SIB stressed, however, that if you were in one of these categories, you would be on the priority list already and a transfer audit service would not speed up the negotiations. A spokesman said: 'If you do not fall into these categories, then using a pension audit service will not make you a priority case and will only cost you more money.' He added that non-priority cases should write to the adviser or provider concerned and register a complaint. These cases would be picked up in the second wave of investigations due to start after the July statement. 'What the regulators will do is make a co-ordinated approach to schemes and providers to facilitate reinstatement and compensation,' the spokesman said. 'This will be more cost-effective and successful than a series of individual claims from different advisers.' A victim's check-list To help construct an appropriate letter to the adviser or provider, Robert Ivey - head of financial services at actuarial consultant Watsons - suggested that non-priority cases should ask themselves certain questions to assess if they had made a prudent and informed decision at the time of transfer: Did your adviser conduct a full fact-find covering your personal, financial and family circumstances and your attitude to risk? Did the pension provider's illustration show benefits on the same basis as those provided under your previous pension scheme - for example, the same level of spouse's pension, retirement age, and level of increases to pensions in payment? Do you understand the guaranteed nature of the benefits you have given up, and the uncertain level of benefits which could be provided to you under your personal pension plan? Did the person who advised you to transfer examine the history of increases to pensions in payment within the previous scheme? Are you aware of the level of death benefits which you gave up, compared with those available under your personal pension? Did your adviser give you details of how much commission or fees he would be earning for arranging the transfer? If you joined a new employer's pension scheme, did you or your adviser consider transferring your pension benefits into that scheme? Do you understand fully the reasons why you were advised to transfer? If the answer to any of the above questions is no, then you would be well advised to take up the matter with your adviser or provider. In addition, those who were members of a public sector scheme (such as local government, the National Health Service, civil service or police), or who belonged to a good final-salary scheme providing pensions linked to the retail price index (RPI), should certainly query the advice. This is because a personal pension or buy-out bond is unlikely to be able to match these benefits. Reinstatement problems Between now and July, SIB has to negotiate with personal pension providers and occupational schemes to determine the cost of full reinstatement. In most cases, this will be far higher than the surrender value of the personal pension plan. The shortfall arises mainly because the provider will have deducted charges to cover its own administration and the commission payments to salesmen. But pension scheme transfer calculations also are at fault. Two plus two equals three Even if the life office concerned offered a full return of the transfer value, the scheme actuary would still identify a shortfall for complete reinstatement. Under a typical final-salary scheme, where the pension is linked to the level of salary at retirement, the real value of a member's pension rights at transfer - known as 'past service reserve' - takes into account full earnings' inflation up to retirement date. Most schemes in the private sector pay out transfer values that are significantly lower than the past service reserve. In theory, this means that if you took a transfer cheque on Monday morning and handed it back on Monday afternoon, it would not pay for full reinstatement. Life offices are not the only ones to make a turn on your pension transfer. Who will pay? Brian Gibb, principal with consulting actuaries William M. Mercer, explains: 'The transfer value is the cash equivalent of the leaving service benefit, which has only limited inflation protection. The difference between this and the past service reserve, which takes account of full earnings' inflation, falls back into the scheme. Therefore, the transfer in must be bigger than the transfer out - and who is going to pay for the difference?' Who indeed? Life offices may well compensate for the charges they have deducted from the transfer values but, understandably, will be unwilling to pay for the vagaries of the company scheme transfer value system. Hard cases SIB has yet to comment on compensation for cases where reinstatement is not possible. *Lexis - tel: 071-374 4448 for the free fact sheet.</p>

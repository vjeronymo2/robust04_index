			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mekhman Gafarly in the "Documents" column: </F> "Tajik Opposition Is Unhappy With Russian Federation Foreign  Affairs Ministry Statement. But Is Ready To Consider a Draft  Temporary Cease-Fire Agreement"]    [Text] A recent statement made by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Foreign Affairs following aggravation in the  situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has caused discontent in  Tajik opposition circles. The statement said that the  "leadership of a number of intransigent opposition groupings  affiliated with the Tajikistan Islamic Revival Movement [TIRM]  is getting ready to launch a spring-summer `onslaught' which is  planned to begin with armed provocations on the Tajik-Afghan  border. In these circumstances the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs deems it necessary to state that the Russian leadership  regards the planned armed provocations as a threat to the  interests of security not only of Tajikistan but also Russia ...  and it... will take adequate steps to stop them."    On 11 May the TIRM came out with a response statement which  says, "We have fought for our civil rights, for the possibility  freely to live and work in our motherland, and we shall continue  to fight for this.... We have nothing against the CIS  Collective Peacekeeping Forces present in Tajikistan to protect  the republic against foreign intervention. But they, under the  treaty, must not interfere in the internal Tajik conflict."    The document also notes, "...the statement by the Russian  Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs in which Russia's foreign  policy department... threatens to take `adequate' measures  arouses bewilderment. ...Neither Afghanistan nor any other  country is going to threaten the security of Tajikistan or other  CIS countries. We, the citizens of Tajikistan, temporarily  staying outside the Republic, including in Afghanistan, want to  return to our Motherland," while "the real threat to security...  are those forces that prevent a peaceful settlement of the  conflict," the authors of the document point out.    Nonetheless the TIRM declares its readiness to consider a  draft temporary cease-fire on the Tajik-Afghan border and to  observe the terms of the agreement after it has been signed.    The statement stresses that in the course of inter-Tajik  negotiations in Moscow in April the opposition delegation  proposed a draft temporary cease-fire agreement but "the other  side did not want to discuss it, which testifies to the  destructive position of the Dushanbe regime."</p>

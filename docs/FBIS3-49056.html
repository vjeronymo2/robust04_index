			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Weronika Kostyrko: "The End of RFE?"] </F>   [Text] All the employees in Radio Free Europe's [RFE]  Polish section received layoff notices toward the end of  December. The section is to be moved from Munich to Warsaw in  the spring. "We have nothing to go back to," say the radio  employees, to whom the closure of the Munich station is a  "betrayal by the Americans" and a "shock." The U.S. Government  intends to close down RFE's Munich facility, which has existed  since 1952. The Afghan section's electricity supply has already  been cut off, and the Hungarian section was closed down on 1  November.    The Polish and Czech sections will move to their respective  countries, but will continue to be maintained by the U.S.  Congress until September 1995. Then they will be privatized.  Radio Liberty, serving the former USSR republics, plus the RFE  Slovak, Bulgarian, Romanian, Serbian, and Croatian sections,  will be moved to Washington or Prague.    "The people here lived like in a ghetto," the Polish  employees told me. "They spent most of their time inside the  station itself, and lived in communal apartment blocks. Many of  them never learned German. We have nothing to go back to in  Poland."    "We hoped that the putsch in Moscow would save us," one of  the employees added.    Half of RFE's 1,500 employees will lose their jobs as a  result of the reorganization. The Poles, almost 100 of them,  will be paid until June. But the Warsaw Bureau will only have  15 posts. RFE's Warsaw Bureau, operational since 1990, already  prepares 80 percent of the material on Poland. The Warsaw staff  are younger, and are not burdened by any emigre past. Their  work style is also different -- they report from the streets and  interview left-wing politicians, something which RFE veterans  frown upon.    "The competition for jobs in Warsaw is open to everyone, but  will someone who spent years broadcasting from behind a desk  ever go into the Sejm with a microphone?" wonders a young  reporter from RFE's Warsaw bureau.    "RFE's mission was a kind of slow suicide," Jan  Nowak-Jezioranski [distinguished author] wrote one year ago.  "Its mission was to regain the freedom of the media in Poland,  in other words bring about a situation where Western radio  ceased to be necessary." According to the latest surveys, only 2  percent of the Polish population listens to RFE.</p>

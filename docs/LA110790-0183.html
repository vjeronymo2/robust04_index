			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> A'S BAN SMOKING IN THE STANDS  </P> <P> Fans of the Oakland Athletics who feel burned by the team's World Series  performance may get really fired up about a new ban on smoking in outdoor seats  at the Oakland Coliseum.  </P> <P> The A's announced the ban Tuesday, saying it will make the ballpark a better  place to watch baseball.  </P> <P> "We have received letters from nonsmoking fans in the past, but this was a  proactive decision to keep the Coliseum environment one of the better ones in  which to watch a ball game," said Andy Dolich, vice president of business  operations for the A's.  </P> <P> One season-ticket holder called cigarette smoke a "part of the ambience of  night games."  </P> <P> But Dolich said starting next year anyone who lights up during an A's game will  receive a warning from an usher and a printed card detailing designated smoking  areas. Militant smokers will be subject to removal.  </P></p>

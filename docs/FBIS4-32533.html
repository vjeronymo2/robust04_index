			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 25 June (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic,  president of the Republic of Serbia, received Thorvald  Stoltenberg and David Owen, cochairmen of the Geneva conference,  who arrived in our country today.    The office of the president of the Republic of Serbia issued  a statement saying that the most important issues involved in  reaching a successful solution to the crisis in the territory of  the former Yugoslavia were discussed during the lengthy and  frank talks.    President Milosevic said he expected the international  community to overcome its one-sided approach in solving the  Yugoslav crisis, and that in the future it will grant equal  consideration to Serbian interests in its proposals for a peace  plan. In that respect, the Serbian president said that the  principles defined during the negotiations so far can be a good  basis for a final solution to the crisis. He noted that the  one-month cease-fire in Bosnia was undoubtedly not long enough  for holding negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina with a  positive outcome. Serbia therefore advocates the extension of  the cease-fire between the warring sides and more intense  negotiations in order to reach a final political solution to the  crisis.    In President Milosevic's view, sincere efforts to restore a  lasting and stable peace imply a solution which should contain  no unsolved, postponed, and open issues, and consequently it  should not contain grey areas or any other undefined and partial  solutions that could be potential new flashpoints. We should  use this occasion to find an overall solution that will make  possible a stable and lasting peace, the lifting of the economic  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the  normalization of life in this region, President Milosevic  stressed in today's talks with Owen and Stoltenberg, co-chairmen  of the conference on Yugoslavia. This is how the statement from  the office of the president of the Republic of Serbia ends.</p>

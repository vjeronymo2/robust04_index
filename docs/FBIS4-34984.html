			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Today,  Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul contacted the mothers, wives,  and sons of military personnel, urging them to make their  relatives in the Army understand the severity of the Haitian  situation and the real threat posed by a potential foreign  invasion.    The letter sent in the name of the Democratic Unity  Confederation (KID), presided over by the Port-au-Prince mayor,  requests that the relatives of military personnel intervene to  explain to the military that the Armed Forces does not have a  Charlemagne Peralte or a Pierre Sully at this time. Peralte was  a hero of the resistance against the 1915 U.S. invasion and  Sully was a soldier who defended his position during the U.S.  landing in July 1915.    "They cannot continue to threaten a tiger with a pin," Paul  said in reference to the "de facto" government's threats to the  United States through which it has warned against military  intervention.    The KID letter says, "The lives of most members of the  military are in danger," adding, "The personal interests of a  few people are to blame for this." KID is linked to the  National Front for Change and Democracy, the coalition that led  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. President Aristide  was ousted by a group of military officers headed by General  Raoul Cedras in September 1991.    The letter adds that there is no democracy within the Armed  Forces, and it tells the mothers, wives, and sons of military  personnel that Gen. Cedras should explain to them why he is  endangering the lives of their relatives.    "Ask him what good the coup d'etat has done for the people,  the Army, and the country over the past 33 months," Paul says in  his letter. In it, he also asks Cedras to present evidence in  connection with the alleged deaths of military personnel during  the seven months of Aristide's administration.    He also suggests that the relatives ask about the number of  military personnel who have been "murdered, disappeared, exiled,  imprisoned, or expelled from the ranks of the Army simply  because they were accused of favoring the lavalas after the 30  September 1991 coup d'etat."    Paul urges the relatives of military personnel to explain to  their kin that they are part of the Haitian people and must not  obey those who are ordering them to repress the people. He also  notes that they should ignore those who pit them against the  defenders of the people's rights.    In the letter, Paul says they should ask Cedras to respect  the commitment made when he signed the Governors Island  Agreement in New York; to resign from his post; and, in turn, to  help avert foreign military intervention. Paul sent a similar  letter to Gen. Cedras last week.</p>

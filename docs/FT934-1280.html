			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Observer: John who? The considerable cash spent every Christmas by British households on trivia knowledge games is evidently wasted. In a recent Gallup poll of more than 1,000 adults, just 11 per cent recall Pete Sampras as winner of this year's mens' singles champion at Wimbledon; 28 per cent come up with the right name - Steffi Graf - for the womens' singles. Only one in three remember the names of the two world boxing champions - Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn - whose October fight ended in a draw. Literary and artistic general knowledge is also abysmal; only 14 per cent know that William Golding wrote Lord of the Flies, while just 35 per cent correctly pinpoint Tchaikovsky as the composer of the 1812 Overture. A paltry 23 per cent accurately say that ERM stands for exchange rate mechanism. Clearly standards of education are not what they should be. Complaints should be addressed to John Patten, education minister. But then, according to the same survey, only 25 per cent of us know who he is.</p>

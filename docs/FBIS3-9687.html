The  meeting took place at the level of chairmen and deputy chairmen  of the coalition parties and movements. Representatives of the  Hungarian Coalition took part in it as well. At a short,  improvised news conference held this evening, we learned the  following about the Coalition Council meeting:    [Moravcik] "We have discussed only one theme so far, and  that  is the preparation of the government policy statement. It is  indeed a very serious matter, with the economic program in its  focus.    "As you know, the talks on a standby loan were suspended  because the previous government was unable to accept the  conditions that were set additionally. So far, economic  development has been different from what was envisaged when the  budget was drafted. It means that our starting points now are  worse than the starting points of the previous government, which  has caused a whole range of problems we have to resolve this  week. Which means that we have to concentrate on solving them  this week.    "Today, we had to make an important political decision as to  whether we should apply for a standby loan [from the IMF] and  whether we would use the time allowed us to establish certain  development trends. Our decision was positive in both cases,  which means, yes, we will apply for a standby loan, and we will  want to establish certain development trends. Naturally, this  will require some unpopular measures. We are considering what  specific measures to take since there are a number of  possibilities."    [Announcer] Asked whether the government had decided to  implement major restrictive measures in the social sector at the  cost of their endangering the preelection position of the  coalition partners, the prime minister said:    [Moravcik] "We will have to adopt all measures once we have  considered the acceptability of their impact on the social  sphere. This will require enormous effort on our part in order  to find a certain balance. We will have to do this by 12 April,  when we are to address the parliament [with the government  policy statement], or even earlier because we are to submit the  policy statement to the deputies on 6 April."    [Announcer] With regard to the state budget, Jozef Moravcik  said:    [Moravcik] "If we want to get a standby loan, we have to  respect the 4-percent limit. That is the key issue. We want to  gain a better position in international currency relations. The  standby loan does not only mean that we will get a credit of  tens of millions of dollars. It also means an assessment of our  financial credibility, which we need if we are to communicate  with the financial world."    [Announcer] The congresses of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia and of the National Democratic Party were held on  Saturday [26 March]. Asked whether the government's  deliberations today take account of the results achieved by the  supreme bodies of these two parties, Jozef Moravcik said:    [Moravcik] "We focused on what I have just told you."</p>

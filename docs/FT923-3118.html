			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles duo resurface at CSI MR DAVID Smith and Ms Elizabeth Hignell, the accounting duo who masterminded the Isosceles bid for the Gateway grocery chain in 1989 but who were ousted last September, have resurfaced in corporate life at Cannon Street Investments, the struggling industrial holding company. The two join Mr Robin Binks, Cannon Street's chief executive and former merchant banker at SG Warburg, in trying to restore the loss-making company's straitened balance sheet. In doing so they return a favour to Mr Binks who played a pivotal role in securing the finance for the Gateway acquisition while at Warburg. Both Mr Smith and Ms Hignell can perhaps afford to chance their arm at the troubled CSI. Isosceles, which announced its annual results last week, revealed that it had paid the two former directors Pounds 1.9m for loss of office.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Philosopher heads party Mr Rocco Buttiglione, the philosopher admired by Pope John Paul II, has become the new leader of Italy's Popular party (PPI), heir to the long-ruling Christian Democrats whose party was dissolved in January. He was elected in a bitterly contested run-off against Mr Nicola Mancino, the former interior minister, winning 55 per cent of the votes at the end of a special congress late on Friday. Mr Buttiglione, aged 46, has been in active politics for only a year and made his reputation with his philosophical writings about the relationship between Christianity and Marxism. His victory represents a defeat for the left wing of the party. Mr Buttiglione was one of those who argued the PPI should consider an alliance with Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia after the March general elections. But with the Berlusconi government now weakened, he is unlikely to be so keen. Mr Buttiglione's task will be to forge a new identity for the PPI, which was born from the demoralising collapse of the discredited Christian Democrats. Mr Mino Martinazoli, who engineered the transition from the old to the new party, resigned in April after the PPI had been squeezed between the left and right in the elections.</p>

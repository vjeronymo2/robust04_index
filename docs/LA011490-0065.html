			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVORING SAFARI  </P> <P> Having recently returned from a safari in Kenya, I thought you might want to  know about the marvelous accommodations, great restaurants and amenities of the  Safari Park on the outskirts of Nairobi.  </P> <P> The rates were reasonable and the extensive park-like grounds were lush, green  and extremely well kept.  </P> <P> I heartily recommend the Safari Park Hotel, P.O. Box 45038, Nairobi, Kenya, as  one of the best.  </P> <P> THEODORE H. FINNEY  </P> <P> Culver City  </P> <P> Letters to the Travel Editor should be brief and are subject to condensation.

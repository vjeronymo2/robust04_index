			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES MUST CONSOLIDATE UNDER NEW LAW  </P> <P> Orange County's transportation agencies -- including the Transit District and  the Transportation Commission -- will be replaced by a single agency next year  under provisions of a new law signed by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The measure, authored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), mandates  that six members of the new 11-member board be selected by the cities; four  members would be selected by the Board of Supervisors, and one member would be  selected by the 10 other board members.  </P> <P> The Orange County Transportation Commission, the Orange County Transit  District, the Consolidated Transportation Services Agency and the Services  Authority for Freeway Emergencies have been given until December, 1991, to  develop a plan to consolidate their functions into a single transportation  agency, according to the bill.  </P> <P> If the plan is not adopted, the cities and the county will face the loss of  state gas tax subventions in 1992-93 fiscal year.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina report specially </F> for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Three Options in Quest for Truth.  Which One Will Supreme Court Choose?"]    [Text] The investigation into the State Committee for the  State of Emergency [SCSE] case is the way to establish the  historical truth, Yuriy Baturin, an aide to the Russian  president, believes.    "If the renewed judicial investigation into the SCSE case is  brought to an end once again, it will have major moral  repercussions for society. Society will be led away from the  quest for the historical truth." This position was voiced in an  interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent by Yuriy Baturin,  the Russian president's national security aide. And he  particularly emphasized in the conversation that his opinion  should in no way be interpreted as pressuring the Supreme Court.    Baturin's fears in connection with the emergence of new  "blank spots" in the country's history are based on the fact  that in the prevailing situation -- whereby the SCSE members  have been granted an amnesty in violation of Article 5 of the  Code of Criminal Procedure, following which this decision was  repealed by the Military Collegium -- at the stage of the  scheduled new judicial investigation, three options are  possible: either the search for the truth is continued until a  conviction or acquittal is gained, after which the amnesty would  come into force; or the case is sent for additional  investigation; or the case is closed.    "If the Supreme Court takes the first option it will trigger  a new judicial investigation. This would mean restoring  legality and continuing the search for the truth. Then we could  take our hat off to the Supreme Court," Yuriy Baturin said.    The second option -- of sending the case back for additional  investigation -- would mean that the prosecutor's office would  again study 150 bulky volumes of evidence.    The third option would be to close the case at the new stage  in light of the legitimate ground of the act of amnesty. "This  may be a well-conceived way of legitimately closing the case  illegally," was how Baturin put it, since, although it was  illegal to close the case in the course of the judicial  investigation, the law does not prevent this now that a new  investigation is in preparation.</p>

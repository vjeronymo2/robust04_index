			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Waste incinerator in north-east wins approval THE GOVERNMENT has given approval for Cory Environmental to build an industrial waste incinerator at Seal Sands, Teesside. Rejections were announced by the Department of the Environment yesterday for proposals for two other incinerators, for sewage sludge and industrial waste, in north-east England. Yesterday's decision follows a six-month public inquiry two years ago that heard appeals against rejection of planning permission for all three. Northumbrian Environmental Management, the Northumbrian Water subsidiary and a partner in the rejected proposals for sites at Howdon, Tyne and Wear, and Portrack, Cleveland, said the decision left it with a serious difficulty because of the ban on sewage sludge dumping at sea after 1998. NEM said: 'Incineration is the only safe and effective way of dealing with the large quantities of sewage sludge generated in the region.' It said the region had the country's highest concentration of chemical and pharmaceutical companies and faced a 'crisis' in waste management and disposal. Integrated Environmental Management, the joint venture between NEM and US-owned International Technology Europe that proposed the rejected plants, is expected to appeal. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said the Seal Sands incinerator site, unlike the other two, had been designated for special industrial use. He said the appeals were complex, particularly because of residents' environmental concerns. Residents and the Tyne and Wear and Teesside development corporations welcomed rejection of the Howdon and Portrack proposals.</p>

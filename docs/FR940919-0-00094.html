			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Comments and the Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency received comments from five parties, Borden Chemical and Plastics (BCP), Bethlehem Apparatus (BA), PPG Industries (PPG), Olin Chemicals (Olin), and the Chlorine Institute (CI). Their collective comments and the Agency's response follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal limited the conditional exemption to certain mercury-bearing hazardous wastes generated by the Chlorine Institute. BCP, BA, and CI argued that the proposed change was too narrow, and that other mercury recovery units may also process combustible materials for legitimate metals recovery. Commenters thus recommended that the exemption should apply to all processors of mercury wastes. The Agency generally agrees with this position. Upon reevaluation, EPA believes there is no need to differentiate between units in the Chlorine Industry and similar units outside the Chlorine Industry. Therefore, the Agency is promulgating a rule which includes units operated by manufacturers and users of mercury or mercury products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCP addressed a second option for broadening the exemption so that devices other than those operated in the Chlorine Industry could process combustible wastes for legitimate metals recovery. BCP suggested EPA define mercury as a precious metal and allow processors to burn mercury laden hazardous wastes subject to the Agency's BIF precious metals exemption (see &sect;266.100(f)). EPA does not agree with BCP's contention that mercury is a precious metal. Mercury is not considered a precious metal by EPA or other Agencies or organizations. Precious metals are defined by the Bureau of Mines to include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium (Mineral Commodity Summary, 1993), and by EPA at 40 CFR 266.70 to include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium, all metals whose value assures adequate control. Therefore, EPA rejects the approach suggested by BCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCP, PPG, Olin, and CI also commented that the list of materials in the proposed technical clarification should be broadened to include the following additional items: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Sweepings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respiratory Cartridge Filters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cleanup Articles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plastic Bags and Other Contaminated Containers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory and Process Control Samples <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge and Filter Cake <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mercury cell process sump and tank sludges <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mercury cell process solids <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K106 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recoverable levels of mercury contained in soil <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Upon evaluation, the Agency agrees that of these materials are appropriate for an exemption as long as they have recoverable levels of mercury. However, many mercury units, e.g., retorters, are not combustion devices and organic emissions may not be controlled in these units. Therefore, the Agency is concerned that materials with recoverable levels of mercury, but laden with hazardous organics, may not provide adequate destruction of the hazardous organics in exempt retorters, and thus, may not be protective of human health and the environment. For that reason, the Agency is promulgating a broadened list of materials but is limiting the exemption to these wastes specifically identified and that contain less than 500 ppm of part 261, appendix VIII organics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, there appears to be some confusion by the Chlorine Industry about their status under the BIF rules (collectively, those regulations set forth in 40 CFR Part 266, Subpart H). CI, PPG, and Olin argued that they are not subject to BIF because they do not ``burn'' or ``combust'' anything and the BIF rules are written for combustion devices. The Agency agrees that many mercury recovery devices do not ``burn'' or ``combust'' by design; however, these units are Industrial Furnaces as defined in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 260.10 and, thus, are subject to the appropriate BIF rules. In particular, &sect;260.10 defines Industrial Furnaces as ``devices *&blank;*&blank;* that use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> thermal treatment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to accomplish recovery of materials'' and that these include ``refining furnaces''. [Emphasis added.] Mercury recovery units raise the temperature of the waste to aid in the recovery and refining of mercury. Therefore, they are refining furnaces. In addition, &sect;266.100(c) states that ``smelting, melting and refining furnaces *&blank;*&blank;* that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> process  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> hazardous waste solely for metals recovery are conditionally exempt *&blank;*&blank;*.'' [Emphasis added.] This language includes all refining furnaces that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> process  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste, irrespective of whether the process to achieve this end is combustion or not. Therefore, mercury recovery devices are BIFs, and come within the terms of &sect;266.100(c). EPA is using the term ``mercury recovery furnace'' in today's amended rule to further clarify this point. (It should be noted that compliance with the BIF rules for these devices are not rigorous. It requires sending a one time written notification to the regional Director and following the provisions set forth in &sect;266.100(c).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mercury recovery operators should note that the changes discussed in this section of the preamble only apply to units which have a metals recovery exemption. Units which process these wastes without the proper exemption are in violation of the BIF rules and subject to enforcement action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Amendment of Rules on Use Constituting Disposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1985, EPA created a separate regulatory regime for hazardous wastes that are recycled by being used in a manner constituting disposal. Part 266 subpart C. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  These rules provide, in essence, that the wastes can be so used without being subject to the RCRA facility standards if the waste-derived product (i.e. the hazardous wastes that is being used by being applied to the land (i.e. used in a manner constituting disposal)) has been ``produced for the general public's use,'' has undergone a chemical change so as to be inseparable by physical means, and if it meets the applicable LDR treatment standard. See &sect;266.20(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These rules apply, of course, only if the recycling is legitimate, and not a form of surrogate disposal. &sect;266.20(a) applies only to ``recyclable materials'', which are hazardous wastes being recycled. &sect;261.6(a)(1). This does not include wastes that are abandoned by being disposed of. &sect;261.2(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

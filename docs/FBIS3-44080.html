After 7 hours of talks in Pretoria that went into the early  hours of this morning, the three sides failed to reach consensus  on an inclusive constitutional deal, but they agreed to meet  again later on today. Both government negotiator Roelf Meyer  and ANC negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa said after the talks that  they did not see much of a chance for agreement dealing with the  Freedom Alliance's point of view. Conservative Party negotiator  Dr. Corne Mulder indicated afterwards that the only deal which  would be acceptable to the Freedom Alliance was a package which  dealt with the alliance's demands.</p>

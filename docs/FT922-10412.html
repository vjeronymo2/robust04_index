			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / The argument against dumping John Ward, appointed to Cranfield School of Management's newly created chair in strategic information systems, sees his principal task as finding ways for business people to appreciate the problems and potential of computers - without their having to get involved in the technology. He is particularly concerned by the current trend towards 'outsourcing', where managements hand over their information requirements to a contractor from outside the company. Some organisations, he agrees, have clear objectives in farming out their data processing; others, perhaps the majority, are simply dumping a function which they find hard to understand or manage. 'If a company finds it difficult to control information technology in house,' he says, 'it will find it even more difficult to manage it out of house.' And if the computer systems are of strategic importance to the company - which most are, these days - reversing the situation will prove expensive, he predicts. Ward, now 45, spent 15 years in industry as an information systems manager, most recently with International Business Machines and Kodak. He joined Cranfield in 1984, fascinated by the links between business and information systems strategy. Christopher Edwards, who holds the chair in management information systems at Cranfield, and Ward are planning a research centre; Asda, Procter &amp; Gamble and BP Chemicals, for example, are involved in a research project on the efficiency of inter-company electronic messaging.</p>

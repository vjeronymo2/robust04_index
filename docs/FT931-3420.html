			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: French dairy products group static at FFr354m BONGRAIN, the fast-expanding French cheese and dairy products group, made static profits of FFr354m (Dollars 62.51m) last year. The group, which has grown rapidly in recent years through a series of acquisitions culminating in last summer's deal whereby it took managerial control of ULN, the ailing French dairy co-operative, also saw sales stabilise at FFr9.7bn in 1992. Mr Jean-Hughes Vadot, finance director, said Bongrain had been affected by a slowdown in consumer spending across all its markets, with the exception of Germany. He said there had been a sharp slowdown in France, still the group's biggest market with 47 per cent of sales, particularly in the second half of the year. Despite the competitive climate, Bongrain would have registered an increase in net profits for its ongoing businesses of 7.2 per cent had exchange rates remained stable. However, the franc's strength since the autumn currency crisis reduced the contribution from exports and overall net profits grew below the rate of inflation by 1.1 per cent from FFr350m in 1991 to 1992's FFr354m.</p>

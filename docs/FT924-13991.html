			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Hopes for Bundesbank rate cut begin to evaporate EUROPEAN government bond markets lost ground yesterday as investors' faith in a German interest rate cut at this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting weakened. The prospect of European leaders gathering for the Birmingham summit at the end of the week also left the bond markets uneasy. The general opinion was that the EC's political leaders could well do more harm than good in the short term to the cause of closer European integration. Ten-year German government bonds fell back about a third of a point as the market decided that recent optimism about Bundesbank easing may have been overdone. The possibility of a substantial supply of new bonds in the coming months is also dampening the enthusiasm of the market, with some DM40bn of this year's deficit still to be funded. In addition, a court ruling on income tax allowances, expected imminently, could add further to supply if, as expected, it forces Bonn to raise allowances for the lower-paid, thus cutting tax revenue. On Liffe, the bund futures contract fell from 91.10 to 90.76 by the close on the general fall-off. The Euro-Mark futures contract on Liffe, meanwhile, reflected the lowering of expectation of a rate cut, with the December contract discounting a rate of 8 1/3 per cent by the end of the day, compared with 8 1/4 per cent at the opening. That is still well below current market levels, though, suggesting that there could be a sharp market correction, said Mr George Magnus, an economist at SG Warburg in London. LONGER-dated UK government bonds also lost some ground yesterday, although short-dated paper rose as expectations grew of a  1/2 -point cut in interest rates later this week. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, failed to provide any new stimulus for the gilt market as he appeared to answer questions before MPs, and no further indication of the direction of UK economic policy is now expected until the chancellor's annual Mansion House speech at the end of the month. Data due out during the rest of this week are all expected to point to the possibility of lower interest rates: producer prices today, industrial production on Wednesday and employment on Thursday. The figures are all expected to show a deepening of the UK recession, and with the foreign exchange market already pricing in a rate cut, the government is widely expected to take the opportunity to pull the base rate down from its current 9 per cent level - where it continues to sit above German money market levels. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe slid from 96 21/32 at the opening to 96 5/32 late in the day, while the benchmark 9 per cent gilts due 2008 lost  1/16 point to close at 98 1/16 . OTHER European markets generally fell in line with Germany, marking time before the Birmingham summit. Some markets, such as France, Denmark and even Italy, are said to be attracting greater interest as investors come to focus on their relative cheapness against bunds (their yield spreads against 10-year German government bonds now stand at 110, 186 and 711 basis points respectively). However, with the European markets still anticipating a further realignment in the exchange rate mechanism, few are willing yet to buy these markets on the argument that they look cheap, said Mr Stephen Lewis, economist at the London Bond Broking Company. WITH Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, travelling to Japan this week, some market commentators have sniffed the possibility of co-ordinated action to bring down interest rates on both sides of the Pacific. Mr Greenspan's comments that the Fed could act before the presidential election next month has also raised hopes in some quarters. With the Fed having failed to take the opportunity to cut last week, however, there remains little indication that it will act now. And for its part, the Bank of Japan remains neutral on the question of any ODR cut, despite little sign that the economic package to stimulate the economy is having any effect. With the Tokyo stock market having stabilised at around the 17,000 level, there is also little immediate pressure on the authorities. The US markets were closed yesterday for the Columbus day holiday, while in Japan the benchmark bond No 145 eased slightly to close at yield of 4.87 per cent. Two Japanese second-tier brokerages are closing some overseas offices as a part of rationalisation plans in the face of a sluggish stock market at home, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Sanyo Securities closed its Los Angeles branch on October 9 and will close its Bahrain office on October 30. Okasan Securities is closing its Frankfurt office on Monday.</p>

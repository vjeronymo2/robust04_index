			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Muscat, April 19 (AFP) -- Delegates on Tuesday [19  April] ended their most successful round of multilateral Middle  East negotiations on water, agreeing on five projects to boost  scarce supplies and establish Israeli-Arab cooperation.    The participants from more than 40 countries and  organisations also approved offers by several industrial states  to provide technical assistance and training to the region to  enable it to ease a chronic water shortage.    Oman's proposal for setting up a water desalination research  centre won unanimous approval and a committee would be formed to  carry out the project.    "As a first step to enhancing water supplies, the working  group approved an Omani proposal for a desalination research and  technology centre in Muscat," a statement said.    Delegates described the water committee's fifth round as the  most successful since the negotiations began two years ago in  Vienna as part of the multilateral phase of Middle East talks  launched in Madrid in 1991.    But the final session hit a snag when Jordan, attending as  an  observer, threatened to oppose the meeting's decisions if the  United States did not raise the issue of its boycott at the  talks.    Jordan is boycotting meetings with Israel to press Western  forces to ease their naval interceptions off the port of Aqaba  under the UN embargo of Iraq.    Delegates said the final session was held up for more than  six hours as Palestinians and other Arab delegates mediated to  end the standoff by holding contacts with the US representative  and Jordan's observer Ali al-Ghazzawi.    "Al-Ghazzawi insisted he would deliver a speech demanding  that the US delegates mention the reason for Jordan's absence  from the talks," a conference source said.    "He threatened to express reservations on the results at the  meeting and to refer them to the Jordanian government. This  could mean that the decisions of the meeting were not reached by  consensus."    The sources said the problem was resolved following  intensive  contacts between Washington and Amman.    The statement said the other four projects covered a US  proposal for waste water treatment and re-use facilities in the  region, an Israeli proposal to rehabilitate municipal water  supply systems, a German study on supply and demand, and a joint  US-European Union training programme.    It said the participants supported the idea of enhancing  data  availability in the region and welcomed the announcement of the  creation of a Palestinian Water Authority (PWA).    "The Israeli delegation welcomed the announcement of the PWA  and expressed an interest in working with the Omani research  centre on solar energy for desalination," the statement said.    It said the participants approved an Israeli proposal to  rehabilitate and make more efficient municipal water supply  systems in small-sized committees. Experts from concerned  parties will be convened to plan the next steps, it added.    Delegates at the three-day talks, opened by Omani Minister  of  State for Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin-Alawi bin-'Abdallah, [title  as received] said most of the funds for the projects would be  provided by Japan and other key industrial nations once the  agreements were signed.    "We are very happy with this meeting," an Israeli delegate  said. "Results like these will encourage all of us to press on  with moves to establish confidence and cooperation in the  region."</p>

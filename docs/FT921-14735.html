			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Enthusiastic response to WA Newspaper flotation AUSTRALIAN investors gave a rousing welcome to the flotation of WA Newspaper Holdings (WAN) last week, raising hopes of similar success for two other media flotations due later this year. WAN, which owns the West Australian daily newspaper published in Perth, closed at ADollars 1.70 after its first day's trading on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), a premium of 70 cents over the issue price. The first-day closing price was at the top end of expectations for the flotation, which raised ADollars 185m (USDollars 136m) from more than 16,000 shareholders. The ASX said more than 15m WAN shares were traded that day. Brokers said the flotation augured well for News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group, which is expected to raise about ADollars 380m shortly from the part-flotation of its Pacific Magazines offshoot. Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian proprietor of the UK Daily Telegraph group, is also expected to float about 80 per cent of the Fairfax newspaper chain following the acquisition of the company late last year. The WAN flotation will provide stable ownership for the West Australian, the last independently-owned metropolitan daily newspaper in Australia. The newspaper was owned by the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT) group from 1969 to 1987, when HWT was acquired by News Corporation, and the West Australian was spun off to the late Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Group. A year later, Mr Holmes a Court sold 19.9 per cent of Bell Group to Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings, and a similar stake to the West Australian State Government Insurance Commission in a deal which was investigated by the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), the then corporate regulator. Bond Corporation was forced to acquire 74.5 per cent of Bell and the company collapsed following Bond Corporation's inability to service its debts. The biggest shareholder in WAN is the Australian Foundation Investment Company, a listed investment group, controlling about 6.5 per cent of the shares. Several other financial institutions are also large shareholders.</p>

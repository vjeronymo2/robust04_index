			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Flooding in south 'may cost Pounds 100m' The damage resulting from flooding across southern England could cost up to Pounds 100m, a firm of loss assessors said yesterday as the south and other areas prepared for rain this week. Mr Justin Balcombe, of loss assessors Balcombe Group, said the total cost of the flood damage greatly exceeded the costs that would be covered by insurance. The Association of British Insurers has estimated claims at between Pounds 20m and Pounds 60m. Mr Balcombe warned that many companies suffering flood damage would discover they had breached the terms of their insurance policies, which often stipulate that goods should be stored on pallets raised above the floor. Large tracts of farmland, where crops have been ruined by floods, are not covered by insurance. Another large bill for flood damage will be borne by the owners of caravans on caravan parks, the contents of which are often uninsured. The London Weather Centre said there would be rain on most days this week. Some 129 flood warnings from the National Rivers Authority were in force last night. By far the most critical area was Chichester, West Sussex, where mopping up was continuing after the river Lavant broke its banks. Emergency services were last night apprehensive and the city was being kept open by sandbags along the A259 link road from the already blocked A27 coast road. Another red warning - the highest level of alert - was issued for the River Hiz in the Bedford area. A warning of flooding on the river Ouse, at Newport Pagnell, Bucks, was expected to be lifted.</p>

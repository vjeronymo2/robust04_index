			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Revenue to use private agency staff PRIVATE employment agency staff will next month take over some of the most confidential and politically sensitive work in the Civil Service as the contracting out of central government services gets under way. Personal secretaries, typists and other support staff at the Inland Revenue's new head office building in Nottingham will be supplied under contract by Blue Arrow Personnel Services. Manpower Employment Services will provide word processing, secretarial and support services at the Department of Health's Leeds headquarters. The work contracted out in both cases involves handling confidential correspondence and sensitive policy papers. The Leeds office is the headquarters of the National Health Service management executive, dogged in recent years by leaks about troubles in the government's health reforms. In the Inland Revenue's Nottingham office the agency will supply personal secretaries for senior civil servants involved in policy and management in the capital taxes office and the superannuation funds office. With complete access to their bosses' files, they will be required to sign the Official Secrets Act and observe the same standards of confidentiality as civil servants. The contracting-out of jobs at the centre of the government machine is part of a drive to put much of the Civil Service work out to competitive tender. A white paper published last November suggested that 'market testing' could save as much as 25 per cent of the Pounds 20bn central-government costs annually. The Blue Arrow bid is believed to have undercut that of the Inland Revenue's own typists by as much as 25 per cent. The agency has guaranteed to provide secretarial services between 9am and 6pm and to meet high accuracy and turnaround targets. In the health department, contracting out the secretarial work is expected to save 10 per cent of staff costs. Manpower has offered a flexible approach to staffing levels, removing staff from the site if the workload falls. All government departments are drawing up, with the help of management consultants, lists of activities to put out to tender. The Civil Service unions have protested at the lack of support for the civil servants bidding to retain work.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Inco slips to Dollars 28.9m loss on poor nickel price SLIDING nickel prices pushed Inco, the West's biggest producer of the metal, to a sizeable fourth-quarter loss, despite a vigorous effort to contain costs. The Toronto-based company's loss reached USDollars 28.9m, or 28 cents a share, up from a deficit of Dollars 5.8m, or 7 cents, a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenues slid to Dollars 627m from Dollars 710m. The latest figures include after-tax expenses of Dollars 9.7m for production shutdowns and Dollars 8.1m for severance pay. The biggest drag on earnings, however, was a drop in average nickel prices to Dollars 3.01/lb in the final three months of the year, from Dollars 3.55 a year earlier and Dollars 3.47 in the third quarter. Copper prices were also lower. The company ascribed the fall in nickel prices to the surge in exports from Russia and 'reduced demand' in some consuming countries. The fourth-quarter performance was the worst of the year and resulted in a loss for 1992 as a whole of Dollars 17.6m, or 21 cents a share, compared to earnings of Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents, in 1991. Revenues for the year dipped to Dollars 2.61bn from Dollars 3.05bn. Weak nickel prices have forced the company not only to cut back output, but also to tighten cost controls. Nickel deliveries fell to 473m lb last year, from 507m lb in 1992. Fourth-quarter shipments were down to 122m lb from 125m lb. Gold shipments fell especially sharply, from 23,000 ounces to 9,000 ounces. Inco said that its nickel unit production costs fell by 14 per cent in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. Capital spending will be trimmed to about Dollars 225m this year, from Dollars 234m last year and Dollars 440m in 1991. The company said it plans to further reduce costs 'to a level which, initially, should permit this business to break even in today's difficult conditions and, over time, provide for a return to profitability'.</p>

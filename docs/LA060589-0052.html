			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> AIDS STUDY USES POLIO VIRUS  </P> <P> Researchers last week reported the development of a possible AIDS vaccine that  hooks up a key part of the deadly AIDS virus with a safe polio virus widely  used in immunization programs. The potential vaccine was able to disarm a wide  range of AIDS viral strains in studies of laboratory rabbits, but it has not  yet been tested in humans, the scientists said.  </P> <P> Reporting in the journal Nature, British researchers said they used genetic  engineering techniques to tailor a model vaccine consisting of the Sabin polio  virus and a protein from the outer membrane of the human immunodeficiency  virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.  </P> <P> A team headed by Jeffrey Almond of England's Reading University said its  custom-made molecule not only neutralized a wide variety of HIV strains in  rabbits, but also reduced the virus's ability to fuse cells into giant  non-functional masses.  </P> <P> The researchers speculated that their model employing polio virus may offer  "considerable advantages" over other AIDS vaccine models because it might  trigger production of antibodies in mucous fluids.  </P></p>

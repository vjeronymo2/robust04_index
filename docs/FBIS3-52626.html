Then, most groups criticized the Lebanese Government but as  time passed, the opposition decreased and ultimately the issue  was relegated to oblivion.    This is because every government that comes to power in  Lebanon is subservient to the policies of Damascus and should  have some coordination with Syria. If al-Hariri's government  fires a hail of bullets on the opponents of the Rabin-'Arafat  accord or resists them in parliament, it is solely because of  its affiliation with Damascus.    This government faces danger, as it has passed its expiry  date and should make way for another government. The straits  the government is in also relate to Syria. If, in the early  days of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord by  'Arafat and Rabin, Damascus reined in the various groups and  promised the United States that it would prevent them from  subversive activity, it was because the White House had pledged  Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Syria's promise was  endorsed by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and other  Syrian officials. Syria also asked Lebanon to rein in  opponents' activities and this was why the demonstrations were  dragged into blood and dust.    Time has shown that the United States does not intend to  honor its pledge to Syria, so Syria has revised its policy.  Syria has hardened its stance on the Rabin-'Arafat accord,  which was proven during the recent meetings between Warren  Christopher and Syrian officials, which necessitated a review of  the stance on the opponents of the Gaza-Jericho Accord by the  al-Hariri government.    It now appears--in view of change and the crisis that has  engulfed Lebanon--that the al-Hariri regime has reached the end  of its tenure and should make way for a new government. There  is talk of a former minister coming to power who leans more  toward Syria and coordinates better with it. In such  circumstances, the opposing groups, particularly the Islamic  Resistance in south Lebanon, will extend their activity and  escalate their attacks on Israel and Antoine Lahd's forces.  This will continue until Damascus officially joins the peace  trend and the problem of the Golan Heights is solved. Until  then, Lebanon will follow the policies of Damascus and oppose  the peace trend.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: TARNISHED VIEW OF CALIFORNIA IN FORBES  </P> <P> They're variations of the chicken-egg question we're likely to hear much more  frequently as the country sinks into recession: which comes first, employers or  jobs; prosperity or "livability?"  </P> <P> In its Oct. 29 cover story, Forbes magazine asks "Is the Golden State Losing  It?" The article argues that, indeed, California is casually kissing off its  $150-billion-a-year manufacturing industry. Preoccupied with more and more  foolish regulatory measures, the state's citizens and lawmakers remain  oblivious to the increasing numbers of manufacturers who are packing up and  heading north or east or to the Southern states, the article's authors assert.  </P> <P> "Basking in the glow from decades of easy growth, Californians lost sight of  the fact that in a free enterprise system, companies are not only free to come  but also free to go," the article says. "They are going because the drawbacks  of doing business in California are fast overwhelming the advantages of doing  business there. The cost curve has finally overtaken the advantage curve."  </P> <P> Those costs include housing that is beyond the reach of 82% of U.S. households  or, alternatively, long commutes that translate into increased absenteeism;  workers compensation rates that are as much as 50% higher than in other states;  higher construction expenses; and schools that rank 49th among states for the  ratio of students to teachers.  </P> <P> But the real villain, in these authors' view, is California's "bewildering  array of environmental regulations and anti-growth propositions."  </P> <P> The economic impact of increased environmentalism demands close analysis. It  doesn't get it in this old-fashioned business booster tract, which occasionally  lapses into the sort of quaint diatribe that had been unfashionable since the  days of Spiro Agnew.  </P> <P> The article points out, for instance, that 3 million poor Latinos and Asians  are likely to arrive in California in the next decade. "They are not likely to  find work selling annuities in Santa Monica or real estate in Marin County. But  none of this much bothers the state's small but visible and vociferous legion  of limousine liberals, Hollywood headline grabbers and tree huggers, people who  have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant and have little real  sympathy for the blue-collar types who are hurt by their activities."  </P> <P> The article has nothing but sympathy for the beleaguered manufacturers, who in  spite of what is portrayed as infinite concern for workers, move their  companies out of state anyway.  </P> <P> For all its legitimate hand-wringing over the loss of industry, Forbes offers  no solutions to the underlying problems. In one paragraph the article chastises  the South Coast Air Quality Management District for fining a business that  failed to come up with a car pool plan. Two paragraphs later, it criticizes  authorities for constraining industrial emissions rather than attacking the  two-thirds of Southern California's pollution caused by car and truck  emissions.  </P> <P> What the article never mentions is that very few Southern Californians say  they're leaving the state because they can't find work. Plenty say they would  like to leave because they're sick of the pollution.  </P> <P> It may or may not be coincidental that the following article in the magazine is  titled "Tom Hayden, Meet Adam Smith and Thomas Aquinas." The premise of this  piece is that environmentalism is a religion and so businessmen should not  count on dealing with environmentalists in rational terms.  </P> <P> The article is written by the author of a book called "Modern Economic  Theology." But the author does not here acknowledge that bottom-line economics  might also be considered a religion, or that the difference between his  approach to the world and that of some environmentalists pivots on whether one  chooses to worship trees, or the green icons made from their pulp: money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REQUIRED READING  </P> <P> In Saudi Arabia, journalists complain that the military's public relations  machinery is making coverage of Operation Desert Shield about as credible as a  fanzine's coverage of the New Kids on the Block. In October's The Washington  Monthly, editor Scott Shuger reports on the F-117 Stealth fighter's performance  in Panama. The Air Force has one public affairs specialist for every four  planes it owns and, Shuger explains, these specialists specialty is the  old-fashioned runaround.  </P> <P> Initial reports from the military PR machine declared the Stealth's mission in  Panama a complete success and trumpeted the plane's "pinpoint accuracy." In  truth, Shuger reports, the planes were no more accurate than the military's  statements to the press, missing one target completely and inadvertently  blowing up a saloon.  </P> <P> The mission succeeded anyway, but that's not the point, Shuger writes.  </P> <P> "The issue is not whether the mistakes (in Panama) kept that mission from  achieving its objective. It's whether they easily could have kept it from  achieving it -- if the Panamanians had been a little better trained, better  organized, or better equipped; if they had been, say . . . the Iraqis. There  are two ways of learning that the risk of military failure is too great. POWS,  widows, and orphans know all about one of them. The press is the other."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW ON NEWSSTANDS  </P> <P> Western capitalists have not been meek about charging into the Soviet magazine  market. Paris Match has just launched a new, all Russian-language general  interest magazine, which is being test marketed in New York City after the  250,000 press run sold out in the Soviet Union. Meanwhile the November Ladies'  Home Journal features a Russian-language section, complete with illustrated  exercise routines and Soviet models posing provocatively in perfume ads.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHREDDER FODDER  </P> <P> Last year, P.J. O'Rourke's acerbic "Joe McCarthy Memorial New Enemies List,"  with its red-baiting of everything and everyone liberal, was so tastelessly  funny in parts it might have caused even Tom Hayden to involuntarily spout  UFW-picked organic blush wine through his nose.  </P> <P> For this year's version, in the November American Spectator, O'Rourke merely  prints a rambling list of conservative complaints submitted by readers that  even crackpot survivalist newsletters would reject -- not because of political  content, but because they are banal, ham-handed and stupid.  </P></p>

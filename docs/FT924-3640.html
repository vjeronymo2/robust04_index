			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Somali warlords welcome US initiative: Washington urged by warring factions to make long-term commitment SOMALIA's two biggest warlords said at the weekend that they welcomed the presence of US Marines, poised offshore to land in their country. But they added that Washington must make a long-term economic and political commitment to the war-ravaged nation rather than a purely short-term humanitarian intervention. In his heavily fortified compound in the shell-blasted Somali capital of Mogadishu, General Mohamed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's most feared faction leader, also complained bitterly about not being consulted by the US over the military intervention which is set to begin within the next 48 hours. 'If we are not consulted by the US it will look more like an invasion force and that could cause problems for them,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Minutes later, he contradicted himself, saying that US troops would come to no harm in Somalia and that he would personally guarantee their safety. Later in the day, six miles away across the green line which divides the rubble-strewn capital in half, Gen Aideed's foe, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, was also guaranteeing the safety of US soldiers to the background sound of intermittent shots. The self-styled interim president said that, unlike Gen Aideed, he did not think he needed to be consulted by the US about the landing of foreign troops on Somali territory - a bizarre admission for a man who still claims, despite all the chaos and fragmentation of the country, to be the legitimate head of a sovereign government. The war between Gen Aideed and the former hotelier, caused largely by the general's thirst for absolute power and clan rivalry and greed over scarce resources, has plunged Somalia in the past year into anarchy and starvation. Both men adamantly denied they had any personal responsibility for the disintegration of their country, the death of at least 300,000 people from war-induced starvation this year or the Mafia-style protection racket which has terrorised and extorted aid agencies and prevented food from reaching those in need. The two men appear to agree on little else except that the US must take a much more long-term view of intervention in Somalia. The White House has said the 28,000-33,000 US forces will carry out a humanitarian operation to get food to an estimated 1.5m people at risk of death from starvation and will leave Somalia as soon as that is completed, possibly by January 20, the date of the Bush-Clinton handover. Both warlords think that US troops should stay in Somalia for at least six months and possibly beyond to achieve four objectives: establish security for the relief effort, disarm the bandits and looters, help start the process of reconstruction, rehabilitation, job creation and economic development and broker a political reconciliation conference between the clan-based factions which will establish an interim government to pave the way for elections. 'Somalis have very high expectations from the US,' said Gen Aideed. 'We expect the Americans not just to do humanitarian assistance.' Mr Mahdi, dressed in a white safari suit and sitting behind a huge mahogany desk with a world globe to his left, said: 'The US must disarm the faction leaders and their few supporters. . . and if the US only distribute food and leave people with guns then there is no hope for Somalia in the long term.' Mr Mahdi added: 'The great danger is that with the US soldiers the Somali people are facing a great opportunity. The world has offered a last chance for peace and order and life in this country. If the Somali people don't benefit from this it will be very sad and a great disaster for us.'</p>

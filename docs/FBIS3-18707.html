The President of the Board of Trade, who failed in his  challenge for the leadership in 1990 after toppling Lady  Thatcher, sought to dampen recent speculation about his own  rekindled ambitions in a lengthy BBC radio interview. It  coincided with an attempt by Mr Michael Howard, the Home  Secretary and a leading Cabinet Rightwinger, to bolster Mr  Major's position and implicitly challenge Mr Heseltine's  credentials as a potential Prime Minister on grounds of age.    "I want John Major to be Prime Minister for a very long  time," Mr Howard said. "I believe he will be Prime Minister for  a long time, and when the time comes for him to hand over to  someone else, I do not think it will be to an older man."    As Mr Major is 50, this would rule out Mr Heseltme, 60, Mr  Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, who is 53, and Mr Howard himself.    Asked on BBC television's "Breakfast With Frost" whether he  would like to be Prime Minister, Mr Howard, 52, replied: "I have  given my answer. When John Major gives up, he won't be handing  over to an older man."    Mr Heseltine was asked on BBC Radio's "The World this  Weekend" whether he was ruling out contesting the leadership.  He sald: "I am telling you quite categorically that I believe  John Major will remain in place. I am not prepared to be  involved in any speculation about my own position because I  intend to go on helping him win the political battles that the  Conservatives have to fight. I believe he will do that and lead  us to victory at the next election.    ``I do not think there is any question of there being a  vacancy and I don't think there is any profit in analysing what  would happen if there was. My position is clear. John Major  has entrusted me with one of the jobs I most wanted. I will do  it to the best of my ability, because I believe Britain has a  very exciting opportunity.''    He added: "I have made it quite clear that my role in  history  is creating rather a good garden. That is where I have spent  the morning."    However, Mr Heseltine was careful to avoid any definitive  statement on his own position should a vacancy arise. He has  made a good recovery from the heart attack that seemed to have  put paid to his career last summer, and there are many in the  party who would turn to him if the Tories needed a new leader.    Although he is privately irritated about the renewed gossip  at Westminster about his ambitions, Mr Heseltine's supporters  believe he would be ill-advised to rule himself out at the start  of a year which is certain to see renewed pressure on Mr Major  if the Tories perform disastrously in the local authority and  European Parliament elections.    The re-emergence of Mr Heseltine as a serious contender for  the leadership following his performance at the Scott inquiry  last week has sufficiently alarmed his detractors to prompt  reports of a "Stop Michael" campaign gathering ground at  Westminster.    Some MPs are suggesting he should be appointed party  chairman  after the European elections in June, in which the Conservatives  could lose up to a dozen seats. They argue this would exploit  Mr Heseltine's political talents to the full while "lashing him  to the mast" of Mr Major's leadership .    There have also been signs that Mr Heseltine has been trying  to make himself more acceptable to the party Right, especially  over Europe.    In a speech last week he was critical of the "Eurosclerosis"  in Brussels over the implementation of the European single  market.    "My preoccupation is to help, in every way I can, the Prime  Minister's determination that, in being at the heart of Europe,  we shall influence the thinking of Europe in a way that will  make Europe more competitive and richer and therefore make  Britain better off," he said yesterday.    The Tory approach to Europe in this June's elections will  try  to chart a course through the divisions in the party.    However, Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister, said  it  would be a "serious mistake" if the views of the "Euro-sceptics"  held sway.    The sceptics would not be satisfied with anything less than  the break-up of the whole thing, he said on ITV's Walden  programme.</p>

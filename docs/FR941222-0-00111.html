			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.51_General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.51(d) was amended to add general recordkeeping requirements for regulated sources of VOCs subject to the emission limitations and control requirements in Chapter 129. Section 129.51 requires the owner or operator of a facility or source to keep records to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limitation or control requirement. Those records are to provide sufficient data and calculations which clearly demonstrate that the emission limitations or control requirements are met. The data or information required to determine compliance with the applicable limitation are to be recorded and maintained in a timeframe consistent with the averaging period of the standard. The records are to be retained at least two years and made available to PADER on request. A facility or source which claims exemption from the emission limitations and control requirements is to maintain records adequate to demonstrate that the facilities and sources are entitled to the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.52_Surface Coating Processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.52(a) was changed to expand the applicability of the surface coating requirements to statewide for facilities with emissions greater than 2.7 tons/yr., 15 lbs/day, or 3 lbs/hr. before controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.62_General Standards for Bulk Gasoline Terminals, Bulk Plants and Small Gasoline Storage Tanks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection (c) specifies that a person may not allow a gasoline tank truck subject to &sect;129.59_Bulk Gasoline Terminals, &sect;129.60_Bulk Gasoline Plants or &sect;129.61_Small Gasoline Storage Tank Control to be filled or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank truck meets the requirement below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The word ``annual'' was deleted from subsection (c)(1) to add ``12 months.'' The gasoline tank truck leak check requirement was revised to clarify the annual gasoline tank truck leak check requirement to add that the owner or operator subject to the requirements of &sect;129.62(c) may not allow a tank to be filled or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank truck has been tested by the owner or operator within the immediately preceding 12 months in accordance to the applicable test method and procedure in &sect;139.14_Emissions of VOCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation adds a one year compliance interval for existing sources newly subject to the requirements of &sect;129.52, &sect;&sect;129.59&hyph;129.61, &sect;&sect;129.67&hyph;129.69 as a result of the revised applicability requirements, and to the newly affected pneumatic rubber manufacturing facilities and surface coating processes subject to the emission standards. Newly subject sources or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are those existing sources which were not previously subject to the emission limitations because they emitted less than the cutoff levels or operated at de minimis production levels prior to the date of publication of the limitation in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, but are now subject to the standard because they meet or exceed the cutoff levels; compliance shall be achieved by May 23, 1993. Section 129.68_Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products was deleted from this section because the compliance schedule (August 3, 1992) for this source category was the subject of a separate rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.67_Graphic Arts Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.67(e) establishes a requirement that the emissions of VOCs used in clean-up operations shall be summed with emissions from surface coating and printing to determine the applicability of the graphic arts regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 129.69_Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The VOC control requirements in Section 129.69(a) are revised to delete the 5,000 tire/day exemption level, add the definitions of pneumatic rubber tire manufacture and passenger type tire, specify minimum control requirements for tire manufacturing, and allow an affected tire manufacturer to petition for approval of an alternative RACT control program. Such an alternative must be approved by PADER and EPA as a SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing is defined as the production of pneumatic rubber passenger-type on a mass production basis, and passenger-type tires are agricultural, airplane, industrial, mobile home, light or medium duty truck or passenger vehicle tires with bead diameters up to 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) and cross-sectional dimensions up to 12.8 inches (32.5 centimeters).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this section adds that the production of specialty tires for antique or other vehicles, when produced on an irregular basis or with short production runs and when produced on equipment separate from normal production lines for passenger-type tires, are exempt from the requirements of this section upon written approval from PADER.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (b)(1) clarifies the requirement that the owner or operator of an undertread cementing, tread-end cementing or bead dipping operation subject to this section shall install and operate a capture system designed to achieve maximum reasonable capture of at least 85% by weight of VOC emitted, from all undertread cementing, tread-end cementing and bead dipping operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

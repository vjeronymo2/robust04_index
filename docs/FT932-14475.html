			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / AEA prepares to emerge from shadows: Michael Cassell finds enthusiasm for the sale of the atomic energy body IT HAS been a long march from Aldermaston but the UK Atomic Energy Authority is finally preparing to break free from its sometimes shadowy state-owned past to make its own way in the commercial marketplace. The recent announcement that the government is to commission a report on the case for moving the organisation - now called AEA Technology - into the private sector is likely to signal an end to nearly 40 years of governance by statute and ministerial diktat. But AEA Technology is a rare specimen, presenting ministers with the difficult task of stripping out its hugely expensive, historic nuclear liabilities from a thriving technology transfer business so that it can be offered for sale. The same sort of dilemma threw electricity privatisation into chaos. If the government faces a headache, the organisation itself - which last year reported Pounds 28m profits on a Pounds 442m turnover - eagerly awaits the freedom to exploit its specialist skills fully and to complete its conversion into a world-class service bus-iness. Although nuclear-related capabilities remain one of AEA Technology's prime commercial strengths, many original nuclear activities have long since gone. British Nuclear Fuels was spun off in 1970 while radiochemical work went to Amersham International, the health science group, 10 years ago. Responsibility for the development of nuclear devices at Aldermaston in Berkshire - once an annual target for Easter peace demonstrations - passed to the Ministry of Defence 20 years ago, al-though AEA Technology still has a hand in managing the site, now part of the At-omic Weapons Establishment. Other operations also remain obscured by the Official Secrets Act, such as work on the strategic defence initiative - 'Star Wars' - programme for the US government and on Trident submarine reactor safety for the MoD. But an organisation created in 1954 to spearhead the development of UK nuclear technology is today much more likely to be using its expertise to create specialist products or advise industries and governments on everything from the supply and use of energy to waste management, safety and environmental protection. Only half its revenue now derives from the UK government and this will fall to about 30 per cent, given the removal of its nuclear liabilities. Since 1986 AEA Technology, based at Harwell near Oxford, has been required by the government to operate commercially - a shift in strategy made all the more vital by subsequent retrenchment in the government's own nuclear programmes. But by the end of the 1980s, with government funding declining, the future of an organisation boasting 3,000 graduate scientists and engineers appeared uncertain. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, says: 'We reached the point where we either devised a new strategy or faced irreversible natural decay.' The result was further change, signalled with the creation in 1990 of a number of nuclear-related and industrial business units. A continuing cost-cutting programme has now reduced staff to about 8,000, one fifth of the peak reached in the early 1960s, while several executives have been recruited from outside. The business is expanding overseas - particularly in east and west Europe, the US and the Far East - and wants to see up to 30 per cent of turnover coming from abroad within the next four years. Overseas income could reach Pounds 70m this year. But its ambitions hinge on the removal of legal constraints which still dog its activities as long as it remains in the public sector, a fact acknowledged last year in a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. At present AEA Technology's financial limits are set by the Treasury. It must also seek ministerial approval for alliances or joint ventures and is severely restricted in exploiting its non-nuclear expertise. Mr Eyre stresses that total privatisation is not essential, providing AEA Technology is given the necessary freedoms, but there is no mistaking the enthusiasm for going the whole way. Neither will any plan envisaging the separate disposal of business units regarded as totally interdependent be welcomed. 'We don't want the bits flogged off separately. We have a much better chance of surviving if everything is kept intact,' Mr Eyre says. But for ministers the biggest dilemma is what to do with the unattractive 'baggage' left in the shape of nuclear installations scattered around the country - such as the Dounreay fast reactor in Scotland - for which the government pays about Pounds 100m a year in decommissioning and radioactive waste management costs. The total state bill, likely to continue well into the next century, is put at Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn. The most likely solution will be the creation of a residuary body to handle AEA Tech-nology's former responsibil-ities. Independent consultants charged with examining ministerial options will be appointed soon and should report by the late summer. A sale could be pencilled in for 1995 or early 1996. But while the present government looks set to extend the disciplines of the marketplace to its old nuclear servant, any delays in privatisation would raise the possibility of a change in administration and an alternative outcome. Labour might be far less ready to see such a centre of technical excellence and innovation slip entirely from its grasp.</p>

It coincided with the arrival here of the  Russian contingent. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation  president's special representative for the former Yugoslavia,  declared this in conversation with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's  correspondent. He visited the Bosnian capital Sunday during  another working tour of the region for the purpose of developing  the peace trend which has become apparent in the city and  extending it to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Within the framework of the consultations in Sarajevo the  Russian diplomat held talks with Alija Izetbegovic, leader of  the Bosnian Muslims. In Pale he met with Nikola Kolevic, member  of the leadership of the Bosnian Serb community. Ways to  develop the peace process after the Croat and Muslim sides  signed the plans to create a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia  were the object of discussion.    Then V. Churkin visited the Russian battalion's billet in  the  capital's Vraca district and went to one of the observation  posts where Russian "blue helmets" are serving. In conversation  with servicemen the Russian Federation president's special  representative rated highly the speed with which the battalion  has settled in in its new location and begun tackling very  difficult peacemaking tasks. Such effectiveness, he emphasized,  elicits a feeling of pride in Russia's Armed Forces.    Another subject was also touched upon -- the resolution of  the problems of a psychological kind which the Bosnian Muslim  side experienced at first in connection with the so unexpected  arrival of the Russian contingent. As is known, some  representatives of the Muslim leadership have made nervous and  at times even irresponsible statements about this. For example,  they have called the Russian battalion an occupying battalion.  In Churkin's opinion, this problem has now been eliminated.    On the conclusion of his visit to "Rusbat-2," as the Russian  contingent in Sarajevo is now being called, Vitaliy Churkin once  again emphasized the importance of Russian participation in UN  peacemaking operations. Joint service in an important cause  with the French, the British, and representatives of other  states, he emphasized, is far more useful for arranging  cooperation between armies than organizing conferences.</p>

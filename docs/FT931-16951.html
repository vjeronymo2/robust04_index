			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Letter: Poland in the EC essential for European peace and unity Sir, In the aftermath of the Edinburgh summit and enthusiasm over the timetable of accession of western countries such as Austria and Norway to the EC, another subject slipped off the agenda - a firm timetable for the accession of Poland, and indeed then Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics to the EC. This is now a matter for Copenhagen. Economists at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have already made the important point that if the EC's governments made the decision, these countries could be admitted right away. Poland's democracy is no more fragile than that of some existing EC members. Moreover, it is a rapidly maturing one - as well as being an economy that will actually grow this year. Convergence criteria are in the eye of the beholder; to insist that these countries meet necessary economic and political pre-conditions before they accede could prove to be the most awful short-sightedness. Britain's prime minister, Mr John Major, has said that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to see Poland become a member of the EC. There is no recession so severe, no problem of economic integration so serious, that cannot be overcome to achieve a degree of European unity that may prove essential for the peace, the development, and, eventually, the prosperity also of Europe as a whole. Ask not what Poland must do for the EC, but instead what all in the EC must do for Poland.

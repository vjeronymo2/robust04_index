			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 9 (AFP)--The  Palestinian police force opened a liaison office Monday [9 May]  inside the Israeli Army's new military headquarters on the Gaza  Strip, a PLO official said.    The bureau would be manned 24 hours a day to try to settle  problems as they arose under autonomy, the official told AFP.    The HQ overlooks Ganei Tal, a settlement in the main Jewish  area of occupation which surrounds the Palestinian town of Khan  Yunis. The Army shifted there from Gaza City to facilitate their  mission to protect Israeli settlers.    Meanwhile, Israeli military administration officials at Khan  Yunis and Rafah called in local Palestinian dignitaries for a  farewell ceremony on Monday.    The PLO official said the new police force would soon take  over the buildings.    About 300 policemen were to cross into the newly-autonomous  strip at the Rafah border with Egypt later Monday, Palestinian  and Israeli officials said.    PLO leaders on the strip earlier met senior Palestinian  employees of the administration to prepare the transfer of  civilian authority.    Palestinian officials said the meeting at the PLO's  temporary  police headquarters in Gaza City covered the range of civilian  affairs, from identity cards to telephones, health, education  and employment.    No date has been set for the Israelis to hand over to the  Palestinians responsibility for running their daily lives, but  the officials said it would take place gradually over the coming  days.</p>

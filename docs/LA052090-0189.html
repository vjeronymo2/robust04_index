			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGN SOLUTIONS: ADDING FIREPLACE TO EXISTING HOME  </P> <P> QUESTION: I want a fireplace in an existing house. What are the requirements  and costs?  </P> <P> ANSWER: There are a number of styles of fireplaces from which to choose, such  as corner, Swedish or a three-faced model. The final choice should reflect the  architectural character of your home.  </P> <P> Considering the costs of adding a masonry fireplace to an existing house, I am  going to recommend a zero-clearance unit. A zero-clearance fireplace has an  insulated metal fire box and flue that can be placed directly adjacent to a  wood-frame structure and chimney. The popularity of these fireplaces has  increased due to their low construction cost as compared to masonry fireplace  and chimney construction.  </P> <P> Zero-clearance fireplaces are available from a variety of manufacturers. Prices  range from $400 on up, not including installation. Construction and  installation costs will depend on the placement of the fireplace and the  specific home. Consult with a licensed contractor to install the fireplace  unit. It is very important to verify actual installation requirements with the  vendor's specifications and the local fire marshal or building code guidelines.  </P> <P> BRADLEY JB QUINN, ISID  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P> <P> </P> <P> How to Make Studio Apartment Cozier  </P> <P> Q: I'm a single guy in a studio apartment. I have no flair for decorating, and  my women friends tell me my place isn't cozy. Help! The king-size bed is on the  floor and I have only one lamp plus a ceiling fixture.  </P> <P> A: Your apartment can be significantly more comfortable by including a sitting  area separate from the sleeping area. Therefore, create a separation by using a  movable screen or wall unit. Screens are available in Oriental motif, casual  wicker or one simply painted in your favorite colors. The screen should help  set a theme.  </P> <P> Your sitting area may include overstuffed lounge chairs and a coffee table with  extra pillow cushions pulled up to it informally. Flexibility in the furnishing  arrangement can allow you to set various moods. Softly illuminate the area  indirectly with a torchiere lamp.  </P> <P> Your artwork can be playful, yet dramatic, such as designer fabric stretched  onto a frame. Shape and size of artwork is up to you. A variety of textures in  your fabrics will appeal to the senses. For a warm, snug look, choose a soft  wool throw blanket or a chenille pillow. Add a rustic pot in the corner with  silk tree (easy for maintenance). Hardcover books are a natural for adding to  the relaxed atmosphere.  </P> <P> Your sleeping area needs a nonconventional night stand. Try a pot with a custom  made glass top or a chest. Be sure your studio apartment reflects who you are  and that you feel comfortable in it. The rest will follow.  </P> <P> ANDREA HYMER, ASID  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> </P> <P> Secret of Mixing Patterns and Florals  </P> <P> Q: What is the secret of mixing geometric patterns and florals? I love the  look, but meet with disaster when I attempt to do it myself.  </P> <P> A: The secret of mixing geometric patterns and florals is in the size of the  pattern and the colors. The colors of the two different patterns must blend.  For instance, if green is one of the common colors in the patterns, be sure  both greens are blue-greens. Not one a blue-green and one a yellow-green. Also,  if the geometric pattern is a very large check or plaid, the flower can have  the same colors in it, but must be a very small all-over design.  </P> <P> JANET MARRACH, ISID  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who Can Advise on Structural Changes?  </P> <P> Q: I want to combine several small rooms into one large room, but I'm afraid it  might affect the structural soundness of the entire house. Who should I call to  help me determine what walls are safe to remove?  </P> <P> A: Confer with your qualified interior designer to draft plans showing  structural design changes. As with any structural change, you must consult a  licensed architect and/or structural engineer, normally provided by your  architect.  </P> <P> I recommend that your interior designer be present at your meetings in order to  retain the integrity of your design. If structural soundness is in jeopardy,  your architect will draft plans and the structural engineer will check and sign  off the prints. Only after city building department approval may you proceed.  </P> <P> JANICE RENNE, ISID  </P> <P> Orange County Chapter of ISID  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where to Install a Wine Storage Area  </P> <P> Q: Wine storage is a major problem in any size kitchen especially one with no  floor or counter space. Any suggestions?  </P> <P> A: A cool and dark "cave" for the storage of wine is best. So choose a base  cabinet and insert one of the following:  </P> <P>  -- A ready-made wire or wood bottle rack(s) which can be found in most kitchen  supply stores. Note: If possible, vent the cabinet to bring up cool air from  the basement or under the house.  </P> <P>  -- Order through your local kitchen cabinet company a custom wine rack  accessory unit, to insert into an existing cabinet, from Amrock or comparable  company at an approximate price of $250.  </P> <P>  -- If there is enough space and electricity, an under-counter refrigerated  wine storage unit can be ordered from a commercial kitchen appliance store.  </P> <P> To use your wine storage as a focal point, choose an upper cabinet and  spotlight it from outside the cabinet. If the cabinet divides the room, open  both sides and insert bottles in alternating directions.  </P> <P> LINDA ADAMS, ISID  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P> <P> This column is prepared by members of the American Society of Interior  Designers and International Society of Interior Designers.

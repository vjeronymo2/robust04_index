			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Baird under fire at Senate hearings THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced tough questioning from senators concerned that she had broken the law in employing illegal aliens for her household. Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be confirmed. Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has declared he will vote against confirmation. But Mr Hatch also reported that his constituent mail was running heavily against Ms Baird and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in the person of Ms Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor known for her high principles. 'The ethical high ground for Zoe Baird is to request that her name be withdrawn,' Ms Jordan said. Earlier this week, Ms Patricia King, also black and a Georgetown University law professor, had maintained in a powerful Washington Post column that the nation's chief law enforcement officer could not be someone who had recently broken the law. Elsewhere, the new administration, if not the president himself, began to get down to work. Mr Clinton was preoccupied with welcoming 2,500 guests to a White House open day. But Mr Warren Christopher, confirmed on Wednesday as secretary of state, talked to Mr Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress.</p>

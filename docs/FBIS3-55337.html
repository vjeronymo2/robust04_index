			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Informed sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry  told Interfax that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk would  arrive in Moscow to meet with Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill  Clinton. The three presidents are expected to meet on January  14.    The sources also said that the reports on Clinton's visit to  Ukraine were "groundless."    Meanwhile, informed sources in Kiev told Interfax that the  authorities there do not rule out the possibility of President  Clinton's stopover in the Ukrainian capital. They say that a  meeting of Kravchuk and Clinton could resolve all issues in the  stationing of nuclear weapons in Ukraine that cause American  concern. The same sources note that in this case Leonid  Kravchuk's trip to Moscow would be "problematic" unless  trilateral documents could be signed there.</p>

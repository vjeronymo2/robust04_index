			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Iver Hoj: "A Fishing Nation Goes Ashore"] </F>   [Text] The people of the Faeroes are disillusioned,  powerless, indebted, and poor. The islands' worst crisis is  still unfolding. People are fleeing to Denmark. The vital  trawler fleet has been on strike for a week over compulsory  fishing quotas that will gradually strangle the industry. But  everyone knows who is responsible for the crisis. They are.    Torshavn--As always the weather on the Faeroes is unsettled,  but the mood is stable, below the freezing point.    For over a week the Faeroese trawler fleet has remained in  port--in anger over a new fishing quota system that could lead  to the scrapping of many trawlers in the near future.    It was not until Friday night [11 March] that the Faeroese  government presented a proposal that could get the fishermen  moving. The quotas will be retained, but the Faeroes will  purchase the right to catch another 5,000 tons in the Russian  zone of the Barents Sea.    The vital trawlers are the first link in the Faeroes' food  chain. Fish make up 98 percent of island exports and the 44  trawlers account for 80 percent of the total catch. But the  people of the Faeroes are so used to misery and catastrophe that  they have scarcely reacted to the paralysis of the industry that  must pump life into the entire island community.    Some 1,000 workers at fish fillet factories have already  been  fired or will be in the coming week and the painful effects will  spread to every corner of the wind-swept islands until more fish  are brought ashore.    "I think the Faeroese and Danish governments forget they are  dealing with human beings. What is happening just now is simply  an enormous catastrophe," said the leader of the strike, Emil  Nolsoe, chairman of the trawler owners' organization and a  skipper from Sando with a steely glint in his eyes.    The depression of ordinary islanders approaches apathy at  times in the midst of the Faeroes' worst economic crisis. It is  hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The people of  the Faeroes do not like their new daily life.  <H5>  Shock Therapy </H5>   After the over-consumption and unrestrained deficit spending  of the 1980's when every town had to have its nursing home and  its soccer field with artificial turf, the bill must now be paid.    And Denmark is very popular in the Faeroes these days. Not  only do the islands receive a billion kroner a year in subsidies  from Copenhagen, the Danish Government has rescued the  foundering banks--and recently Prime Minister Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen agreed to lend the Faeroes 3 billion kroner so the  islands could eliminate expensive old loans. The conditions were  the fishing quotas and an end to wage guarantees for the highly  paid fishermen.    The foreign debt amounts to almost 8 billion kroner and  although the Danish Government has come to the rescue and  suspended payments, an expensive 500 million kroner a year in  interest must be paid.    The natural catastrophe of fewer fish in the sea--and the  fall of the Berlin wall which opened the door for cheap Russian  fish--have been a hard blow.    The result is 5,000 people unemployed out of a labor force  of  21,000. The strike is temporarily sending 1,000 more off the  job. A little under 1,000 people are not covered by unemployment  funds and live on public assistance. The crisis has meant a wage  decline of 10-15 percent. At the same time taxes have risen  explosively. Before the first of the year the islanders were  paying 10 percent more in taxes than Danes do. After 1 January  municipal taxes rose 6-7 percent. An ordinary wage earner pays a  good 60 percent in taxes--without deductions. In addition there  is a high oil tax and a value-added tax. An unemployed person  receives only two-thirds of a skilled worker's pay and the  support is close to the absolute subsistence level.    "We are well aware that we have only ourselves to thank for  our situation," the islanders all say.    But they do not believe they will ever be able to pay off  the  debt. Denmark will be stuck with it--sooner or later. For if  unemployment rises further and taxes do not decline, emigration  from the islands to Denmark will accelerate. Neither Denmark nor  the Faeroes can live with that in the long run.    In 1993, 2,700 people left the Faeroes and only 900 returned  home. It is people between the ages of 30 and 40 who go to  Denmark to get work and more money. The population figure has  dropped suddenly from 47,000 to 45,000 and everyone believes the  outward flow will continue.    "It is an open artery that is draining energy and the future  from society. It is the people who ought to get everything going  again who are leaving. But the question is whether there is room  for that many people here. Whether we have to get down to a  population of 25-30,000 to find a natural level," said Aksel  Hansen, the grand old man of fishing in the Faeroes.    The 70 year old Hansen is one of those who have been hardest  hit. In the fall his fish factory in Torshavn harbor would have  celebrated its 40th anniversary. But one month before the big  day the bank rejected a debt reorganization plan and he lost the  factory.    Now he has five trawlers but he is still debt-ridden.    "Things began going wrong for the Faeroes in the 1970's.  Grants were given for ships and fish factories in every single  town and it was quite obvious that it was too much. But things  went well through the 1980's when fishing was good. At our  factory we used the money to improve production and we were also  hit when the crisis came," he said.  <H5>  Politicians Detested </H5>   The trawler owners' confrontation with the politicians of  the  Faeroes has been reinforced by a total distrust of the elected  representatives.    "Our politicians are no good," Hansen said bluntly. And a  similar refrain is heard everywhere from people high and low.    But the anger with the island government fell on deaf ears  despite the fact that the strike will probably cost Faeroese  unemployment funds 50 million kroner. Just after the strike  began a 14-man delegation headed by Prime Minister Marita  Petersen (Social Democrat) journeyed to Stockholm on a visit to  the Nordic Council. And she did not return until Thursday [10  March], when she rejected the fishermen's demands. The law on  limiting catches goes into effect tomorrow.    The debt-ridden Faeroese trawler fleet considers the quotas  unreasonable. Especially as it will not be possible to let the  healthiest ships buy quotas from those in poor shape so they can  quit.    "The whole quota system is set up so unrealistically that it  makes it impossible to make a living. The law has sidestepped  the heart of the matter. If the government thinks some ships  should be eliminated it is wrong to kill all of them slowly in  order to weed some out," said Nolsoe. He feels a deep distrust  of the marine biologists who said in 1987 that if a third of the  87 trawlers then in existence disappeared the fleet would have  an ideal composition.    Now there are 44 left and the biologists are saying again  that the fleet should be cut in half.    "The fish are there. The supply of haddock and cod is on the  way up. We agreed earlier to protect big areas and use larger  meshes, but we do not believe quotas will help increase the fish  population. I think the Danish Government has acted too hastily  and listened to the wrong people. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is being  penny-wise and pound-foolish," Nolsoe said.    At Tinganes, where the government can be found (at least  after its return on Friday) Prime Minister Petersen is well  aware that she occasionally makes unpopular decisions:    "Everyone is to blame for what has happened. But the  politicians have the biggest responsibility. We should have had  a different fishing policy, a different housing policy and  different rules on taxing interest long ago to avoid acquiring  this huge debt. But I can look the voters in the eye and say: We  have tackled the problems that exist and have gone against the  tide. We stand by what we do."    It is an election year and she is considerably more  optimistic about the future than people on the street and in the  business sector.    According to the local government's projections the public  debt of 6.3 billion kroner will not rise during the next five  years. On the other hand plans call for doing away with private  foreign debt in 1998. And at that time things may well move  forward again--by virtue of strong growth in the fish supply.    "It will be tough to get through this. Especially because  people here have enjoyed constant progress for 30 years. This  has created a way of life that is hard to give up. So now people  are disillusioned and can only see the negative side. Things are  not that bad. Some 70 percent of the people are doing quite  well."    Like most people she regards foreign debt as the biggest  problem. But while others hope the debt to Denmark will be  canceled because the catastrophe can be limited that way, the  prime minister of the Faeroes does not plan to entreat Denmark  to cancel the outstanding amount:    "If we are to have any hope of regaining our credibility and  our credit rating abroad it is decisive not to have our debt  canceled. Five years from now things may well be moving in the  right direction again."    But when will she come to Copenhagen next with her hat in  her  hand?    "I cannot answer that."</p>

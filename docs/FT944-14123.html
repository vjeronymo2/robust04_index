			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / 'The extent of my personal involvement' Mr Michael Howard last night issued this statement on the Fayed brothers' naturalisation: 'In view of certain allegations concerning the handling of the naturalisation applications by Mr Ali Al-Fayed and Mr Mohamed Al-Fayed, I should like to put on record the extent of my personal involvement with these applications. 'Naturalisation applications are normally decided by officials in the nationality division of the Home Office, but especially difficult or sensitive cases are referred to ministers, when they are usually dealt with by the junior minister responsible for immigration and nationality. Exceptionally cases are referred to the Home secretary. 'The application was referred by the head of the nationality division on December 23 1993, to my then junior minister Charles Wardle. I had made it clear from the outset to Mr Wardle that I wished the application of Mr Ali Al-Fayed to be decided by him. Subsequently, on January 13, Mr Wardle's office referred the papers to my office and indicated that he wished to discuss the case with me and I saw him on January 21. I confirmed to Mr Wardle that the decision on this application should be taken by him. 'The case next came to my attention on April 27 when Mr Wardle's office referred to me his intended decision on the application of Mr Ali Al-Fayed. I made it clear that the decision was to be taken by Mr Wardle, but suggested further inquiries should be made before a final decision was reached. 'Following the ministerial changes at the end of July, Nicholas Baker became the minister responsible for immigration and nationality. On August 29 his office passed to mine a further submission from the head of the nationality division containing proposals for taking the case forward, which I saw in early September after my return from Latin America. 'I subsequently briefly spoke to Mr Baker to confirm that I wanted him to deal with the applications.'</p>

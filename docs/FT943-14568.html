			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / 'Dear Leader' takes complete power in N Korea Radio broadcasts from Pyongyang indicated yesterday that Mr Kim Jong-il had assumed complete political power in North Korea following the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung, Our Seoul and Beijing Correspondents report. Mr Kim, the country's 'Dear Leader', has been raised 'to the highest position of the (ruling Korean Workers') party, the state and the revolutionary armed forces,' the state-controlled Radio Pyongyang said. The statement suggests Mr Kim now occupies the three key posts in the country, including general secretary of the party and president, in addition to his current role as supreme commander of the armed forces. But the radio broadcast did not mention the official titles of these positions, indicating Mr Kim would not formally be named to them until next week after his father's funeral on Sunday. In Beijing Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, on his return from a central European tour hailed Mr Kim Jong-il as North Korea's 'new leader'. Mr Li led other Chinese leaders to the North Korean embassy where they bowed to a large portrait of the late leader and wrote condolence messages. According to China's official Xinhua news agency, Mr Li then asked the ambassador, Mr Chu Chang Jun, 'to convey his regards and respects to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's new leader, Kim Jong-il'. The ambassador replied that under the leadership of Mr Kim Jong-il, the Korean people would turn grief into strength. Radio Pyongyang announced that North Korea would hold preparatory talks with the US in New York next week on resuming their negotiations on the international inspections of the North's nuclear facilities. The discussions, begun in Geneva last Friday, were suspended after President Kim's death.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hardanger Props Hardanger Properties, the Kidderminster-based retail property developer, is being placed in administration after the collapse of a rescue package. The company announced yesterday that certain Hong Kong investors, who in December proposed refinancing its debts, have withdrawn. Substitute investors are not acceptable to Barclays, its main creditor. The shares were suspended at 65p in April following delayed property sales and high borrowings. The depressed property market prevented the company making necessary sales to reduce its interest charges. Hardanger has about Pounds 80m in secured creditors, with Barclays owed more than Pounds 40m. Unsecured creditors are thought to total less than Pounds 10m.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AIRLINE RETIREMENT RULE UPHELD  </P> <P> The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago has upheld a 30-year-old  Federal Aviation Administration rule that forces commercial airline pilots to  retire at age 60.  </P> <P> The three-judge panel voted 2 to 1 Wednesday against a group of airline pilots  who sought to have the rule overturned.  </P> <P> But all three judges voiced reservations about the ruling. The senior judge,  Hubert L. Will, wrote a strongly worded dissent. The FAA established the  retirement rule in 1960 and has argued consistently that allowing pilots to fly  beyond age 60 would be dangerous.  </P> <P> Critics say pilots in their 60s have experience that benefits passengers, and  cite the 1989 crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, to back  their case. A 57-year-old pilot landed a jet, despite a crippled hydraulic  system.  </P></p>

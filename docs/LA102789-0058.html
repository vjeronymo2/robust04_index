			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADA ORDERS MURDER SUSPECT NG'S EXTRADITION  </P> <P> Charles Ng, wanted in California on 12 murder charges in a string of grisly  sex-torture slayings, Thursday was ordered extradited by Canadian Justice  Minister Doug Lewis.  </P> <P> But Ng, who lost one previous round of appeals in the courts, still has legal  avenues open to stay in Canada.  </P> <P> Ng, 29, a former Marine, is charged with committing the crimes in 1985 at the  remote mountain home of a companion, Leonard Lake, in Wilseyville in Calaveras  County.  </P> <P> According to state and local investigators and hundreds of pages of court  documents and evidence filed in Calaveras County, Ng and Lake have been linked  to about two dozen slayings. The evidence includes at least one videotape of a  murder victim.  </P> <P> Lake committed suicide in June, 1985.  </P> <P> In July, 1985, Ng was apprehended in Calgary, Alberta, during a scuffle with a  department store security guard in which the guard was shot. Ng was convicted  of attempted murder and is serving a 4 1/2-year sentence in Calgary.  </P> <P> California has cited as grounds for extradition 19 of 25 criminal charges that  have been filed against Ng. Of the 19, 12 are for capital murder and the rest  involve kidnaping, burglary and attempted murder.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the U.S.-Canada extradition treaty, Canada may refuse an  extradition request unless state authorities in the United States assure Canada  that the death penalty will not be imposed.  </P> <P> However, Justice Minister Lewis said in a letter to Ng's lawyer: "I am  satisfied that it is in the public interest to surrender Ng to the United  States without seeking (death penalty) assurances."  </P> <P> If fugitives charged with murder believed that they could avoid the death  penalty by fleeing to Canada, Lewis added, the country "would become a safe  haven for such criminals." He said the government could not ignore the reality  that the long border between the two countries affords many opportunities for  fugitives to "move quickly, easily and frequently between both countries."  </P> <P> Canadian Department of Justice spokeswoman Helene Ouellet said that Ng could be  extradited to the United States in a "couple of days," although she said the  process could be delayed if Ng files an appeal in Canadian federal court.  </P></p>

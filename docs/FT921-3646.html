			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ABP plans general purpose port on Humber ASSOCIATED British Ports Holdings will build a general purpose cargo port at Immingham on the Humber, following its recent cancellation of plans to build the UK's biggest coal terminal on the site. ABP last month cancelled a Pounds 150m contract with PowerGen and National Power, the two privatised electricity generators, after PowerGen sought to postpone signing of the already delayed contract. Sir Keith Stuart, chairman of ABP, said: 'There are many other trades in Immingham which need further capacity. It is bursting at the seams - we could not delay matters any longer, pending decisions by these semi-privatised companies.' Sir Keith said the group would start building at Immingham this year and develop the riverside site over two to three years, although at less cost than the Pounds 45m which the port group would have contributed to the coal terminal. ABP, the UK's biggest ports group since privatisation in 1983, yesterday confirmed its January warnings that provisions on its property portfolio would wipe out profits in the second half of last year. Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 60.2m to Pounds 31m in the year to December 31 following provisions of Pounds 29.7m against property development activities. Turnover rose from Pounds 211.3m to Pounds 310.3m, mainly because of the sale in June of Aldwych House, the group's largest development, for Pounds 75.2m. Despite the recession, continuing growth of the group's ports and transport activities caused divisional profits to rise from Pounds 59.5m to Pounds 76.1m on turnover of Pounds 184.6m (Pounds 176.4). Tonnage handled at the ports increased from 101m to 106m. Sir Keith said: 'Our ports business has continued to perform well in the first months of 1992, although we do not expect any dramatic increase in activity until the current recession in the UK economy and elsewhere is reversed.' Net borrowings decreased by Pounds 63m to Pounds 332m at the year end, bringing gearing down from 63.8 per cent to to 54.5 per cent. The interest charge increased to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 9.2m), as the amount of interest capitalised in the year was cut from Pounds 35.8m to Pounds 12.8m. Earnings per share fell from 22.5p to 12.4p. However, ABP said that because of the underlying strength of the company's position, it would pay a final dividend of 4.9p (4.5p), giving a total of 8p (7.25p). COMMENT Having bought Grosvenor Square Properties in 1987, ABP stood back and watched that sector go up like a rocket and down like a stick. It promises to avoid speculative property developments in future, although as these results show it will be living with the costs of that period for some time to come. It is, however, genuinely impressive to increase ports turnover in the depths of a recession. It is even more impressive to convert an Pounds 8.2m increase in turnover into a Pounds 16.6m rise in profits. ABP is still benefiting in efficiency terms from the abolition of the National Docks Labour Scheme in 1989. Full-year profits of Pounds 70m would put the shares, which closed down 11p yesterday at 348p, on a prospective multiple of 12.7. That does not seem demanding for a group which would benefit very quickly from any economic upturn.</p>

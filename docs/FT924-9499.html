			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Brussels urges accord on VAT PLANS to simplify the transitional indirect tax system in the European single market should be pushed through the EC's legislative machinery before the end of the year, the European Commission said yesterday, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. The Commission approved a new draft directive to help lift the potential administrative burden on companies, many of which have complained about the new transitional system for collecting value added tax (VAT) and excise duties. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC tax commissioner, said the European Parliament and national officials would begin debating the measure immediately, and the Commission hopes for unanimous approval from member states before the old system of border controls is abolished at the end of the year. The directive should eliminate problems arising from 'triangular trade'. For example, if a German company occasionally buys goods from a British group for delivery to a Spanish company, the German company will not have to register for VAT in Spain.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Verdicts: Counting the cost of the scandal THE Blue Arrow scandal has cost National Westminster Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew dearly. County NatWest's parent now expects the affair to set it back at least Pounds 50m. Of that, Pounds 30m has been paid in compensation to misled investors. 'Quite a fine for one evening,' reflected Mr Roger Flemington, the NatWest deputy chief executive. By contrast, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew offered shareholders Pounds 45m in compensation. The Swiss-owned firm has always tried to depict itself as the 'junior partner' in the case, but its greater involvement in placing Blue Arrow shares after the failed rights issue left it more vulnerable to criticism from institutional investors. The damage to their reputations in the markets was considerable. NatWest commissioned extensive market research among both its corporate and individual customers, and that found there had been little impact on the reputation of the parent bank itself. Potential clients of County, however, expressed second thoughts on whether to choose its corporate finance department to act as adviser. The depth of the scandal at one stage led the parent to consider closing County. Its recovery, largely under the chairmanship of Mr Howard MacDonald, did not happen overnight. Regaining the confidence of the Bank of England required reviewing the systems of checks and balances in County. Restoring confidence in the markets took longer. Looking back, some in the parent bank regret not having kept the investment banking arm on a somewhat shorter rein. Mr Flemington admitted with hindsight that Blue Arrow pointed to a failing to integrate one sub-culture properly into the overall management structure. Within an organisation as large as NatWest, sub-cultures such as investment banking remain distinctive. What is important is to recognises this, whilst still blending them into the overall structure, he said. The impact of Blue Arrow on P&amp;D was arguably less than that on NatWest. Its name has not been linked as frequently with the affair as that of County. And although the firm went through its own upheaval at the end of the 1980s, it has recovered more quickly and more strongly. The dangers of reputational risk have not been lost on the company. Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of P&amp;D said: 'I am confident that our levels of compliance and systems of control are among the highest in the business, as you would expect of a bank with a triple-A rating.'</p>

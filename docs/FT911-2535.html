			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Paving the way for lower interest rates - all in good time: The weekend meeting where the Group of Seven nations papered over the cracks between them THE WEEKEND meeting of representatives of the Group ofSeven leading industrialised countries established the principle that policy co-ordination need not involve various countries pursuing the same policies at thesame time. While the US failed in its short-term goal of getting Germany to cut its interest rates, the discussions among the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada should pave the way for lower interest rates in the months ahead. The communique followed a time-honoured ritual of papering over the cracks among the seven sufficiently to enable each participant to claim that its views had in the endprevailed. The German delegation could point, in support of its refusal to cut rates, to that part of the final statement in which the G7 underlined its 'common objective of sustained growth with price stability'. The communique also 'emphasised the importance of monetary and fiscal policies which provide the basis for lower real interest rates and a sustained global economic recovery with price stability.' The G7 finance ministers, it added, 'believed that such a medium-term strategy was the best way of reducing potential risks and uncertainties in the current outlook.' The US, which has underlined its fears of a global recession in recent weeks, could draw comfort from a recognition in the communique that there was a persistence of high real interest ratesand a slowing of economic activity in countries which until recently had been experiencing strong expansion. The G7 bridged the gap between its members by agreeing 'to monitor the situation closely and to take actions as needed within the co-ordination process, with a view to achieving a sound recovery and a growing world economy.' The US will hope that such words will exert some pressure on Germany not to tighten monetary policy to combat what it sees as burgeoning inflationary pressures. Yesterday, Mr David Mulford, US Treasury Under-secretary for international monetary affairs, said he thought Germany would hesitate to raise rates after the meeting. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, said Germany told the meeting that it might cut its rates this year. Further remarks from him suggested that the G7 had adopted a strategy, outlined last week by the International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook, to cut rates as the financial markets allow. He said that world bond marketsat the long end were giving clear signals to cut rates. 'It is up to the monetary authorities not to disappoint the markets.' The G7 participants 'reaffirmed their commitment to co-operate closely on exchange markets' but otherwise did nothing to halt the current strength of the dollar. There were signs after the meeting that some ministers and central bankers thought the dollar may be nearing a peak. Mr Beregovoy said that political factors, rather than economic fundamentals, were keeping the dollar strong. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, said on Sunday that he thought the German economy was a 'bit oversold' by financial markets and that this situation would correct itself. 'It is not all doom and gloom in Germany,' he said.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: House of Fraser flotation public element oversubscribed House of Fraser, the 56-store department store group, said yesterday the public element of its flotation was 2.2 times subscribed, and larger applications would be scaled down. The group placed 172.2m ordinary shares, 75 per cent of the total, firm with institutional investors. It offered 57.4m shares to the public, and received applications for 126.87m shares from more than 112,000 applicants. Applications for 200 to 400 shares will be allotted in full, but applications for more will receive only partial allocations. Those applying for 3,000 to a million shares will get 25 per cent, and applicants for more than a million will get 20 per cent. Eligible employees, pensioners and directors applied for a total of 897,700 ordinary shares under a preferential offer. Their applications will be satisfied in full. The Fayed brothers, owners of House of Fraser, are selling all the shares in the group, valuing it at Pounds 413.3m, but are keeping its former flagship Harrods. In the 'grey market' made by IG Index, the London financial bookmaker, the shares were quoted at 190 1/2 p yesterday, against the offer price of 180p, after dropping to 185 1/2 p on Friday.</p>

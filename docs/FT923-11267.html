			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): The benefit of a bond AM I correct in thinking that, were I to assign the benefit of a single premium insurance bond to my wife, a chargeable event would not result - ie it would be a gift inter vivos and so free of all tax? If that is so, on subsequent encashment of the bond by my wife, is the assessment of capital gain based on the original single premium paid to me nearly 20 years ago, or on the value of the bond (determined by the published price of the underlying units) on assignment to her? If the latter is the case, can top slicing relief be applied over this period? As assignment by way of gift of the rights conferred by a single-premium life assurance policy is, as you say, not a chargeable event within section 540 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. (However, the reason which you suggest, after 'ie', is not correct). Your wife's income tax liability on her subsequent surrender of the policy would indeed be based upon the excess of the surrender proceeds over the original premium. Top slicing relief would indeed be available to mitigate any liability to excess liability (currently 15 per cent) - and to CGT on other assets (under section 102(3) of the Finance Act 1988) - but not any liability to age surcharge (currently 12 1/4 per cent). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

Bratislava has reacted very sensitively to signs of  "discrimination" within the Visegrad Group. It has not  responded positively to the reserved stance of Czech politicians  towards the Visegrad Group, or to efforts at taking an  individual approach to the West. The Slovak Foreign Ministry  has been stressing the multilateral character of the envisaged  meeting of the Visegrad countries' top representatives with U.S.  President Bill Clinton, which is to be held in Prague on January  11-12.    By its recent approval of Slovakia's association with the  EU,  the Slovak parliament seems to have clearly expressed its  support of the strategic goal of attaining full membership in  the EU and other West European structures, including NATO.    However, more exact conclusions on a consensus of Slovak  political parties regarding the goals of Slovak foreign policy  can probably be drawn only after the debate on the speech of  Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, slated for January.    Slovakia did not reject the U.S. initiative "Partnership for  Peace," but at the same time indicated that the initiative did  not fully correspond to its idea of joining NATO.    "We understand (the initiative) as a certain temporary phase  which will eventually lead to our full membership," Moravcik  told the government daily REPUBLIKA. At a press conference  after his recent visit to Germany, he praised the "Partnership  for Peace" as a sign of the differentiated approach to the East  and Central European applicants for cooperation with NATO, which  gives priority to the Visegrad countries. Moravcik rejected any  attempts to discriminate against Slovakia within the Visegrad  Group. At the same time he said he hoped the NATO countries'  stands would be more accommodating, also in view of the results  of the Russian parliamentary elections.    In an interview with the U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST,  Slovak President Michal Kovac said he intended to present his  own plan for acceleration of the Visegrad countries' joining  NATO. Kovac's spokesman, Anton Bodis, added that the proposal  was not to be a counter-proposal to the "Partnership for Peace,"  but a possible alternative.    "President Kovac welcomes the U.S. project... the Slovak  Republic unambiguously sticks to this initiative and wants to  participate actively in it, however, it sees the real and  definitive solution in full-fledged NATO membership," Bodis told  CTK.    "The president has an idea of quicker integration of  Slovakia  and other Central European countries into NATO. The first step  would be their admission to NATO as political members along with  offering them security guarantees. After fullfiling the  obligations to follow from this, the Visegrad countries could  become full members of the NATO military organisation as well,"  Bodis explained. He added that full integration into the NATO  military complex demanded a certain amount of time and the  compatibility of the relevant military systems to NATO standards.    He quoted Kovac as saying that in the process of joining  NATO, the Visegrad Four countries should be considered a  regional whole, which necessitates these states' greater mutual  cooperation. "He, Kovac, does not believe that the Visegrad  countries' individual admission to NATO, at intervals of several  years, would help improve the stability of Central Europe,"  Bodis said.    However, even the stand of Slovakia's government camp on  NATO  is not united. In late November 1993, the government daily  REPUBLIKA cast doubts on the statements of Slovak politicians  regarding the necessity for Slovakia to join NATO, as well as on  their efforts to do so along with Slovakia's Visegrad partners.  "In no way can Slovakia's striving to join big politics through  a group that is not favourable to us, and in which every member  country pursues only its own interests, be considered a success  for Slovak foreign policy," REPUBLIKA wrote, referring to Czech  politicians' reserved stance towards the Visegrad Group.    However, it is not ruled out that such criticism of Slovak  foreign policy stems more from the internal situation in the  country's governing Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS),  especially given Moravcik's (HZDS) recent reservations about the  policies of HZDS Chairman and Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar.    REPUBLIKA quoted Moravcik as saying that so far, no signs  had  emerged within the Visegrad Group or NATO regarding whether the  Visegrad countries should join NATO jointly or separately.  However, he added that the cooperation between the Visegrad  Four would be more acceptable for both NATO and the EU, and "our  countries might be admitted at about the same time."    The present situation in Slovak-Hungarian relations seems to  have caused another slow-down of the cooperation within  Visegrad. Rudolf Chmel, the last Czechoslovak ambassador to  Hungary, said these relations destabilised the situation in the  whole region.    Both Hungary and Slovakia have not yet concluded any  inter-state treaty, which should, according to Bratislava,  include the confirmation of the two countries' present borders,  so that Bratislava's often voiced fears of a "Greater Hungary"  could be dismissed. Hungary has made the treaty conditional on  the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on the status of the  Hungarian minority in Slovakia. Bratislava refuses to accept  this, fearing possible separation tendencies on the part of the  minority. The question of the Gabcikovo waterworks on the  Danube River also remains an open problem, which is burdening  mutual relations. The dispute over the opening of new  Slovak-Hungarian border crossings, which Bratislava has made  conditional on Budapest's approval of the readmission agreement  on returning immigrants, led to the postponement of Hungarian  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's planned visit to Slovakia.    Peter Weiss, leader of Slovakia's strongest opposition  party,  the Democratic Left Party (SDL) said that the settlement of  Slovak- Hungarian relations was the basic condition for the  country's NATO membership, as "NATO will not admit neighbours  who are at odds with each other."    It seems that further development of Hungarian-Slovak  relations depends to a large extent on the result of the  forthcoming parliamentary elections in Hungary. However, the  present tension over the Hungarian minority's claims to  participate in the administration of southern Slovakia does not  indicate either any prospect of a prompt settlement of the  disputes or normalisation of relations between Bratislava and  Budapest.</p>

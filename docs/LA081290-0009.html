			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WEEK: 'CLOTHESPINS' PUTS PROGRESS ON THE LINE  </P> <P> Progress takes a back seat to pathos in the California Music Theatre production  of "Clothespins and Dreams," a jazz/gospel/pop musical that made its world  premiere Saturday at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. "It takes place in 1911,"  explained Ron Miller, who wrote the book and lyrics to Ken Hirsch's music.  (They also collaborated on the musical "Satchmo.")  </P> <P> "It was the middle of the Industrial Revolution," he said. "All of these great  inventions -- and with each, 100 men were out of a job."  </P> <P> But in this story (based on Tom Harris' play "Suds"), it's the women who are in  trouble. A group of Harlem laundresses are about to be replaced by a new  monster, the electric washing machine. A contest is waged: Suds, the  washerwomen's manager, against the newfangled invention -- 20 loads, no breaks,  in the hot afternoon sun, with Suds' girls cheering her on. "Impoverished  people have an incredible camaraderie," noted Miller, who grew up poor in  Chicago. "They laugh and joke at life. That's what keeps their sanity."  </P> <P> Here, they also sing -- a lot. "There are 18 songs, 14 hopefully hysterically  funny," said the writer, whose song credits include "Touch Me in the Morning"  and "For Once in My Life." "In one, the women predict the future without  knowing it: 'We'll have lots of inventions, and they'll control our lives.' "  There's also a grudging admiration for the enemy. "One woman says, 'This  machine can put us out of work, but you've got to admit it's a great  invention.' "  </P> <P> CMT artistic director Gary Davis directs a cast of 20, headed by Eloise Laws,  Barney Martin, Ren Woods and Jordan Bennett.  </P> <P> DOIN' IT RIGHT: Last year, Everybody's a Player Productions staged "You Can't  Take It With You" as a benefit for the Stepping Stone Youth Crisis Shelter in  Santa Monica. This year they've staging Larry Shue's "The Foreigner" currently  running at the First United Methodist Church in Santa Monica. All proceeds  again will be donated to Stepping Stone.  </P> <P> Stepping Stone is "the only youth shelter of its kind for homeless or runaway  youth 7 to 17," says Kim Reinking, a spokesperson for the acting company. "They  offer food, shelter, clothing and counseling."  </P> <P> Last year's "You Can't Take It With You" netted the shelter approximately  $6,000, "or about 85% of what it takes to feed 200 kids per year," Reinking  added. First United Methodist Church is donating its stage. Center Theatre  Group came across with costumes, and Omega Cinema Props and Cinebar donated  props.  </P> <P> Now it's the public's turn.  </P></p>

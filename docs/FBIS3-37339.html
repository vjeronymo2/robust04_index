			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belarusian Strike Committee Spokesman Alyaksandr  Lysenka has told BELAPAN that rallies demanding early elections  and the resignation of the government were held today in Minsk,  Mogilev, Soligorsk, Zhodino, and Vileyka. Assessing the  workers' actions, Lysenka pointed out: "This is a success. The  situation in the Republic is so complicated that people found it  hard to make the decision to join the political strike.  However, mass actions did take place and tens of thousands of  people took part in them. We believe that we will soon see the  real political results of this undertaking."    Lysenka underlined that if the Strike Committee Council  receives no answer to its petition by 1300 [1100 GMT] on 22  February, the general political strike will be resumed on the  morning of 23 February. The same will happen if the  administration begins persecuting the organizers of the action.    Meanwhile, Kebich's Press Secretary Uladzimir Zamyatalin  pointed out that "the ultimate decisive battle" urged by the  strike's organizers had not taken place. Zamyatalin added that  "common sense prevailed. This proves that our society is moving  toward democracy."</p>

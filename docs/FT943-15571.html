			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Bretton Woods and the G7 Just a photo opportunity: that is how one knowledgeable observer has already dismissed the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, due to start in Naples tonight. It could well prove to be an accurate forecast. Fortunately, President Clinton comes armed with a number of ideas, some of which, notably the call for an official review of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, deserve support. It is, in any case, wrong to overdo the cynicism. At the least, G7 summits help leaders know one another better. Summits can also push global decision-making forward. The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations might never have been finished if successive summits had not reminded more recalcitrant leaders of its importance. Now they can remind one another of the need to ratify the outcome. But summits are not the right place for day-to-day economic management. On exchange rates, the question leaders should ask themselves is not whether the ailing dollar needs support, but whether the system needs modification. Not all the topics on the agenda are likely to prove equally productive. But now is the right time for the G7 to pay attention to the Bretton Woods institutions. This is appropriate, not just because of the 50th anniversary of the initial conference, but also because the world has changed so much in recent years. Global co-operation Communism has collapsed, largely because of the success of postwar economic reconstruction. Russia's presence at the summit bears witness to this change. With the passing of the strategic threat it posed, the international economic system is both the heart of global co-operation and a potentially potent source of conflict. Also important is the rapid economic growth of populous east Asia, which may soon deprive the present G7 of the capacity to determine the shape of the international economic system. In addition, the agreement to create the World Trade Organisation, reached since the last summit, means that now is the appropriate time to return to the topics of international macroeconomic co-operation and development assistance. The Bretton Woods commission, under the leadership of Mr Paul Volcker, has helped define the issues. It calls for the major industrial governments, first, to strengthen macroeconomic policies and convergence and, second, to establish a more formal system of co-ordination, including target bands for exchange rates. Managing this would become the IMF's central role, leaving development assistance to a reformed World Bank Group. The latter should have a greater orientation towards the private sector, largely through an expanded role for the International Finance Corporation. Fiscal deficits These ideas deserve consideration, above all in the G7, which alone can ensure any conclusions are put into effect. But they are not all equally persuasive. Those on the World Bank and the relationship between it and the IMF seem cogent. Also convincing is the call for better fiscal policy, the greatest need being smaller fiscal deficits over the cycle. The most controversial question is whether, now that inflation has converged at low levels, greater exchange rate stability can also be achieved. It is easy to accept that floating rates have not behaved as well as people once hoped. It is more difficult to agree that this has been one of the main reasons for the slowdown in growth since the 1960s. Nor, particularly after the ERM's melt-down last summer, is it obvious that there exists a workable alternative. The tighter any exchange rate bands, the more demanding the system, in terms not just of knowledge about where limits should be set, but also of the willingness of the members to subordinate domestic goals to international obligations. Nevertheless, it makes sense for the G7 to confront the question of reform. To do so, it should set up high-level taskforces, to make recommendations on how to achieve the goals of the Bretton Woods conference, 50 years on. Attempting this task is both timely and important. It would also pay suitable homage to those wise leaders of 50 years ago, whose achievement can be seen in the fact that the G7's second, third and fifth largest economies were then enemy powers.</p>

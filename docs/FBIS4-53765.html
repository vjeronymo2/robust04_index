			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The Non-Aligned Movement  (NAM) will seek a "balanced" view on the North Korean nuclear  standoff at its foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo next week,  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Monday.    Meeting his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu, Alatas  explained that Cairo will be in charge of drafting the final  document that is to include the first clause on the nuclear  dispute.    Alatas said Indonesia, as chairman of NAM, will try to  reflect a balanced position on the matter that is unbiased  toward both North and South Korea and the international  community, Yu Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs  Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said after the  two-hour talks.    Alatas said his government will "have sympathy" for South  Korea's bid to gain a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security  Council, noting that Jakarta is aware of Seoul's position. South  Korea is expected to compete with Sri Lanka for the council slot  for 1996-97.    Indonesia has been the object of heavy diplomatic lobbying  by  North Korea, which keeps its third largest mission here with a  staff of 25 as a base camp for Southeast Asia.    NAM foreign ministers meet May 31 in Cairo and the row over  Pyongyang's nuclear program is on the agenda for the first time,  with the final document at the end of the meeting June 3 to  address the issue.    Alatas commented on the need for overall revisions to the  makeup of the permanent membership of the Security Council,  pointing out that all current members except China are advanced  nations. He emphasized that developing countries should be duly  represented as well, Yu said.    The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on the  upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in  November, to be hosted by Indonesia.    Alatas notified Han that the summit is slated for Nov. 15,  preceded by a ministerial conference Nov. 11-12. Despite the  expected changes from last year when the United States and other  advanced nations stole the spotlight, Alatas explained his  country plans to follow the format of last year's summit.    In addition, the two foreign ministers discussed prospects  for the Malaysia-led East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), a  sub-group within APEC that raised U.S. officials' eyebrows when  advanced countries were excluded.    Alatas said the matter will be discussed fully with South  Korea, Japan and China as well as Australia, Canada and the  United States.</p>

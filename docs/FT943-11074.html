			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Haiti declares state of siege after UN vote on force Haiti's de facto government declared a state of siege early yesterday, hours after the United Nations voted to approve a US resolution allowing the use of force to remove its military leaders, Reuter reports from Port-au-Prince and Washington. In a decree read over state-run television and radio, provisional President Emile Jonassaint called the UN vote 'arbitrary, iniquitous and in violation of international rights'. He gave no details of what the state of siege entailed but reiterated Haiti was ready to fight against any foreign intervention. The UN Security Council had voted 12-0 to approve a resolution allowing the US to invade Haiti, should it choose, to remove the military leaders who took power in a bloody September 1991 coup. President Bill Clinton has refused to rule out military action to oust the coup leaders but US officials have repeatedly said an invasion is not 'imminent'. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, said yesterday that despite the UN action an invasion of Haiti was not the only option to force out Haiti's military rulers. She said the military rulers could leave 'voluntarily and soon or involuntarily and soon', but would not define 'soon'. Radio stations said that under the declaration all civil power was transferred to the military. Meetings could be dispersed, media outlets could be closed, searches could be carried out without warrants and a curfew could be imposed.</p>

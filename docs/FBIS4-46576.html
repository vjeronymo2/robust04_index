Sizov and A.G. Luzan under the rubric </F> "Military Reform"]    [Text] Yuriy Georgiyevich Sizov is a doctor of  technical sciences and the author of more than 150 scientific  works and inventions, who headed the Armaments Directorate of  Field PVO of the Scientific-Research Institute of the Ministry  of Defense from 1982-88.    Aleksandr Grigoryevich Luzan is a candidate of  technical sciences, and a well-known specialist in armaments and  military hardware for field PVO. He has been deputy and then  chief of armaments for field PVO of the ground forces for more  than ten years.    The rapid development of the means of aerial attack and the  great difficulties in the use of the air-defense weaponry that  has been developed for the country's PVO [air-defense] troops in  the interests of the ground forces made it necessary to create a  special branch of troops among the latter. The PVO SV [ground  forces PVO] troops were first forced to use obsolete cannon  weaponry and S-75 surface-to-air (SAM) systems. The mobility of  the ground forces increased rapidly. Their successful operations  under conditions of the continuously increasing threat from  aviation and other means of aerial attack (SVN), however,  required air-defense weaponry with completely different  characteristics. The S-75 SAM system, quite a fearsome weapon at  the beginning of the 1960s, had too little mobility. All of its  combat elements were located on trailers that required cable  communications between them. The deployment time was thus many  hours, and movement was possible only along roads.    The KS-19 and S-60 artillery systems also had insufficient  mobility and, more importantly, their effectiveness was  intolerably low against modern SVN.    The decision was made to create air-defense weaponry that  would meet the tough requirements of the ground forces. The  first was the Krug SAM system (General Designer V.P. Yefremov),  which entered service in 1965. All of the combat elements of the  system were located on highly mobile, self-propelled tracked  platforms: the acquisition and target-designation radar, the  guidance radar, and the launchers with the SAMs. The outer  boundary of the SAM lethal area was 50 km, with the altitude of  targets from 3.0 to 24.5 km. The lower boundary was brought  first to 500 meters, and then to 150 meters in later models.    The appearance of the first SAM systems in service with the  USSR and Western countries forced aircraft to adopt new tactics.  Air power was forced in particular to operate primarily at low  altitudes in the zones of powerful PVO. The Kub SAM system  (General Designer Yu.N. Figurovskiy) was created to fight air  power at low and medium altitudes.    The system has two principal combat elements--a  self-propelled vehicle with the electronics equipment, and a  launcher with self-guiding missiles. The former has the  acquisition radar, guidance radar and illumination station. It  must be said that the combination of this many stations was done  for the first time in world practice. The acquisition radar and  the guidance radar were located separately for the analogous  American Hawk SAM system. The reaction time could be reduced  markedly with the joint placement of the stations, important in  defeating low-flying targets.    The Krug SAM system began to enter service with army and  frontal air-defense missile brigades. Air-defense regiments for  the tank divisions were formed on the basis of the Kub SAM  system. A heavier and cheaper weapon was needed for the  protection of the motorized-rifle divisions. The Osa SAM system  (General Designer V.P. Yefremov) was thus created; it had all of  the elements placed on a single self-propelled platform.    This made it possible to protect troops advancing in battle  formation. It must be said that the Mauler SAM system, in which  all of the elements were also placed on a single vehicle, was  also under development in the United States for many years. The  project was not completed, however.    The lighter and cheaper Strela-1 (Chief Designer A.E.  Nudelman) and portable Strela-2 (General Designer S.P.  Nepobedimyy) SAM systems with non-radar equipment, as well as  the Shilka self-propelled AA cannon mount (Chief Designer N.A.  Astrov), were created in addition to these other types of SAM  systems for the PVO SV troops. The first two were later replaced  by the Strela-10 and Strela-3 systems respectively. The  analogous Chaparral, Redeye and Vulcan system were in service  with the U.S. Army.    The first generation of air-defense missile and artillery  weaponry for the PVO SV troops thus took shape. All of the types  of systems, aside from the Krug SAM system, were supplied for  export abroad and took part in various military conflicts, where  they proved themselves to be quite highly effective for their  time.    The further development of means of aerial attack, the  increases in their mass and types and their fitting with  electronic-warfare armaments required the creation of a new  generation of arms. The assurance of high effectiveness of this  generation of systems under the new conditions required serious  increases in the complexity of air-defense weapons, which led to  a sharp rise in their cost. It became necessary in this regard  to optimize the types of air-defense systems for the PVO SV  troops.    An entirely fair question arises--why are we discussing the  optimal types for the PVO SV, and not for all of the armed  forces? The answer to this question is both complex and simple.    First of all, the task of the necessity of developing  second-generation systems arose in the middle of the 1960s, when  the narrow departmental fragmentation even within the Ministry  of Defense was very large. It existed between the customers,  between the developers and even between scientific organizations.    Second, there was a very serious battle among the customers.    Third, quite powerful groups of developers appeared that  were  working for various customers. The various "weights" of the  customers was a circumstance of no small importance.    The leaders of PVO Strany [national PVO], as a branch of the  armed forces, had greater access to the leadership of the  Ministry of Defense and the other power structures of the USSR  than the leaders of the branches of the armed forces, the PVO  SV, and the customer, one of the directorates of the GRAU. The  conceptual model for the leadership of the PVO troops in the  creation of weaponry was for many years oriented toward fixed,  semi-mobile or, in the best case, slightly mobile equipment.  This weaponry was thus not suited to the ground forces. The  reverse was possible--the troops of the PVO Strany could take  weapons developed for the PVO SV. But this impeded ambitions and  the orientation toward "their own" developers. The task of  substantiating the optimal types was formulated as follows: find  the types of air-defense systems under which the required  protection of the force groupings with PVO is ensured, while the  cost of the air-defense systems is minimal, i.e. find  n at which C = min. The task of  defeating all types of SVN could be fundamentally resolved by a  PVO group that had only one all-purpose type of SAM system able  to defeat all targets effectively. Another extreme variation is  where a specialized type of SAM system is developed to defeat  each type of SVN. The optimal solution is located somewhere  between them, and is sought according to the criterion of  minimal cost with the aid of mathematical modeling.    The required effectiveness of PVO is determined proceeding  from the level of losses of ground forces allowable while their  fighting ability and capabilities for the successful fulfillment  of the assigned mission are still preserved.    A number of restrictions imposed on SAM systems by the  specific features of the ground forces as objects of defense are  introduced in the solution of the problem. These include  mobility, terrain passability, frequency of change of positions,  time for shutdown and deployment of the systems, resistance to  climatic factors etc.    Manned and unmanned aircraft, helicopters, ballistic and  cruise missiles, guided aerial bombs and the strike elements of  high-precision weaponry, as well as special EW and  command-and-control aircraft that are in patrol zones, were  considered as SVN.    The operational-tactical background for the solution of the  problem was taken to be repelling a mass attack by SVN in which  all types of air-defense systems take part. The efficient types  of air-defense systems were determined according to the results  of computation; each of them should provide for the defeat of a  certain set of SVN, with this set is moreover arranged in its  own priority order for each type of system. The presence in a  PVO group of air-defense systems of a certain type ensures its  stability under the conditions of exposure to EW equipment. The  development of second-generation systems was begun at the end of  the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s.    The types of air-defense systems received concrete  designations and purposes:    S-300V SAM system (General Designer V.P. Yefremov)--for  the defeat of ballistic and aeroballistic missiles, EW and  command-and-control aircraft in their patrol zones, aircraft of  strategic and tactical aviation and other types of targets;    the Buk SAM system (Chief Designer Ye.A. Pigin)--for  the defeat of aircraft of tactical and strategic aviation,  cruise missiles and other types of targets;    the Tor SAM system (General Designer V.P.  Yefremov)--for the defeat of aviation missiles and other combat  elements of high-precision weaponry, aircraft of tactical  aviation, cruise missiles and other types of targets;    the Tunguska air-defense missile and artillery system  (General Designer A.G. Shipunov)--for the defeat of combat  helicopters, aircraft of tactical aviation, cruise missiles and  unmanned equipment;    the Igla portable SAM system (General Designer S.P.  Nepobedimyy)--for self-defense against attacking SVN.    The leadership of the USSR was forced to alter some of the  procedures in the country and begin to destroy interdepartmental  barriers at the beginning of the 1970s. This was determined to  no small extent by the colossal expenditures that had to be made  for the development and production of arms. Discussions began on  the necessity of standardizing them.    Some concrete steps were also taken. These include the  creation of various Interdepartmental Coordinating Councils  (MKS). An MKS was created in particular for radar equipment. The  largest step in this regard was the decision in 1980 to transfer  the leadership of the PVO SV troops to the PVO Strany troops,  after which the latter began to be called simply the PVO Troops.    The idea of combining all of the PVO troops under a unified  command was not a bad one in and of itself. As much else that  was done here during the "era of stagnation," however, the  incarnation of the idea took on a grotesque nature. What in fact  happened?    The command and staff of field PVO were transferred to the  PVO Strany High Command. The commander of the PVO SV forces,  Colonel-General P.G. Levchenko, was named commander of field PVO  and first deputy commander-in-chief of the PVO Troops. Some  structural changes were made in the PVO staffs of the military  districts, and substantial organizational changes were made in  the PVO Strany troops. The various customers for PVO weaponry,  however--the PVO GUV [Main Armaments Directorate] for the PVO  Strany troops, the GRAU Directorate for field PVO--and the  arsenals and bases remained under various departments. A  paradoxical situation arose in the ground forces--the field PVO  formations were part of the motorized-rifle and tank regiments,  motorized-rifle and tank divisions and armies and, naturally,  were subordinate to the corresponding commanders and the  commander of the ground forces.    Many questions of the administration of these formations, at  the same time, were in the hands of the command of the PVO  Strany troops. This situation brought harm to everyone. The  commands began to be regarded as alien to the PVO formations in  the ground forces in a number of cases, and a large portion of  the housekeeping and other unpleasant work began to be passed on  to them. The most complex PVO military hardware, after all, is  in the ground forces--this is PVO hardware, and it requires  well-trained and professionally prepared people. The command of  field PVO, on the other hand, remained an alien body to the  leaders of the PVO Troops. The commander of the field PVO was  only nominally named first deputy commander-in-chief. All of  this caused great harm, which became obvious to the leadership  of the Ministry of Defense as well.    The leadership of the field PVO was thus returned to the  ground forces in 1986.    Some positive aspects of the attempt to combine PVO should  be  noted for the sake of fairness. These are, first and foremost,  the substantial destruction of interdepartmental barriers. A  number of conceptual views in the PVO Strany thus underwent  marked changes as a result. The necessity of a substantial  increase in the mobility of the weaponry and the rejection of  static weapons wherever possible was understood first of all. A  model of the Buk SAM system was ordered in which the principal  combat equipment was switched to wheeled self-propelled  vehicles, and the appearance of the S-300P system was altered  and began to look outwardly more like the S-300V system.    Russia is now in a grave economic and political state.  Spending for defense needs has been cut back sharply. Military  reform is underway, but its implementation is proceeding with  great difficulty, and the structure of the armed forces that  existed under the USSR is by and large preserved.    There are three branches of the armed forces in all of the  leading countries of the world--the ground, naval and air  forces. Each branch has its own high command, the size of which  is quite large, and is staffed to a considerable extent by  senior officers and generals. The upkeep of the high command  constitutes an appreciable share of the funds that are allocated  for the maintenance of personnel in that branch of the armed  forces. The only country in the world that permitted itself to  have five branches of the service was the USSR. When the  collapse of the Soviet Union began, it was proposed that Russia  have three branches of the armed forces. There were also to be  strategic forces unified for the whole CIS, which were expected  to include some of the structures of the PVO troops as well  (first of all the system for warning of a missile attack (SPRN)  and the system for fighting space weapons).    This decision was dictated not only by economic  considerations, but also by the great changes that have occurred  in recent years in the structure and characteristics of SVN,  first and foremost aeroballistic ones.    The share of cruise missiles, which fly principally at low  altitudes and can be defeated only at short ranges, has  increased substantially. Various RPVs are close in trajectory  and radar characteristics to aircraft in sport and agricultural  aviation on which IFF transponders have not been installed.  Sport aircraft often violate the airspace of neighboring states  and do it, as a rule, unintentionally. What should be done with  them--do they really all need to be shot down?    The characteristics of some ballistic targets have been  markedly altered. Recall the recent past, when the Pershing-2  ballistic missiles were placed in Western Europe. It turned out  at that time that the SPRN in the USSR could not ensure timely  target designation for firing on such targets.    The problems that brought about the necessity of creating  the  PVO Strany troops as a branch of the armed forces thus proved to  be largely unresolved. Those troops could not protect the entire  country, but only a certain number of targets. A whole branch of  the armed forces is probably not necessary for that.    Such structural changes naturally cannot be carried out  easily and require a certain amount of time, but they must begin  now. The funds freed up thereby are best invested in enterprises  that produce air-defense systems for the ground forces. Those  arms have already won leading positions, and could be used not  only to equip the armed forces of Russia, but could also be sold  in the international arms market. The favorable situation that  arose after the successful Mosaeroshow-92 weapons show and the  Oborona-92 exercises, as well as the results of the IDEX-92  weapons show in Abu Dhabi, must be utilized.    The funds invested in the production of air-defense weapons  for the ground forces (the S-300V, Buk, Tor, Tunguska and Igla  systems) could very quickly repay themselves a hundred times  over. The decision needs to be made quickly, however. If the  funds are not invested now, this year, the leading positions of  Russia in air-defense weaponry will quickly be lost, and the  market competitiveness of our air-defense weapons in the world  market will be gone.

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Blair to review voluntary sector Mr Tony Blair last night ordered a thorough review of Labour's policies on the voluntary sector, saying he wanted to propose 'a new deal' between voluntary organisations and the government. The Labour leader called for a middle path between the left's old belief in state intervention and the right's view that voluntary bodies relieved the government of its own responsibilities. Labour had learnt from the mistakes of the past. 'The state does not have the solution to every problem. Nor do people want the state to intervene in all areas of life,' he said. Offering one or two hints as to what the conclusions of the review might be, Mr Blair said the proposed new deal must be based on a recognition that the voluntary sector was not a 'cut-price alternative to statutory provision'. 'Why should the state provide all the training for the unemployed when voluntary organisations in many cases are providing innovative schemes,' he said. The review is to be conducted by Mr Alun Michael, the shadow home affairs minister, a staunch Blair loyalist.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Tharsis applies for listing cancellation Tharsis, the Glasgow-based group mainly involved in property development in Spain, has applied to the Stock Exchange for a cancellation of its listing and permission to deal in its shares under Rule 535.2. The rules of the Exchange require that at least 25 per cent of a company's shares must remain in the hands of the public. Tharsis said that Inpec had recently acquired a further 462,190 shares in the company, bringing its holding to 1.26m or 48.36 per cent. Following that purchase, some 83.7 per cent of the company's shares are held by five shareholders. It said that the recent low number of transactions in its shares was a further indication that the company's listing was no longer appropriate or cost effective. Dealings under Rule 535.2 are expected to begin on May 24. Allied Provincial Securities are the company's broker.</p>

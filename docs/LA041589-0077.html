			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND DON'T FORGET THAT KOUFAX WENT OUT ON TOP  </P> <P> Jim Murray, in an otherwise excellent column on Parnelli Jones quitting racing  at the peak of his career, says that "Only one other man, also a Jones -- Bobby  -- had ever quit at the height of his powers in this way."  </P> <P> But Murray seems to have missed another one who quit at the top. Try this: a  three-time Cy Young Award winner in his last four years in the majors. In these  four years, his records were 25-5, 19-5, 26-8 and 27-9. The ERAs were 1.88,  1.74, 2.04 and 1.73. In each of his last two years, he had more than 300  innings pitched and more than 300 strikeouts.  </P> <P> During these four years he won four World Series games and lost two. In the  Series at one point he had 27 consecutive shutout innings.  </P> <P> In his final official major league (World Series) game, his center fielder made  three errors in one inning, two of them on one play. In the four-game Series,  his teammates amassed 14 hits and two runs. They ended the Series with 33  scoreless innings in support of their pitchers.  </P> <P> The (final year): 1966.  </P> <P> The pitcher: Sandy Koufax.  </P> <P> His age: 30.  </P> <P> LARRY BERG  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

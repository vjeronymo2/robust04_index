			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: Music Anonymous 4, the all-American female group who sing early unaccompanied vocal music, turn to a collection of 13th century courtly love texts for their latest offering, Love's Illusion (harmonia mundi). The verses, chosen from the Montpellier Codex, the richest single source of French polyphony, are all based on two simple precepts: that true love may exist only outside of marriage and that a man must subject himself totally to the will of his beloved, no matter how irrational it may seem. It sounds subversive, and not a little dangerous, to me, but the texts are beautifully sung and the packaging exemplary. Anonymous 4 make their first-ever British appearance at St John's, Smith Square on September 27. Not much courtly love on Robert Palmer's new album Honey (EMI), but followers of the smoothie's career will not be surprised to see him adorned by yet another beautiful woman on the unimaginative sleeve. The music itself is a welcome return to form for Palmer after a few years of self-indulgent experimentation, drawing on a rich variety of musical styles and driven relentlessly by Nuno (Extreme) Bettencourt's cutting guitar. Amanda Roocroft is a young British soprano who has refused to play safe in compiling the material for her debut album on EMI, preferring to stretch her repertoire all the way from Handel to Richard Strauss, taking in Mozart (her strongest performances), Puccini and Verdi along the way. Franz Welser-Most conducts the London Philharmonic in accompaniment. Swing Out Sister attempt to join the Four Weddings and a Funeral bandwagon of monstrous success with the release of their version of the Delfonics' La La (Means I Love You) from the movie soundtrack. It also features on the band's new album, The Living Return (Mercury), a happy enough slice of jazz-funky languor which, I can't help thinking, should have been released in time for the summer - it's that kind of sound. Bad idea of the week: If I Were a Carpenter (A&amp;M), an 'alternative, irreverent' tribute album to the torpid duo featuring American Music Club, The Cranberries, Sonic Youth and others. One can take 1970s nostalgia several steps too far. Even worse is Balearico (Mercury), a 'house-style, hi-NRG adaptation' of Ravel's Bolero. It has come from the night clubs of Ibiza, and should have stayed there.</p>

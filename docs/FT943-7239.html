			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Graseby blames end of cold war for unchanged Pounds 4.96m Graseby, the electronics group, yesterday blamed flat first half profits on falling demand for its defence equipment following the break up of the Soviet Union and end of the cold war. A weak performance by the technology division, which makes detection systems for explosives and chemical weapons, held pre-tax profits at Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 4.87m) as group sales slid from Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 47.4m. Worsening defence sales relegated the division from being the best-performing business to the worst with operating profits down from Pounds 2.66m to Pounds 1.05m. However, that was offset by improved figures from the medical, environmental and product monitoring businesses. 'We have great growth prospects in these three divisions and they will be the key to our future,' said Mr Paul Lester, chief executive. Medical showed the sharpest improvement with operating profits increasing 83 per cent to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.01m), helped by buoyant hospital demand for its drug delivery systems. The division claimed that its latest product, a pocket size infusion pump, could generate sales of Pounds 20m over the next five years. The product monitoring division saw operating profits increase 69 per cent to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 1.16m) following UK cost-cutting and a five-month contribution from Graseby Best. Sales of emission monitoring equipment, meanwhile, lifted profits in the environmental division from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.43m. The group benefited from sharply reduced net interest payments of Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 799,000) as borrowing fell from Pounds 26.7m at the 1993 year end to Pounds 13.9m, for gearing of 53 per cent. Earnings per share were flat at 5.8p (5.7p) and, as previously announced, the interim dividend is reduced to 2.7p (3.3p). The total dividend is expected to be unchanged at 6.6p.</p>

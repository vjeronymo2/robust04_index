			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Management: Cupid's arrow across the desk - Lucy Kellaway on reactions when colleagues fall in love What do Bill Clinton and Bill Gates have in common apart from being at the top of their respective trees and having the same first name? Both are married to colleagues. They are members of a club that includes Anita Roddick of Body Shop, Michael Green of Carlton Communications, and Derek Bonham of Hanson on its rapidly growing membership list. Some couples met through their work, some met first and then found a job for their partner, and some set up a business together. All are evidence of the same trend: business and pleasure are being mixed on a scale never seen before. A recent survey by Alfred Marks employment agency shows that 60 per cent of employees have had an office romance, and half of these ended in wedlock or in cohabitation. A similar study in the US suggests a staggering 70 per cent of a cross-section of employees have had a relationship with a colleague. In the old days bosses dated secretaries. As greater numbers of women are working in increasingly senior positions, men are marrying their equals at work. At British Airways, pilots used to wed air hostesses, yet next month the first husband and wife team of captains will be created when Jenny Fray and Steve Pock get married. Traditionally, an office marriage was a signal for one partner to leave the company. Now there is less pressure to choose between job and spouse. Melinda French, who married Bill Gates, evidently feels no conflict between being the boss's wife and being a Microsoft manager. She is carrying on with the company as before. Work romances are a mixed blessing for companies. 'These relationships are an extra complication in the working environment,' says Susan Bloch of career consultants GHN. 'Companies need to be very sensitive about it or they can get into a mess.' Many companies say there is no policy because there is no problem. But research from Strathclyde Business School suggests that middle and senior managers in UK companies still disapprove of office affairs. Companies that decide to take the ultimate sanction and fire one or other partner may be breaking the law. An office romance can only be grounds for dismissal if the employee's conduct is disruptive, or threatens to harm the employer's business. If a couple marry, one partner can only be dismissed if it can be proved that their continued employment would be impracticable, and the rules forbidding marriage are both reasonable and clear. An industrial tribunal recently upheld the dismissal of a senior manager of a small UK company called Alarmco. He had been engaging in bizarre feats including a toast and jam fight with his secretary, with whom he was having an affair. In another case Ann Tomen, a marketing assistant with Irish Bonding, was fired after her husband, who also worked there, left to work for a competitor. She contested the case, but a tribunal ruled that her sacking was fair. Despite romances that end in tears, most office affairs cause little trouble. The majority view among UK companies is that relationships between members of staff are both inevitable and beyond the scope of corporate involvement. NatWest is typical in having no policies at all. 'It's just not a problem,' says the company. At the other extreme are some US corporations which forbid employees from dating. According to Michael Rubenstein, editor of Equal Opportunities Review, some companies have taken this route to protect themselves from litigation. He says office romances raise several thorny issues for businesses. The first is sexual harassment. 'The concern is that if you have a relationship that goes wrong, and one party wants to continue, you have a ready-made case of sexual harassment,' he says. A further problem is conflict of interest. This can arise if the couple work closely together. Some employers think this problem sufficiently serious to have rules to keep couples apart. At Arthur Andersen couples are not allowed to work in the same business unit. 'The basic policy is that partners should never be in the position where one supervises the progress of another,' says the company, adding that the rule applies not just to couples but to members of the same family. McGraw Hill takes a slightly more flexible approach. 'We deal with every situation on its merits. Where there may be a potential conflict, we review it,' the company says. 'It is an issue if the man is married to someone more junior in the department, and others think the partner is getting more favourable treatment. If that person isn't a good performer, it could be harder for their husband to talk to them.' For most companies there is much to be said for doing nothing. 'We know that people are more likely to meet their partners at work than anywhere else. Usually it means more loyalty not less,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Management. 'The only time there is a problem is when people fall out. If that creates an atmosphere it should be dealt with under normal performance management techniques.' There is some evidence that couples can be an asset rather than a potential problem. American research shows that morale and absenteeism improve when a workplace romance is in full swing. David Norburn, director of the Management School at Imperial College and his wife Sue Birley are a veteran career couple. Over the past 23 years they have held jobs together at six different business schools and universities, but found some more accommodating than others. 'A bad response is the fear factor of the power of two people working together. A good response is that a couple gets up to speed more quickly. One plus one equals more than two,' says Norburn. In his latest job at Imperial, he is her direct boss. He admits that there is a danger that some colleagues could suspect favouritism, just as there is a similar risk that he might be unfairly severe on her. He thinks these problems are minor compared to the advantages. 'The real plus is that you can gossip about the same people.' Others might complain that dinner at home is not much different to lunch in the staff canteen.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / BICC in Pounds 55m US power cable deal BICC, the UK-based cables and construction group, yesterday announced a Pounds 55m deal which will double its share of the power cable market in North America. BICC Cables, the group's North American subsidiary, has provisionally agreed to buy the electrical division of Reynolds Metals, a leading maker of transmission and distribution cables in the US and Canada. Reynolds' electrical division employs 900 people in factories in Washington State, Texas and Arkansas in the US, and LaMalbaie in Quebec, Canada. No decision has been made on how many people will transfer to BICC. BICC's purchase is in line with the strategy outlined when making a Pounds 154m rights issue last month. It said companies in the fragmented and recession-hit North American cable industry could now be bought cheaply. The UK group itself suffered from the downturn. In March BICC described its slide last year from an annual profit of Pounds 24m in North America to a loss of Pounds 3m as the group's 'biggest single disappointment'. Reynolds does not disclose profits on the Dollars 200m annual sales by its electrical division, but said the disposal would have no material effect on its operating results. Although the deal will double BICC's share of the North American cable market to about 25 per cent, the UK group said it did not expect to face any regulatory obstacles. As part of the transaction, Reynolds will have a long-term agreement to supply BICC with aluminium redraw rods from its new rod mill in Becancour, Quebec. BICC Cables intends to integrate the Reynolds US operations with its Cablec Utility Cable company in the US and the Quebec operation with the utilities division of Phillips Cables. BICC Cables has 17 North American plants with 3,200 employees. BICC announced the sale to private investors of Metal Manufactures Construction, the group's loss-making Australian electrical and mechanical engineering contracting business. The consideration of ADollars 2m (Pounds 800m) is the net book value of the business, after extraordinary provisions of about Pounds 13m taken by BICC in March.</p>

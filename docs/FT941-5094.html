			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carrefour keeps up recovery as profits double Carrefour, the largest French food retailing group, yesterday announced that it continued its recovery last year by more than doubling net profits to FFr3.01bn (Dollars 500m) in 1993 from FFr1.33bn in 1992. The group, which in 1992 suffered a sharp fall in profits, last year benefited from a steep increase in its exceptional gains. It made a windfall profit of FFr1.36bn from the FFr1.8bn placing in March of a large minority stake in Castorama, the largest French do-it-yourself chain. However, Carrefour also had to make provisions to cover the closure of two hypermarkets in Philadelphia. As a result it made total profits of FFr1.34bn on non-recurring items, against a compar-able loss of FFr4m in 1992. The group, like the rest of the French retail sector, last year experienced difficult trading conditions. Consumer spending throughout France was depressed by the combination of high interest rates and fears about rising unemployment, although sales of food and other basic items were less badly affected than other sectors. Carrefour mustered a 5.2 per cent increase in sales to FFr123.2bn in 1993 from FFr117.14bn in 1992 while profits before exceptional items rose by 24.3 per cent to FFr1.66bn from FFr1.34bn. The board proposed a dividend of FFr42 a share for the 1993 financial year, an increase over its FFr35 payment in the previous year. It also yesterday announced plans for a one-for-one scrip issue.</p>

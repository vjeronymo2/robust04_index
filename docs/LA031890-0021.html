			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** GRANT HART "INTOLERANCE" SST: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> In sharp contrast to Bob Mould's oppressive, scowling introspection, the music  of his former Husker Du teammate is a miraculous blend of the buoyant and the  brooding. The unruly Hart is like a wide-eyed, open-armed, big-hearted  prankster dancing Daffy Duck circles around the memory of a hunched-up Mould.  </P> <P> The drummer-singer's first solo album is erratic -- at times he seems to lose  interest and wander away for a while -- but his best servings of chewy,  psychedelic-textured, folk-flavored rock are the kind that stay with you. Most  notable are "All of My Senses," with a ? &amp; the Mysterians organ line that  repeats like a flashing neon sign, and "2541" -- that's the address of the  apartment where a relationship began and ended. The lyrics' detail and the  music's intensity conspire to sanctify the commonplace, as Hart makes this  piece of personal history seem touching and urgent. RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

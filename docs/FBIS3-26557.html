On the occasion of celebrating the  forthcoming Spring Festival, they talked freely, reviewing the  achievements made in reform, opening up, and the development of  the two civilizations, and airing their views on double-support  work.    Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Fei; Lieutenant  General Li Xilin, commander of the Guangzhou Military Region;  Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political commissar of the  Guangzhou Military Region; and Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin  delivered speeches at the get-together.    Comrade Xie Fei said: Guangdong Province has achieved great  success in double-support work, and is bound to make greater  progress in the new year. This is because the Army units and  local authorities share same objectives and interests: To  strive for the motherland's prosperity and to defend it against  foreign bullying and humiliation. Xie Fei noted: The  harmonious relations between the Army units and the government,  and between the Army units and the public in Guangdong Province  should be attributed the fact that the leadership of the Army  units in the Guangzhou Military Region has set great store by  the work in this regard. It is hoped that in the new year the  Army units, the government, and the public can communicate with  each other better, and can help each other. Comrade Xie Fei  suggested that the three sides join to study the possibility of  running some practical, constructive projects this year so as to  further strengthen solidarity between the Army and the  government, and between the Army and the masses.    Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political commissar of the  Guangzhou Military Region, highly appreciated Guangdong  Province's performance in the drive to support the Army and give  preferential treatment to families of martyrs and servicemen.  He disclosed that the funds Guangdong Province appropriated  only to finance the operation of local Army units last year  totaled 162 million yuan. On behalf of the Army units stationed  in Guangdong, he expressed heartfelt thanks to the party and  government organs at all levels, as well as the people of  Guangdong Province.</p>

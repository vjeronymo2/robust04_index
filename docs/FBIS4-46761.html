			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. Bakhritdinov, head of the environmental </F> laboratory of the department of geography of the Uzbek Academy  of Sciences, and E. Chembarisov, head of the laboratory of  hydrochemistry of the Institute of Water Problems: "The Desert  Is Diminishing, and We Are the Losers"]    [Text] The desert zone of Central Asia, including the  territory of Uzbekistan, has enormous reserves which at present  are far from being fully utilized. What the desert zone  encompasses can be clarified by this simple calculation: of the  44.9 million hectares of territory in Uzbekistan the area of  irrigated lands is about 4.2 million, while pastures used in  agricultural production account for 22 million hectares.    Desert pasturelands account for 82 percent of the total  balance of agricultural lands in Uzbekistan. In recent years  more than 9.2 million sheep have been kept on them, including  5.1 million karakul sheep, as well as more than 823,000 goats  and several thousand camels. In addition to receiving karakul  lamb hides pasture sheep herding in the desert produces tens of  thousands of tons of meat and wool each year. The enormous role  of this sector in the republic economy is perfectly obvious.    In recent decades the anthropogenic impact on desert zones  has been increasingly felt. This is reflected first of all in  the water arteries of the arid territories. As an analysis that  was made indicates, the primary rivers of the desert--the  Amudarya, Zarafshan, and Kashkadarya--are contaminated to one  degree or another. Phenols, petroleum products, pesticides, and  other elements have been detected in river waters. Contamination  of water around the large cities has increased especially in  connection with the discharges of industrial enterprises.    In the large cities ecology problems are linked primarily  with the growing concentration of production. Contamination of  the natural environment of rural settlements is somewhat  different. As a rule there are no large industrial enterprises  in the towns and villages, the density of housing construction  is three-five times less, transportation arteries are less  dense, and there is lower overall saturation with motor  vehicles. But the ecological situation around towns and villages  has also been worsening in recent times. The impact of the city  on the environment is manifested in development of nearby land  for suburban gardens, recreation zones, trunk transportation  routes, and the like. But it is seen particularly in pollution  from industrial discharges into the atmosphere and streams. The  greatest anthropogenic stress falls on the most heavily  settle--but small in land area--Chimbayskiy Rayon in  Karakalpakia and the Khorezm region.    So intensive development of the desert pasture territory of  Uzbekistan intensified the anthropogenic stress on the desert  ecosystems of our republic. We need to determine the precise  data on the location and chemical composition of underground  waters, the efficiency of methods of opening up underground  waters by drilling wells, transporting water with pumping  pipelines and in tankers, the use of small desalinization units  to supply water to the population, improving techniques of  freshening mineralized springs with atmospheric precipitation,  and ways to raise water using electrical drive operating on wind  and solar energy. It is essential for regeneration of the desert  pasture zone to compile a long-range prognosis of the  intensification of desertification under the anthropogenic  influence, broken down by physico-geographic regions. And the  approach to further development of land resources within  geosystems should be differentiated here and city planning  policies must be straightened out with due regard for how  favorable the ecological situation is and the degree of  anthropogenic stress on their territories.    Therefore it is especially important and fundamental--both  for its ecological and its economic significance--to put on the  agenda of the upcoming session of the Supreme Soviet discussion  of amendments and additions to certain legislative enactments of  the Republic of Uzbekistan in connection with adoption of the  Law on Environmental Protection and the Law on Specially  Protected Natural Areas.</p>

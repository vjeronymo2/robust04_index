			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bhushan Marwah of THE HINDUSTAN TIMES: </F> "India's 45th Republic Day"]    [Text] India has taken a confident stride toward its 45th  Republic Day [26 Jan] as a country with more respect in the  community of nations, better political stability, and  substantially liberalized foreign trade as well as domestic  economy.    In the international relations, India has continued to  strive  for better relations with other countries, particularly its  neighbors; and barring Pakistan, it has met with a tremendous  success in building up realistic, mutually respectful, and  economically cooperative relationship with all the countries,  more so with its immediate neighbors. Even with Pakistan, India  has been all along keen to normalize its ties and have a  mutually beneficial economic and cultural exchange. However,  Pakistan's attitude has been grossly unreasonable, aggressively  chauvinistic, and designed to malign this country. The  Interservices Intelligence, ISI, of Pakistan has been aiding and  abetting terrorist activities as well as current of separatism  in Kashmir, Punjab, and the eastern parts of this country. The  latest reports suggest that Pakistan is preparing more than  10,000 Afghan mojahedin to push them into the Kashmir Valley to  escalate militancy-related violence in the valley in its bid to  continue disturbance in the state. Unnerved by the success of  the security forces in their anti-militancy operations in recent  months in Kashmir, Pakistan has evidently drawn this massive  plan to push in more trained militants to further boost the  otherwise sagging morale of the militants in the valley.    Surprisingly, the United States of America is not only  turning a blind eye to all this, President Clinton has lately  made biased and misinformed remarks on Kashmir, Punjab, and  perceived abuse of human rights in this country. His remarks on  Punjab on finding a solution to protect Sikhs' rights are not  only uncharitable but also negate the very structure of  secularism on which Indian polity and society are based. It  goes contrary to the fabric of Indian Constitution where it is  enshrined that in this country, everybody's right is protected  irrespective of his caste, color and, creed. Predictably, India  has taken strong exception to U.S. President's observation on  Punjab and rejected the statement which speaks of a solution  that protects Sikhs' rights. It should be abundantly clear to  USA and, indeed, rest of the civilized world, that India's  commitment to human rights and democracy is axiomatic [as heard]  to India's existence. At the same time, this country does not  accept external prescriptions in this regard. India hopes that  the United States, as another democracy, will value India's  policy of secularism and democracy and make more positive moves  in the context of India's amiable and meaningful relations.  [sentence as heard]    Happily, India has appreciated the economic and political  stability in today's world as a driving force in international  relations. India has responded remarkably to the increasing  globalization of economic process through a wide-ranging program  of economic reforms. In a short period of about two and half  years, major reforms have been undertaken in industrial policy,  foreign trade and exchange rate policies, taxation policies, and  the financial sector. The basic medium-term objective of these  policies is to lay the foundation for sustained growth of output  and employment in the context of increasing global  competitiveness of the Indian economy. The country is expected  to receive around $2 billion in nondebt-creating flows of  foreign investment this year. Equity issues abroad by Indian  companies have been highly successful. This year, agriculture  is expected to receive 2 to 3 percent growth. Interestingly, a  U.S.-based economic forecasting company, the (?Wharton) Economic  Forecasting Association, WEFA, has projected India's real GDP  [gross domestic product] to grow by 5.6 percent in 1994. With  an increase in net exports and agricultural incomes, the growth  is predicted to be 6.1 percent in 1995. These projections are  based on the findings of a study that merchandise exports will  rise by 18.6 percent in 1993.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE BOTH Royal Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum report their second quarter results on Thursday. Shell is expected to show a healthy rise in current cost net income from Pounds 516m to about Pounds 760m. Results will have benefited from a weaker pound, stronger natural gas prices in the US, cost-cutting and solid performances from non-OECD countries. The biggest question now hangs over the dividend payment, which will not be announced until September 18. This time last year BP announced a dividend cut and Pounds 835m of post-tax exceptional restructuring provisions. For the latest quarter, analysts are looking for replacement cost net income of Pounds 240m with a dividend of 2.1p. Abbey National is expected to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 315m after bad debt provisions of some Pounds 160m when it reports its interim results today. It is expected to be hit by provisions on French operations, but show strong mortgage lending in the first half. Tomorrow National Westminster is expected to show profits in the range of Pounds 280m-Pounds 350m with a strong performance anticipated from treasury and capital markets. The bank is likely to cover its interim dividend for the first time since 1989. Midland, whose parent bank HSBC Holdings reports on August 31, is expected to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 200m on Wednesday, while Barclays on Thursday is expected to show recovery from losses last year to pre-tax profit of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 170m. The interims from Reed Elsevier, the international publishing and information group on Thursday are the first combined results since the merger of Reed International and the Dutch publishers Elsevier took effect at the beginning of the year. That and a change of year end appears to have made City analysts wary of issuing firm forecasts but James Capel is looking for combined pre-tax profits of Pounds 287m compared with Pounds 247m last year. GKN's interim results, to be announced on Wednesday, are expected to reflect at least partly the very tough times now being experienced in the Continental motor industry, where vehicle markets have plunged by up to one third this year. But analysts don't expect too sharp a fall-off from last year's Pounds 65.1m pre-tax, thanks to a continuing effective onslaught on costs, still buoyant UK production and increasing market share for key products like constant velocity joints. The following day TI, the specialist engineering group, is expected to report interim profits of a little more than Pounds 60m. The market will be concentrating on the recently announced Dowty aerospace division's new venture with Messier-Bugatti of France and Dowty's overall performance in a difficult market.

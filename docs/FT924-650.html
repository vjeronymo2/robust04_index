			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Arts: Lully's 'Armide' goes abstract - Opera in Paris Following last year's successful and enjoyable Alceste, the cycle of Lully operas at the Theatre de Champs-Elysees in Paris continued with his Armide - the last of the series of tragedies lyriques written with his eminent librettist Quinault. Lully died in 1687, one year after the first production. Owing to the king's absence this took place not privately at Versailles but publicly in Paris. Quinault died after one more year. The climate of taste was changing. Classical and mythological subjects were giving way to medieval chivalry. At court the influence of the pleasure-loving Mme de Montespan was waning. The increasingly powerful Mme de Maintenon, whom Louis XIV had secretly married, was by comparison austere: pleasure was under a cloud. The change is reflected in the tone of Armide. I doubt, though, if the historical background had much if any influence on the producers of Armide, Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser, responsible for last year's Iphigenie en Tauride at Cardiff. Caurier and Leiser turned their backs firmly and a little prudishly on the sumptuous, enjoyable and illuminating baroque richness of their predecessors' Alceste. In their programme note they rightly stress the vital role of dancing in the choreographer-composer Lully's theatre works. But it is absurd to deny the equally vital role of spectacle, 'machines' included. The sum of his great gifts made Lully a super-entertainer, and 'entertainement' on such a level need not exclude serious subjects or deep feelings. The decors by Christian Fenouillat are based on abstract painted cloths of the kind once popular for 'symphonic' ballet. They leave plenty of room for the dancers but the general effect is dusty and dispiriting. The prospect in the heathen sorceress Armide's magic realm that so enchants the besotted Crusader knight Renaud consists of tall dark grey panels shifted round against a gloomy background - Hades as imagined by a modern Gordon Craig. At the end of the opera, when Armide realises she has lost her lover, a slatted curtain is let down to which she bravely clings and is raised high enough to show her palace in flames behind her. But all we saw of that palace was a single panel painted streakily like fishmonger's marble. Costumes by Elizabeth Neumuller were vaguely modern from flapperdom to New Look skirts, with an emphasis on old-style sports clothes (had someone remembered that the Debussy-Nijinsky tennis ballet Jeux was first given in this theatre?). That at least gave some indication of Renaud's physical prowess - there was very little to suggest a Holy War and next to nothing of the Gorgeous Middle East. But then the producers avowedly shun anything 'anecdotal' like the plague. The choreography by Stephanie Aubin was uneventful, unmemorable 'modern dance'. The dancers' and singers' movement was unusually well integrated. The good-looking dancers of the small Compagnie Larsen, like everyone else in this production, were thoroughly prepared - this co-production with Flemish Opera had already been seen at Antwerp. The singing and playing of the Chapelle Royale (with the Collegium vocale from Ghent) gave continuous pleasure. The expert conductor was Philippe Herreweghe, in livelier, more authoritative form than in his recording of the opera a few years back - the fourth act, omitted then, was included this time. The Armide, Sylvie Brunet, is a strong performer who knows how to shape and form Lully's varied, subtle and highly expressive phrases. Above a certain level the voice took on a shrill vibrato inappropriate for such an irresistible seductiveness, and she sometimes sang below the note. She was not helped by nondescript garments. Some but not enough of her words were clear. The best singing and declamation came from the Renaud of that good artist Howard Crook, whose light tenor carried easily in this large theatre. Gilles Ragou and Bernard Deletre as the two paladins sent to bring Renaud back to the path of duty, had the best of this opera's subdued comic scenes. As Hate, John Hancock appeared as a dyspeptic-looking gent in evening dress, his supporting demons wearing white surplices over black trousers. At the last of the six performances there was a full house, deeply attentive and enthusiastic except when the production team took their curtain call, when the usual and by now rather stale pandemonium broke out. Although I believe this self-conscious effort to avoid theatrical archaeology to be misguided and find the visual appeal unsuitably dreary, this Armide was a serious, consistent piece of work, ably carried through. There is more than one way of treating Lully on the modern stage. Next year the admirable series promise Roland with Jose van Dam.

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Energy market plans scaled down LARGE industrial users of gas and electricity should be the principal beneficiaries of controversial plans to open up the European energy market to greater competition. The plans, which are likely to be approved by the European Commission on Wednesday, have been watered down since last summer, partly to win the support of some sceptical commissioners and member states. However, they will be fiercely opposed by the gas and electricity industries. If approved, the draft directives will enable users of more than 100 GW/hours of electricity a year, or more than 25m cubic metres of gas annually, to buy their energy from suppliers anywhere in the Community from January 1, 1993, subject to capacity being available. The threshold should apply to heavy users of gas, such as fertiliser and chemical plants, and electricity consumers ranging from the largest aluminium and steel factories down to glass-making. In theory, larger energy distributors would also be able to pick suppliers outside their home country, thus passing on the benefits of competition to smaller consumers. The plans would also allow competing companies to generate electricity and build power lines and gas pipelines, and would insist on separating the management and accounting of integrated production, transmission and distribution operations. Regulation would largely be left to each state. The first stage of energy liberalisation has already been introduced, in the form of two directives forcing utilities to allow the transport of gas and electricity across EC borders. Brussels officials hope this second stage will prompt industrial users not covered by the new directives to press for further opening of access to energy networks. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, EC energy commissioner, decided to adopt a phased approach last autumn, dropping more aggressive plans to use special legal powers to break energy monopolies. He has now discussed the new ideas with all 12 EC energy ministers. 'It was much easier to sell the idea in this form; and in three or four countries we were surprised to receive a favourable reception when beforehand it was more difficult,' he said last week. But some member states - most notably the Netherlands and Germany which are protective of their gas producers - and the industries themselves will fight attempts to push for increased third party access to networks.</p>

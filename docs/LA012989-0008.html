			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "The Dick Van Dyke Show" is currently airing on KDOC Channel 56, and I couldn't  be happier. A special note of appreciation is due KDOC because the episodes are  being shown without any editing for additional commercials.  </P> <P> Kevin C. Fawley, Anaheim  </P></p>

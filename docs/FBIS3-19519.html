The White  House, where Whitewater has reached a threatening level, is  adopting the second method lately -- forward defense.  Nominating old Washington insider Lloyd Cutler as the successor  of resigned legal adviser Bernard Nussbaum was such a sortie;  the second one was made by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had so  far been unusually quiet in the Whitewater affair. In several  interviews with news magazines, the president's wife defended  herself against criticism of her.    It is not so much the content of these interviews that is  remarkable. Although Mrs. Rodham Clinton admits having made  certain mistakes (especially the mistake of having participated  in the dubious estate project at all), she keeps insisting that  neither she nor her husband did anything wrong or even unlawful.  She regards the affair primarily as a campaign by political  opponents aiming at undermining the First Couple's credibility.  This line of defense is well known. What is new, however, is  that criticism is concentrating more and more on the First Lady  -- and this is why her interview offensive is like a curious  spectacle featuring a besieged person that is forced to do a  sortie.    Mrs. Rodham Clinton is under fire for three reasons. First,  she was the Clinton family's acting part in the Whitewater  business. Second, she seems to have been one of the main  protagonists in the failed attempt to limit the damage to the  White House (she and her confidante Nussbaum tried to prevent  the appointment of a special attorney up to the last minute).  Third -- and this does her the greatest harm -- public  admiration of how she redefined the role of First Lady has  turned into criticism of exactly this redefinition.    Bill Clinton's wife is the president's most influential  adviser in many domestic policy issues. In the central part of  Clinton's agenda of reforms, the health insurance reform,  Hillary Rodham Clinton had the position of a top politician that  had neither been elected nor appointed. Admittedly, there were  other president's wives before her, such as Eleanor Roosevelt or  Rosalynn Carter, who considered the role of First Lady to be  more than a mere hostess and smiling benefactress. But never  before in this century did the White House see a wife as  cogovernor.    Up until the Whitewater affair, this was not considered as  suspicious. Quite the contrary, the media, which form the image  of a presidency, praised Hillary Rodham Clinton as a  revolutionary who perfectly embodies the changing role of women  in America. For a long time, the wife was more popular than her  husband. Surprisingly, hardly anyone wondered how Mrs. Rodham  Clinton could be considered a shining example of emancipation,  although she owes her present position exclusively to the fact  that she is married to a man who was elected president. Putting  it provocatively, one could say that she won her top position in  a highly "unemancipated" way: through marriage.    This is not meant to detract from Hillary Rodham Clinton's  achievements or even qualifications. As an attorney, she proved  again and again that success in one's job does not have anything  to do with one's sex or marital status. Like so many other  women, she also had to bear the additional burden of having to  stand her ground in a world that is still dominated by men.  Maybe it is part of the burden that the empire is now fighting  back: Bill Clinton is asked how he could let the mistakes  happen. But his wife is asked what she is doing in a position  where she could make such mistakes.</p>

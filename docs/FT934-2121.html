			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Amberley back in black with Pounds 21,000 Amberley Group, the USM-quoted building services concern, swung back into the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 21,000 in the six months to September 30. The recovery was struck on turnover of Pounds 2.14m and compared with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 79,000 from turnover of Pounds 1.62m last time. Earnings per share came out at 0.22p (1.44p losses). As in previous years there is no interim dividend, but as a result of the increased size of the company this policy was under review, said Mr Leek.</p>

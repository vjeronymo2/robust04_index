			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 7. Composite Performance Presentations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Rule 4.21(a)(4)(iv) currently permits the performance of pools operated by each person for whom performance is required to be disclosed to be presented on a composite basis provided that the performance of the pool offered is separately disclosed, the CPO describes how each composite was developed, and the composite is not misleading. Rule 4.31 also permits composite presentation of the performance of accounts directed by the CTA and each of its principals provided that material differences among the accounts and the manner in which the composite was developed are described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Composite presentations have the obvious advantage of reducing the volume of past performance data presented. However, composite presentations raise a number of regulatory concerns precisely because they supplant individualized presentations of potentially quite different types of pools and trading programs and may smooth or camouflage actual rates of return. Composite results not only fail to reflect differences among the pools and accounts whose results are presented but also merge potentially disparate trading results into average trading results and thus fail to reflect the actual dispersion of returns as well as the volatility of individual pools and accounts. For these reasons, the Commission considered prohibiting the use of composite performance data for pools as well as accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has carefully considered the benefits and disadvantages that may accrue from the use of composites and is proposing an approach designed to realize the benefits of reducing the volume of performance data created by the use of composites while reducing the potential for misleading result presentations. Under the proposal, past performance data for the pool offered and pools similar to the pool offered would be required to be separately disclosed. Pools of a different type from the pool offered would be permitted to be presented in composites with other pools of the same type, provided that such presentations would not be misleading. Pools would be considered to be of a different type or category if they differed in material respects. The proposed rule delineates several types of material distinctions among pools for this purpose, including the following: Pools privately offered pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities Act and public pools; pools traded with materially different leverages; limited risk pools and non-limited risk pools; pools using different commodity or trading methodologies; and multi-advisor pools <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  and non-multi-advisor pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 4.10(h) would define the term ``multi-advisor pool'' as a pool in which no CTA is allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's aggregate initial margin and premiums for futures and commodity option contracts and no investee pool is allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A pool could be included in a composite with another pool only if both pools were of the same type with respect to each of these categories. For example, a publicly offered non-multi-advisor pool could not be included in the same composite as a privately offered non-multi-advisor pool and two limited risk pools that used different trading programs or materially different degrees of leverage could not be included in the same composite. Moreover, there may be instances in which even composites of pools of the same type may be misleading, such as where differences between the trading results of the pools are so great that a composite would materially distort their results. For example, two publicly offered multi-advisor pools with the same CTAs could show widely disparate results unless each CTA were allocated substantially the same portion of each pool's assets. Also, two single-advisor pools with different CTAs may achieve very different results. The proviso in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii) that results may be presented in composite form ``unless such presentation would be misleading'' is intended to assure that composites are carefully reviewed to protect against any material distortion that may result from these types of situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rules 4.25(a)(6) and 4.34(a)(2) would require that records substantiating the performance data set forth in CPO and CTA documents, respectively, and documenting the underlying calculations be maintained in accordance with Rule 1.31. Naturally, this requirement also applies with respect to composite presentations. Pursuant to proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii), a CPO must be prepared to justify the inclusion in a composite of the pool results contained therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To present capsule performance of pools in a composite, the CPO would name all pools included in the composite, set forth the categories of these pools (which, as discussed above, would be the same for each pool in the composite), including at a minimum the categories specified in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(iii), and specify the dates on which each pool commenced trading. The aggregate gross capital subscriptions would be the total subscriptions for all pools in the composite. The draw-down figures would be the worst experienced by any one of the pools included in the composite and the rate of return would be the average rate of return for all pools included. The sample capsule past performance presentation table set forth above following the discussion on capsule performance includes an example of performance presentation for pools (pools A and B, in the example) whose performance is disclosed in composite form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission requests comment as to whether the pool categories delineated in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(iii) relating to composite presentations are appropriate for purposes of limiting composite presentations and as to whether any additional categories of pools should be identified for this purpose. Comment is also requested as to the costs and benefits of a general requirement of separate rather than composite presentation of pool performance in lieu of a qualified approach of the nature proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

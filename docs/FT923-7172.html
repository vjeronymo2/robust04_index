			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / US to begin airlift to dying Somalis: Aid official says operation may run out of food within 14 days UNITED STATES military aircraft and personnel continued arriving in Kenya yesterday in preparation for the start tomorrow of the biggest airlift of food so far to millions of Somalis facing death from starvation. Reflecting the new-found urgency with which the Bush administration is treating the 'world's worse humanitarian disaster', at least 11 aircraft and between 250 and 300 military personnel will have arrived in Kenya by tomorrow evening, five days after President Bush gave the green light for an operation called 'Provide Relief'. Many of the aircraft are flying 20 hours non-stop from military bases in the US and are having to be refueled twice in mid-air. Kenyan officials yesterday complained that the US had only told them it was sending military aircraft to their territory after the first one landed on Monday. US relief officials in Kenya also appear to have been caught off guard by the speed with which the US has mobilised forces for the operation, which could eventually cost more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 105m). One senior aid official said yesterday that the aircraft might run out of food and have to be grounded until more food arrived at the port of Mombasa. At the moment there are 11,000 tonnes of food available for the airlift  - an amount which could be exhausted in two weeks if the aircraft work around the clock. Brig Gen Frank Libutti, commander of the joint task force, said in Mombasa yesterday that the airlift would get under way tomorrow, lifting the 11,000 tonnes of food to Wajir, in north-eastern Kenya. The food will initially be distributed to 300,000 Somali refugees who fled to Kenya. Later the food will be trucked across the border into Somalia to prevent further refugees pouring into Kenya. Food will also be distributed to an estimated 700,000 drought-hit Kenyans. Gen Libutti said his task force, composed of personnel from the air force, army, navy and marine corps, would evaluate the security and condition of airstrips in Somalia and would work in close collaboration with aid agencies already on the ground. Mr Fred Fisher, the head of USAID, said that 145,000 tonnes of food pledged by the US for Somalia and Kenya last week was for fiscal year 1993, which begins on October 1. The first shipments from this pledge could not be expected to arrive in Mombasa for at least two to three months. US aid officials were trying to exchange some of this pledged amount for food already held by other aid agencies, he said. Reuter adds from Washington: At least a quarter of all Somali children under the age of five are believed to have died as a result of famine and civil strife, US officials and aid organisation leaders said yesterday. . 'One-fourth of all children under five are estimated to have perished already,' said Mr Peter Davies of Interaction, a coalition of 135 relief organisations working in Somalia.</p>

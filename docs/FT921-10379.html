			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / WEU to study defence corps: Germany summons Europe's military planners GERMANY has invited all member states of the Western European Union (WEU) 'seriously interested' in setting up an integrated European defence corps to attend a brainstorming session in Bonn on February 19 and 20. The seminar will flesh out the Franco-German plan for such a unit. It will also explore the possibilities for reconciling the idea with the alternative Anglo-Italian plan for a European rapid reaction force to operate outside the Nato area. The intention is to bring together military planners to give practical substance to the Franco-German political initiative launched by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand last year. They proposed building a European corps on the basis of the existing Franco-German brigade, based in Baden-Wurttemberg, as the military arm of a future common European defence policy. It is clear that Bonn and Paris are determined to press ahead with their plan, in spite of a mixed response. Spain and Belgium have expressed a serious interest, while Britain and the Netherlands, in particular, were very sceptical, and the US was studiously non-committal. Invitations to the seminar were given last week by General Klaus Naumann, the inspector-general of the German Bundeswehr, or German armed forces, at a meeting in Bonn of the chiefs of the defence staffs of the nine WEU nations. They came together for the first time since the European Community summit in Maastricht to think through the military implications of the EC treaty on political union. The question now is which members of the WEU will attend the seminar, in the light of Gen Naumann's emphasis that they should be 'seriously interested' in the European corps idea. Officials in London suggested that some sceptical states might send 'quite low- level people to take notes.' The recent meeting of the chiefs of staff discussed three issues arising directly out of the Maastricht summit: How and when the chiefs should meet regularly, and what they could contribute to the WEU process. How the proposed planning staff at the WEU should be constituted. What the European leaders actually meant by 'forces answerable to the WEU'. Gen Naumann said that all participants were unanimous on the question that any moves to build up a 'European defence identity' must be 'complementary to and compatible with Nato's efforts.' However it is precisely that question of what would be complementary to Nato, and what would merely duplicate Nato efforts, which still divides the WEU in its efforts to forge a military identity. The Franco-German plan would duplicate Nato to the extent that the corps would operate inside the Nato area. Germany argues that its concept would involve France directly in Nato military operations, and therefore strengthen the alliance.</p>

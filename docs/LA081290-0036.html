The impressive new Huntington Hospital complex, long in  construction with love and affection, is about to be finished. Thus, a group  gathered at the Valley Hunt Club to discuss Operation Celebration scheduled for  Nov. 30. In the coterie: dinner committee chairman William Doyle, Huntington  president Dr. Allen W. Mathies Jr., Ken McCormick and Fred Allen. The good  doctor has even sent a save-the-date prescription for the night: "Disp: To have  the time of your life. Sig: To be dispensed on Nov. 30. Black tie."  </P> <P> TRUMPETS FOR TIFFANY'S: Trumpet fanfares and Tiffany jewels signaled the  upcoming 25th Sterling Anniversary Celebration of Tiffany &amp; Co. in Beverly  Hills and the store's opening at Two Rodeo Drive the week of Oct. 22.

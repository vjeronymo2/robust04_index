			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The going gets tough for Asian finance: The Bank of England's dispute with Albaraka has raised the spectre of BCCI SHEIKH Saleh Abudallah Kamel is remarkably phlegmatic for a man who has had to start repaying Pounds 83m in deposits to 10,000 depositors after an unresolved dispute with the Bank of England. 'The Bank was very tough, and I am glad about that,' he says. 'They should be tough with banks.' But the enforced suspension of his Albaraka International Bank's deposit-taking activities has raised questions about whether the Bank is being too tough with lending to Asian businesses in the wake of the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International nearly two years ago. The Albaraka situation is the latest in a series of incidents involving banks with links to Britain's Asian community. The putting into administration of the Equatorial Bank last month followed the winding up of the Mount Banking Corporation on the Bank's initiative in October. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the Bank of England's treatment of banks' lending to Asian businesses. He says it seems 'more than a coincidence' that the Bank has been so strict. The Albaraka case carries echoes of BCCI. The Bank of England appears to have believed that the Albaraka's true 'mind and management' were in Saudi Arabia although it does not operate as a bank there. The Bank seems to have feared another case of a bank not supervised adequately in any country although operating in several. As a result of BCCI, international central bank supervisors insist on banks being supervised on a consolidated basis in a 'home' country, the judgment of which other countries can rely on. The Bank insisted yesterday it had no argument with banks operating according to Islamic Sharia principles. In Albaraka's case this means not dealing in pork products or armaments. The bank also does not pay or charge interest on deposits or loans. Islamic principles are not bad for profits. Sheikh Kamel says Albaraka could not persuade Islamic banks elsewhere in the world to dilute his shareholding  -and so take a stake in Albaraka - because they make 100 per cent returns on equity compared with returns of below 10 per cent among most British banks. However, Albaraka and the Bank remain divided on whether it would be good for Albaraka to have a broader-based ownership structure. The Bank seems to have thought that this might dilute the control of Albaraka from Jeddah, and turn it into a truly British bank which could be properly supervised. Sheikh Kamel says he will try to offer a different form of ownership to the Bank by June. But he believes his sole ownership has been good for depositors because he feels a sense of responsibility towards them. Last year he injected Pounds 15m of capital. 'I am responsible for every penny if I am the only owner. If there are a thousand owners, how can any of them be truly responsible?' he says. The Sheikh also argues that the Basle principles for consolidated supervision are wrong, and that his group's 22 banks should operate independently. Sheikh Kamel says the effort to have the holding company's banks supervised from a single country, leaving the Bank to rely on foreign supervision as a 'host' country, is misguided. 'The Saudi authorities cannot control my acts in London. That is what happened in the case of BCCI,' he says. Bank of England officials believe the cases of Mount and Equatorial are wholly different, although they also operated across borders, and lent to British Asians. Both banks were affected by provisions against bad loans, which eventually led to a loss of confidence and the withdrawal of deposits. The fortunes of such banks have partly been affected by the closure of BCCI and a loss of confidence in smaller banks. The Bank last week disclosed that it had launched a series of financial 'lifeboats' in the second half of 1991 to support a number of small and medium-sized financial institutions. Whether the Bank could have performed a different role in the Mount and Equatorial closures may thus be irrelevant to the main problem: that the BCCI closure has had a damaging effect on Asian finance. The emergence of a public dispute over Albaraka is only a symptom of this difficulty.</p>

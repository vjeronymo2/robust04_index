			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (2): Why the minister stepped in - Government 'interference' at the central bank MR Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's forceful finance minister, looks almost hurt when asked if he might not have had just a tiny bit to do with the resignation of the deputy governor of the Bank of Portugal in March and the subsequent attack on the escudo in the foreign exchange markets, writes Peter Bruce. He does not quite put his hand on his heart and say 'Who, me?', but neither does he apologise for any trouble he might have caused. On Thursday March 11 Mr Braga de Macedo made a speech taking the bank to task for not paying attention to the needs of what he called the 'real economy' and for not playing a forceful enough role in lowering interest rates. Mr Antonio Borges, its popular deputy governor, immediately resigned in protest at the minister's 'interference'. At one level, the affair probably assumed more importance than it deserved. Mr Borges has not explained exactly why he left and it is assumed by some market operators in Lisbon that he may have been looking for a suitable excuse to leave the bank any way. The most ominous result, though, occurred in the foreign exchange markets, where the escudo immediately came under pressure, dropping to Es94 to the D-mark at one point. In the absence of a clear explanation, the pressure persisted. It forced short-term interbank rates up from around 13 per cent to 25 per cent at one point and, in March, intervention to support the currency cost the Bank of Portugal about 10 per cent of its non-gold foreign exchange reserves. However, the important question surrounding the affair may be whether the minister was, indeed, trying to interfere with central bank policy and, if he was, to what extent was he damaging the Bank of Portugal's reputation as an independent institution? The bank's credibility is central to the growth of Portugal's financial markets and its banking industry. The prospect of it becoming fully autonomous under the monetary union rules of the European Community holds out a vitally important promise of monetary stability for tiny Portugal. The present government has already overseen an important transfer of autonomy to the Bank of Portugal. It is no longer obliged to finance the government (by underwriting treasury bills) and, says Mr Miguel Beleza, the governor, while it could if it was thought appropriate, 'we have not thought it appropriate for the last two years'. For the moment, though, exchange rate and interest rate policy are made in conjunction with the government, meaning, probably, that the finance ministry has the final say. But, assuming the EC's efforts to forge a monetary union remain on track, the Bank of Portugal will become its own master, fully autonomous, before the end of the decade. It will (so the theory goes, at least) control monetary policy and remain the main regulator of the country's financial system. This may have been where the finance minister stepped in. He says he was not trying to force the bank to cut official interest rates but to get it to persuade commercial banks to narrow the vast gap between their prime lending rates and the high rates that small businesses have to pay for loans. 'The Bank of Portugal could do more to explain how the economy works in a time of change,' he says. 'It is part of forming a consensus.' The minister sees this political role for the central bank as an extension of four key structural measures taken by the government in the last few years to drag the country's financial system into the late 20th century: The end of the bank's obligation to finance the government. The start, last December, of full convertibility of the escudo. The decision to enter the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS last year. New banking laws which open the sector to full competition. By explaining 'how the economy works', Mr Braga de Macedo means that the bank should become involved in debates on how the banking system should respond to the crisis sweeping small and medium-sized businesses as the country teeters on the verge of recession. 'Consensus is important,' he says. 'If we are incapable of responding rapidly to the crisis we will find ourselves still at the bottom while others are recovering. There is a great deal of work for everyone to do.' Is this interference? On balance, it probably is. The question is whether it is interference in the bank's monetary policy role, or in its other task as a regulator. More likely, it is the latter. Even after full autonomy is granted to the central bank, it is unlikely to include banking regulation, where the government will still have the power to make banking law. The issue has implications for the approaching independence of central banks in Spain, France and elsewhere in the EC. If a central bank cannot be told how to behave as a guardian of monetary policy once full autonomy is achieved, will governments then try to follow Mr Braga de Macedo's lead and implicate their central banks, through their continued exposure to government as banking regulators, in the implementation of policy?</p>

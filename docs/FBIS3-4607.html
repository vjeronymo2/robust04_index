The investments were in 64 projects and represent a  94.9 percent increase over last year's January.    Since November 1988 when Korean industries began to invest  in  China, South Korean industries' investments in China totaled  999.6 million dollars in 1,104 cases as of the end of last  January.    It accounted for 13.7 percent of the total investments of  7,276.4 million dollars made by South Korean industries abroad  during the same period.    The sharply increased investment in China in the recent past  was owing to the fact that many industries have moved away from  ASEAN countries to China attracted by cheap wages and improved  investment climate there following diplomatic normalization  between Seoul and Beijing.    In contrast, investment conditions in ASEAN countries have  deteriorated lately due chiefly to sharp wage increase and  cut-throat competition among Korean industries, a business  source said.</p>

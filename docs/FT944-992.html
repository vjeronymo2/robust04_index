			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Thyssen unit and Deutsche Bahn form railway group Deutsche Bahn, Germany's state-owned railways, and Thyssen Handelsunion, the trading house of the Thyssen steel group, yesterday joined forces to form a railway cargo transport company with the aim of sharply reducing road traffic, cutting costs and speeding up delivery services. The new company, BahnTrans, will be equally owned by Deutsche Bahn and Thyssen Handelsunion, with the former providing rolling stock and the latter logistical support. Mr Heinz Durr, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, said he expected the new company to carry about 4.75m tonnes of freight a year and have turnover of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn). BahnTrans, which will be based in Berlin, will start operations early in 1995. It will operate throughout Europe. Mr Durr said he expected BahnTrans eventually to take over 70 per cent of the cargo currently delivered by road in Germany, adding that the country's congested motorways and roads could have 315,000 fewer lorries on them. Thyssen Handelsunion said that at full capacity, BahnTrans would employ more than 3,000 people. The majority of the staff would be taken from Deutsche Bahn, which is restructuring following its takeover of the east German railways, and from Thyssen Haniel Logistic, the logistics subsidiary of Thyssen Handelsunion. The announcement comes amid increasing criticism from industry, the retailing sector and environmental groups of increased traffic congestion in Germany - particularly in the five eastern states, where roads are being modernised, causing even longer delays. 'The point is that this new company will cut down costs, save time and have a positive affect on the environment,' Thyssen Handelsunion said.</p>

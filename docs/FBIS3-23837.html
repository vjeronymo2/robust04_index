			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by TRUD political commentator Vitaliy Golovachev: </F> "Prices Disobeyed the Prime Minister"]    [Text]  <H5>  Will the Government Be Able To Pull Through? </H5>   In one week the price of regular domestically produced  analgesic went up on average across the country by 15 rubles  [R]. On 1 February it cost R810 in Yakutsk, R650 in Ukhta, and  R336 in St. Petersburg (in many cities--Vorkuta, Cherepovets,  Yelets, Naberezhnyye Chelny, and others--this medicine was not  available for sale altogether). Nitroglycerin, which a person  with a heart condition must always have on him (his life may  depend on it) was not available on 1 February in the pharmacies  of Belgorod, Tambov, Astrakhan, and Norilsk. In Naberezhnyye  Chelny this medicine cost R144, and in Chita--R153.    I am leafing through a thick reference book prepared by the  Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] of Russia, which  lists prices in different cities as of 1 February. A color  television set in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk--R1 million; regular  children's cotton socks in Ulyanovsk--R800; shoe repair in  Magadan--R7,500. Of course, prices are not like this everywhere;  in other cities they are lower, but still the magnitude of the  figures is disheartening. The average price of beef is almost  R2,500 (R2,414), but in Yakutsk it costs more than R5,000, and  in Khabarovsk--about R4,000.    In Krasnoyarsk the price of butter in the stores over one  week went up by almost R600, crossing the R5,000 mark. In Kyzyl  it costs even more: R5,972 per kg; in Moscow--R7,400 at the  farmers market and R2,842 in retail trade outlets (a  R180-increase over the week).    All prices are rising, but it is especially noticeable  looking at foods that in the past used to be part of Russians'  daily nutrition. In Apatity the price of rye-wheat bread went up  by more than one-quarter over the week and now costs R525. The  average (across the country) price of 10 hen eggs exceeded  R1,000 (R1,023.70) in retail trade; at the market they cost  R1,290. A liter of milk in Severodvinsk already costs R1,000, in  Kemerovo--R790, and in Moscow R2,170 at the market and R458 in  retail trade (by now, closer to R500 and up).    These are not at all cheerful statistics. Prices rose in  January much faster than the leadership of the government had  anticipated. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in December  that in the first quarter "the rate of inflation will drop to  15-16 percent." But prices in January "disobeyed" the prime  minister and increased by 21 percent. This shows that the  economy is still sick; it has a long way to go to get healthy,  and a new wave of inflation may hit us in March-April.    It was not too long ago that statements of a number of  ministers and the deputy prime minister sounded very optimistic:  the worst is behind us, they said; inflation is receding; the  economy is on the upturn. They quoted figures to support these  contentions: in October 1993 the inflation rate was 20 percent,  in November--16 percent, and in December--13 percent. But at the  same time they somehow failed to mention that the country was  living sort of on credit, because the state moved many payouts  from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of the  current one. Which amounted to no more, no less, than R7.8  trillion (for grain delivered to state storage facilities; state  orders fulfilled by defense enterprises; payouts in the  budget-financed sphere, including back pay; etc.).    That is, the budget deficit was in a way artificially  reduced. But one cannot postpone debt repayments forever. They  have to be paid, except that now current payments will be added  to them. The amounts being mentioned now for the expense part of  the budget are in the tens of trillions rubles. This means that  with a certain time lag (a month and a half or two) a new  avalanche of money will descend on the marketplace, and prices  will start rising like yeast. It is possible that inflation in  February will slow down somewhat (to 18-19 percent), but in  March-April it may rise to 22-25 percent. And then our economy  will enter a period of new severe trials.  <H5>  There Is No `Uncle' To Keep Us Fed and Clothed </H5>   Is it possible to avoid these tribulations by conducting,  for  instance, an even tougher monetarist policy, by delaying  payments until the next quarter, and then again the next one,  or, on the contrary, by handing money out right and left? I  think that neither option is the best solution; they will only  exacerbate the ills of our economy. Until full-scale structural  restructuring begins in industry and all sectors of the national  economy, we will not see any success.    Yes, most of our goods are not competitive in the world  market. This means we have to install new technologies and  modernize shops and plants. This requires enormous money and  investors. Meanwhile, however, we cannot allow all of light  industry to grind to a halt, and "close down" domestic  agriculture. There is no "uncle" to keep us fed and clothed.    Meanwhile, production continues to decline. I will quote  perhaps the most alarming figures over the two years of reforms.  In "shock" January 1992 production declined by 15-16 percent, in  the difficult January 1993--by 17-18 percent, and in January of  the current year--by 23 percent. The solvency crisis and the  disarray in the economy provoke increasingly new rounds of  decline, and it looks as if the economy, like an aircraft out of  control, is entering a tailspin. Had the appropriations not been  used for consumption, had they not been turned into dollars and  channeled abroad but used instead for structural restructuring,  refurbishing and modernization of industry, one could at least  understand 20-percent inflation. But a new round of inflation  against the background of a deteriorating economy is too much.  Unless the government in the very near future finds effective  levers to radically change the situation, it will not survive  until the fall.    Such levers do exist. Take for example the defense complex.  The directors of many idling plants with first-class equipment  are begging (and not for the first year) for just one thing:  Tell us precisely how much military hardware will be needed for  1994, 1995, 1996, and subsequent years? There is such a  notion--mobilization capacities. This is the foundation of the  national defense. A plant director, under the threat of severe  punishment, cannot take even a bolt off an assembly line, let  alone dismantle the line itself. So shops stand idle for years  (or operate at 10 percent of capacity), and no one will take the  responsibility to decide their fate.    Another lever is to attract investors. Guarantees for  businessmen in the form of Russian real estate abroad (in the  event of loss of investment in political cataclysms) would open  the road for capital to our market, which has a skilled labor  force and ready infrastructure (buildings, communications,  etc.). There are other options as well. But so far nothing moves  beyond endless discussions, The state even has no interest in  its own enterprises as the owner, and is not conducting  structural restructuring of those that are very promising.    Meanwhile, credit liability amounted to R48 trillion as of  the beginning of the year, of which past due arrears comprise  R17 trillion. The most acute solvency crisis is in Vologda,  Leningrad, Kemerovo, Omsk, and Kamchatka Oblasts and a number of  other regions.  <H5>  Wages: Millionaires and Paupers </H5>   The solvency crisis not only paralyzes the economy--for many  Russians it means delays in labor remuneration. Of course, the  picture is far from uniform in this respect. It is one thing  when a nonstate enterprise (a potential bankrupt) accumulates  back pay because all it has is debts--this is, after all, its  problem; and it is a completely different thing when workers in  the budget-financed sphere are not paid because the state does  not keep its word and does not pay its debts.    Unfortunately, no statistics are kept as yet that separate  back pay into budget and nonbudget debt. But judging by reports  from localities, the budget debt is very substantial. Does the  government not understand that by such actions it not only  discredits itself but also provokes a rapid rise in social  tension in society? By holding back labor remuneration and thus  "slowing down" the rate of inflation with this uncivilized,  savage method, the government loses much more than it gains.    The total arrears with respect to labor remuneration in  industry, construction, and agriculture alone amounted to R766  billion as of 1 January. This means that millions of people are  making do without money, borrowing and selling their belongings.  The greatest arrears in wages have been registered by  statistical organs in Tyumen Oblast (R60 billion), Krasnoyarsk  Kray (R39 billion), Tatarstan (R35 billion), and Chelyabinsk  Oblast (R32 billion), as well as Kemerovo, Saratov, Irkutsk,  Sverdlovsk, Magadan, Volgograd, and other oblasts, and Altay  Kray.    Wages delayed by 20 or more days account for almost  three-quarters of the total amount. In many regions of Russia  wages are not paid for two months. The greatest incidence of  such occurrences is in the Central and Far Eastern regions. How  can one live without money for two months? Do they understand  this at Staraya Square and in the White House? I would propose  this experiment: hold back salaries of members of the government  for two months; perhaps then the urgency of the problem would be  more clear to the powers that be.    There are, however, instances in which wages (or part of  them) have been held back for three or even six months. Do we  need to spell out who the workers of these enterprises voted  for? All in all, 24,000 enterprises owe their workers back pay.  Among the debtors are 5,000 enterprises in industry, 4,000 in  construction, and 15,000 in agriculture (the state's  indebtedness to agriculture is the greatest).    Now let us look at how the average wage has increased over  the past year and how it was correlated with the rising prices  for goods and services. For the year as a whole prices continued  to lead this race; they increased at an anticipatory pace, but  not by much. In my calculation, over 12 months the average wage  increased 8.8-fold, and prices--9.4-fold. However, taking into  account production decline in industry (16 percent) and cutbacks  in for-pay services, the rise in wages is nevertheless excessive  and does not correspond to the product produced. That is, on the  whole Russians produced less and got paid more (even taking into  account the inflation factor). Unearned money undoubtedly  contributes to price rises. We will see more of it when the  state pays off its debts.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Average December Wages in Different Sectors and Regions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Another serious item to contemplate is the growing  differentiation in wages. The gap between the average wages of  the highest- and lowest-paid 10 percent of workers measured by  the end of the year a factor of 27 (!)--no developed country has  anything like this. Some were paid more than R1 million a month,  while more than 1 million Russians got less than even the  minimum wage (R14,620). In this respect the gap is measured by a  factor of 100 or more.    With respect to per capita monetary income, one of the  poorest is Ivanovo Oblast (R57,000), and one of the richest is  Tyumen Oblast (R245,000). At the same time, among gas industry  workers in Krasnoyarsk Kray the average per capita income in  December amounted to no more no less than R2.4 million. Such an  income policy only increases the danger of a social overheating  of society.</p>

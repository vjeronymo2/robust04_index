			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Arts: Grassic Gibbon's A Scots Quair - Edinburgh Festival Up here in Scotland, Lewis Grassic Gibbon's trilogy A Scots Quair (1932-34) is something of a classic. The novels - Sunset Song, Cloud Howe and Grey Granite - take Chris Guthrie from childhood in a Scottish croft before the First World War, and marriage to a local farmer, through to her second marriage and socialist fervour in the deprived urban conditions of the 1920s, and so to standing apart from her son Ewan as he grows up and becomes a Communist in the 1930s. Two years ago, TAG Theatre Company staged a sell-out version of Sunset Song, and now it is staging all three. Grassic Gibbon's depiction of the bygone life of the crofts is curiously akin to Margaret Mitchell's evocation of the vanished South in Gone with the Wind (and, like Scarlett O'Hara, Chris Guthrie marries three times). I say 'curiously', since Mitchell's account is rightwing and perilously close to pulp romance; yet Scarlett is altogether less passive than the lyrical and reflective leftwing Chris. Grassic Gibbon's vision was the most loveable kind of Marxism. He set each character against the toughness of their social conditions; and to anyone who struggled to determine the course of his or her own destiny he accorded a kind of heroic dignity. The TAG production goes straight for the lyricism of Chris's, and Grassic Gibbon's, vision. Chris sings some of her soliloquies, in affecting folk style (composed by Dougie MacLean); and the folk around her sing the various songs of their time and place. They also dance; and choreographer Andrew Howitt has economically caught the contrasting poetries of farmwork and steel-foundry work, of social life and private life. After Saturday's performance of the complete trilogy on Saturday, large parts of the audience rose to their feet to hail and cheer the TAG achievement - and, of course, Grassic Gibbon's achievement too. I applauded too, but I found the plays too loaded with charm to be able to cheer. The adaptation from page to stage, which has been done by Alastair Cording, is paced with variety, but - a big but - all too often boils down important scenes into telegrammatic precis that miss the truth of serious human feeling. The adaptation also exposes and highlights a sentimentality at Grassic Gibbon's heart. Chris's father was a bully who drove his wife to suicide and who attempted incestuous rape on his daughter; but at his funeral Chris forgives him, because of his social conditions. Chris's first husband turns into a drunk who abuses her; but after his death at the front we discover that army life had wrecked him and that he had always really loved her. Her second husband turns into an unfeeling religious bigot; but, when dying, he rediscovers his love for her and his socialist convictions. How many of these in-the-hour-of-death soft-centered forgivenesses can you take? TAG presents the whole saga with just a dozen performers. Most of them have marvellous faces, modernist faces that seem sculpted, faces that move with maximum simplicity. As Chris, Pauline Knowles has exemplary stillness, directness and tenderness. (Her only faults are an occasional tendency to chant her spoken monologues and to let us know that she has found the next Mr Right by gazing spellbound right at him.) As her son and her first husband, Stuart Bowman is even finer; it is hard, at the third play's close, to believe just how different he was in the first. Anne Kidd delivers a whole range of contrasting character roles with beautiful vigour. (Only Nicola Burnett Smith lets the side down with over-busy 'surface' acting.) Every year you know that the Edinburgh Festival will include a few chunks of Scottish art - a token few bits of national art amid a generally international festival. A Scots Quair is virtually guaranteed to charm those who want to be charmed by Scotland. The diction alone is adorable: 'You canna manage the whole hoose on your ain,' 'God pity the puir bairn the faither it had,' 'Dinna fash me - mebbe he'll no' want tae,' 'My hairt is beatin' fair tae burst frae my breast,' etc. Even the toughnesses that A Scots Quair depicts, and its subversiveness, are part of a Scotland many people are only too happy to believe in. Until September 4 at the Assembly Hall.</p>

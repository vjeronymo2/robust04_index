The daily AL-ANBA' said in its  leader today that "'Arafat is saying that he has placed the  responsibility of the al- 'Aqsa Mosque on the custodian of the  two holy mosques, as if King Fahd and his honorable people  needed to be reminded by a vile person about this  responsibility. The late King Faysal Bin-'Abd- al-'Aziz paid  with his life for this responsibility and was assassinated,  precisely because he had announced that he shouldered the  responsibility for al-'Aqsa Mosque and that he was committed to  it." AL-ANBA' asked: "Would be unjust to 'Arafat to remind him  of the day when he knelt before his master Saddam, sang the  praises of the occupying Iraqi Army, and said he wished that he  had part of that occupying army in order to remain in Kuwait for  60 days [as received]?"    PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said in press statements  following  his arrival in Riyadh last Sunday that he placed the  responsibility of the al-'Aqsa Mosque on the custodian of the  two holy mosques.</p>

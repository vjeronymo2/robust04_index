			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japanese Firm Stops Making Black Doll: A Japanese toy maker said it will stop  selling a black inflatable doll with big round eyes and a grass skirt, but the  company denied it was acting because critics called the doll racist. Shusuke  Kubota, a spokesman for Takara Co., said it also was discontinuing the use of  the doll, named "Dakko-chan," as its corporate symbol. Takara also makes  "Transformer" robots that can be bent and twisted into other objects. Kubota  said Takara's decision to discontinue "Dakko-chan" had no connection with  racial issues. "It's not a black. It represents a Japanese child whose skin has  darkened from being out in the sun all summer long," he said.  </P></p>

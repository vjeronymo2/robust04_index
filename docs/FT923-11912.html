			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent stages a technical recovery MOST continental bourses staged a technical rebound after two days of heavy losses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was heartened by the dollar's gains after concerted intervention on Monday, the DAX index recovering 10.10 to 1,659.77. But investors remained on the sidelines as turnover eased from DM6.9bn to DM6.5bn. From Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, Mr Michael Zapf gave investors some encouragement. 'All cyclical indicators,' he said, 'suggest that the economic weakening which had been in progress since the second quarter of 1991 is over.' The bank's charts on growth of production and incoming orders show a turnround and the same cyclical pattern 'is also showing for such still struggling industries as steel . . .' Steels rose in concert yesterday, led by Klockner-Werke, up DM2.50 to DM108.50, and Hoesch, DM4.10 higher at DM241.10. However, the sector has been anticipating economic recovery for at least the last three months, and domestic analysts are divided about its appeal. Another cyclical stock, meanwhile, came unstuck. PWA tumbled DM19.50 to DM201.50 after forecasting that the 1992 dividend would be at least halved, and that net profits in the first six months had dropped by 89 per cent to DM6m on flat sales. Lufthansa rose DM3.80 to DM113.80 in active trade on news that the government plans to sell all of its 52.95 per cent stake in the airline at some stage in the future. Lufthansa has been standing close to its 1992 low on poor profit prospects. MILAN steadied after Monday's sharp losses but sentiment remained fragile. Dealers expect trading to remain volatile for the rest of the week. The Comit index eased 0.96 to 411.71 in turnover estimated at less than Monday's L139bn. Fiat, which tumbled 6.7 per cent on Monday, eased just L1 to L4,574 and recovered to L4,590 after hours. The telecom sector also found its footing, with Sip adding L15 to L1,047 and Stet unchanged at L1,445. The board of Iri is due to meet tomorrow to discuss the sector's reform and, in particular, how to reorganise the former ASST's assets. There was still some fallout from Monday, however, with Ambroveneto suspended from trading temporarily because of excessive losses. The stock was eventually fixed down L69 at L3,436. PARIS ended lower after a volatile day, as the CAC-40 finished 5.23 down at 1,762.67 on modest turnover of just under FFr2bn. Dealers said there was some buying of defensive and quality stocks, with Alcatel adding FFr6 to FFr624 and L'Oreal adding FFr17 to FFr934. Euro Disney fell FFr2 to FFr100. A report in a UK newspaper yesterday said that disappointing attendances and hints from British tour operators that they would drop the theme park from their programmes have prompted Euro Disney to restructure its prices. AMSTERDAM improved in spite of a lack of corporate news. The CBS Tendency index finished up 1.00 at 117.6. News that British Airways was to take a 44 per cent stake in USAir had little real negative impact on KLM. The Dutch and UK carriers have been holding talks for months but the market had already discounted the possibility of a merger. KLM closed down 50 cents at Fl 32.00. Fokker improved Fl 1.10 to Fl 30.10 on hopes that talks between Dasa of Germany and the Dutch government, which began on Monday and are scheduled to continue tomorrow, will be successful. Companies with strong US exposure performed well, with Hunter Douglas gaining Fl 2.50 or 4 per cent to Fl 61.30. ZURICH majored on blue chips, and the SMI index of leading shares added 29.5 to 1,786.1, Nestle bearers topping the active list as they rose SFr150 to SFr9,330. Roche certificates came second in the list and rose SFr110 to SFr3,260. The pharmaceutical company said that it expected markedly higher current year profits after a 19 per cent rise in turnover for the first six months of 1992. STOCKHOLM recovered in thin trade, turnover dropping from SKr352m to SKr283m as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 10.7 to 860.5. Most Swedish blue chips with key markets in the US or products denominated in dollars rose, Volvo B recovering SKr5 to SKr338, Ericsson B SKr3 to SKr123 and Electrolux B by SKr7 to SKr225.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1073.09  1070.99  1072.53  1077.24  1077.73  1077.78  1078.53  1075.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Day's High  1079.36    Day's Low  1070.50  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jul 20     Jul 17     Jul 16     Jul 15     Jul 14 1064.04    1097.57    1120.48    1122.53    1124.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

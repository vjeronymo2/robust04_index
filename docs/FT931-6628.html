			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Spanish in bid to raise question of Gibraltar MR Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, yesterday reiterated Spain's commitment to ending the UK's colonial presence in Gibraltar. Speaking in the eve of a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, Mr Solana cautioned that little progress towards solving the Gibraltar dispute could be expected from the one-day talks. Spain would use 'persuasion and pressure in appropriate doses' to end the 'anachronism' that Gibraltar represented. The most obvious pressure exerted by the Spanish authorities consists of rigorous customs checks on vehicles entering and leaving the colony which can lead to queues of up to three hours. At a diplomatic level Spain has prevented the implementation of the EC's External Frontiers Convention which lays down the borders of the Single Market because it refuses to accept Gibraltar under its present colonial status as a valid Community entry point. Mr Hurd could, however, be pressed to review proposals tabled by Spain in 1985, which suggested a leaseback formula or power sharing.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / People: Constructive careers Oliver Whitehead, chief executive of Alfred McAlpine since May, has moved to strengthen the management of the construction and building materials company. Richard Baldwin, previously managing director of GEC transmission and distribution projects and former main board director of APV, has replaced Peter Hulmes as managing director of McAlpine's important building division. He also becomes a main board director. In a separate move, two non-executive directors, Sir Alex Alexander, who joined the board in 1978, and Sir Timothy Kitson, with the company since 1986, will retire after the agm in April. Bobby McAlpine, a former chairman, is also expected to stand down next year. The company had felt that the board was a little top-heavy and needed some fresh faces; it thinks it has a good catch in Andrew Ronn, finance director of Pilkington since 1989. Garry Forster has been appointed company secretary in place of Gordon Beaumont who remains corporate development officer.</p>

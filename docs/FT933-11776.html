			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Powerbroker who fell from grace: Obituary - T. Dan Smith T. DAN SMITH, the charismatic Geordie local politician who fell from grace in the Poulson corruption scandal, died yesterday in the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle, aged 78. He was undergoing surgery after collapsing at home. One of Britain's most ebullient post-war local government figures, the miner's son rose from a boyhood and socialist youth in the modest terraced streets of Wallsend to become a tireless powerbroker, driven by a mission to change his native north-east and, say his enemies, to wield power. For good or ill, he stamped his vision on Newcastle upon Tyne, where he was council leader for five years in the 1960s, sweeping away slums and ushering in the city's 'Brasilia' era of multi-storey blocks of flats and motor-ways. One city alone seemed insufficient for the energies of the man who became known as Mr Newcastle; he became the first chairman of the northern Economic Planning Council, formulating a vision of change for the entire region; a member of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England; and chairman of Peterlee new town development corporation on County Durham. His political career was wrecked by his involvement in the web of corruption surrounding the architect John Poulson. In 1974, T. Dan Smith was sentenced to six years in prison for accepting Pounds 156,000 from Mr Poulson. Released after three years, Mr Smith was politically persona non grata; only in 1987 did his local Labour party agree to his being readmitted. He remained a forceful personality, campaigning after his release for prisoners' rights. He also relished a new role as an independent, challenging pundit on north-east matters; only a few days ago he was taking part, with his usual verve, in a Radio Newcastle phone-in.</p>

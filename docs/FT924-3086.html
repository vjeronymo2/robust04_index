			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (2): Call for stricter rules - After Maxwell, UK controls are under scrutiny THE CUSTODY business is the one area of the financial services industry that is still unregulated. However, it is not likely to remain so. The death at sea on November 5, 1991, of Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communications Corporation, sparked an investigation which revealed more than Pounds 400m was missing from pension schemes he controlled. The way in which assets disappeared has called into question the role of custodians and the rules under which they operate. Using a series of transactions nominally labelled stock lending - although, in fact, it bore little resemblance to such practice - ownership of shares passed from the pension fund managers and custodians to other Maxwell-owned companies. The ease with which this was achieved has dismayed MPs, who are demanding new rules to regulate pension schemes, fund managers and custodians. The government has appointed an independent committee, headed by Professor Roy Goode, to study pensions law, especially as it applies to custodians, and to make recommendations. And in March, the cross-party Parliamentary select committee on social security, which has held extensive hearings into the Maxwell affair, also suggested fund managers be required to use a separate custodian for assets under their control. The idea has alarmed the UK's largest fund managers, almost all of whom operate custodial companies and derive significant fees from them. The National Association of Pension Funds, which has also called for the regulation of custodians, has suggested a more modest measure. It believes that custodians should only be separate from the fund manager for those pension funds which are managed in-house. That suggestion, however, has upset the UK's largest banks which are both fund manager and custodian for their own pension schemes. The sums are not inconsiderable. More than two-thirds of the assets of Lloyds Asset Management belong to its own pension scheme and Barclays de Zoete Wedd manages more than Pounds 6bn of Barclays Bank pension scheme assets. Perhaps the most contentious issue for custodians has been the suggestion that securities be registered in designated names. Mr Robin Ellison, partner at pensions solicitors Ellison Westhorp, says the idea is unsound. 'If you put Pounds 5 in the bank one week and then go back the following week to withdraw it, you simply ask for Pounds 5. You dont say 'I want my five pounds'.' Mr Michael Robarts of Fleming Investment Management, argues that designation not only offers little protection to clients, but will also slow down the settlement process, raising costs for everyone and increasing risks. 'Chaos will ensue,' he predicts. Some firms, such as NM Rothschild and Mercury Asset Management, maintained securities in the names of individual clients in the days before London's Big Bang and the explosion in trading volume. However, this required constant reconciliation of files, a cumbersome manual process that frequently led to errors in valuing client accounts when securities were filed incorrectly. When trading volumes rose sharply in 1987, the practice was abandoned. A return to it, would create more problems than it would solve. In the aftermath of the Maxwell affair Mr John Quarrell, a partner at solicitors Nabarro Nathanson and a leading pensions lawyer, advocated requiring securities to be held in designated names, on the grounds that such a move would have alerted securities firms to the true owners of shares received as collateral for personal loans to Mr Maxwell. 'Since then, I've moved my position. I've been persuaded by the well-run houses that it is the auditing and the financial controls internally which matter most.' The argument in favour of designation is best summed up, however, by one example. Robson Rhodes, administrators to the Maxwell fund management company Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), were able to recover Pounds 27m of shares in Teva Pharmaceutical, an Israeli company, from National Westminster Bank because of designation. Although the shares were pledged as collateral to Robert Maxwell's private interests, they were held in the name of BIM, a firm whose sole purpose was to manage pension fund assets. Thus, the liquidators were able to argue, NatWest should have been suspicious about the ownership of securities it was accepting as collateral. Not only were the shares returned but NatWest reimbursed the administrators Pounds 90,000 in costs. But, says Mr Robarts, designation will do little to protect pension fund assets because designation is under the control of the custodian. Had BIM changed the designation to that of one of the Maxwell companies, the matter could have been easily covered up. The answer, he claims, is to improve financial controls on custodians. For instance, audits of a fund manager do not include any review of the assets under custody. His own company has, for the first time, asked its auditors to include a statement about the custody business in the larger annual report. Also, there should be tighter controls on which pension fund trustees have the authority to order custodians to move assets. While most custodians keep sample signatures on file, they may not necessarily know the powers of signatories. Mr Robarts says custodians should be required to seek the permission of all trustees of pension funds before an individual is given the authority to move assets. Meanwhile, some members of the pensions industry have suggested the UK should adopt US-style Erisa legislation which requires custodians to refuse to carry out orders which they believe or suspect to be improper. That view has been discussed with the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, which is said to favour it. But Mr Robarts argues unless the largely clerical staff employed by custodians receive much better training, the rule will offer little protection. Moreover, the rule will allow the US banks, which already dominate the global custody business, to claim a further edge on their UK competitors by advertising to potential clients that they have long been following the rule.  ------------------------------------------           World financial markets,              1991 (Dollars bn)  ------------------------------------------ Financial assets Equities                          7,000.0 Bonds                            12,000.0  ------------------------------------------ Mutual funds US                                1,400.0 UK                                  100.0 Continental Europe                  600.0 Japan                               400.0  ------------------------------------------ Total                             2,500.0  ------------------------------------------ Asset management industry US (1,013 managers)               4,000.0 100 largest non-US managers       4,700.0  ------------------------------------------ Total                             8,700.0  ------------------------------------------ Pension fund industry US                                2,700.0 Canada                              200.0 UK                                  600.0 Continental Europe                  700.0 Japan                               700.0 Other                               300.0  ------------------------------------------ Total                             5,200.0  ------------------------------------------ Insurance industry US                                2,000.0 Canada                              200.0 UK                                  900.0 Continental Europe                1,200.0 Japan                               900.0  ------------------------------------------ Total                             5,200.0  ------------------------------------------ Source: State Street Boston Corp  ------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: MUFFINS, GOOD COFFEE -- THEY MAKE RISING EARLY WORTH  IT  </P> <P> The specially blended yogurt at Chelsea's Choice keeps the customers coming  during the day, especially in the summer. But early mornings, the place belongs  strictly to the muffin crowd.  </P> <P> Most of those who stop by come for takeout on the way to work. When you've got  a few minutes to spare, though, Chelsea's is a cheerful place to sit awhile  with a good cup of coffee and a newspaper.  </P> <P> And, of course, a tasty muffin. There are raspberry and blueberry bran, banana  walnut, banana oatmeal, oat bran, chocolate chip, carrot nut bran, but the best  is carrot -- moist, not-too-sweet, with lots of walnuts and perfect spicing.  </P> <P> You also can find novel varieties. On a recent morning, for instance, there  were "turtles" (made with pecans, caramel and chocolate) and hot fudge muffins  (with the real stuff, as well as chocolate chips and sour cream). If that's not  enough, there's a sweet streusel version of some sort each day; blueberry,  apple and cinnamon are among the favorites.  </P> <P> Chelsea's is worth getting up early for. No day that starts there can be all  bad.  </P> <P>  Chelsea's Choice, 777 S. Main St. 125, Santa Ana. Open Mondays through Fridays  6:15 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturdays from 7:15 a.m. to 5 p.m. (714) 972-9171. 3025 E.  Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. Open daily 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sundays from 7  a.m.. (714) 675-7870.  </P> <P> CLAUDIA LUTHER  </P></p>

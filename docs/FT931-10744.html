			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Iveco Ford urges no bail-out for Daf IVECO FORD, the truck maker, urged the government yesterday not to 'bail out' Daf, its Anglo-Dutch rival, which collapsed into administrative receivership earlier this week. Mr Alan Fox, Iveco Ford chief executive, claimed in a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that Pounds 750m of debts had been written off by the government when Daf took over Leyland Vehicles in 1987. 'Surely there can be no further government-funded financial support for a company with such a track record,' he wrote. 'We think it right that you do not intend to bail out Leyland Daf because clearly there is too much truck manufacturing capacity available even for an annual market of 50,000 new trucks.' UK new truck sales were only 31,398 last year, 55 per cent down on the peak of 69,234 in 1989. 'Should there be any change in government policy in respect of direct or indirect support to Leyland Daf, then Iveco Ford Truck would look to receive an equal benefit and opportunity,' Mr Fox said in his letter. Iveco Ford, a joint venture between Iveco, commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, and Ford, the US vehicle maker, lost the leadership of the UK new truck market to Daf two years ago. Iveco Ford itself continued to lose Pounds 500,000 a week 'due to the parlous state of the British truck market,' Mr Fox said. The Iveco Ford truck plant at Langley, Berks, could make 15,000 trucks a year, but was currently 'screwed down to just 6,000. This is why we are losing money'. Iveco Ford Truck incurred losses in 1992 of Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m, Mr Fox disclosed. Leyland Daf Finance, the truck maker's hire purchase and leasing arm, yesterday closed its five UK regional offices.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 25 Mar, TASS -- The State Duma included in  the agenda today the issue on plans to unite the monetary  systems of Russia and Belarus. The proposal of Aleksey  Mitrofanov, member of the State Duma, was supported by the  majority of the legislators.    The State Duma adopted a resolution by the roll-call voting  on setting up a commission, which will prepare and hold  parliamentary hearings, whose topic will be "threat of fascism  in Russia." Yuliy Gusman from the Russia's Choice bloc, who  suggested it, said that thugs professing fascist ideology are  already walking without hindrance by the streets of Russian  cities. "Today they look like clowns, but if we close our eyes  to this problem, a situation may emerge, which will mean nothing  but the revival of fascism," Gusman stressed.    Sergey Baburin responded to his words in an original way. He  said that "the threat of fascism does exist, and it became  evident in October 1993."    On the suggestion of Viktor Zelenkin from the Russia's  Choice  bloc the State Duma will hear a report of the group of deputies,  who visited Vladivostok following the much-publicised removal  from office of the city mayor. The State Duma decided as well  to hear a report of a representative of the prosecutor-general's  office in connection with accusations against Bella Kurkova,  head of the St. Petersburg TV company.</p>

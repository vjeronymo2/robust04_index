			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS  </P> <P> Have you ever looked at a work of art and wondered what was going through the  artist's mind when he created it? The works of Jorge Santos will keep you busy  for a week. "Unknown Realities," his latest display, is featured at MRL Fine  Art in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Although he focused primarily on pencil drawings, Santos has recently begun to  paint with oils and has made significant accomplishments in the field of  lithography. His works are said to be very powerful and complex . . .  comparable to the moods of Salvador Dali and M.C. Escher. Santos is bringing  surrealism to life in the '90s.  </P> <P> Santos was born in Lunada, Angola, in 1959. He was forced to leave Africa in  1975 and fled to Lisbon, Portugal, to avoid violence in Africa.  </P> <P> It was through his passion for drawing that Santos dealt with the emotions  stirred by the change. He traveled throughout Europe and northern Africa and  returned to Portugal in 1979. Santos later settled in Los Angeles. His works  were shown during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, at the  International Art Exhibition.  </P> <P> "Unknown Realities" will be on exhibit through Dec. 15 at the MRL gallery, 4718  E. 2nd St., Long Beach. MRL Fine Art is open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday  through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Sunday. Admission is free.

More than 500  of the new 1991 models will be on display Wednesday through Nov. 25.  </P> <P> The Southland's first showing of 1991 cars will feature more than 40 major  lines, including the much-anticipated Saturn from General Motors. England's  Lotus Elan convertible will make its West Coast debut. Acura will unveil its  all-new 1991 Legend sedan. Volvo will present its new 940 series, which  replaces the 760 models. Spectators can get behind the wheel of the Dodge  Stealth and Mitsubishi 3000 GT.  </P> <P> Special cars will make appearances at the auto show. The Chevrolet Lumina "Days  of Thunder" movie race car will be displayed along with the Pontiac concept  car, the Banshee.  </P> <P> Lifestyles Promotions will hold a drawing for a new 1991 car.

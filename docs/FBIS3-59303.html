I. Analysis of Future of China's Grain Trading in the  World Market    A basic question to ask before discussing how China's  "re-entry in GATT" will impact on China's grain system is:  Looking ahead, will China be importing or exporting grain? In  1962-1991, China imported a total of 157.231 million tons of  grain, at an average rate of 5.42 million tons annually. Looking  ahead, and basing our estimate on the 1962-1991 average annual  grain import rate of 5.42 million tons, China's grain imports  will reach 50 million tons by the year 2000. We came to this  conclusion after analyzing the following grain supply and demand  trends in China.    (A) Analyzed from the standpoint of grain demand, the  factors  which influence grain demand increase are increase in population  and rise in per capita income. China's population by century's  end will be close to 1.3 billion. The annual population increase  will add an additional grain demand of 3.15 million tons, using  as estimates 200 kilo of grain consumption per capita and an  annual increase of 15.75 million people. Rise in per capita  income will also increase demand for grain. In many developing  countries in the Asia Pacific area, the elastic rates of demand  for grain relative to income range between 0.4-0.9; based on our  analysis, China's elastic rate of demand for grain relative to  income is 0.6. In recent years, the adjusted rate of our  national economic development has been 8 percent, suggesting  that the per capita income has also increased by a similar  margin. Even the lowest estimate puts the rate of increase at 5  percent. Using the following formula for calculating the rate of  grain demand increase: D = P + eg &lt;sup&gt; 1&lt;/sup&gt;  (in  which D is the rate of grain demand increase, P the rate of  population increase, g the rate of per capita income increase,  and e the elastic rate of grain demand relative to income),  therefore D = 1.4 percent + 5 percent x 0.6 percent = 4.4  percent.    (B) Analyzed from the standpoint of grain supply, the 3.1  percent average annual rate of increase in 1950-1975 dropped to  2.9 percent in 1975-1985, and further to 2.2 percent in  1985-1992. The rates of grain supply increase are trending  downward. It is estimated that by century's end, China's grain  output will reach 520 million tons, with an average annual rate  of increase of 1.9 percent. The reasons the rates of increase  are dropping are:    1. Decreased amount of farmland under cultivation. From  1957-1991, a total of 243 million mu of farmland were taken out  of cultivation, an average of some 7 million mu per year.    2. Decline in soil quality in farmland under cultivation.  According to statistics of China's Second Soil Quality Survey,  the proportion of phosphorous-poor land was 59.1 percent of all  farmland under cultivation, the proportion of farmland lacking  potassium was 22.4 percent, and the proportion of farmland  lacking both ingredients was 13.8 percent. Farmland with less  than 0.6 percent of organic contents constituted 10.6 percent of  the total area under cultivation.    3. Aging water conservancy facilities. A majority of water  conservancy facilities were built in the 1950-1960 era, and all  of these are aging. In 1978, only 55.4 percent of the irrigated  farmland was irrigated by motorized or electric means; in 1991,  it was 57.8 percent, an increase of only 2.4 percent in 13 years.    4. Prospects of increasing fertilizer use to boost grain  production are not bright. The reasons are: a) In 1991,  fertilizer use in China per hectare of cultivated land already  reached 249 kilo, which is close to the fertilizer usage  standard of developed countries, and further increase in the use  of chemical fertilizer will not marginally increase grain  productivity by much. b) Slowing down of peasant income increase  means peasants lack the purchasing power to buy chemical  fertilizer. Summarizing the above, the rate of grain supply  increase by the year 2000 is likely to be around 2 percent.  Thus, the rate of grain demand increase in China will exceed the  rate of grain supply increase, with a differential of 2.5  percent between the two. The gap between supply and demand by  the year 2000 will be 50 million tons, requiring on average an  annual import of 5.55 million tons, or over 50 percent of the  world's grain exports. Looking ahead, therefore, China will  likely become one of the world's largest grain importing  countries. This is the basic finding in our analysis of the  impact of "re-entry in GATT" on China's grain system.    Impact of "Re-entry in GATT" on China's Grain System    For a long period of time, world grain trade has not been  subjected to control by the basic principles and regulations of  GATT. Countries with developed market economies have all  extended large financial subsidies to grain production by  imposing quota or tariffs on grain imports and by subsidizing  grain exports. Since the 1970's, developing countries have  changed from subordinating grain producers in the interest of  industrial development to protecting the former. Among Asia's  most rapidly developing economies of Japan, Korea, China's  Taiwan Province, all of them are now paying large subsidies to  grain producers. This is by no means accidental.    1. Comparing grain production with manufacturing production,  the former has a long production cycle, slow capital turnaround,  low utilization rate of fixed assets, and very slow transfer of  values. Manufacturing industries, on the other hand, have a  short production cycle, fast turnaround of capital, high  utilization rate of fixed assets, and rapid transfer of values;  furthermore, manufacturing industries can, by enlarging the  scope of manufacturing or increasing the number of factories,  expand the overall scale of production, and can manipulate the  time factors involved to expand the scope of production. Grain  production, however, is limited by the area under cultivation,  which allows little leeway for expanded production, and even  less in terms of shortening the time frame required for grain  production.    2. Grain production is easily exposed to ravages of weather,  plant diseases and pests, and the ratio of input and output in  production can usually not be guaranteed. On the contrary,  manufacturing industries are seldom the victims of seasonal  weather or natural disasters.    3. The price elasticity in grain supply and demand is not  only lower than that of manufactured products, but also lower  than those of other economic crops and animal food products. In  terms of the elastic theory of supply and demand, the less  elasticity in supply and demand, the greater the changes in  prices linked to changes in fixed supply or demand. Therefore,  [to deal with grain imports after China's re-entry in GATT]  government interventions will be necessary not only within  China, but at its borders as well.    4. The rate of grain price increase is slower than that of  manufactured products. This is because manufactured products  have numerous processing outlets, and with the completion of  each processing cycle, prices are increased accordingly. Even if  grain were to undergo further processing, however, the scope of  processing would be limited and the rate of subsequent price  rise rather slow. China will therefore have to support [its  domestic] grain prices.    Summarizing the above, it is our judgment that China must  stand on the principle of grain self-sufficiency and, since  coordination on a worldwide basis is lacking, China must take  steps to protect its own grain producers and to intervene in  grain imports and exports at the border. This is a basic  principle China must adhere to after "re-entering GATT."    (A) Beneficial Effects of "re-entry in GATT" on China's  grain  system.    1. The ultimate objective of the GATT negotiations is to  promote free trade worldwide; only with free trade can capital  be most efficiently allocated on a worldwide basis, which in  turn can provide the impetus to individual countries to expand  and develop production. Trade protectionism however interferes  with efficient allocation of capital. At present, China's grain  trade is basically not being protected. China has very low  tariffs on grain, and in particular, none on the import of  husked rice. China poses no obstacles to any negotiations to  reduce tariffs on grain imports. After China's "re-entry in  GATT"; however, world market grain prices will likely rise  across the board. According to analyses of the U.N. Food and  Agriculture Organization, if trade restrictions were eliminated  by all developed market economy countries, prices of wheat would  rise by 20 percent, coarse grain by 16 percent and husked rice  by 14 percent. If free trade were engaged in by all  wheat-trading countries, world market price of wheat would rise  by 11 percent, and market price fluctuations reduced by 35  percent2.    Based on our analysis, if the United States eliminated grain  export subsidies, world grain prices would rise by 10 percent.

In  1984-1985, U.S. subsidies were very low, and U.S. grain exports  as a proportion of the world export market were only 35.7  percent, but with world grain supplies thus reduced, grain  prices shot up; b) if the United States eliminated export  subsidies, world grain prices would rise by 10 percent.  Therefore, after China "re-enters GATT," and assuming all the  grain exporting countries eliminated export subsidies and trade  restrictions (though elimination per se is extremely difficult  to carry out), then world grain prices would generally rise; and  if China's grain enterprises were operating by market mechanism,  domestic grain prices would also rise and this would benefit  China's grain producers.    2. In terms of the overall multilateral trading system,  however, China as a country also exports agricultural products,  and with the gradual relaxation of agricultural protectionism,  China's agricultural products will gain a larger share of the  world market. In addition, with the lifting of trade  restrictions, prices of world agricultural products will rise  which will increase the export earnings of China's agricultural  products. As an indirect consequence, China's peasant income  will also rise, which will lead to greater inputs and  accelerated development in grain production.    B. Detrimental Effects of "Re-try in GATT" on China's Grain  Output    1) China's main grain import is wheat. In 1991, wheat  imports  totalled 12.37 million tons, accounting for 92 percent of all  grain imports that year. But China's wheat market price is  higher than the world market price. In 1992, China's domestic  wheat price was $146.55 per ton, while the world market price  (i.e. U.S. Chicago future price) was $126 per ton.3  Yet, the quality of China's wheat is lower than that of imported  wheat. The wheat-to-flour ratio of China's wheat is lower than  the United States by 7-8 percentage points. Assuming that all  tariffs and non-tariff barriers were eliminated by wheat trading  countries, the world market price of wheat would rise by 11  percent to $140.6 per ton, calculated on the basis of the 1992  world market price of $126 per ton. That price will still be  lower than China's domestic wheat price. Therefore, after  "re-entering GATT," China's wheat production will face the  difficulties of high price and low quality. Large quantities of  wheat from abroad will pour into China, invading our domestic  market and causing our wheat market price to drop. China's wheat  producers will be the victims.    2) China is a major importer of world grain; in 1991, China  imported 13.45 million tons of grain, paying $1.64 billion in  foreign exchange. After "re-entry in GATT," if world grain  prices were to rise by 11 percent, then China would have to pay  a total of $1.8 billion. Based on the 5.8 [yuan to the dollar]  exchange rate, China's consumers will be paying 1.044 billion  yuan more than before China's "re-entry in GATT." The government  will also be sacrificing its precious foreign exchange reserves.    3) At present, a majority of grain are procured and sold by  the government. Prices are also set by the government. This  therefore severs any linkage between the domestic market and  world market. Turbulence in world market grain prices cannot be  transmitted to China itself. After "re-entry in GATT," however,  China's domestic grain market will be linked up with the world  grain market, and thus the latter's price turbulence will be  felt inside China; this linkage will increase the rate and  extent of grain market turbulence and add to the cost as well as  difficulties of macro regulation and control on the part of the  government.    4) After "re-entry in GATT," large quantities of grain from  abroad will pour into China and greatly lower our domestic grain  prices. This will reduce the peasant labor inputs in grain  production and generate more surplus labor to add to the already  large pool of surplus labor.    III. Main Policy Recommendations For Before and After  China's "Re- entry in GATT"    A. Protect domestic grain producers    It is our judgment that China's "re-entry in GATT" will have  greater detrimental than beneficial impact on China's grain  system, and that unfavorable effects will outweigh favorable  ones. We should therefore make use of those GATT articles which  operate in China's favor to strengthen protection of and subsidy  for our grain producers.    B. Strengthen border interventions in grain trade    China's tariffs on grain imports are very low; there is none  on rice. In the circumstances where China's grain prices are  close to or exceeding world market prices, China should carry  out import quota control by continuing the system of issuing  import permits. Although GATT Article 11 prescribes that: "Any  contracting party will not establish or maintain quota, export  or import permit or other measures to control or restrict the  import of products from territories of other contracting  parties, except for purposes of collecting taxes and other  expenses," a GATT-prescribed "protective article" does allow the  contracting parties to control both the quantities and values of  goods permitted for import in order to protect the importing  countries' external financial positions and international  revenues and expenditures. On the basis of this article, China  can utilize non-tariff measures or other means to control  imports of grain from aboard in order to protect China's grain  producers and other trades utilizing surplus labor.    C. Quicken the pace of grain market reform    From the standpoint of the fundamental principles of GATT,  the essence of GATT is to promote a system of free trade based  on market-oriented economy. From the perspective of this basic  principle, there is still great disparity between that goal and  China's current grain market reforms. Although some one-half of  China's provinces and municipalities have freed their grain  markets, the basic system at present is still a "dual-track  system." If we want to re-enter GATT, we must quicken the pace  of market-oriented reforms.    D. Implement the linkage between China's domestic grain  market and the world market. To carry this out, we need to take  the following concrete steps:    1) We should encourage grain export organizations and  domestic grain enterprises to develop toward a market economy.  We should establish and perfect a sales and service network  oriented toward the world market.    2) We should adjust the composition of grain varieties and  raise the quality of grain for exports. China now exports coarse  grain, soybean and maize. Because their qualities are rather  low, they lack international competitiveness. In pricing, we  should differentiate quality by price. We should increase the  area for cultivation of high- quality rice, soybean and maize.  We should apply one unified international standard for all grain  exports, and abolish the present dual domestic and international  standards.    3) In grain production, we should import high-grade  varieties  and advanced techniques from abroad and raise both these areas  to international standards.    E. Quickly establish and perfect a two-stage system of grain  reserve and storage.    In order to complete the linkage of China's domestic market  to the world markets, where turbulence in world grain prices  will be transmitted to China's domestic market, we need to  establish a domestic grain reserve and storage system which will  alleviate the impact of imports due to world grain price  fluctuations.    In summary, only if we conscientiously complete our  preparatory work before re-accession in GATT will we be able,  after entering that organization, to minimize the adverse impact  it will have on China's grain system.

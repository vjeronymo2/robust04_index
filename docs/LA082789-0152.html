			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REV. LOU SHELDON AND RIGHTS OF HOMOSEXUALS  </P> <P> Sheldon's Commentary that homosexuality should not have a minority status is  fatally flawed because if the average homosexual is a walking "tropical island  of exotic diseases," doomed to "a life of self-destructive perversion," then  why would anyone care to become homosexual?  </P> <P> People do not necessarily choose to become homosexual and face the terrible  discrimination, injury, disease and death. Rather, they are most often born  that way, having little or no control over the constant uphill battle they must  face against misguided religious fanatics. Hitler tried the same tactics in  Germany with minorities, finally murdering thousands of homosexuals, but  right-thinking men and women in the long run righted the injustice. The same  will prevail in this case and every case where blind bigotry rears its ugly  head.  </P> <P> Sheldon may have homosexuality denied a minority status today; however, one  shining day, society will grant all of its citizens equal rights and protect  them to grow to their full potential.  </P> <P> RICHARD MOWERY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> HOT COPY: The always unpredictable (dare we say erratic) ex-New York Dolls  guitarist Johnny Thunders is back with a new album, teamed up with vocalist  Patti Palladin. Called "Copy Cats," the record features a host of cover tunes,  ranging from the Seeds' "Can't Seem to Make You Mine" and Roy Head's "Treat Her  Right" to the Chamber Bros.' "Uptown to Harlem" and the Shirelles' "Baby It's  You.". . .Our Album Title of the Week goes to folkie Cindy Lee Berryhill's  upcoming, Lenny Kaye-produced album, which is titled "Naked Movie Star.". . .  And Our Joke of the Week goes to Dr. Bubba from the Scott's Tissue tip-sheet  whose rock predictions for 1989 include this highlight: "Roseanne Barr, the Fat  Boys and Sam Kinnison will form a band called the Traveling Pillsburies."  </P></p>

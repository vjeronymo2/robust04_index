			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLITICIANS, TAX HIKES AND GAS TAX MEASURES  </P> <P> It is time to say no to more than just drugs! On Jan. 1, Social Security taxes  increased a hefty 15.3%. Willie Brown is proposing that the temporary  quarter-cent earthquake tax be made permanent, as though that should come as a  surprise.  </P> <P> On Nov. 6 we will be asked to vote for a 100% increase in the state gasoline  tax, from 9 cents to 18 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> After the Orange County voters overwhelmingly turned down a sales tax increase  called Prop. A, the officials came back with a $2.5-million-plus campaign to  try and sell one more increase called Measure M. The ink is hardly dry from the  reports of that defeat, and here they are coming back to the trough one more  time and proposing one more vote on the same twice-defeated tax increase.  </P> <P> This time every voter should get out and leave little doubt in these  non-representative official minds that no means no!  </P> <P> WILLIAM H. EARNEST  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

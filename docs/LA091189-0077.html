			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP TRACK AND FIELD MEET;  </P> <P> KINGDOM'S 12.87 IS WIND-AIDED  </P> <P> When Roger Kingdom saw his world-record time on the scoreboard after he won the  World Cup 110-meter hurdles Sunday night, he could not believe it. Then, he  could. Near the end of his victory lap, he discovered that he was right the  first time.  </P> <P> After running the high hurdles in 12.92 seconds earlier this summer to break  Renaldo Nehemiah's eight-year-old record, Kingdom bettered that at Montjuic  Olympic Stadium with a 12.87.  </P> <P> "No, no, no," Kingdom said as he looked at the time flashing on the scoreboard.  "Not twice in one season."  </P> <P> "Yes, yes," Spanish hurdler Javier Moracho said as he congratulated Kingdom.  </P> <P> Moracho was wrong both times. As he and runner-up Colin Jackson of Great  Britain jogged down the backstretch side by side on their victory lap, Jackson  pointed to the wind gauge, which registered a plus 2.51 meters per second for  the race. The allowable tail wind for record consideration is 2.0.  </P> <P> "I was hoping it was for another race," Kingdom said of the wind reading. "But,  unfortunately, they called out that it was for ours. It was very disappointing.  When the gun fired, the wind was in our faces."  </P> <P> Still, it was the fastest time ever recorded in the event under all conditions.  The previous best was the 12.91 that Nehemiah ran 10 years ago with a 3.5  meter-per-second wind at his back. In finishing second Sunday night, Jackson  ran 12.95, the fifth-fastest time under all conditions.  </P> <P> Even with the prevailing wind, Kingdom's time was remarkable considering that  only minutes before the track looked like a moat.  </P> <P> A sudden, heavy downpour caused a two-hour delay in the meet and caused about  half of the 43,574 who bought tickets to find something else to do, presumably  indoors. There was even talk of canceling the final session of the three-day  competition, until the rain suddenly subsided.  </P> <P> Despite a superb job by the squeegee patrol, the track was still so wet when  the hurdlers were called to the starting line that Poland's Thomaaz Nagorka  took one look and decided to return to the dressing room.  </P> <P> "He was on the track and decided not to run," said U.S. Coach Harry Groves of  Penn State. "I talked to his coach afterward, and he was banging his head  against the wall."  </P> <P> That was the coach of the European all-stars, who entered that race tied with  the United States for first place in the men's standings.  </P> <P> Seeking its third title in five World Cups, the United States earned nine  points from Kingdom's first-place finish. Europe expected as many as six from  Nagorka and instead got none because he scratched. So much for solidarity from  the Pole.  </P> <P> The Europeans never overcame the deficit, although a victory by Sweden's Patrik  Sjoberg in the high jump with a meet record 7-feet 8-inches brought them within  two points entering the final event, the 1,600-meter relay.  </P> <P> The United States was second in that race to finish with 133 points. The  Europeans were a distant sixth in the relay and finished with 127 points. Great  Britain scored 119 points for third place.  </P> <P> "We didn't look real glamorous at the end," said Groves, who could count only  five first-place finishes in 20 events among his team's points. "But we did  what we came to do."  </P> <P> The East German women won their fourth consecutive World Cup championship with  124 points, easily beating the 116 scored by the second-place Soviet Union.  With only two first-places in 16 events, the United States finished fifth with  84.5 points.  </P> <P> But the United States had a courageous effort Sunday night in the 3,000 from  PattiSue Plumer. With little more than a lap remaining, she clipped the heels  of Soviet Tatiana Pozdnyakova and went sprawling. When she did, East German  Ellen Kiessling tripped over her and also fell.  </P> <P> Pozdnyakova ran ahead in a futile attempt to catch the eventual winner, Great  Britain's Yvonne Murray. Kiessling got back on her feet first and soon was  challenging Kenyan Helen Kimayio for third place.  </P> <P> But entering the stretch, running with a strained left knee suffered in the  collision, Plumer began to gain on them. In the final 10 meters, she edged  ahead of Kiessling for third place.  </P> <P> The meet's outstanding performer was Cuba's Ana Quirot, who anchored the  Americas all-stars to first place in the 1,600-meter relay Friday and added an  individual gold in the 800 meters Saturday with the third-fastest time ever.  </P> <P> Finally running out of energy, she was overtaken in the stretch of Sunday  night's 400 meters by France's Marie-Jose Perec. Perec crossed the finish line  in 50.30, Quirot in 50.60. But Perec later was disqualified for running out of  her lane, giving Quirot her third gold.  </P> <P> With the world's fastest time in 1989 in the 400 and the 800, Quirot, 26, has a  good chance to be named woman athlete of the year.  </P></p>

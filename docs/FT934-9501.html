			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: ABB buys Renault robotics division ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, yesterday strengthened its position in the market for industrial robots. It is to acquire the robotics operations of Renault and form a joint venture in automated vehicle assembly with the French car group. The two companies said that the 50-50 joint venture would employ about 290 people and have annual sales of about Dollars 80m. After the acquisition of Renault's robotic operations, ABB's French robotic operations would have annual sales of about Dollars 60m and would employ about 200 people. Mr Stelio Demark, managing director of ABB Robotics, said the deals with Renault were a central element in the company's strategy of shifting from a product supplier to a partner of industrial groups in the design and manufacture of automated systems. He said the joint venture, which will centre on body in white activities - where cars are assembled and welded together - would give ABB access to Renault's production line expertise and enable it to offer higher value-added products and services. The proposals, which require final approval by Renault employees, would give ABB its first joint venture project with a car manufacturer, the biggest market for robotics, and its first direct participation in the assembly stage of the production line. The expansion of ABB's French activities through the acquisition of Renault's robotics division is aimed at achieving economies of scale in what Mr Demark described as an increasingly competitive market. He said prices for industrial robots had fallen by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent over the past three to four years. This prompted Renault to sell its robotics operations. Renault's robotics operation, the largest in France, accounts for about 12 per cent of total sales of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 237.3m) from its automation division.</p>

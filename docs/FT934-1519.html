			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Exchange withholds study on USM substitute The London Stock Exchange has declined to release a report prepared by one of its own working parties which recommends the creation of a separate market for the trading of small company shares intended to replace the Unlisted Securities Market. After a long board meeting on Thursday, the exchange said it had decided there was insufficient evidence of public support for the creation of a so-called Enterprise Market, with its own management. That proposal has had strong support from venture capitalists and stockbrokers specialising in the shares of smaller companies. Mr Andrew Beeson, chairman of stockbrokers Beeson Gregory and chairman of the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) - which had urged the creation of the new market - said yesterday he was 'disappointed' at the Stock Exchange move. While Cisco still preferred to see an Enterprise Market operating as part of the London Stock Exchange, 'there will be venture capitalists who will be prepared to spawn a new market,' he said. The exchange, in announcing it was shelving the report - if only temporarily  -acknowledged that it has not been seen as a promoter of small company interests. 'There is a widespread perception that the needs of smaller enterprise companies are not always adequately catered for,' the exchange said in a statement. It added that it 'will consider whether changes in the exchange's organisation or in regulatory arrangements are required to deliver the necessary service'. Earlier this year the Stock Exchange said it would close the USM, partly because it was concerned that the distinctions between it and the main official list of traded companies were too blurred. The exchange's Smaller Companies Working Party, established last April, had recommended that the new market be established and operate under the aegis of the Stock Exchange. The working party had suggested that the Enterprise Market could alternatively try to distinguish itself from the Stock Exchange's official list of traded companies by lowering regulatory and reporting requirements for companies whose shares trade there. It had been intended that the working party's report would be released by the Stock Exchange as a consultation document and that no planning would occur until the comment period had expired. However, the board voted instead to commission additional market research aimed at investigating the degree of public support for a new exchange. Privately, some Cisco members said the board's move may have been prompted by fears of embarrassment if the new market failed to attract sufficient support. 'They are saying that if we revamp the secondary market for a second time and it doesn't work we will look really stupid,' one member said. Go-getters, Page 9</p>

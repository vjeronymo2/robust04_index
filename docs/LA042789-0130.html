			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROAD INC. SETS SHIFT TO L.A., TO ADD 200 JOBS  </P> <P> Broad Inc., one of two companies spun off as part of the breakup of Kaufman  &amp; Broad, said Wednesday that it will move the administrative headquarters  of its financial services operation to Los Angeles from Atlanta, creating 200  new jobs locally in the next year.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based firm also plans to invest $15 million in a new service  center in Los Angeles that it hopes will make selling tax-deferred savings  products faster and less costly.  </P> <P> Those announcements are part of several to be presented today to Broad  shareholders in what is expected to be an upbeat first annual meeting as a  separate company.  </P> <P> The company was split away from the former Kaufman &amp; Broad in March, with  home building operations remaining in Kaufman &amp; Broad Home, a company  formed in 1986 that was majority owned by Kaufman &amp; Broad.  </P> <P> The restructuring was designed to enhance shareholder value. Management  believed that the firm was hampered by a "two industry" image that resulted in  its stock selling at ratios below those of home builders or insurance  companies.  </P> <P> So far the strategy seems to have worked. A share of pre-breakup Kaufman &amp;  Broad, worth about $11 in December just before the restructuring was announced,  has risen recently to nearly $16. That price represents the value of one share  of Broad Inc. and 0.73 share of Kaufman &amp; Broad Home, which shareholders of  the former Kaufman &amp; Broad received in the breakup.  </P> <P> Also, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. recently boosted ratings on Broad Inc.'s debt  issues, partly because the company will no longer be burdened with the cyclical  revenues and earnings of home building.  </P> <P> Broad Inc. continues to transform its financial services operation. It has been  divesting traditional life insurance businesses, focusing instead on  faster-growing retirement-oriented savings products such as single-premium  annuities. Those annuities -- which allow investors to accumulate earnings tax  deferred until retirement -- have been gaining popularity, particularly among  middle-aged consumers saving for retirement.  </P> <P> "We think we are in the right market and will be equipped to service our  customers better and more efficiently than anyone else," said Eli Broad,  chairman and chief executive of Broad Inc.  </P> <P> The move of the headquarters of Broad's SunAmerica Corp. financial services  operation to Los Angeles is part of an attempt to move closer to its primary  markets and become the nation's lowest cost provider of retirement-oriented  savings products, Eli Broad said. The move, he said, will allow the firm to  upgrade its caliber of employees and create a new corporate culture and  technology designed to sell annuities and life insurance products in the same  way banks sell certificates of deposit, without lengthy paperwork procedures.  </P> <P> The move, however, will result in layoffs of about 350 workers in Atlanta, whom  the firm opted not to transfer to California.  </P></p>

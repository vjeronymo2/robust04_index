			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Hyatt to run for US Senate seat Mr Joel Hyatt, known across the US for his television advertisements on behalf of his legal services retailing chain, has won the Democratic nomination in the race to succeed his father-in-law, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, as senator for Ohio. The wealthy Mr Hyatt won a closely contested primary on Tuesday by 46 per cent to 44 against a strong challenge from Ms Mary Boyle, a county commissioner, who argued in her campaign that the Senate needed more mothers, not more millionaires nor more lawyers. In the November general election Mr Hyatt will face Mr Michael DeWine, Ohio's Republican lieutenant governor, who won his party's primary with 52 per cent of the votes, defeating Dr Bernardine Healy, former director of the National Institutes of Health. In the same round of voting in Ohio, Congressman David Mann beat off a challenge from Mr William Bowen, a state senator, for the Democratic nomination in his House of Representatives district.</p>

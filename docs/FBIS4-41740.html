			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin  met members of the Russian Agrarian Party group in the Kremlin  today. The deputies briefed the president on their group's  organizational structure and its numerical strength, as well as  on their political positions, which they describe as centrist.  The conversation was devoted to problems of the agro-industrial  complex.    Having noted his full awareness of the difficulties Russian  agriculture was experiencing, the president stressed the need to  develop the agro-industrial complex taking account of the  overall strategy of the country's economic reforms.    It was agreed to continue contacts between presidential  structures and the State Duma's groups, including the Agrarian  Party group, to prepare agreed decisions, the Russian  president's press service told ITAR-TASS.</p>

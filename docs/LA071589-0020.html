			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO  </P> <P> The real tragedy of the North trial was once again the truth has eluded the  American people. Unfortunately, both Bush and Reagan were able to cloak their  involvement in the Iran-Contra affair by pleading "national security" during  the North trial.  </P> <P> I can only hope that the judges who preside at the John Poindexter and Richard  Secord trials will have more judicial backbone than Gesell. If citizen Reagan  is subpoenaed to testify, order him to take the stand or be held in contempt of  court like any other American. Perhaps then all the Iran-Contra scoundrels can  enjoy a "Dutch treat" and the American people may learn the truth.  </P> <P> JOHN S. HORVATH  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

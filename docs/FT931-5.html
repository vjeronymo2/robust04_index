			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: QSP's shares jump SHARES IN Quality Software Products, the accounting software company which came to market last week, moved ahead strongly on the first day of trading, closing 155p up at 535p. Some 2.85m shares had been placed at 380p valuing the company at Pounds 29.6m. About 1.3m shares traded yesterday. The rise raised questions about whether the offer price had been set too low. Analysts said, however, that in the wake of offerings like Tadpole Technology which came to market at 65p and was now trading at 304p there was considerable interest in small, high technology stocks. The difficulty for market makers Hoare Govett, in managing the placement, had been to strike a balance between the company's potential and the fact that the success of its main new product, Universal Olas, was by no means a certainty.</p>

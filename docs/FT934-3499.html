			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Warburg arm leads US stock issue for Cummins Engine The US subsidiary of SG Warburg took another step in its attempt to gain a profitable foothold in the US capital markets yesterday when it lead-managed a Dollars 112.7m issue of new common stock for Cummins Engine, the big Indiana-based engine manufacturer. Although the deal is not particularly large by US standards, it is rare for the US arm of a European investment bank to lead-manage an equity issue by a well-known US corporation. While Warburg has co-managed a number of US issues, Wall Street investment banks traditionally run the books for US companies. Warburg's New York unit, under its American chairman Mr Thomas Wyman, has been pursuing US underwriting business aggressively in the past two years as part of a strategy to reduce the firm's reliance on European investment banking transactions and building a US business independent of the UK parent. At the same time, Warburg has continued to emphasise its strengths in international capital markets. It was this global reach that helped the firm win the mandate from Cummins. The company, which is the world's largest manufacturer of engines, with almost half of its sales generated overseas, wanted to sell a large part of its new stock issue to non-US investors. Although Cummins would not say why it chose Warburg as lead underwriter, Mr Michael Cohrs, head of equity syndication at Warburg, said the firm's ability to distribute Cummins' shares to non-US investors, particularly in the UK and continental Europe, was a crucial factor in winning the deal. Three big US firms, CS First Boston, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Securities, were co-managers of the issue. Ultimately, about 45 per cent of the 2.3m common shares sold in yesterday's issue went to non-US investors, primarily in the UK, Japan, Switzerland, Denmark and France. Warburg said the issue was oversubscribed. It was priced at Dollars 49 per share and at the close of trading Cummins shares were up  5/8 at Dollars 49 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cummins will use the sale proceeds to reduce its debt.</p>

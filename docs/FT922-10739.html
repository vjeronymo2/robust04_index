			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Heseltine faces pressure to refer bid - The Battle for Midland perhaps unstoppable  - political pressure to refer a Lloyds' bid for Midland to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Most Conservative MPs believe he should take a tough stance against Lloyds, in what would be one of his first decisions in his new job. 'If it were to be waved through without a referral there would be great disquiet,' said Sir Michael Grylls, who was chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee in the last Parliament. Labour was also swift to call for an MMC investigation. One MP with experience at the Department of Trade and Industry said the director general of fair trading was almost certain to recommend referral and Mr Heseltine could not refuse  - particularly given the anxiety of Tories about the banks' role during the recession, especially towards small businesses. Hostility towards a Hongkong Bank bid for Midland was less marked because it was seen as less of a threat to competition.</p>

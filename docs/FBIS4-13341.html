			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Reconciliation...Before Peace"] </F>   [Excerpts] Peace with Israel is closer at hand than  reconciliation between the Arab capitals. The achievement of  Arab-Israeli reconciliation is closer than inter-Arab  reconciliation, despite four destructive wars, the occupation of  five Arab countries, and a 45-year old enmity.    This is the bitter truth we are living with. This is the  painful Arab situation we are experiencing despite all the  sincere efforts made by several Arab capitals and the persistent  endeavors of the Arab League secretary general, which no one can  ignore.    The results of the 101st Arab League Foreign Ministers  Council session and all the statements issued by the foreign  ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] after concluding  their meetings in Riyadh indicate very clearly that Arab  reconciliation has become difficult to achieve. Even clearing  the Arab atmosphere as a prelude for achieving reconciliation  will remain a mere "pan-Arab hope" that needs frankness,  face-to-face meetings, and bold and responsible political  decisions with which to face the regional and international  changes. [passage omitted]    The GCC foreign ministers' final statement--which was very  tough on Iraq--means that the Gulf wound has not yet healed.  The statement also put an end to reports about differences and  disagreements in the Gulf countries' stance on the Baghdad  government. It is true that the way Qatar and the Sultanate of  Oman are dealing with Baghdad is unique. It is also true that  the United Arab Emirates has repeatedly called for clearing the  Arab atmosphere. But the six Gulf countries' unanimous approval  of their final statement means that there has been no change  toward the Iraqi Government. [passage omitted]    In a press statement by Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud  al-Faysal--and we note here the rarity of the Saudi official's  statements--he stressed that the GCC has one single objective:  Iraq should implement all UN resolutions. He added that the  essence of these resolutions is the recognition of Kuwait. He  reiterated the need to maintain Iraq's unity and sovereignty  over all its territories and also expressed the GCC countries'  sympathy for the Iraqi people.    The amazing thing is that some of the major countries that  are permanent members of the Security Council--Russia, China,  and France --have declared that Iraq has made progress in  implementing Security Council Resolution 687. Iraq has  officially announced its acceptance of this resolution. This  declaration came at the same time that the six Gulf states  stressed that the Iraqi regime continues to pose a threat to  their security and stability. The GCC countries then welcomed  the continued imposition of the embargo on Iraq!    No one in the world doubts that the Iraqi regime is  responsible for the Iraqi people's sufferings now because of its  invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. All the reports coming  from Baghdad speak about the tragedies that the Iraqi Arab  people are facing and the food, medicine, and children's milk  shortages.    No one disagrees with the fact that the international  treatment of the Gulf crisis was characterized by extreme  arbitrariness and by U.S. determination to destroy everything on  Iraq's territory. Iraq withdrew from Kuwait, complied with the  Security Council resolutions, and then complied with the actions  to dismantle its army and put an end to its military strength.  But to continue the international boycott and the constant  attempt to split Iraq's territories and people is unacceptable  to any conscience or to any Arab. It appears that the issue is  not one of implementing the international resolutions but a plot  to starve the Iraqi people and make that country submit. The  United States is unsheathing its sword and using its pressures  against Iraq, but it ignores or forgets that Israel has the  nuclear power, is daily disregarding the UN resolutions, and is  violating human rights. Still the United States does not act.    The U.S. President is upset when he learns that the Iraqi  people continue to be an asset to the Arab nation despite the  tribulations and horrors it has gone through. The U.S.  President's conscience feels no pain when the reports coming  from Baghdad tell him that the Iraqi capital's hospitals are  suffering from acute shortages of medicine and the absence of  anesthetic necessary for surgery.    It is not a defense of Saddam Husayn or his regime but a  defense of a fraternal Arab people, against whom plots are being  hatched in the name of international legitimacy while this  legitimacy disregards all that is happening inside the occupied  Arab territories and the organized killing of the Bosnian people.    The current situation requires an urgent and responsible  Arab  action to save a fraternal people, clear the Arab atmosphere,  and achieve a comprehensive reconciliation. Reconciliation here  is not for the sake of this or that regime but is a pan-Arab  necessity imposed by the challenges facing the nation. If the  danger is threatening the Iraqi state's unity and pan-Arab  security, then no one in the region can save himself even if he  seeks the help of the major countries' armies. The Arab world's  primary and last guarantee stems from within this world, from  its peoples and regimes. We have no course other than  solidarity so that the torrent does not sweep over us all. If  it does, then neither the oil nor the money will help us protect  the nation's identity and national independence.</p>

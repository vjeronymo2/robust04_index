			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Rodamco loss widens to Fl 405m RODAMCO, the largest property investment company in the Netherlands, yesterday blamed the decline of sterling and a fall in property valuations for a widening of its net total investment losses to Fl 405m (Dollars 230m) in the first nine months of 1992-93. This compared with a loss of Fl 66m over the same period of 1991-92. The company, which is part of the Robeco investment group, said that direct investment results - which comprise rental, interest and dividend income and which help determine the dividend to shareholders - rose to Fl 319m in March-November 1992 from Fl 300m a year earlier. However, indirect results - which include currency movements and property valuations - fell into a loss of Fl 737m from a loss of Fl 386m a year ago. In local currencies, property values were written down by Fl 433m, slightly less than the Fl 441m write-down seen in the same period of 1991-92. At the beginning of the current fiscal year, Rodamco had property assets of Fl 7.7bn. In Britain, which accounts for roughly one-fifth of Rodamco's property portfolio, the value of properties was lowered by 16.6 per cent, nearly double the 8.6 per cent rate for continental Europe and well ahead of the 3.5 per cent for North America. Sterling's depreciation was the main reason why currency movements made a negative Fl 300m contribution to indirect investment results. A year earlier, currency movements had added Fl 49m. The company said that the 1992-93 dividend was likely to be unchanged.</p>

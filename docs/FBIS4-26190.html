			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 18 (CNA) -- The former RCA Taoyuan and  Chupei plants and surrounding areas were declared to be  "seriously contaminated" by the Industrial Technology Research  Institute Friday [17 June].    Results of the institute's random testing of water from  private wells and reports of three foreign industrial consulting  firms have confirmed alarming rates of organic-solvent  contamination in the surrounding areas, institute officials said.    Water in 18 of the 40 wells within a one-kilometer radius of  the Taoyuan plant were found to be contaminated with  trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Tetrachloroethylene  found in water samples taken from well No. 4 registered 210  parts per billion [ppb], which is 42 times higher than the  government-allowed maximum of 5 ppb.    Reports of the Bechtel Corp., which was contracted by  Thomson  Consumer Electronics Co. to investigate pollution at the RCA  plant in 1990, showed that tetrachloroethylene in the plant's  production wells was found to be at levels ranging from 10 parts  per million [ppm] to 1,100 ppm, or 200,000 times higher than the  allowed maximum.    Thomson, a French-based firm, began using the RCA plant in  1988 after it secured the plant from the U.S.-based General  Electric Co. [GE], which bought RCA in 1986.    GE had hired the U.S. industrial consultant D&amp;M Co. to  do  investigation possible contamination around the Taoyuan plant in  1988.    The institute said that both GE and Thomson knew about the  toxic waste but did not take preventive measures to offset any  negative impacts, such as informing plant workers and residents  in the neighborhood to refrain from drinking underground water  in the area. Instead, the two companies chose to bury the  contaminants in 11 wells at the Taoyuan plant and four wells at  the Chupei plant.    Eight other wells in the vicinity of the Chupei plant, now  owned by Japanese-based Ushio Co. which produces halogen lamps,  were also found contaminated with tetrachloroethylene, the  institute said.    The contaminants, however, could be derived from other  sources, it said. Situated behind Ushio is Philips Taiwan,  while Yuloong Styrofoam Co. lies opposite the Chupei plant.    According to medical research data, trichloroethylene and  tetrachloroethylene may be carcinogenic and are damaging to the  liver, heart, and central nervous system.    The environmental protection administration has decided to  speed up operations to enable tap water to be supplied to  residents in the vicinity of the two plants from a source other  than groundwater as soon as possible.    Meanwhile, the construction affairs department of the  Ministry of the Interior announced that it will freeze an  application by the current owner of the Taoyuan plant to use the  land for commercial or residential use rather than for  industrial use.</p>

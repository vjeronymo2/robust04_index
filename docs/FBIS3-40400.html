			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Strategy; Bull: IBM Backs Out; </F> NEC Increases Its Commitment"]    [Text] Bull has enjoyed varying fortunes with its  shareholders. Whereas the State (72.03 percent of the capital),  France Telecom (16.17 percent), and NEC (4.43 percent) promised  to follow the manufacturer's recapitalization, IBM (5.68  percent) for its part refused to do so. The U.S. company chose  to wait and see and backed out, determined to postpone any  additional investment until it has a better picture of the  French manufacturer's business development. On the other hand,  specific industrial partnerships are contemplated. The two  manufacturers decided to accelerate the implementation of the  projects launched in 1992, in particular those involving RISC  [reduced instruction set computer] technologies. IBM's financial  disengagement is bad news for Bull, for which private investors'  contributions give credibility and validity in Brussels to those  made by public shareholders. Besides, Bull did not wait for the  European Commission's assent to set the terms of its  recapitalization at a board meeting held last Wednesday. The  State agreed to make its final contribution (7 billion French  francs [Fr]) during 1993 and 1994. During the same period,  France Telecom will contribute Fr1.572 billion (in addition to  the Fr458 million granted at the beginning of 1993). The  operator's interest in Bull should increase to 17 percent, while  IBM's will decrease. In addition, the manufacturer held a  general meeting of shareholders to approve a capital increase  that should help it reduce its debt from Fr9.4 billion to Fr2.4  billion. In a different context, early in December, Bull and NEC  signed a letter of intent aiming to strengthen their ties in the  fields of computers, components, and telecommunications.  Continuing their collaboration in large systems, they should  also extend it to microcomputers. Moreover, NEC should become a  privileged supplier of Bull for active-matrix color displays,  ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits], and DRAMs  [dynamic random-access memories]. Bull will also help the  Japanese company market communication systems such as VSATs  [very-small-aperture terminals] and identification systems using  fingerprints.</p>

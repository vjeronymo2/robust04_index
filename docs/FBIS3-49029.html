Bratislava company be granted a  license for the STV [Slovak Television] 2 channel. One of CTV's  representatives is Marcel Dekanovsky, the Kosice movie director.    In the course of the preceding weeks, 12 contenders  presented  their concepts to obtain 12 hours of broadcasting time on STV 2.  Slovak Television will continue to operate the channel during  the remaining hours. The commercial station will broadcast from  1700 to 0500 hours. Apart from the victorious CTV, whose  nomination still must be approved by parliament, the license had  also been sought by the following firms: Redstone, Davay, Sola,  Sezam TV, SP, Artep, Markiza, Danube Television Channel, Medium  5, Sitno 5, and Cent Eur (behind which stands U.S. the capital  of Turner BS, which owns, among other things, the Cable News  Network).    In a secret ballot, CTV won five votes from members of the  Council, Cent Eur won three votes, and Sitno 5 won one vote.</p>

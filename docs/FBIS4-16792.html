			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev praised the situation in the Russian Air Force at  a meeting of the Air Force leadership on Monday. This appraisal  is corroborated by some indicative figures revealed to ITAR-TASS  by officials at the Russian Air Force press centre on Tuesday.    Warplanes of the Russian Air Force were air-borne more than  13,000 times over the past week alone. The total flying time  amounted to 6,932 hours. Some 4,000 troops and their family  members as well as 1,000 tonnes of cargoes were flown to  garrisons and army groups between April 11 and 17.    Air Force planes helped to withdraw troops of the West Army  Group from Germany, to bring replacement and foodstuffs to the  201st Motorised Division (Tajikistan) and to replace personnel  and materiel of the 14th Russian Army (Moldova). The Air Force  press centre also reported that 37 international flights were  made at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Presnyakov and Boris Smitiyenko: "Russia </F> Awaits Foreign Investors"]    [Text] According to the available data the number of  enterprises with foreign investments in the Maritime Territory  will grow by 2-2.5 times in the next few years. They are growing  dynamically in the Urals region and Western Siberia (especially  in the Tyumen and Tomsk regions), in the north and north-west of  the European part of the Russian Federation, in the North  Caucasian region (Krasnodar and Stavropol territories) and in  the Volga area (especially in the Samara and Nizhni Novgorod  regions and Tatarstan).    Regions have broad rights in matters of the attraction of  foreign investments. They may conclude agreements on economic  cooperation with regions of foreign countries. These are as a  rule geographically close territories.    According to forecasts, the sectoral structure of foreign  investments in the Russian Federation should in the next few  years change towards the production sphere (up to 70 percent of  foreign investments), the priority sectors being:    oil and gas production;    conversion of the defence industry;    agricultural production and other branches of the  agro-industrial complex;    material and technical equipment of business infrastructure;    industrial application of the results of research and  technical development.    Following are the most important institutions which are  being  formed in Russia for purposes of investment cooperation:    The Russian Agency of International Cooperation and  Development which has replaced the committee for foreign  investments and the committee for technical cooperation with the  World Bank. The agency effects the state policy in the sphere of  international financial and investment cooperation.    The State Investment Corporation whose main  function is the activization of the investment process and the  pursuance of the state investment policy. The corporation  effects the entire investment process, has a considerable  mortgage fund of property worth one billion dollars and an  authorized capital of 50 million dollars and 200 billion  roubles. It is establishing an investment bank, an insurance  company and sectoral insurance funds and plans to set up  foreign branches and offices.    The Russian Financial Corporation attracts, along  with the use of state investment credits and credits of the  Central Bank of Russia, funds of commercial banks and foreign  investors. It has the right to grant state guarantees to foreign  investors.    The international agency for insuring foreign  investments in the Russian Federation from noncommercial  risks was formed by a decree of the President of the  Russian Federation on February 26, 1993. Its main task is to set  up an insurance system which should grant concrete financial  guarantees to foreign investors in addition to the guarantees  offered by the Russian legislation and Russia's obligations  under international treaties.</p>

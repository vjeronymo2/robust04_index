			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Swiss set for vote on talks with Union Swiss voters are likely to be asked in the next four years whether their government should discuss membership of the European Union, Reuter reports from Berne. A statement from the Federal Chancellery yesterday said 101,337 legal signatures - more than the required minimum of 100,000 - had backed a proposal for a referendum on the issue. Unless the proposal is withdrawn, the government is now obliged to hold a vote before January 20, 1998. Proponents of a referendum want the Swiss government to break off all negotiations with the European Union on future membership and begin discussions only with explicit approval of voters. The proposal was launched by members of the right-wing political parties Swiss Democrats and the League of Ticino. Switzerland voted in December 1992 to reject membership of the European Economic Area, but the Berne government continues to support EU membership.</p>

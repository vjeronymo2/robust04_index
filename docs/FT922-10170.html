			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Air Canada sees break-even this year AIR CANADA will achieve break-even on an operating basis this year, and forge alliances with North American, European and Asian airlines, according to Mr Hollis Harris, the president. Mr Harris, a former head of Delta Airlines, said that Air Canada can count on its quality and strong revenue base. But costs are too high and must be cut by 10 per cent more by the end of 1993. This will mean further staff cuts in the hundreds. The sale and leaseback of three Boeing 747-400s and the sale of its credit card operation will bring CDollars 700m cash into Air Canada by year end.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Vodafone steps up phone price war VODAFONE, the leading cellular mobile telephone operator, yesterday announced a 50 per cent cut in peak-time rates for its new MetroDigital service as the price war in the industry intensified, Paul Taylor writes. It also unveiled an interest-free loan scheme which will enable customers to spread the Pounds 240 cost of MetroDigital phones over two years. The moves signal Vodafone's determination to compete head-to-head with Mercury's new One-2-One digital service which is initially limited to within the M25 area. MetroDigital will initially be available in 168 cities and towns. Subscribers will be able to nominate the location of their 'home cell' with peak-time local calls costing 10p a minute and nationwide calls at 12.5p - half existing tariffs. All off-peak calls will cost 5p a minute from the home cell. Lex, Page 18</p>

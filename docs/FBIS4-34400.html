			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Minister Fabio Villegas </F> by reporter Carlos Ruiz and an unidentified reporter at Plaza  Bolivar in Santa Fe de Bogota and by station director Dario  Arizmendi in Emisoras Caracol's Santa Fe de Bogota studios; from  "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts] [Ruiz] Mr. Minister: What is your message to the  nation, through the Caracol network, with regard to today's  election?    [Villegas] I invite all Colombians to vote today, we should  go early to the voting tables to vote and elect en mass our  future president. In our opinion, whoever occupies the  Presidency can do so in a much more legitimate manner, with  greater authority, depending on the extent to which a greater  number of Colombians vote. The goal is to strengthen democracy,  strengthen peace, and strengthen all the values and hopes of the  Colombians. The goal is to defeat violence and those who still  attempt, through terrorism, to impose their political will on  this country.    [Reporter] What report do you have on the situation in the  nation at the opening of the voting tables?    [Villegas] We understand that everything is perfectly  normal.  Nevertheless, yesterday there were some difficulties in southern  Bolivar Department, in the province of [name indistinct] in the  Santander Department. These were taken care of by the public  forces, the electoral organization, and the local authorities.  Early this morning, there were some terrorist actions in  Medellin; however, we hope these will not hamper the normal  development of the elections. The idea is for Medellin to  reaffirm its desire to be a calm capital, as it deserves. One  of the ways to do this is to participate in the elections.    [Ruiz] Have the two delegates of the contending parties been  sent to all the nation's municipalities as they requested?    [Villegas] Presidential delegates were sent to each and  every department in compliance with one of the mechanisms to  give guarantees to the parties that are participating in these  elections. Currently these delegates should be in the  departments. We expect them to act as overseers of the electoral  process and of the performance by the electoral officials, the  electoral organization, and the public forces. They are to  report to the appropriate authorities all their observations,  all the irregularities that they possibly may observe in order  to correct them.    [Ruiz] Mr. Minister, Dario Arizmendi and our colleagues at  Caracol station will now greet you. [passage omitted]    [Arizmendi] A few moments ago we talked with Defense  Minister  Rafael Pardo. He told us that he wanted to study abroad, had  sent applications to some universities, and wants to further  study contemporary issues. He is most certainly thinking about  his future. What will you do after 7 August?    [Villegas] That is the big question. I still do not have an  answer.    [Arizmendi] Would you like a diplomatic post?    [Villegas] There is nothing planned yet. We want to conclude  a series of actions we have pending at the Government Ministry.  One of these is precisely these elections. After that, we will  have the time to think over what is more appropriate. [passage  omitted]</p>

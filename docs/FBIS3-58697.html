			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Ciampi To Summit on </F> Partnerships, Mediterranean"]    [Text] Brussels, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi today hailed the U.S.-sponsored Partnership for  Peace with East Europe -- adopted by the NATO summit this  afternoon -- highlighting how they could be both reinforced by  the Anglo-Italian initiative to bring former Warsaw Pact  countries closer to the European Union, and counterbalanced by a  similar commitment to the Mediterranean area's security.    Addressing the opening session of the summit, Ciampi praised  the "appropriate and timely" nature of the Partnerships for  Peace initiative, but also stressed Italy's concern that it be  accompanied by efforts to bring East European countries closer  to the political and common security dimensions of the  Maastricht Treaty.    In this process, he said, it was imperative not to isolate  but to involve Russia in "an ever closer dialogue" with the  West, while responding to the security and stability needs of  East Europe -- needs that can be met not only via the  Partnership but also through closer ties with the EU [European  Union], he said.    In the other chief concern of his speech, Ciampi said "the  time has come for the Atlantic Alliance to contribute more  directly and systematically to the achievement of conditions of  security and stability in the Mediterranean."    Italy was thus proposing, he said, the creation of a  high-level study group -- initially non-governmental -- of NATO  and Mediterranean countries to lay the groundwork for a future  regional security arrangement. Ciampi urged that these ideas,  "which regard an area of vital interest, not only for Italy,"  should receive "understanding and support" from all NATO  partners.    On transatlantic relations -- in which he called for  outstanding trade disputes to be settled in a spirit of  "cooperation and solidarity" -- Ciampi stressed that the  strengthening of pan-European security and defence structure  will not weaken but reinforce the Atlantic Alliance. But the  crucial element in the present phase, he reiterated, is NATO's  ties with East Europe and with Russia in particular. The  success of the Atlantic Alliance, he said "will depend largely  on our ability to extend co-operation with the new democracies  of Central and East Europe, responding to their needs for  stability and security." The "uncertain" political situation in  Russia, he said, had increased "feelings of insecurity" in East  Europe, prompting desires for NATO membership. This situation  called for "prudence and clear-sightedness," he said, rather  than "premature alarm."    No one can predict how the Russian situation will evolve, he  went on: It will depend "partly on us" to avert the rise of  nationalism and instability. But East European countries must  also work to prevent the occurrence "of what they and all of us  fear," he said.    "In other words, the best way to prevent instability and a  new imperialism in Russia is to try to help Moscow rid itself of  its old complex of isolation and encirclement."    Thus, dialogue with Russia must be increased as much as  possible -- but "Russia must also understand that rash moves  towards its neighbours would be seen as a return to the  ambitions of old, and would call into question the entire  philosophy that inspires our present attitude."    He added that a significant contribution to these efforts  would also come from the increased political importance that  will be given to future meetings of the Group of Seven most  industrialised nations.    Ciampi ended his speech by speaking of another "important  task" facing NATO: a new role in peacekeeping operations under  the aegis of the United Nations or the Conference for Security  and Cooperation in Europe. He voiced Italy's proposal for  looking at the possibility of creating an international  monitoring system that might use advanced technologies to  quickly inform the international community of the violation of  human rights, cease-fires, and other accords.    Another Italian idea Ciampi aired is the the use of  nonlethal  weapons for peacekeeping missions.</p>

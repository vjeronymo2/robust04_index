			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] HANOI, March 14 (AFP) -- The Vietnamese authorities  sounded an anxious new warning Monday about Western influence,  with editorials declaring the communist regime must not be  destabilized by "Western spiritual and cultural pollution."    The editorials have been stepped up since the lifting of the  U.S. economic embargo on Vietnam earlier this year.    In the latest commentaries, both the party and military  newspapers called on Vietnamese to make "the irreversible  choice" toward socialism, taking into account "the thoughts of  Ho Chi Minh" during this period of opening.    The Cold War language since the embargo was lifted earlier  this year betrays the government's suspicions of Western  influence, as increasing numbers [of] Americans have begun  arriving in the country to do business, analysts say.    Following closely the actions of its neighbour China, which  has been facing US pressure on human rights, Vietnam is  emphasizing the primary importance of political stability, and  rejects "interference in its internal affairs."    "The Vietnamese people recognize the leading role of the  party, support political stability as helpful to doing business,  and recognize that pluralism and a multiparty system are  potential causes of social problems," the SAIGON GIAI PHONG  (FREE SAIGON) daily wrote.    The leadership is particularly wary of the return of some of  the one million "Viet Kieu," or overseas Vietnamese who fled to  the United States after the fall of Saigon in 1975.    The leaders are eager for the money and business know-how  the  returnees would bring, but not the political and cultural  influences picked up during years in the West, well-placed  sources said.    The other threat to the regime, the sources said, comes from  inside Vietnam itself in the form of Catholic and Buddhist  dissidents, other intellectuals, and disgraced former party or  military members.    The Vietnamese leadership now enjoys less ideological  support  abroad for its orthodoxy, with only Laos and Cuba left in the  traditional communist camp.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrives for a visit  next week.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Keating control AUSTRALIA's new prime minister has made an impressive start. Economic recovery is under way, inflation has collapsed; interest rates are low; and Mr Keating's colourful adoption of the republican cause looks a potential vote-winner. Little wonder that the popularity of the Liberal opposition - labelled by him a bunch of 'colonial lick-spittelers' - looks increasingly shaky. But Mr Keating must not get carried away in his desire to fuel the recovery. Keeping political power may best be achieved by refraining from exercising it. The new government's desire to kick-start the recovery is understandable. Mr Keating's past errors as Treasurer left Labor trailing 20 per cent in the polls. After six quarters of flat or falling output, with an election looming and with the memory of 18 per cent interest rates fresh in voters' minds, Labor has needed to re-establish its economic credibility. The government was wise to cut interest rates hard last year. Australia shared with the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world in the mid-1980s asset price boom following financial deregulation. It faced a similar legacy of high real interest rates and heavy personal debts and has also paid the price in terms of lost output. But Labor has already gone far enough to stimulate activity. Interest rates have fallen by more than 10 percentage points over the last two years, over twice as far as in the UK; and with the budget deficit relatively small by OECD standards, the government has also been able to introduce a growth-friendly package of higher public spending and tax cuts. Inflation risk Indeed, the danger now is not too little but too rapid growth. The fall in consumer price inflation to just 1.7 per cent is evidence that the past policy of high interest rates has worked; but not a sign that they should be cut further. Further stimulus now could quickly lead to rising inflation and a widening trade deficit. The government would be wise to sit back and let the already substantial easing of both monetary and fiscal policy feed through. The policy lags are long: but output rose in the last quarter of last year and signs from retailers and the housing market suggest that recovery is underway. Mr Keating should instead be deciding how best to change the policy framework to avoid a repeat performance of the latest boom-bust cycle. It is this imperative which makes studying the OECD's latest report worthwhile. Its economic forecast is, as always, ludicrously out of date and should be ignored. The OECD report expects only modest growth; but was finished before the fiscal package was announced at the end of February. Independent bank However, Mr Keating would be wise to follow the OECD's tentative suggestion and cede control over interest rates to a newly independent Reserve Bank charged with maintaining low and stable inflation. Mr Keating did, in fact, do a relatively good job in reducing inflation; but only after it had first been allowed to run out of control. Only with a secure macroeconomic framework will the Labour government be able to pursue its reform agenda confidently. Australia has come a long way in the last decade from its protectionist and over-regulated past. But there is further to go: in cutting tariffs, improving transport networks, deregulating the public sector and raising educational standards. But Australia should be wary of undermining the system of consensus wage-bargaining that has guided wage and price expectations over the past decade. True, the series of national wage accords has prevented changes in relative wages from effectively signalling shifts in supply and demand to workers. Australia's labour productivity growth record in the 1980s has not been impressive; but nor was that of decentralised America. The rapid fall in wage inflation during the recent recession has not been achieved in partially decentralised and unco-ordinated Britain. The Labor government has set itself ambitious goals. But Mr Keating would be better placed to pursue his constitutional and liberalising agenda if he were to relinquish control over monetary policy. It might not suit his character to give up power to his central bank; but the risks of holding on to the policy reins outweigh the apparent gains of being able to manipulate interest rates before elections. Mr Keating has already done enough manipulating.</p>

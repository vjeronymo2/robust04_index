			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton on Friday assured visiting South Korean Foreign Minister  Han Sung-chu that there will be no high-level talks between  Washington and Pyongyang unless there is an exchange of special  envoys by the two Koreas.    Saying he was happy to receive a personal letter from Korean  President Kim Yong-sam, Clinton stressed the importance of  inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation between Seoul and  Washington in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem,  according to Korean envoy on nuclear affairs Kim Sam-hun.    The U.S. President said he looked forward to meeting  President Kim at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  summit slated for Jakarta, Indonesia, in November.    Han, delivering a verbal message from Kim, said Seoul  welcomed Pyongyang's acceptance of International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspections, but noted it was just the first step  toward a resolution and Seoul thus wished to continue close  cooperation with Washington.    Kim was quoted as saying that because of Pyongyang's  unpredictability given past experience with the communist  regime, South Korea and the United States should tread  cautiously in dealing with North Korea. Kim also stressed that  Seoul and Washington will abide by the principles --  implementation of IAEA inspections and exchange of presidential  envoys between South and North Korea -- that are prerequisites  to a third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks as agreed  at a summit last November in Washington.    Clinton reportedly responded to Kim's personal letter  delivered last week by reaffirming the initial Seoul-Washington  agreement on thorough and broad settlement of the North Korean  nuclear problem.    Han tried to schedule a meeting with Clinton during his Feb.  10- 11 stay in Washington before visiting Canada to personally  deliver Kim's letter, but failed due to the Washington-Tokyo  summit.    The foreign minister made a second stop in Washington to  coordinate further efforts on the nuclear problem following  North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections. He headed for  Seoul after his meeting with Clinton.</p>

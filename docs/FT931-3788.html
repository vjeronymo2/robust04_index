			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Everest: the ultimate high - Rebecca Stephens sets off in the steps of Everest's first climbers LORD HUNT, the veteran mountaineer, looked at me gently. 'Everest was not my favourite mountain,' he said 'And I doubt, my dear, it will be yours.' Only three years ago at mount Everest's base camp, I met four French women who I thought were, quite simply, mad for wanting to reach the 29,028ft peak. Surely women had more sense. Women wanted to create life and preserve it, not throw it away for a mountain, I thought. But this week I am on my way to Everest to face the same dangers as they did in an attempt on the summit. Our expedition is intended to mark the 40th anniversary of the first ascent of Everest by the British expedition led by Colonel John Hunt. It has been endorsed by Sir Edmund Hilary, who, with Sherpa Tensing, was the first to reach that majestic peak on 29 May 1953. Our team - the DHL British 40th Anniversary Everest Expedition - will climb by the same route they took, by the Western Cwm and South Col. We aim to raise Pounds 1m for Sir Edmund's Himalayan Trust, a charity which helps build schools and hospitals for the Sherpa people, and conserve their The expedition will cost some Pounds 250,000. Sponsors include DHL, New York-based investment banking group The Carter Organization, Sally Ferries, Glenmorangie, Foundation for Sport and the Arts and, clothing us head to toe, Karrimor. After two years of preparation we set off this week from Kathmandu to trek through the foothills to Everest base camp. In April we shall set up camps high on the mountain aiming to climb, weather allowing, in May. The expedition, the idea of merchant banker Peter Earl and led by John Barry, a mountaineer of some repute, is nine climbers strong. It includes names such as Bill Barker, Harry Taylor, both Everest veterans, Dave Walsh, Dave Halton, John Rowe and Dr Sandy Scott. I am going as an amateur. In the autumn of 1989 I was at Everest Base Camp reporting for the Financial Times on an Anglo-American attempt on the North East Ridge. I did not climb; had never climbed. But since then I have become quietly obsessed, abandoning holidays on the beach for the hillier parts of Africa, Europe - climbing Mount Kenya, Kilimanjaro and Mont Blanc - and most recently Alaska, where the Everest gang climbed north America's highest, and coldest peak, Mount McKinley. The addiction takes a hold, like any drug. And now I want to be the first British woman to reach the top of Everest. What is it about the mountain that still draws climbers four decades after the first ascent? 'Everest became rather more than a mountain,' Hunt says. 'It is so easy to idealise our expedition, but there was enormous pressure to be the first expedition - and a British one at that - to climb the mountain. All the more so because following the war we were preceded (on the mountain) by the Swiss and to be followed by the French.' Hunt, and he suggests most of the 1953 team, agreed with the words of Eric Shipton - who until six months earlier had been leader of the expedition - when, on hearing of their success, said: 'Thank Goodness, now we can get on with some real climbing.' In the last 40 years 469 men and 16 women have stood on the summit of Everest; 117 have died in attempts to do so. Man has climbed it solo, without oxygen, and in May of last year 32 people queued to stand on the summit on a single day. Is the climb easier? Has Everest shrunk? Or is it that modern equipment  - Gore-tex, quick-wicking fabrics which allow perspiration to escape, plastic boots, light-weight oxygen cylinders - and an advancement in the understanding of high altitude physiology has enabled climbers to overcome the effects of the drastic reduction in ambient oxygen levels and the associated susceptibility to the cold? 'It's easy to overplay the difference in equipment. I think we were well equipped,' said Hunt; though undoubtedly the net weight of clothing and oxygen then was considerably higher than it is today. 'Stoves were important,' he said; a comment that reveals quite how experimental such things were in the 1950s. The Swiss failed in 1952 because their stoves failed. The Brits knew this, and made sure that their stoves could melt enough snow to enable each climber to drink at least seven pints of liquid a day. It was revolutionary knowledge then, that it might be essential to consume large quantities of liquid at high altitude; today it is part of traditional mountaineering wisdom. The biggest difficulty to overcome on that first ascent was, said Hunt, 'the psychological problem.' To enter the Western Cwm climbers must first clamber up the Khumbu Icefall: 2,000ft of gaping crevasses and shifting monoliths of ice, that collapse and tumble with a whim. 'Terrifying,' said Lincolne Rowe, an artist accompanying us on the expedition, who twice has been high on Everest. 'I can say so; I'm an artist.' In Hunt's day it had been passed only twice: 'It was a real hazard to be reckoned with.' A greater problem still was the last 1,000ft or so to the summit: 'There was that uncertainty about man's ability to do it. The Sherpas suffered especially from those doubts, and their superstitions that they should incur the wrath of the gods for venturing above the South Col.' It was a sacred summit: 'The monks at Thyangboche Monastery (in the foothills) quite clearly didn't want us to get to the top,' said Hunt. On the climbers' return the monks congratulated them - for 'nearly reaching the summit.' How different today: Ang Phurbar, the head Sherpa on our expedition, has reached the summit twice. The barrier of doubt is down. Might a woman have been invited to climb Everest in 1953? 'Inconceivable,' said Hunt. 'Had there been a girl she would have been one of us - that would be natural, normal,' he reflected. But there were very few male climbers then, and especially few women climbers. When the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme - of which Lord Hunt was a founding director - opened its doors to girls in 1958, it was considered their preferred pursuits might be make-up and hair-style, dress design and flower arranging, not motorcycle maintenance or potholing. This spring, eight young people from the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme - boys and girls - are accompanying us to Base Camp Everest, each one climbing Island Peak (20,380ft) en route. In 1953, Hunt's expedition had Everest to themselves. This spring there will be some 20 expeditions on the south side of the mountain alone. But as Hunt chose to entitle his loosely autobiographical book, Life is Meeting. He, and Ed Hillary, George Lowe, George Band and Michael Westmacott will be rekindling their 40 year friendship at a 1953 Everest reunion in Khumbu this spring. With luck, we will meet them; and the old Everest hands will be able to throw a tips to nine modern-day aspirants, as they trek by.</p>

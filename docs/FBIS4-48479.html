			<p>BFN     [Text] Niamey, May 19 (AFP) -- Fifteen Tuareg rebels were  killed and five government troops wounded when an Army patrol  clashed with rebels trying to steal an official vehicle,  Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou told AFP Thursday [19 May].    Five rebels were detained after the incident, which happened  Monday between Assode and Timia, in the Iferouane region.    Troops seized a four-wheel drive vehicle, weapons,  ammunition  and various documents of the Front for the Liberation of the Air  and Azawagh (FLAA), one of four Tuareg rebel movements in Niger.    The clash came after the government and the rebels last week  said they would seek a negotiated end to the three-year conflict  which has claimed more than 100 lives.    Officials from mediating countries -- Algeria, Burkina Faso  and France -- met with delegates from the two sides last week  and said the government and the rebels agreed in principle to a  meeting soon.    Both sides last met in Ouagadougou in February.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Launching a company with a little 'fringe lunacy' - Nick Garnett meets the creator of the modern amphibious vehicle 'IT PROBABLY takes an Irishman to build something like this.' Well, Sean Dooley-Power is Irish and he has built it. A curious creature is his creation. As tall as a small house and looking a bit Heath Robinson, like something made by sixth formers for a science competition, the C-MAC amphibian nevertheless incorporates clever technology. It can also transport 36 passengers at 35 miles per hour on land and seven knots on water. All Dooley-Power now has to do to make a business out of this curious beast is to persuade potential customers to buy the four-wheel-drive machine. So far, the venture, including building the prototype, has absorbed more than Pounds 150,000 with no return. 'It has felt a bit like the loneliness of the long distance entrepreneur,' Dooley-Power says. Dooley-Power, a 37-year-old business-studies graduate, worked for the Ford motor company, a merchant bank and a property company, married a Jersey woman and moved to the Channel Islands. A home-catering business provides the family with a regular income but Dooley-Power wanted to be a different kind of entrepreneur. After helping to design and build three old-fashioned amphibians for a Jersey operator he started to plan what he claims is the first significant technical advance in amphibious vehicles since the lorry-based landing craft of the second world war. 'I've taken the concept where it was left back in 1945 and put in modern design criteria, modern survivability demands and modern technology.' Instead of a truck chassis with a propeller, Dooley-Power's tiny company, C-MAC Industries, offers a boat with wheels. It incorporates a 200hp air-cooled engine with power and steering in the water provided by swivelling water jets. There is no direct mechanical drive between the engine and the separate motors on each of the four wheel hubs. So there are no metal components such as a drive shaft to suffer rust under water. The bottom of the amphibian is just a flat box. The company has a patent on a hydraulic mechanism which transfers power from one axle to the other as the vehicle leaves or enters the water, creating greater traction. So far, so good. But Dooley-Power has been forced to learn some pertinent, if unsurprising, lessons about trying to start a business on the back of a new product. The first lesson was that he had to build the vehicle. 'I learnt that you cannot sell a concept off a set of drawings. No one wants to know. I had to make a prototype.' This was even though the drawings were made by a proven boat designer, Stan Goldman, whom Dooley-Power met at a boat show. The second lesson was that on a project like this, the banks will, in unison, turn up their noses. 'I wrote to 26 banks and got nowhere. I also tried 3i and they were dismissive. I was naive enough to believe that my commitment to the venture would be good enough. Instead people start thinking of you as a kind of Walter Mitty." The funding for the project, says Dooley-Power, has come from Kevin Leech, head of quoted company ML Laboratories, also a Jersey resident. The backer has taken a 50 per cent stake in the company in return for funding the Pounds 138,000 needed to build a prototype. This money includes all the fees to obtain approval from Lloyd's Register for sea-going vessels and the Department of Transport. The cost was partly inflated by the need to use sub-contractors. The aluminium-bodied amphibian was constructed by an engineering company in Cornwall. 'What that means though is that my fixed overheads are kept down to zero,' says Dooley-Power, whose hero is Joe Bamford, founder of JCB, the earth moving machinery manufacturer. Another lesson he is still learning is that luring customers usually proves a hard slog. Dooley-Power has spent Pounds 20,000 of his own money on the project, partly taken up by visiting potential customers overseas. 'We have proved the concept and the vehicle is virtually maintenance free but nevertheless people always ask: 'How many have you sold?'.' Possible customers include existing operators of passenger-carrying amphibious vehicles to islands one or two miles from the mainland and operators wanting an amphibious work boat, including oil companies using pipelines in swampy terrain and local authorities faced with oil and algae pollution of ports and beaches. The basic machine will cost Pounds 160,000 but a range of different work platforms are offered as well as four-wheel steer. Dooley-Power says the venture includes an element of 'fringe lunacy'. Being immersed in it for the past few years has resulted in many a sleepless night. But he is convinced there is a slot for the C-MAC. 'It is, though, the ultimate niche market.' The machine has taken two years to complete. The next year or two will decide whether it sinks or swims. C-MAC Industries, PO Box 447, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands. Tel: 44-534-44454.</p>

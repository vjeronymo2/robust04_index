			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Poland opts for TV ads Hortex, Poland's largest fruit and vegetable processing group, is setting an example for other eastern European companies adapting to the rigours of a market economy. The company recently decided to spend money on advertising, marketing and distribution. 'We noticed that our fruit juices were no longer being sold from under the counter but standing on shop shelves,' says Wojciech Zelazny, a deputy president. 'So we decided to advertise.' Last month the first tailored TV advertisments were aired in a 5bn zloty campaign run by BBDO Warsaw - the first step of its kind by a Polish company, according to Dorota Walczyk, Warsaw chief of BBDO, the advertising and marketing agency. Hortex, which recorded sales worth 3,500bn zloty (Pounds 145.3m) last year, plans to spend 50bn zloty on distribution this year. Walczyk praises her client. 'There were no differences of opinion and they were willing to learn.' She may have been lucky as Brian Dunnion who heads Saatchi and Saatchi in Warsaw says Polish companies have 'a producer mentality'. 'They still haven't thought out who they are producing for,' he says, noting this as the main problem in dealing with Polish clients. Last year his company's Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.4m) turnover in Poland came mostly from western multinational clients, but Dunnion is looking for local firms to work for. 'This is where the growth is will come from.' For Walczyk speed is essential because costs - such as the price of air time  -and competition are increasing. The Hortex campaign is aimed at consumers and places less emphasis on work with retailers and wholesalers. But the wholesaler culture which has grown in Poland in the past three years decrees only goods advertised on TV move in large quantities. If the wholesalers and retailers see the juices on TV they will believe it will sell and will take larger orders, says Walczyk.</p>

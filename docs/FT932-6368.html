			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BICC to float Andover on Nasdaq BICC, the international cables and construction group, is to float its US subsidiary, Andover Controls, on the Nasdaq National Market System. The flotation of Andover, which makes micro-computer based building automation systems, follows BICC's decision to concentrate on its core businesses. BICC is making an initial public offering of 3m shares (about 60 per cent) of the common stock at an estimated price of between Dollars 14 and Dollars 16 per share. Upon completion, it will retain an interest of some 33.8 per cent in Andover (24.8 per cent if the underwriters' over allotment option is exercised in full) and Andover employees will hold about 6.2 per cent. Net proceeds received by Massachusetts-based Andover, estimated at Dollars 41.4m (Pounds 27m), will be used to repay intercompany indebtedness.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Management: Dangers of the office 9-5 - A look at ways to combat violence in the workplace Workplace violence is escalating rapidly in the US. In California alone, workplace homicides surged from 159 deaths in 1992 to 195 last year, and the final tally for 1994 is likely to be even higher. Ironically, the epidemic of violence has spread as the total number of workplace fatalities has diminished. 'We've become good at preventing death in other categories such as contact with hazardous chemicals and falls,' says John Howard, director of the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Calosha). 'But violence is still a big concern.' Homicide accounts for 17 per cent of all workplace fatalities in the country, just behind motor vehicle accidents, according to the Bureau for Labour Statistics. The National Occupational Safety and Health Administration says it is working on recommendations to counteract the problem. Although the US media has recently highlighted violent acts by disgruntled employees, most incidents occur during rob-beries. 'These workplace risks have been ignored in the past because they are seen as part of a larger crime problem,' says Guy Toscano, an economist with the US Department of Labour. 'But they are so big we must pay attention to them.' Taxicab drivers are murdered at higher rates than workers in other professions, accounting for 26.9 per cent of the US total, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh). Liquor store workers are next in line, accounting for 8 per cent. Other risky places to earn a living are petrol stations, detective services, grocery stores, jewellery stores, hotels, restaurants and bars. Non-fatal assaults also plague American workers. More than 670,000 Americans were assaulted at their place of employment in 1992, according to the National Crime Victimisation Survey, and the figure represents about 11 per cent of all violent crimes in the US. 'Besides the risk to workers, these incidents affect businesses because of missed work and decreased productivity,' says Howard. A substantial number of victims are carers in nursing homes and hospitals. They are usually injured by their patients. Niosh and Calosha guidelines advise stores to keep their car parks as brightly lit as the local law allows, to post signs that a limited amount of cash is on hand, and to install silent alarms. They suggest that employers in health care and other service industries instruct workers in how to defuse hostile situations involving patients or clients, to install alarm systems or panic buttons as a back-up and to consider establishing a buddy system or hiring security personnel. Workplace crimes of passion by disgruntled employees, or a worker's spouse, friend or lover are not as common as other assaults. But Calosha recommends that employers look for tell-tale signs that a person may become violent and ensure that employees with severe emotional problems have someone to turn to, such as a staff psychologist. Offices should be closed late at night and early in the morning (most attacks occur between 6pm and 10am). Employees should be discouraged from working in offices alone, and employers should encourage female employees to let them know if they are being stalked.</p>

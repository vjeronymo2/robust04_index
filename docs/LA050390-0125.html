			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL RESPONDS TO RISE IN GANG VIOLENCE  </P> <P> A group of 50 residents told the City Council Tuesday that gang crime has  become an epidemic here.  </P> <P> "The question is not whether a gang war exists in San Gabriel, but how bad is  it?" said the Rev. Gerardo de Jesus, pastor of the Love Gospel Fellowship  Church at La Casa de San Gabriel Community Center. "What we want is a program  that is preventive in nature and educational."  </P> <P> He cited the city's three gang-related killings since September, saying that  the city must spend more money for programs that work directly with gang  members.  </P> <P> Group member Olivia Lopez told the council her 15-year-old nephew is a wanna-be  -- someone who wants to be a gang member.  </P> <P> "What we're asking for is a gang task force to come into the community and  reach the wanna-bes," she said.  </P> <P> "I'm here tonight because I'm fighting for my nephew's life," Lopez told the  council. "I'm asking the San Gabriel City Council for help, help in getting a  program to get our youths off the streets."  </P> <P> In response, Mayor James Castaneda formed an eight-member committee of  community members and city and police officials.  </P> <P> The committee will work with Los Angeles-based Community Youth Gang Services to  develop a way for San Gabriel to deal with the problem of youngsters who will  be idle in the summer.  </P> <P> Castaneda acknowledged that the gang problem is the worst it's "ever been in  the 10 years that I have been here."  </P> <P> Since December, Castaneda and Police Capt. David A. Lawton have been meeting  with the group of residents, who call themselves the San Gabriel Community  Interfaith Program.  </P> <P> Lawton said: "I don't think that anybody is denying that there's a gang  problem. But I see a cyclical gang problem. Right now, we're at a higher level  of the cycle."  </P> <P> Before the three gang-related killings in the past year, there had been none  for two years, he said.  </P> <P> But De Jesus said some people think gang-related crime goes under-reported and  that not enough is done by city and school officials to quickly remove gang  graffiti.  </P> <P> "There's so much fear in the community," he said. "City officials and the  powers that be seem not to take a real concern about it."  </P> <P> In March, the City Council authorized a $25,000 reward for any information that  leads to an arrest and a conviction in any of the three gang-related killings.  </P></p>

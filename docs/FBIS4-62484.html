			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Svetlana Kalinkina -- </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk, 16 May -- Fulfilling the decision of the Holy  Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Belarusian clergy will  not take part in the Republic's first presidential election.    A BELINFORM correspondent was informed at the office of the  diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church that there is no  substance in reports that the clergy are canvassing for one  candidate or another or participating in groups. At the same  time some church ministers have until now been actively engaging  in politics; deputies at various levels are permitted to  complete their term in office as set out by the law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmenta; from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] [Sarmenta] The first meeting between the Zapatist  National Liberation Army [EZLN] delegates and Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis ended a few minutes ago at the Cathedral of  San Cristobal de las Casas. They spoke to the national and  international media, which has arrived here in San Cristobal de  las Casas.    Bishop Samuel Ruiz pointed out that yesterday both sides  basically worked on the mechanisms for the negotiation.  Subcommander Marcos and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis,  in an act of friendship and great symbolism, both carried a  Mexican flag to the location of their meeting with the national  and international media. We must point out that we had access  to the cathedral in San Cristobal de las Casas at approximately  1730 under tight security measures. All our equipment was  inspected. There were numerous reporters from various parts of  the country and the world.    Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that in this first meeting they  basically talked about a dialogue, which has been initiated with  goodwill. He said there is a high degree of communication  between the sides precisely to achieve good negotiations. He  said there is mutual respect. The bishop said both sides  introduced themselves and translation was necessary because some  representatives of the EZLN....[three-minute break in reception]    [Begin EZLN Subcommander Marcos recording in progress]  ....so that the dialogue is possible. He especially praised  the work done by the national mediation commissioner, Bishop  Samuel Ruiz, and his team. He especially congratulated and sent  greetings to the men and women of the nongovernment  organizations, who are the ones who are guaranteeing the  security of our leaders. Subsequently, we talked about how we  would discuss the points contained in the list of demands, which  the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee will present  tomorrow. We talked about the problems at the national and  state levels and those specifically having to do with the  peasants and Indians.    Today we basically talked about the agenda for the dialogue  that began today and which we hope will continue tomorrow.  Members of the committee are willing to listen to the words of  the federal government. We also believe the commissioner is  also willing to listen to what the EZLN has to say. That is how  we prepared everything to initiate the discussion scheduled to  be held tomorrow. That is what we have to say to the national  and international media. [end recording]    [Unidentified Radio ACIR announcer in Mexico City] That was  the voice of Subcommander Marcos, who is the official spokesman  of the delegates and representatives of the armed wing of the  EZLN.    [Sarmenta] Subcommander Marcos said they believe Manuel  Camacho Solis is willing to contribute to a fruitful dialogue.    [Announcer] Subcommander Marcos talked about the topics of  the agenda that will be discussed tomorrow. I remember that in  his latest statement, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho said  that in this peace dialogue they would not talk about any topic  in the national agenda. There is apparently a victory for the  EZLN in this dialogue.    [Sarmenta] That is true. Manuel Camacho Solis had pointed  out that in this topic they would not discuss national issues,  however, he pointed out that he would be willing to listen to  all the concerns of the EZLN delegates. I can also report that  a small kiosk was set up in front of the main altar of the  cathedral. Both sides sat down at a table there. A Mexican  flag was set up behind the kiosk. We must point out that the  person who attracted the most attention from photographers and  cameramen was undoubtedly Subcommander Marcos. The peace  commissioner spoke later on. He pointed out that they have come  a long way from war to politics, from weapons to dialogue.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I appreciate Samuel Ruiz'  hospitality and the respectful behavior shown by the EZLN  clandestine committee members.    You witnessed a very important event a few minutes ago. You  and all the people who are sitting here owe allegiance to only  one flag. We all stood up to show our respect to this national  flag that unifies us all. This dialogue is being held on  Mexican territory. The EZLN is an organization of Chiapas  residents who are Mexican -- predominantly Indian -- citizens.    The key point of this negotiation is that it allows us to go  from force to politics. We are going from weapons to dialogue.  Words, not weapons, are talking right now. There are mutual  guarantees. That is why we are here. Both parties respect each  other. We are attempting to find a solution to the conflict  through the political dialogue channel. This new political  situation should not be reversed, not only because both parties  are willing to talk but because it is the will and the demand of  Mexican society. My media friends, this is what I have to  report to you at present. Thank you. [end recording]    [Sarmenta] After Subcommander Marcos and Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis talked Bishop Samuel Ruiz told reporters  that from now on we will probably be told ahead of time if there  is to be a news conference or an interview with one of the  parties at this dialogue. He said, however, that in this first  meeting with the press the commissioners had expressed their  points of view but reporters would not be allowed to ask  questions. We were also informed that the list of EZLN demands  will be revealed tomorrow, as well as Peace Commissioner Manuel  Camacho Solis's reply to those demands.    [Announcer] Jose Luis, I thank you very much for this  detailed report on what has just happened at the San Cristobal  de las Casas Cathedral in Chiapas. This is the peace fortress  where the first peace and reconciliation meeting is ending right  now. It is so good to hear the EZLN members and the peace  commissioner state that they will continue to discuss the topics  on the agenda tomorrow because this shows that the dialogue is  to continue. We, as many Mexicans, believe that while the  parties in conflict sit and talk, words and not firearms, will  talk.    [Sarmenta] Right. At the meeting, the fact that the dialogue  started with the opportune mediation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz and  that there is mutual respect between the EZLN members and the  peace commissioner was underscored.    [Announcer] However, we are worried about what is happening  in other areas of Chiapas State. We reported to our ACIR Radio  Noticias listeners a few minutes ago that the cattlemen and  people who have had to move from the area because of the  conflict in Altamirano area in the Chiapas highlands....[pauses]  We are worried because one of the regents of the Altamirano  municipal council said the cattlemen had threatened to return  tomorrow to recover their ranches -- with or without permission.  There are more than 101 ranches in that area. This prompts  apprehension because right now that region can be compared to  very dry grasslands during the hot season -- any spark can set  things on fire.    [Sarmenta] Yes Pepe, we have kept abreast of the events at  Altamirano. Up to now, the people in the area have not suffered  any type of physical pressure due to the cattlemen's threats.  However, we will be attentive to this situation.    [Announcer] We will be attentive and I thank you for this  report. Thank you, Jose Luis.</p>

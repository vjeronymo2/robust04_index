			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: When loyalty loses to commercial strategy - David Wighton on LWT's fight to avoid becoming part of the Granada Group Their Pounds 50m worth of shares may provide a little consolation, but there was no disguising the disappointment of LWT's directors yesterday. They felt badly let down. Shareholders had sold out to Granada rather than stick with the team that had delivered them such sparkling returns over the past four years. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, did not conceal his feelings about Mercury Asset Management, LWT's largest shareholder, which accepted Granada's offer on Thursday. 'We have performed outstandingly well, particularly for MAM, and I think we were entitled to their support when we needed it.' Some observers have seen MAM's decision as another example of the ruthless, short-termism of some institutional investors. 'I can't remember when a management with such a good record was not backed in a hostile bid,' said one analyst yesterday. 'If the LWT team doesn't deserve loyalty nobody does.' But institutions that accepted the bid dismissed such arguments. One said: 'We have a high opinion of LWT's management, but then we do of Granada's too. In the end it came down to commercial strategy, and, of course, price.' For many institutions the debate over price was finely balanced, but in terms of commercial strategy LWT's defence had a serious flaw. 'The defence was that LWT had a rosy future as an independent company, but that was inconsistent with management actions,' said one institution. Most observers agree with Granada's charge that LWT's defence had been strong on presentation - with Sir Christopher and his chief executive, Mr Greg Dyke, proving a very effective double act - but weak on content. 'You kept on thinking they must have a rabbit to pull out of the hat. But they hadn't, or if they had it died,' said one analyst. Plans for a link with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Anglia came unravelled almost immediately. The more promising talks with US West, which expressed interest in taking a 29.9 per cent stake in LWT, were cut short when the Takeover Panel refused to allow the US telephone giant to make a formal approach. Hopes that LWT would be saved by a referral to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission were also quickly dashed. The takeover clock was stopped for a week while the Office of Fair Trading considered the concentration of advertising market share following a successful bid. But the clock restarted after Granada undertook to limit its share of UK television net advertising revenue to 25 per cent by August 31 1995. That left LWT's defence relying largely on its 1993 profits forecast, showing a 43 per cent increase on the previous year. Granada, attempted to cast doubt on the figures - making claims it was subsequently forced to retract by the Takeover Panel - but the much better than expected forecast meant it had little chance of success without raising its bid. It tried to secure a recommendation for an increased offer. But Sir Christopher turned down the 8 per cent improvement in the paper terms. 'I think if there had been an eight on the front it would have been agreed,' said one institution. 'But in the end you wonder whether it became a personality issue.' Sir Christopher yesterday insisted that there had been no acrimony and congratulated Granada on its fine judgment. 'Their decision not to go for a recommendation was vindicated. They would have had to pay more. As it is they have got a great company at what I am sure will prove to be a great price.' Some analysts have questioned whether Granada was right not to pay that bit more for a recommendation. 'LWT is a people business with some very good managers who Granada needs. They have taken a big risk by not getting agreement.' However, some in the Granada camp dismiss the idea that most of the top executives will leave. 'I think Gerry Robinson is too smart to let them go. If the top people walk out he will have a problem.' Sir Christopher, who is also chairman of Life Sciences, the quoted laboratory equipment group, has known from the start that there would be no room for him in the enlarged Granada group. Of his future he will only say: 'We will see. There is a large pile of unopened letters on my desk.' One colleague said yesterday: 'I would be surprised if he is not chairman of a Footsie company within the next three months.'</p>

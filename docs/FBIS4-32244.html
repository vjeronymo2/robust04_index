			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. C.: The Generals' Offensive] </F>   [Text] The reform of the Polish command structures of the  armed forces was completed in the middle of last year. It turned  out that, in the close-knit command structure, there is room for  four civilians (the minister and deputy ministers responsible  for education, foreign affairs, and what is called logistics)  and only one general, i.e., the chief of the General Staff.  Almost all of the institutions that had an influence on the  Army, including the military intelligence services, were located  in the civilian structures of MON [Ministry of National  Defense]. The General Staff became virtually just an executive  agency. The generals feel that, at that time, the Army was  without leadership during peacetime because it was difficult to  regard a civilian as the head, the minister of defense.    After the elections in 1993, the new minister of defense,  Piotr Kolodziejczyk, suspended the organizational rules drafted  by his predecessor, Janusz Onyszkiewicz. A considerable portion  of the responsibility for the Army was transferred to the  General Staff. At present, it [the General Staff] consists of  four main members: the Inspectorate of Training, to which are  subordinate, among others, the facilities for combat training,  education, and schooling, physical training, as well as the  military police forces, and the commanders of the branches of  forces; the Logistics Inspectorate; the Department of Strategic  Planning; and the Department of Organization-Mobilization. The  General Staff also includes the special services, i.e.,  intelligence and military counterintelligence. At the same time,  the jurisdiction of the previously existing civilian department  has been curtailed considerably. A portion of the special  services has been placed here, however. Those who support  Onyszkiewicz's reform think that the chief of the General Staff  has been made independent of the minister of defense inasmuch as  (under the new disciplinary regulations) he is in charge of all  of the servicemen also assigned to the MON structures.    For the present, however, there is no legal document that  would eliminate the supreme authority of the Minister of  National Defense. This may happen in the future when a general  (the commander of the Armed Forces) is subordinate to the  president alone. Several plans exist for a new supreme command,  i.e., the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces. Along with  each of them, the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces  (before the war, an institution by the same name existed, whose  head answered only to the president) will be composed of three  inspectorates (ground forces, air forces and air defense, and  the navy), as well as the General Staff, with considerably  smaller jurisdiction than it has currently.</p>

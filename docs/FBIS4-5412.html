			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Leaders of four parties in  the ruling coalition agreed Monday [11 April] to urge other  partners in the administration to meet in an effort to break the  stalemate over selection of a successor to departing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    "We reaffirmed that we shouldn't prolong this period of  political vacuum," Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP)  [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference.    "We thus agreed to strive to hold a meeting of parties'  leaders at 10 A.M. tomorrow," said the chief of the largest  coalition contingent.    Other leaders who joined Monday's session include Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads new party  Sakigake (Harbinger) and Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi  of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).    Eiichi Nakamura of the Democratic Reform Party, a small  parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, also attended.    The gathering of the four coalition figures came shortly  after top officials of the ruling parties agreed to continue  mulling the choice of a replacement for Hosokawa at their caucus  for the time being, not at a meeting of ruling parties' heads.    Murayama said he will call on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Management and Coordination  Agency Chief Koshiro Ishida of Komeito and Hosokawa of the Japan  New Party (JNP), to attend the planned session on Tuesday.    "I will tell them to compare notes at a meeting of parties'  heads to minimize the political vacuum and work together to  fulfill our duties to the public," he added.    Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP had flatly refused to hold a  summit of coalition parties' leaders on Monday.    The SDPJ chief denied the four leaders discussed during  Monday's meeting a possible change in the current framework of  the coalition government, which was formed last August.    There is a growing rift among the ruling parties on the  selection of a candidate for premier and the shape of the new  government.    Hosokawa, 56, announced his resignation Friday to take  responsibility for a gridlock in the Diet budget debate spawned  by allegations of financial impropriety.    Hosokawa will remain in office as caretaker until his  replacement is chosen.    Hata is tipped as the most likely candidate for the  premiership. But some coalition members say Murayama and  Takemura are also on a list of candidates.    Also, the Shinseito-Komeito bloc is considering fielding  former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the primary  opposition Liberal Democratic Party as a candidate to succeed  Hosokawa in a move to split the once-dominant party.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: PTC offering attracts Dollars 1.4bn Bids from international investors for a placing of 5m vouchers in the state-run Pakistan Telecommunication Corp (PTC) reached Dollars 1.4bn yesterday, joint global co-ordinator Jardine Fleming said. The offering had been expected to raise around Dollars 750m for the government of Pakistan. The 5m PTC vouchers, which are exchangeable into shares in the future privatised Pakistan Telecommunications Company, account for around 10 per cent of the company. The bookbuilding process is scheduled to close today, after which allocations will be made. An official at Jardine Fleming said that the vouchers were likely to be priced between Rs5,000 and Rs5,500. This compares with a price of Rs3,000 in a recent domestic offering of vouchers which accounted for 2 per cent of the company. The official said that demand was particularly strong from emerging market funds and from institutional investors in east Asia, the UK and the US. Non-resident Pakistanis in the Middle East also showed a keen interest in the offering. The strong response from foreign investors prompted the vouchers to close Rs575 higher at Rs6,350 at the Karachi Stock Exchange. Jardine Fleming is co-ordinating the offering with Muslim Commercial Bank.</p>

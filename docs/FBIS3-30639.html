Yesterday they had talks with President  Zhelyu Zhelev and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. The  mediators are seeking support from the countries in the region  for a peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav conflict.    Invited to comment on Alija Izetbegovic's statement that the  forthcoming talks in Geneva would be a waste of time, Lord Owen,  admitting that negotiations had been going on for long, said  that if any of the parties thought it a waste of time, there  were lots of other things to do. Mr. Thorvald Stoltenberg added  that efforts would continue both before and after the meeting.    Asked what gives him hope about the peace process, Lord Owen  said it was the general belief/human nature [as received] that  some day human beings stop fighting and prefer to act and live  together. People in Bulgaria are suffering because of sanctions,  this is a fact: You have lost many dollars, as well as your  neighbours, he went on to say. And the question which the  region has to say is how much longer they all are going to go on  making sacrifices to try and bring a settlement, Lord Owen said.  He described Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Greece  as severely affected by the sanctions against ex-Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] today  showed for the first time since its establishment that it is  able to exercise its authority, when the chief of the kwaZulu  Police [KZP], Lieutenant General Roy During, testified before  the council after a long delay. This follows an earlier report  by Justice Richard Goldstone on so-called hit squads in the KZP.  This report by Ronel Van Zyl:    KZP Commissioner Lt. Gen. Roy During had up till today  refused to respond to requests by the TEC that he appear before  them. On Friday it was agreed that he would do so, after an  out-of-court agreement between the TEC and the kwaZulu minister  of police. Three KZP members were suspended after the Goldstone  report.    In his evidence, Gen. During maintained that he was not  aware  of any other KZP members who were involved in hit squads. He  added, however, that other allegations were being investigated  by the South African Police at his request. Gen. During was  pressed by questions on KZP members who had been trained by the  South African Defense Force in Caprivi. It was obvious that the  council wanted to determine whether there is any link between  those KZP members trained in Caprivi and the hit squads.    Gen. During admitted that the allegations about hit squads  in  the KZP had been surfacing for many years. He emphasized that  he had personally initiated investigations into these  allegations, with the approval of Chief Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi. At the end of the hearing the TEC did not make any  ruling, except that the investigations into the matter were far  from completed. Gen. During said he was prepared to appear  again before the council.</p>

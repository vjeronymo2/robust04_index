			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Investors cast eye outside Europe Institutional investors in the UK are shifting their attention away from continental European markets and towards Japan and the US, according to a survey by stockbrokers Smith New Court and Gallup, the market research group. For the first time since October 1992, a balance of fund managers said they were planning to reduce their holdings of European shares. Last month, opinion was almost equally divided on whether to raise or cut holdings, while previous months showed balances of 20 per cent or more in favour of increases. There has also been a marked rise in the number intending to increase their Japanese exposure: a balance of 39 per cent of managers planned to do so, compared with 8 per cent last month. Interest in Japan is at its highest level since October 1991. A balance of 11 per cent planned to raise US equity holdings. The appeal of the UK stock market has dwindled, with a balance of 5 per cent planning to increase their UK holdings, compared with 27 per cent in December. But there has been a sharp shift in favour of medium-sized FT-SE 250 companies, rather than the FT-SE 100. Only 20 per cent of managers preferred FT-SE 100 stocks this month, compared with 42 per cent, while those favouring FT-SE 250 stocks leapt from 49 to 74 per cent. The three favourite UK sectors were media, leisure and hotels, and building materials and merchants. The least liked were banks, property and food retailers, although banks and property companies were among the favourites in last October's survey. Managers continued to be optimistic about the UK economy, with 22 per cent expecting it to get much better in the next 12 months and 72 per cent expecting a little progress. However, 71 per cent said inflation would be rising more rapidly in a year's time. Base rates were expected to be half a percentage point lower in three months' time. Some 89 institutions, managing a total of Pounds 799bn, took part in the survey last week.</p>

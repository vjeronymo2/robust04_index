			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> The White House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate the nomination of  Portland, Ore., lawyer John E. Frohnmayer to be chairman of the beleaguered  National Endowment for the Arts. Frohnmayer, whose naming to the top arts  endowment job by President Bush was disclosed in early July, will be subject to  confirmation hearings before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,  chaired by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). A Kennedy spokesman said the hearings  would be held within the next couple of weeks with a confirmation vote in the  full Senate scheduled by the end of September.

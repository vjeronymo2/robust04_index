			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Recession less deep than reported, figures show THE recent recession was slightly less deep than previously reported, according to revised official statistics released yesterday. The Central Statistical Office said that the economy contracted by 0.4 per cent last year, compared with its earlier reports of a 0.5 per cent decline, and put the real, inflation-adjusted, fall of gross domestic product in 1991 at 2.3 per cent, compared with 2.5 per cent previously. The growth figures, released ahead of next month's publication of the CSO Blue Book giving the national accounts for last year took 1990 prices as a base level instead of 1985 prices as previously. They also took into account a reweighting of certain items in the national output figures. The government says that oil and gas extraction now represent only 1.7 per cent of UK economic output in value compared with 6.2 per cent previously, reflecting the sharp fall in oil prices after 1986. Banking and other financial services have been reduced in importance to 3.9 per cent and 1.5 per cent of output from 5.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. The shares of wholesale and distribution services have risen to 2.2 per cent and medical and health services to 4.5 per cent from 1.3 per cent and 3.6 per cent. The Blue Book will contain a 'national balance sheet' for the first time in six years, reflecting improvements in the CSO's gathering of statistics. Among the statistics published yesterday were figures pointing to a strengthening of household savings that could be a reaction to falling wealth levels. The figures showed: A sharp fall of 3.6 per cent in national wealth, measured by total tangible assets, to Pounds 2,418bn last year. Last year's decline reflected falling property values and was the third annual fall in succession. Officials said the three-year decline was unprecedented since the government first began to measure such assets in the 1950s. A big jump in household savings to Pounds 17.85bn at current prices last year from Pounds 5bn the year before. The savings, which excluded payments to life assurance policies and pension funds, amounted to 4.1 per cent of household disposable income, the highest level since records began in 1970. Between 1986 and 1990, households borrowed rather than saved, with overall borrowings reaching a peak of Pounds 10.8bn in 1989. The balance sheet for last year also disclosed that the UK's overall savings ratio rose to 12.5 per cent of personal disposable income last year, up 2.4 percentage points on 1991 and the highest level since the end of the 1950s.</p>

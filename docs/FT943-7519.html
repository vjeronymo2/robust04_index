			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / BR runs 45% of strike-hit service British Rail said it ran 45 per cent of its normal services yesterday afternoon, the largest number of trains to run during strike action since the start of the railway signal workers' dispute 11 weeks ago. Railtrack said it had managed to open 40 per cent of the 10,000-mile rail network to train services, slightly more than during last week's two-day strike. The company, which manages British Rail's track, signalling and stations, said 530 signal workers had worked last week, including 309 members of the RMT transport union. At the start of the strike only 337 signal workers had reported for duty including 131 RMT members. Railtrack yesterday said that it did not yet know how many signal workers would be working during the present 24-hour stoppage, which ends at midday today, but it expected a further small increase. BR is seeking to put some of its staff in Railtrack signal boxes but has not yet done so. The union denied that there had been any significant return to work by its members and said they were still 'solidly supporting' the stoppages. It accused Railtrack of becoming more ruthless in its attempt to open up more track and break the strike. The most significant addition to the operating rail network yesterday was the east coast main line from London to Edinburgh which was open along its entire length for the first time, BR said. InterCity ran an almost full service in some regions. The Chiltern line between London Marylebone, Banbury and Birmingham also ran a nearly normal service while 90 per cent of trains ran in the Thames region and 60 per cent on Merseyrail. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said: 'Railtrack have been able to open up some additional parts of the network today because they have become more clever, as well as more ruthless, in their exploitation of supervisors, not through a return to work by RMT signalling grades. If cracks are developing in the dispute it is on the management side.' Many of the train operating units of BR have produced detailed timetables of their services for travellers during the present 24-hour strike. RMT is planning a further 48-hour strike by signal workers on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.</p>

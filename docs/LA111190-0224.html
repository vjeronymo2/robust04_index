			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NEW PANEL TO STUDY TRAFFIC PROBLEMS  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce traffic in the Simi Valley area and help employers  comply with a county regulation requiring fewer commutes, the Simi Valley  Chamber of Commerce on Thursday announced the formation of the Simi Valley  Transportation Management Assn.  </P> <P> It is one of three such organizations in the county formed so employers,  developers and government representatives can work together on transportation  policies, programs and services. Two other organizations have been formed in  Oxnard.  </P> <P> Richard Baldwin, the county's air pollution control officer, said the  association would help employers put together ride-share programs.  </P> <P> Last June, Caltrans signed an agreement with the Simi Valley chamber  guaranteeing $60,000 to implement the transportation management association.  The chamber must put up matching funds or perform services that would match the  grant.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Charles Coffey, the executive director of the association, said  traffic congestion has brought about changing times.  </P> <P> "We must change the commuting habits of our populace," Coffey said. "We're not  just talking about car-pooling or van-pooling. We are talking about bus  transportation, bicycling, jogging, variable work hours, telecommuting and  parking management."  </P> <P> In 1989, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors passed Rule 210, which  requires that employers with 100 or more employees submit plans to the county's  Air Pollution Control District showing reduction of home-to-work trips --  specifically, one out of every three cars must have two passengers.  </P> <P> On Nov. 1, the county began sending notices to large companies, beginning at in  the east county. About 30 notices a month will be sent over the next 10 months.  Once the notice is received, companies have 120 days to file a trip-reduction  plan.  </P> <P> The rule will extend to employers with 75 or more employees in August, 1991,  and all other businesses by January, 1992. Failure to submit trip-reduction  plans could result in fines or imprisonment.  </P> <P> Potential services to be offered by the association include computerized  van-pool, car-pool and transit information, computerized traffic monitoring  services, van-pool subsidies, guaranteed ride home services and development of  employee on-site child care.  </P> <P> Simi Valley has 25 employers with more than 100 employees.  </P></p>

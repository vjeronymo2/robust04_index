The installation of the 670-tonne  turbine was completed at the Hoa Binh plant on the Da River  southwest of Hanoi on Friday. The giant hydroelectric scheme,  which has taken more than 10 years to complete and was one of  the former Soviet Union's main foreign aid projects, was  finished in time for the major diversion of power from the  surplus north to the deficit south. Inauguration of the new  1,500-km north-south transmission line is scheduled for 5 April.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (2): Bordering on the burlesque - Political battles / Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, has been waging war against France's head of state ever since Francois Mitterrand trounced him in the 1981 presidential elections THE Hotel de Ville with its Disneyesque towers, turrets and tricolors on the right bank of the Seine has for a very long time played a pivotal part in the politics of Paris. Danton, Robespierre and Marat, the lynchpins of the French Revolution, decamped there in 1792 to turn it into their seat of government. But in 1871 the Hotel de Ville was ransacked by the angry mobs that swept through the city in the early days of the Paris Commune. The Hotel de Ville, sparkling in neo-Renaissance splendour with its illuminated fountains and shimmering chandeliers, is now the scene of another political struggle in its current role as the campaign headquarters of Jacques Chirac, the neo-gaullist who has been mayor of Paris since 1977, in his bitter battle against Francois Mitterrand, France's socialist president. Mr Chirac has been waging war against France's head of state ever since Francois Mitterrand trounced him in the 1981 presidential elections. The battle between them has become all the fiercer since the uncomfortable era of cohabitation between 1986 and 1988 when they wrestled for power on the national stage, while Jacques Chirac played prime minister to Francois Mitterrand's president. The two men have clashed over everything from the rights and wrongs of military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina, to whether the French state should have chopped down the trees on Quai Branly, to who was to stand closest to the Queen of England at the photocalls for her official visit to Paris. All too often the battles have bordered on the burlesque. The mayor's assaults on the Grands Projets, the ambitious architectural programme initiated by the president and Jack Lang, his faithful arts minister and another Chirac bete noir, are a fine example. Almost every new architectural scheme, from IM Pei's Louvre Pyramide, to Dominique Perrault's Tres Grande Bibliotheque, has been treated to an attack  -on aesthetic, social or financial grounds, often on all three - from the Hotel de Ville only to be defended with a carefully cultivated air of insouciance from the president. At first glance, President Mitterrand appears to hold the winning hand if only because central government still controls many aspects of the management of Paris, including public transport. Mr Chirac has been left to drum up as much publicity as he can for the few areas left under his aegis - ranging from the enormous electronic information boards he has plastered all over the city (relaying details of the time, traffic jams and the weather) to his 'poop-scooping' campaign against dog dirt. The Hotel de Ville's power has also been eroded by the socialists' decentralisation programme which has been implemented throughout France but could scarcely have been better designed to curb Jacques Chirac's authority. These reforms started six years ago with the creation of the Ile de France region, an elected body that now adminstrates the area in and around Paris in tandem with the council. They continued in 1990 with the appointment of a state-selected prefet to represent the government in the region. But the wily mayor has battled back. The Ile de France region is in the sympathetic hands of a Chirac loyalist. Equally important, the city council's budget at FFr18.7bn for 1992 is still twice as big as that of the region. The prefet, Christian Sautter, is a Mitterrand man and was once senior adviser to the president. But he has forged a sound relationship with the Ile de France loyalist and, in practice, there are relatively few serious differences of opinion on strategic issues between the various governing bodies. CONTEMPORARY Paris is a prosperous place. New buildings have been flung up, old buildings lovingly restored and the city's statues glisten after their recent regilding. In the early hours of the morning the streets are crammed with the apple green vans of the city council, scooping up litter, hosing down pavements, sweeping the roads and even polishing the street signs. During the Mitterrand era Paris has gained 137km of new railway track, four times more than London, and 500km of motorway to London's 250km. A fourth express rail route is now under construction and a fifth is in the pipeline. There are also plans for a fourth ring road and for five subterranean motorways. This investment seems to have done little to tackle the city's appalling traffic problems. Parking is still a nightmare. It is almost impossible to find a legal parking space in central Paris at night. The pavements of the grands boulevards are littered with abandoned cars. The huge subterranean car parks built by the city council in the late 1980s have had little impact. The only consolation is that things would almost certainly be even worse without them. Yet, almost all the comparative studies between contemporary Paris and London come out in the French capital's favour. Paris wins higher marks for transport and planning in a recent British government report, while London scores on culture and greenery. When it comes to public service infrastructure, Paris has a clear advantage. The London Underground, according to the report, is slower, dirtier, less efficient and more dangerous than the Paris Metro. The chief criticism levelled at Jacques Chirac is that, like Mayor Ed Koch in New York, he has gentrified his city to such a degree that the centre is now an enclave for the affluent, with the disadvantaged shipped out to the potentially explosive poverty belt of the suburbs. But it is the government, not the city council, that usually gets the blame whenever the suburbs erupt in sporadic bursts of urban unrest. And Jacques Chirac has yet to lose an election. He, and his loyalists, have been returned to power by poll after poll. Mr Chirac is only likely to leave the Hotel de Ville on his own terms. In other words he will only do so if he finally triumphs in a presidential election so that he can swap the towers and turrets of the Hotel de Ville for the 18th century grandeur of the Elysee Palace.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: State forces GM to call off sale of Allison division GENERAL Motors yesterday called off the sale of its Allison Transmission division in the wake of a legal challenge from the US Justice Department. It also issued an angry rebuke to the Clinton administration's approach to competition policy. GM and ZF Friedrichschafen, the German company which had been in talks to buy Allison, said the administration's move to block the deal had come after 18 months of talks between the two parties, and marked 'an excessively long period of arduous government deliberation'. Mr William Hoglund, executive vice-president of GM, and Mr Klaus Bleyer, chief executive of the German company, said in joint statement: 'In our opinion, the government took a very narrow view of competition in the market and one that does not reflect commercial reality.' The decision by Mrs Anne Bingaman, head of the anti-trust division, to file a civil suit to block the deal marked one of the earliest signals of the Clinton administration's intention of taking a tougher line than its predecessor on competition policy. Other recent Justice Department actions have also indicated a more stringent approach to enforcement of anti-trust laws, though not a change in policy. Mrs Bingaman had said the Allison sale would have seriously reduced competition for automatic transmissions for buses and trucks. The new entity would have had 78 per cent of the Dollars 50m market for transit bus transmissions in the US, the department said. Mrs Bingaman added that the department would focus increasingly on protecting competition in technology. Mr Hoglund of GM said the decision to take Allison off the market would enable the division 'to develop a plan which will make it a successful entity in the marketplace'. The planned disposal had been part of GM's strategy of selling off operations where it did not believe it could compete effectively. It was part of the move to return its North American automotive operations to profit.</p>

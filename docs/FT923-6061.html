			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Citibank rejects claims it violated Reserve Bank rules in Bombay securities scandal CITIBANK, the US bank, yesterday denied that it had violated guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India, or that it had actively financed brokers involved in the Rs35bn (Pounds 630m) Bombay securities scandal. In a statement issued in Bombay in response to publication of an official report on the scandal, Citibank blamed the Indian banking system for irregularities in its Indian operations. It said that if Citibank government bond transfer forms had bounced, as the report said, it was because other banks had dishonoured the forms. 'This highlights the need to assess the settlement drawbacks in the entire system,' it said. The bank also denied that it had 'accommodated' or been involved with Mr Harshad Mehta, the key broker in the scandal, and that it had guaranteed returns to its customers under portfolio management schemes. It said fiduciary accounts were managed on the basis of a written mandate received from customers. According to the report published on Tuesday, Citibank and Bank of America accrued large profits in the Indian financial markets by flouting guidelines laid down by the Reserve Bank of India. Bank of America has not yet commented on the report. The report by the Janakiraman committee of the Reserve Bank, the third in a series, found that the American banks, among other Indian and foreign banks, used portfolio management schemes as a 'deposit substitute' to mobilise funds, mainly from government corporations. Large corporate cash surpluses were attracted by the banks, especially those with more aggressive marketing strategies, by offering guaranteed rates of return far exceeding the deposit rates permitted by the Reserve Bank, and without the client bearing the risk of capital loss on its portfolio investment. The report says that the 'client's perception of the portfolio management schemes seemed to support the suspicion that they considered the funds placed under the schemes merely as deployment of short-term funds with banks in the nature of bank deposits enjoying a higher rate of interest and not subject to any risk.' To circumvent the stipulation that portfolio management funds had to be placed with the banks for a period of one year, several banks offered facilities for 'ready forward', or repurchase, transactions: securities, bonds and units were sold to clients and repurchased after a specific period at a pre-determined rate which assured the client a guaranteed rate of return with no risk. The banks would then use the money freely in the interim period to earn the highest possible return. The Reserve Bank guidelines require all transactions between a bank's investment account and portfolio account to be 'strictly at market rates'. The guidelines also expressly prohibited ready forward deals in government bonds and units, but almost all the banks violated this norm, according to the report. An indication of the magnitude of the funds collected under these schemes, says the report, is ascertainable from the fact that between April 1991 and May 31 1992, Citibank entered into ready forward transactions for an aggregate value of Rs59.72bn. Bank of America entered into transactions for an aggregate value of Rs69.54bn. Standard Chartered of the UK operated a similar scheme, called Corporate Cash Deployment Services, for which the funds received and outstanding on March 31 this year for the Bombay branch alone are an estimated Rs7bn. The committee suspects that a large amount of these funds were routed by banks to finance brokers through ready forward deals. In many cases, says the report, brokers may have helped to obtain these funds, especially from state-owned enterprises, 'mainly motivated by the expectation that that the funds would in turn be made available to them by the banks/institutions'. The committee says it has not substantiated this suspicion, but bankers say it is plausible that the 'guaranteed' returns were at levels far higher than the yields of the underlying securities, which were usually either bonds, units, or government paper. The inflated yields had to be earned elsewhere, most likely in the sharply rising Bombay stock market of 1991-92, until the bubble burst this May. Simultaneously, the diversion of funds would be laundered under the guise of portfolio management scheme investment in units, bonds and securities through ready forward deals. The committee highlighted the substantial value of bonds held by banks either on their own account or in portfolio management schemes and the significant erosion in their value due to the fall in market value of the bonds. The committee's latest report focused particularly on Citibank and the Bank of America. It will carry out a similar exercise on the role of Standard Chartered and ANZ Grindlays in its fourth and final report. Citibank was the largest portfolio manager, having innovated the scheme and accounting for 56 per cent (Rs12.98bn) of the total investment of Rs23.29bn in portfolio management schemes up to June 30 this year. When questioned by the committee, Citibank argued that there was no violation of guidelines since these transactions went through portfolio management scheme funds and Reserve Bank restrictions did not apply to these funds. The report lists several instances of alleged violations of the rules, for example detailing a bond deal between Citibank and Bank of America involving several brokers. The report also says that the transactions which earlier did not tally, have shown up in the records of some other bank or institution, thus reducing fears that money had 'disappeared' from the system.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST AND CONRAD  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick's criticism of Secretary of State James Baker's evenhanded approach  to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is unwarranted, to say the least.  </P> <P> The tone and substance of Kirkpatrick's article reflect her long-standing and  myopic support for Israel. There was not even an iota of a hint that Israel was  to blame for any aggressive conduct since its creation. There was, for  instance, no mention of the unjustifiable presence of Israeli forces on  Egyptian soil in 1956 when France and Britain invaded Egypt. Even if a  Palestinian-Israeli rapprochement is realized eventually, it is the opinion of  this writer that there will not be a lasting peace in the Arab-Israeli region  of the Middle East until Israel becomes a truly Middle Eastern country, not a  Western outpost.  </P> <P> MAHDY Y.

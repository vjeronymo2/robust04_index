			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI MEDICAL CENTER'S LOSSES AND THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS  </P> <P> UC Irvine appropriately bemoans the fact that there is a projected operating  loss of $13 million this year at the medical center. It is undoubtedly accurate  that the major reason for this is that UCI treats 50% of the poor, yet has only  6% of the hospital beds in Orange County. The fact that UCI, as a teaching  institution, must spend more per patient than our other hospitals undoubtedly  accounts for only a percentage of the loss.  </P> <P> However, isn't that what UCI as a training institution is all about?  Historically, when the current medical facility was the County Hospital,  virtually all indigent patients were cared for there. Why then should that  change?  </P> <P> If Orange County possessed a deficit of other hospitals, the answer would be to  build more hospitals in Orange County and make funds available for treating  indigent patients. However, we have a surplus of both private and nonprofit  hospitals in our county. It, therefore, is correct to expect the university to  care for the overwhelming majority of indigent patients, not only 50%! It is  just as logical for funds to be made available to UCI for this.  </P> <P> Similarly, if Orange County were in a void and did not have at least three  hospitals that can be considered tertiary-care institutions with the capability  of treating virtually any disease entity, then the need for a "Super Center"  able to address the most complicated medical problems would be necessary. With  all due respect to the academic environment, Orange County's medical facilities  are excellent and insured patients simply need not travel very far to receive  the finest medical care available. Whereas UCI Medical Center can supplement  them, their main function should still be care of the indigent patient and  training physicians. It is no less true that funds should be made available to  that institution. However, to invoke excellence or uniqueness of medical care  as the essence of UCI Medical Center's existence is inaccurate.  </P> <P> MICHAEL H. SUKOFF, MD  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

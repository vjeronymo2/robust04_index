			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Treuhand looks east with expertise THE TREUHAND, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring east German industry, will be giving itself a new lease of life when it winds up its main operations in Berlin next year. The Treuhand is expanding eastwards, in the former Soviet Union and the Baltic states. 'We want to pass on our know-how and experience of privatisation to these countries,' said Mr Klaus Muller, director of Treuhand Osteuropa Beratungsgesellschaft (TOB), a consultancy arm of the Treuhand. TOB seems determined to compete, or co-operate, with other bodies - including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the European Investment Bank - active in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. However, it may seem surprising that the Treuhand would be welcomed in these countries. Its shock privatisation programme in eastern Germany has been aimed at a radical restructuring of large enterprises resulting in massive unemployment. 'The unemployment factor is not an issue. Officials from eastern Europe and the Baltic states approached us in the first place,' said Mr Muller. 'They reckoned with our experience of quickly breaking down the giant Kombinate (east Germany's large enterprises), as well as preparing these plants for privatisation; they could learn from us.' With a small budget of DM30m (Pounds 12.1m) from the federal finance ministry, to which it is answerable, TOB has set up in Berlin a small unit of 40 specialists, and has already placed 70 consultants throughout eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the Baltic states. It is the principal advisor on privatisation to the Estonian government. But, in a region inundated with advisors and consultants on privatisation since the collapse of the Berlin Wall nearly three years ago, is there room for TOB? An Estonian diplomat has a clear view: 'Look, whatever the mess the eastern German economy is in at the moment, we know that Germany will make it with unification because they will try and develope a mittelstand (small and medium-sized companies). We want TOB to teach us how to do that.' Berliner Kraft und Licht, Berlin's main utility company, is set to gain a foothold in Russia's electricity industry after an agreement to advise the Russian Federation on restructuring its energy sector. Over the next five years, Bewag, as the company is known, will advise Mosenergo, the oldest and largest of Russia's utilities, on upgrading and modernising its 22 power-generation plants which have a total capacity of 14,000MW.</p>

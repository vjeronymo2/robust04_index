			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE SEARCH FOR DEEP POCKETS;  </P> <P> OBSERVERS OF THE ORANGE COUNTY ARTS SCENE ARE WONDERING WHO WILL PAY FOR THE  PROFUSION OF PROJECTS  </P> <P> Last weekend, for the first time in its history, the Newport Harbor Art Museum  canceled a fund-raising event for lack of ticket sales.  </P> <P> The museum's director of development, Margie Shackelford, said the "Good  Vibrations" affair, which was to have coincided with an exhibition of pop art  from the '60s, was called off because of unforeseen competition from private  parties. Still, some observers of the local arts scene are wondering whether  the explosion in projects is plumbing the depths of the county's deep pockets.  </P> <P> A marketing report released earlier this month has recommended that the Orange  County Center for the Performing Arts build as many as three new theaters -- at  a cost of up to $119 million.  </P> <P> Excluding the cost of programming and endowments, other capital projects now  either under construction or on the drawing board -- from Costa Mesa south to  Laguna Beach alone -- could exceed $50 million more. These include the Newport  Harbor Art Museum ($20 million), the 750-seat Irvine Theatre ($17.6 million),  expansion of the Laguna Playhouse ($2.8 million) and a new, 1,500-seat theater  in Mission Viejo, which has no cost estimate.  </P> <P> "Population in Orange County is growing rapidly," according to the Center's  marketing study, prepared by the Harrison Price Co. of Torrance. "Estimated  population in the year 2000 is approximately 2.7 million persons. To maintain  the same ratio of population attending performing arts events as is currently  being achieved, the county must increase both the level of programming and the  number of theater seats. . . . If Orange County is to provide programs for its  growing audience, it must build new theaters."  </P> <P> Although a significant portion of the funding of these projects has been  provided from public sources or already has been raised from private sources,  still more needs to be raised. These needs include up to $10 million, for  example, for the Newport Harbor Art museum (the museum declined to say how much  more has been raised since it announced that it had reached the halfway point),  $3.2 million for the Irvine Theatre and $2 million for the Laguna Playhouse.  </P> <P> Even on the local level, the hunt for private money to help build and renovate  arts institutions is growing. Backers of Huntington Beach's new Municipal Arts  Center, sensing a shift of sentiment on the newly elected City Council,  announced plans earlier this month to raise more than $300,000 through a  nonprofit foundation. . In Fullerton, supporters of the Muckenthaler Cultural  Center are hoping to raise $300,000 for major renovations, also from private  sources.  </P> <P> With all this construction under way and in the wind, "certainly the issue will  have to come up of where the dough is going to come (from)," says David Emmes,  producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory Theatre, which expanded  its own facilities in Costa Mesa to the tune of $1.7 million 2 years ago.  </P> <P> Professional fund raisers affiliated with various county arts organizations are  upbeat. Newport Harbor's Shackelford, for instance, is unconcerned by the other  campaigns. She said the drive for the museum, which is slated to open in 1992,  is going "very well," and she said that her organization's fund-raising  probably would be completed by the time the Center's expansion campaign was  getting under way.  </P> <P> "There is certainly plenty of money to go around in Orange County," she said.  "The county's booming."  </P> <P> All the major campaigns, she said, had feasibility studies done before they  began.  </P> <P> "The county is ready for these institutions," she said.  </P> <P> Henry Goldstein, a New York fund-raising consultant now working for the  museum's campaign, agreed that private giving for the arts in Orange County is  "nowhere near the limit" of what can be done. With the median age rising to the  late 30s, he said, "marginal and incremental supporters will later become  serious supporters."  </P> <P> Henry Segerstrom, perhaps the best known performing arts patron in the county,  said he believes that the Center's forthcoming capital campaign will not  compete with any of the projects now under way.  </P> <P> But James L. Vandeberg thinks arts "organizations need to bear in mind that  there's a finite amount of money out there." Vandeberg is secretary and  corporate counsel for Carter Hawley Hale and vice president of South Coast  Repertory. Carter Hawley Hale has contributed $50,000 to SCR and between  $50,000 and $100,000 to the Performing Arts Center's $73-million building fund  around the same time.  </P> <P> Raising tens of millions of dollars for the various new building projects  should be "a real challenge," Vandeberg said. "That's a lot of money. They  might have to expand out of Orange and L.A. counties to raise it."  </P> <P> At its recent board meeting, the Center established a division of national  gifts. But based on the Center's experience in building the existing facility,  two-thirds of the money contributed by businesses will be from those with  headquarters in Orange County.  </P> <P> Inevitably, some of the same names pop up whenever the hat is passed for major  donations for the arts:  </P> <P> * The Segerstrom family, which donated the land for the Performing Arts Center,  valued at the time at $5 million, as well as $6 million for construction. One  of the most likely sites for the proposed Center expansion is owned by family  interests.  </P> <P> * The Irvine Co., which contributed the site for the Newport Harbor Art Museum,  $1.75 million to the Performing Arts Center building fund and $600,000 to the  Irvine Theatre.  </P> <P> * The Harry and Grace Steele Foundation, which gave $1 million to the Center's  building fund, $500,000 in matching funds to the Laguna Playhouse's capital  campaign and $50,000 to SCR's 1987 expansion, and has pledged $1 million to  Newport Harbor Art Museum.  </P> <P> * The Mission Viejo Co., which contributed between $100,000 and $250,000 to the  Center's building fund and an unspecified amount to the Laguna Playhouse  expansion. The company is also expected to be a major supporter of the proposed  Mission Viejo theater, which may be built on the campus of Saddleback College.  </P> <P> Like the major corporate givers, the number of foundations who are likely to  participate in capital campaigns is limited. Relatively few national  foundations, like the Kresge Foundation, make "brick-and-mortar" grants to  build facilities, according to fund-raiser Goldstein.  </P> <P> In addition to the Steele Foundation, major players in Orange County include  the James Irvine Foundation (not affiliated with the Irvine Co.), which  contributed more than $1 million to the Center's building fund; the W.M. Keck  Foundation of Los Angeles, which donated a similar amount; the Security Pacific  Foundation, which gave between $500,000 and $1 million, and the Ahmanson  Foundation, which gave between $250,000 and $500,000.  </P> <P> At some point, major donors may begin making choices about their giving,  although most were reluctant to be quoted on the subject.  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo Co., for example, supports the idea of a theater on the  Saddleback campus.  </P> <P> "It's too early in that proposal to decide much else," said Wendy Wetzel,  director of corporate affairs.  </P> <P> Asked how that support would affect the company's participation in building new  theaters at the Center in Costa Mesa, Wetzel said only that "projects in our  planned community do have our first priority."  </P> <P> Another question that looms is whether the reliance on these major contributors  can continue.  </P> <P> Douglas C. Rankin, general director of the Irvine Theater, has a unique  perspective. His $17.9-million institution is being watched as a model of  local, state and private partnership.  </P> <P> The site for the theater was donated by UC Irvine, which also contributed $1.8  million in cash, and the city of Irvine has approved $11.3 million in building  support. That still left $4.8 million to be raised from the private sector. To  date, $1.6 million of that has been raised.  </P> <P> Even though the Irvine Co. has made the largest private contribution to date --  $600,000 -- Rankin thinks institutions like his need to look beyond the usual  sources of major givers.  </P> <P> His strategy has been to "develop new leadership and new contributors who are  out there. I believe that if you can first find them and then create the  interest for your project in their minds, those individuals and corporations  will grow over time and have the potential of becoming major donors later on. .  . . We're in this for the long haul."  </P> <P> But, at least for the foreseeable future, Segerstrom says he expects the  traditional pyramid configuration of fund-raising, with its heavy reliance on  major givers, to apply: the top 10 donors account for one third of the total,  the next hundred largest donors provide the second third of the total and all  the remaining givers provide the rest.  </P> <P> It's even possible, said Bob Sharp, a Santa Ana-based consultant, that reliance  on large donors is increasing.  </P> <P> Sharp, who directed the Center's building campaign and is now directing the  Irvine Theatre's efforts, said that recent figures on efforts similar to the  Center indicated that as much as 95% of the money was coming from 5% of the  donors.  </P> <P> The biggest challenge to fund-raisers is the Performing Arts Center, primarily  because of the hefty price tag for the Center's new theaters and the Center's  policy of not accepting government funds.  </P> <P> Officially, the Center has so far only accepted the Harrison Price survey's  recommendations and is in the very preliminary stage of looking for a site for  the new theaters. And while the survey recommends building three new theaters,  for up to $119 million, it suggests that one of these could be "deferred." Even  building two of the three theaters -- a concert hall being first in order of  priority -- probably will require a capital campaign of $90 million over the  next 10 years.  </P> <P> John Miltner, vice chancellor of UCI and a member of the Center board, thinks a  $90-million capital campaign is realistic, but he doesn't disagree with Rankin  that newer sources of funding will be needed.  </P> <P> "I think it's realistic if (Center officials) start right now expanding their  constituency," said Miltner, who has served as chairman of the National Society  of Fundraising Executives. "I don't think they can do it on the existing donor  base."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paying for the Arts in Orange County  </P> <P> Many arts projects requiring private donations are under way in Orange County.  Some fund raisers see only a finite amount of money available from patrons.  Other say private giving is "nowhere near the limit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton: $300, 000 for renovations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huntington Beach Municipal Arts Center: $300,000 to rehabilitate an industrial  building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 750-seat Irvine Theatre; $17.6 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa: $119 million to build three new theaters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newport Harbor Art Museum; $20 million  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1,500-seat theatre in Mission Viejo: No cost estimate  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expansion of the Laguna Playhouse: $2.8 million  </P></p>

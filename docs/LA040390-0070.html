			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERATED AND ALLIED STORES CUT LOSSES DURING FEBRUARY  </P> <P> Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores, the American retailing  operations of Canada's Campeau Corp. that are trying to reorganize, cut their  losses to $45.6 million in February from the late January period.  </P> <P> According to monthly statements required by the bankruptcy court overseeing the  reorganization of the retail chains, Federated showed a loss of $29.8 million  in February while Allied posted a $15.8-million loss.  </P> <P> The losses do not include costs associated with the bankruptcy.  </P> <P> In the 20 days after the bankruptcy filing in January, Federated and Allied  reported a combined loss of $56 million.  </P> <P> Sales at Federated and Allied were mostly higher in February, with the biggest  gains coming in apparel, shoes, fashion and home accessories, the stores said.  </P> <P> Federated and Allied said February's results reflected progress made with  suppliers after the bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> "We view February results as reflecting the stabilization of our department  store operations in the post-filing period," the companies said.  </P> <P> The February performance exceeded expectations for the first complete month of  operations after the Jan. 15 filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In Chapter 11, a  company is protected from its creditors while it attempts to reorganize.  </P> <P> Maas Bros., based in Tampa, Fla., and Bon Marche of Seattle, both showed slim  profits in the month. Boston-based Jordan Marsh, and Sterns, which operates in  New Jersey, lost money.  </P></p>

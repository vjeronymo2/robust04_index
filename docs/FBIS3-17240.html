			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Elections: Were They Held or </F> Not?"]    [Text] St. Petersburg residents have never before shown  such striking passivity as they did regarding the elections to  the City Assembly held last Sunday. In this respect our  "politicized" compatriots surpassed even the traditionally  politically inert regions of the Russian hinterland. Barely  one-fifth of the registered voters of St. Petersburg went to the  precincts to vote the day before yesterday.    Yet, according to the statute on elections to the City  Assembly of St. Petersburg, they can be considered to have taken  place only if 25 percent of the potential voters (plus one  person) have participated in them.    Sunday evening, when it became clear that the necessary  quorum of voters would not appear, the city's mayor, A.S.  Sobchak, issued an urgent directive "On Changing the Procedure  for Voting in Elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly."    "Taking into account the appeal of the Central Electoral  Commission, the sociopolitical blocs, the parties, and  associations," it says in this document, "the time period for  voting in elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly shall be  extended, the operation of the electoral commissions being  resumed on 21 March 1994 from 0800 through 2200."    According to this same directive, the right to participate  in  the voting has been granted to citizens who went to school or  served on active military duty in St. Petersburg.    Thus the city voted yesterday for the second day in a row  and  today we will find out whether, as a result of this  unprecedented measure, it succeeded in passing the 25 percent  mark for voter turnout.    Incidentally, even if this happens, most likely the subject  of whether or not the elections to the City Assembly of St.  Petersburg really took place will be discussed for a long time  to come at the most diverse echelons, including the Central  Electoral Commission and the courts. Because no matter what you  say, a change in the voting procedure during the course of the  voting itself is, we repeat, something unprecedented. And,  naturally, even yesterday this and also other details of the  election were at the center of the attention of the public and  the voter associations of the city.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Chinese inflation rises to 27% as fears of social unrest grow China's annual inflation rate rose to 27.4 per cent in September, putting more pressure on the central government which fears social unrest. The government has already introduced price controls in an effort to break the inflationary cycle. The September figure was up nearly two percentage points on August, according to figures released yesterday by the State Statistical Bureau. The gloomy economic news underscores the difficulties faced by the government, which admits it has entered a 'crucial' phase in its efforts to curb inflation. The authorities need to maintain high levels of economic growth or risk worsening unemployment and possible social unrest. The bad September result seems certain to add to pressures on the leadership to stiffen remedial action taken last month to restrain price increases. The latest figures showed a further narrowing of the gap between the national cost of living increase and that in the 35 biggest cities. Until recently, urban inflation had been rising faster than the national average. This suggests price curbs have been more effective in the cities than in provincial towns and rural areas. Urban cost of living was up by 27.5 per cent in September, compared with the same month last year. Western economists in Beijing view the inflation figures as an ominous reminder to the authorities of their difficulties in curbing inflation. 'Whichever way you look at it, this is bad news for China,' one said. 'This shows inflationary pressures in the economy are still quite strong.' Mr Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the Statistical Bureau, blamed the inflationary spiral on food price rises due to drought in northern China and flooding in the south. He also said the effects of administrative price rises for grain and other commodities were still being felt. The state purchase price for grain has risen about 50 per cent in the past year. Mr Qiu warned that China had entered a 'crucial' phase in the last quarter of the year, with pressures increasing on the government to redouble its efforts to bring price rises under control. He urged restraint on money supply growth, increased curbs on capital spending, and increased agricultural production.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb. 16 (MAP) -- The Moroccan  counter-proposals for a new partnership with Europe submitted  Monday to the European Commission here focus on commercial and  financial aspects.    A source close to the Moroccan delegation currently visiting  Brussels told MAP bureau here that the Moroccan delegation had  from the start pointed out that the negotiations directives  adopted by the European Ministers' Council last December 6 were  insufficient in commercial and financial matters.    The Moroccan side renewed commitment for more open trade  relations with the European Union and called for a necessary and  vital balance between the agricultural and industrial sectors.  The open relations, the delegation argued, would be started  progressively and framed by support measures.    The delegation underlined that pending the setting forth of  the new trade relations, and in view of the new data stemming  from the Uruguay Round it is necessary to adapt the current  cooperation accord in order to maintain the preferences granted  so far to Morocco and especially to maintain the flow of  Morocco's exports of fruits and vegetables.    The European Union confirmed in this respect its readiness  to  preserve Moroccan trade gains especially regarding fruits and  vegetables, the same source said.    Regarding the financial sector, the Moroccan side pointed  out  that the development of financial cooperation should be adapted  to Morocco's socio-economic conditions, the financial  constraints entailed by the adjustment policy and its will to  promote privileged relations and more intense exchanges with the  European Union.    Morocco deems its counter-proposals accurate, comprehensive  and realistic given the cooperation possibilities with the  European Union and the complementarity between their economies.    The delegation that handed to the European officials the  memorandum of counter-proposals was led by Moroccan Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Taieb Fassi Fihri  [title and spelling as received].</p>

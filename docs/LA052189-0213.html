			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> COPING WITH COMMUTING;  </P> <P> COMMUTING BY ELEVATOR  </P> <P> The investment industry has been very good to Gene Morgan, so good that he  could afford to live just about anywhere he wanted.  </P> <P> But wasting precious hours on the freeway commuting from his downtown Los  Angeles brokerage to a home at the beach, in the hills or even in nearby  Hancock Park is something that this 65-year-old ex-Marine simply could not  abide.  </P> <P> Instead, his commute is vertical and takes about a minute by elevator, from his  30th-floor condominium at Bunker Hill Towers to the building's Plaza Level,  which houses the offices of Gene Morgan Financial.  </P> <P> "It simplifies my life," Morgan said of his decision to live and work in the  same locale. "I waste absolutely no time on the freeways." Across the country,  more such "city within a city" projects are going up in urban and suburban  areas, affording an option for workers who like the idea of a commute on the  hoof.  </P> <P> Many are in self-contained high-rises where residents can also shop for  groceries, go to the dentist, get their hair cut and work out on weight  machines. Others are in sprawling communities, such as Century City, that also  feature fancy hotels and restaurants, movie houses and other forms of  entertainment.  </P> <P> As highways become more clogged and home prices spin further out of reach in  some metropolitan areas, observers say, such mixed-use projects are bound to  become more important fixtures on the urban landscape.  </P> <P> "The future for that is very, very bright," said Rocky Tarantello, a real  estate consultant and a professor of real estate and urban economics at USC.  </P> <P> To date, such developments have tended to work best in condensed or older  cities such as Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis and San Francisco, which, unlike  Los Angeles and Houston, are not completely reliant on automobiles to function.  (Washington, on the other hand, has restrictions on building height that make  funding such developments less economically rewarding.)  </P> <P> Chicago boasts one of the most successful projects -- Water Tower Place -- with  the Ritz-Carlton hotel, condominiums, restaurants, theaters, a myriad of  service establishments and an upscale shopping mall anchored by Marshall  Field's and Lord &amp; Taylor.  </P> <P> Located near Lake Michigan on prestigious North Michigan Avenue, Water Tower  Place also benefits from traffic at nearby cultural institutions and the  presence of thousands of residents and workers in nearby high-rise condo,  apartment and office buildings.  </P> <P> Then there is Los Angeles. With its utter dependence on autos, its lack of a  downtown residential base, its far-flung suburban and exurban communities and  the after-hours bleakness of its downtown core, the city has not lent itself to  much mixed-use development. (The early effort at mixing offices and retail  space in Arco Plaza, for example, has proven disastrous for the merchants.)  </P> <P> "Not all cities are so hospitable to mixed-use projects," said Norman Elkin,  vice president of Urban Investment &amp; Development Co., a Chicago development  subsidiary of JMB Realty. "In Los Angeles, that's a problem. What do you hook  on to?"  </P> <P> Bunker Hill Towers, with its proximity to the Music Center and the Museum of  Contemporary Art, is as close as the city now comes, although other projects  are under way and some others -- such as Broadway Plaza, California Plaza and  Citicorp Plaza -- almost qualify, but for the lack of residential space.  </P> <P> In Tarantello's view, a number of factors are converging that will make  development of mixed-use buildings more appropriate for California. In the past  10 years, the nation's population has increased about 16%. At the same time, by  his estimate, the number of licensed drivers has risen 60% while the number of  new roads is up only 5%. Meanwhile, with the surge in population, city  infrastructures are strained, yet government officials face consumer outcries  at the mention of tax increases to upgrade facilities.  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, the congestion and traffic patterns are as good now as  they're ever going to be," Tarantello said. "The only viable solution is not  building more roads but intelligent land-use planning.  </P> <P> "You can no longer zone houses over there, a shopping center on the corner and  office buildings over here," he added. "We are going to have to start pushing  things together. The key to success is traffic mitigation -- taking cars off  the street."  </P> <P> From the worker's viewpoint, living near the office in a mixed-use project  could prove a mixed blessing.  </P> <P> "If you're a workaholic, it might not be good at all (because) you'd be more  inclined to go to work at all times of the day and night," said Dean Schwanke,  director of real estate development information service at the Urban Land  Institute, a Washington organization that has studied the mixed-use phenomenon.  </P> <P> Then again, he added, being close to home would give one the flexibility to  take frequent breaks. "Obviously," he said, "it would save on auto wear and  tear."  </P> <P> Surveys by the institute have shown that employees are not inclined to live in  the same project where they work.  </P> <P> One reason is that developers of mixed-use buildings have found it difficult to  integrate parking for permanent residents and retail customers or office  workers.  </P> <P> Partly because of that, future mixed-use projects are expected to consist  primarily of side-by-side structures -- say, a high-rise office and retail  building joined by corridors to a high-rise residential building.  </P> <P> "You will see less stacking," said James J. Didion, chairman of Coldwell Banker  Commercial Group in Los Angeles and a member of the Urban Land Institute's  mixed-use council. Vertically stacked, mixed-use projects that attempt to do it  all "are very costly to build and very difficult to integrate."  </P></p>

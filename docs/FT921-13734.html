			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman Pounds 1.8m in red SUTCLIFFE Speakman, the activated carbon company which had to be rescued by shareholders after it ran into financial difficulties last year, reported an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.79m for the six months to September 30. The result compared with a deficit of Pounds 11.18m in the nine months ended December 30 1990. The loss, which came on turnover of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 38.9m), included those from discontinued businesses. In engineering fabrication which was disposed of earlier this month for Pounds 600,000, the deficit was Pounds 700,000. The group is trying to re-establish itself as a supplier of speciality activated carbons and solvent recovery plants after a high level of debts forced it to sell its water treatment and environmental engineering companies in late 1990. Last year, in spite of the disposals, it had to refinance its debts and Mr John Bellak, non-executive chairman, who also headed Severn Trent Water at the time, was forced to resign. Sutcliffe hopes that the sale of high technology carbons, which are used in environmental applications, will support its recovery as environmental legislation is increased. The loss per share was significantly reduced to 1.6p (49.1p).</p>

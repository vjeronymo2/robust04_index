			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko arrived  in Tehran on Sunday at the head of a high-ranking  political-economic delegation on a three day official visit to  the Islamic Republic of Iran. Soon after his arrival, Mr.  Zlenko began the first round of his talks with Iranian Foreign  Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati.    Part of yesterday's talks between the foreign ministers  focused on regional and international developments and, as he  had announced before his visit to Tehran, Mr. Zlenko showed he  is willing to do his best for the expansion and strengthening of  bilateral ties during his first official visit to Iran.    In view of the agreements concluded during the Ukrainian  president's visit to Tehran and his meeting with Iranian  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani in April 1992, the Ukrainian  foreign minister believes the present level of the two  countries' ties is not compatible with the needs of the day and  that, along with the two countries' political ties, the level of  Tehran-Kiev economic exchanges should also be increased to  higher and desirable levels.    Therefore, the composition of the political-economic  delegation accompanying the Ukrainian foreign minister is so  designed that, during the three days of talks in Tehran, all  areas of mutual interest could be included, especially when Mr.  Zlenko has come to Tehran with certain specific and clear  proposals for the expansion of bilateral ties.    The Ukrainian foreign minister has laid real stress on the  need for expanding bilateral cooperation in the fields of  energy, steel, petrochemical industries, oil and oil refining,  transport, geology and the training of the two countries'  experts.    The Ukrainian foreign minister, in a detailed report on the  latest developments in his country -- especially Ukraine's views  vis-a-vis the regional countries -- stressed that regional  security is actually a wide-ranging process, which can be  attained only through security for all the regional countries.  The emphasis the Ukrainian foreign minister places on this  point means that, aside from expanding ties with Tehran, Ukraine  is willing to cooperate with Iran on regional and international  security.    On the whole, the trend of Iran-Ukraine ties during the two  year period that has elapsed since the start of political and  economic relations between the two countries and the outcome of  the first round of talks between Dr. Velayati and Mr. Zlenko  reflect the reality that the two countries, with due knowledge  of their common interests, are moving ahead in consolidating the  foundations of bilateral ties. This is not only to the benefit  of Tehran and Kiev, but will also prove beneficial to the  Caucasian region countries.</p>

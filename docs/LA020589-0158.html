			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD BEATS FLORIDA, 84-69, IN FIRST GAME AT ORLANDO ARENA  </P> <P> A crowd of 14,687 packed the Orlando Arena for its basketball debut, but  20th-ranked Stanford spoiled the day by beating Florida, 84-69.  </P> <P> "This is our first time on national TV, and to come into a place like this and  win is great," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "It isn't Florida's home  court, but it's almost like it is."  </P> <P> Todd Lichti led the Cardinal, scoring 27 points, 17 in the first half. Howard  Wright added 17 for Stanford, including 10 during the final six minutes of the  first half, when Stanford (16-5) jumped to a 44-33 lead.  </P> <P> "In the first half, I felt we really ran well," Montgomery said. "Lichti shot  the ball like he always seemed to -- right through the hoop."  </P> <P> Florida (11-10) cut the lead to 60-52 midway through the second half on  Clifford Lett's 3-pointer.  </P> <P> But Wright and Terry Taylor quickly stopped the rally, scoring all of  Stanford's 15 points in the next seven minutes as Stanford took its biggest  lead, 75-58.  </P> <P> "In the second half, we started off by missing some easy shots, but Florida  didn't shoot well either, so that helped," Montgomery said.  </P> <P> Florida, led by Livingston Chatman with 14 points and Dwayne Schintzius with  13, had foul trouble.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well and they did," Florida Coach Norm Sloan said. "We had some  spurts, but every time we got something going, they would do something to take  us out of it. It was their day and not ours."  </P></p>

They agreed with HUD's proposal to eliminate the presumptive estimates since, in general, they no longer serve a useful purpose. This change eliminates the burden of amending the Five-Year Action Plan and/or Annual Statement during a FFY because of differences between the presumptive estimate and final formula amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As endorsed by the commenters, HUD has adopted the proposed rule's provision of providing only one formula amount in the FFY.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Formula Characteristics Report (FCR) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HAs expressed a need to receive their final formula amounts at the earliest possible date. This would allow HAs to base proposed work items and budgets on the actual dollars available. Commenters also requested HUD to update the formula characteristics data in July and August of each year so that the formula characteristics information can be finalized in September. If the formula characteristics information was ready in September, it could be applied at the earliest possible date to the congressionally appropriated amount yielding each HA its final funding amount significantly ahead of the March 1994 date achieved this year. Access to new CGP funds at the earliest possible date is critical to obligating and expending CGP funds in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD will transmit the formula characteristics data to HAs before the end of the current FFY for review and updating for the next year's formula run. However, since the formula calculation is based on all units that are under ACC and have reached DOFA by October 1 of the FFY in which the formula is being run, it is not feasible for HAs to return the FCR until after October 1. Notwithstanding an early review and correction of data, HAs should be aware that the exact amount of funds available for the CGP may not be known until several months into the FFY. This is due to the need to determine the following: (1) Amount of funds, if any, carried over from the previous FFY; (2) amount of funds authorized for set-asides by the Appropriations Act; and (3) shortfalls, if any, in other programs which share the Annual Contributions Account with the Modernization Program. Once the adjusted total appropriation for the Modernization Program is determined, then the Department is able to run the modernization formula, which determines the allocation of funds between the CIAP and CGP, as well as the formula amounts for CGP HAs. However, HUD still anticipates that HAs will have access to their formula amounts earlier in the FFY since only one formula amount will be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

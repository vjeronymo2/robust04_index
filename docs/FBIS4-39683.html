			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia wants the next "ministerial" meeting on  settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be held in a week or  two, a high-ranking Russian diplomat said in an interview with  INTERFAX on Thursday.    He said that the exact time-frame for this meeting could be  defined before the end of the week. The foreign ministers and  secretaries of Russia, the U.S.A., Great Britain, France and the  EU troika (Germany, Greece and Belgium) will discuss these  issues in Istanbul where they will take part in the meeting of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC).    Russia seeks to invite representatives of the parties to the  conflict in Bosnia to the "ministerial" meeting, to tell them  about the results of the work of the contact group on the map of  the demarcation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After this the  parties must have two or three weeks to think everything over  and to settle the disputed issues. Thereafter, a long-term  agreement putting an end to hostilities must be signed, the same  sources told INTERFAX.</p>

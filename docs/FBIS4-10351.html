			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party Vice President Rui Falcao by </F> Carlos Eduardo Alves; place and date not given -- first two  paragraphs are FOLHA introduction]    [Text] Since last June, journalist Rui Falcao, 50, has held  the political command over the PT [Workers Party] in his hands.  A state deputy alternate in Sao Paulo who is himself now holding  the seat, Falcao is the man responsible for the PT leadership's  swing to the left. A former militant in the PCB [Brazilian  Communist Party] and in the VAR-Palmares [Revolutionary Armed  Vanguard], the current vice president of the PT was a political  prisoner for three years during the military regime.    Falcao defends the legitimacy of the current PT leadership  and says the lack of electoral representativeness at the top  does not disqualify the leadership in comparison with the  previous party officers. Following are the highlights of  Falcao's interview with FOLHA.    [Alves] The PT calls itself a socialist party. Would a Lula  administration pave the way for socialism, and if so, what would  be the content of that socialism?    [Falcao] We define a Lula government as being democratic and  people-based. A government of profound social, economic, and  political reforms that plans to tackle longstanding privileges  and create conditions for the people to participate in drafting  the budget, in government decisions, in giving a new direction  to the role of the State, and strengthening the organization of  Brazilian society. The PT is a socialist party and sees the  opportunity to govern the country as the time to change values,  raise the consciousness of the public, and democratize land  ownership.    [Alves] So it would be a government of transition to  socialism?    [Falcao] We want to create democratic conditions so that in  the future we can live in a society of fraternity, justice, and  equality. In our view, such a society is socialist and  democratic.    [Alves] Is the current configuration of the PT leadership  the  result of the exhaustion of the social movement?    [Falcao] The present leadership is as pluralist and  legitimate as its predecessors were. The majority was  constituted by capturing a sentiment pervading the party that  there was too much distance between sectors of the leadership  and the party's rank and file, that there had been  indecisiveness in the former leadership's attitude toward the  Itamar Franco administration when it was formed, and a certain  natural loss of influence of leaders who had spent a lot of time  in command of parties.    [Alves] Among the classical schools of thought that founded  the PT (the Church, the labor movement, and people from leftist  movements), this last group has become superimposed on the  others. Why did this happen?    [Falcao] That sounds like a sociological explanation of the  life of a party. There is no domination by formative legacies in  the composition of the present leadership. Lula, who was mainly  responsible for creating the PT, continues to be the expression  of party unity, and a democratic fellowship among the different  tendencies is what rules the PT today.    [Alves] The groups that now control the PT lack social and  electoral representativeness. Why is that?    [Falcao] I would not say they lack social  representativeness,  inasmuch as several of my fellow leaders are associated with  various movements. Electoral representativeness is conferred by  the party as a whole. The legislators who serve in the current  leadership and all the legislators of the PT were elected by the  weight of the party--not to mention their individual qualities.  Those who are now in the leadership did not go through the same  voting process as their predecessors. But I do not believe this  disqualifies, or qualifies, the colleagues who served previously  in comparison with the present group, or vice versa.    [Alves] Isn't this a sign that the PT is becoming a party of  cadres and not of the masses?    [Falcao] We never defended the idea that the PT should be a  party of cadres. Since its foundation, the PT has broken with  that tradition of the Brazilian Left. We believe that just  because a party organizes millions of workers and common people,  it does not mean that political cadres, organic intellectuals,  are not developing.    [Alves] Lula's electoral base is greater than what the PT  has  historically achieved. If he is elected, will the mandate be  his, or the PT's?    [Falcao] The president's mandate comes from the people, but  it reflects a commitment to a program. It is that relationship  that we establish so that there will be no doubt. It is a  mandate from the people, but one that is also legitimized by the  fulfillment of a program.    [Alves] In case of doubt, will Lula, or the PT, make the  decision?    [Falcao] The one who governs this country is the president  of  the Republic, and his ministers, in conjunction with the  Congress. We want to expand that concept of democracy by having  the population not just vote, but be able to participate in the  control over the government and in government decisions.    [Alves] What are the PT's boundaries in terms of alliances  during the campaign?    [Falcao] Our policy as regards alliances must be coordinated  with our program. We put priority on alliances in society and  also with parties. The PCB [Brazilian Communist Party], the PC  do B [Communist Party of Brazil], the PSB [Brazilian Socialist  Party], the PPS [Socialist People's Party], the PV [Vanguard  Party], the PMN [National Mobilization Party], and the PSTU  [United Social Workers Party] are possibilities. The PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is disputed territory. We  recognize that the PSDB has a people's camp within its  electorate and among its troops, and we are competing for the  support of part of the PSDB for Lula's candidacy, even though we  know the PSDB will run its own candidate for president, riding  piggyback on a stabilization plan, something that is in the  worst tradition of Brazilian politics.    [Alves] What do you think of Minister Fernando Henrique  Cardoso as a candidate, and what about the economic plan?    [Falcao] The economic plan does not deal with the issue of  the monopolies and the financial system. It does not associate  stabilization with the need for development of this country;  therefore, we might actually move into a situation of declining  inflation rates but still have unemployment and misery. In the  third place, it ties the country's economic decisions to the  United States and to the IMF via a shamefaced dollarization of  the Brazilian economy. In the fourth place, it is an  electioneering program because it is betting on the possibility  of a partial and temporary decline in the inflation rate to pay  dividends at the ballot box. It is a Cruzado Plan without a wage  bonus.    [Alves] Now that the constitutional revision is a fact, is  there any regret that the PT is absent from it?    [Falcao] I do not consider the revision to be a consolidated  process. What we are seeing now is an auction. There is dissent  even among the elites as to the course the revision should take.  We have maintained a tactic of obstruction, of attempting to  reduce the boundaries of the revision and to shorten its  duration. If the revision process does get going, we hope to  achieve the longest possible agenda and a change in the rules so  that our deputies can get involved in the process.    [Alves] How do you view the manifesto by the intellectuals  who criticized the party leadership by pointing to a distance  between it and the PT grass roots?    [Falcao] Any group of PT members may legitimately band  together and express themselves either against or in favor of  the leaders. I cannot, however, agree with their view of the  current PT leadership. This leadership is legitimate, and there  are other intellectuals who support it.</p>

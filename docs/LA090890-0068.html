			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COULD HUSSEIN GET HIS TEETH INTO SETTLEMENT?  </P> <P> The crisis in the Persian Gulf could be settled peacefully if Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein got his teeth fixed, the personal dentist to the late guru Osho  Rajneesh said Friday.  </P> <P> Swami Devageet said that Rajneesh, a mystic who was expelled from the United  States in 1985 and died in January, discovered a year ago that "man's animal  past, including his aggressive instincts, are mysteriously stored in the human  dental structure."  </P> <P> In a telex from the commune that Rajneesh founded in Poona, Devageet said that  Hussein could become "a blissful human being instead of a blistering warmonger"  if he submitted to tooth-centered character analysis.  </P> <P> "It may sound absurd, but it's a lot cheaper than a third World War," Devageet  said.  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: In defence of a total nonsense? Sir, I have been bemused by some of the highest intellects in the land hotly defending the wearing of wigs as being somehow beneficial to the proper dispensation of justice in Britain. Vaclav Havel, when he was being persecuted in Czechoslovakia for challenging another rigid form of ideology, once said: 'I love logically constructed arguments which defend total nonsense.' Those of us with lesser minds but perhaps a better understanding of the real world outside the cloistered attitudes of the legal profession, have to ask them: beneath your wigs, are you wearing any clothes?

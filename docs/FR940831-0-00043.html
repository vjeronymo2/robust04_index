However, the regulations explain that we will not make a determination on such a claim for benefits unless the following conditions are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, a claim for benefits based on an allegation that we provided misinformation must be made in writing. The written statement must explain what information was provided; how, when and where it was provided and by whom; and why the information caused the individual not to file an application for benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, an application for the benefits must be filed by the claimant or by someone who could file on behalf of the claimant. The application must be filed after the occurrence of the alleged misinformation.

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Air France losses grow Air France, the state-owned airline, will this year lose FFr7.5bn (Pounds 857m) and see a further decline in its world market share, Mr Bernard Bosson, the transport minister, said at the weekend, writes David Buchan in Paris. With estimates of its 1993 losses steadily worsening from the FFr3.5bn deficit forecast in April, Mr Bosson told the Senate: 'This shows how quickly the company has been sinking'. He also said it had been Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's personal decision to reject the '800 straight redundancies' contained in the austerity plan of Mr Bernard Attali, the former Air France president, who resigned after the government gave in to striking airline staff. The prime minister would countenance only 'a few dozen' layoffs, Mr Bosson said. Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's new president, is re-negotiating the Attali plan with the unions.</p>

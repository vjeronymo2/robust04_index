			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MACHO-MAN' NOVEL SPREADS MORE THAN BLOOD AND GORE  </P> <P> LOOSE JAM by Wayne Wilson Delacorte Press $17.95, 263 pages  </P> <P> This first novel is filled with such macho-man prose as: "There was a flash of  red and his head seemed to stretch like a ball of dough. Blood squirted down  the front of his shirt. A fist slammed into his belly, lifting him to his toes,  driving the air from his lungs. Doubled up and choking, Henry fell to the  pavement."  </P> <P> But although maybe 20% of this narrative is filled with bar fights, road fights  and house fights, and another 20% is composed of generic rape, murder and  pillage, "Loose Jam" is far, far more than a man's-man novel.  </P> <P> Yes, it's true a gun goes off every dozen pages -- whether in Vietnam  flashbacks or the stormy California present. It's true men bite each other and  bash each other with pots and pans and brass Buddhas, and nobody is  "half-stepping" here, and even the villains are righteous in their villainy.  But the novel, just under all this action-movie stuff, is about love,  friendship, second chances and whether life is worth it.  </P> <P> As "Loose Jam" opens, Henry Brown, Vietnam vet and former side man for pianist  Miles Duckworth, self-styled "voice of a generation," is padding quietly into  middle age, bugged by the sour knowledge that life, as he's living it, is full  of fifth and sixth choices.  </P> <P> Henry works up in San Luis Obispo as the manager of someone else's record  store. He rents someone else's house. He's got a crush on a good woman, but he  can't get to first base with her. He's sore as a boil about everything: He's  fat; he's bald; he lives on a diet of doughnuts, lasagna and tequila; he has to  put up with small-town and small-time posturing on every side. His boss is a  culture-monger, but that's just the tiny tip of the iceberg. To Henry,  everything is bleak, everything sad. He's convinced that, at 40, his life is  over.  </P> <P> Enter -- on crutches, dirty and drunk -- Miles Duckworth, out ofthe past. His  band is gone; he's been playing in pizza joints, and a wound from 'Nam has left  him with just the one leg. But all that is nothing. What's worrying Miles is  that another veteran, a creepy sociopath called Policy Man, is out of prison  and after him, sworn to murder Miles, still holding a 20-year grudge.  </P> <P> Miles plays immediate hell with Henry's life. Miles swears and pukes and  dithers at such a high pitch that within a couple of days (it makes you wonder  exactly how up-tight San Luis Obispo is as a community), Henry's lost his house  and his job. He, Miles and Martha -- the woman of Henry's dreams -- drive south  to Los Angeles, then out to Pomona to confront their respective screwed-up  pasts. And in a rust-colored van, the Policy Man, with a stupid and murderous  sidekick called Byron, hurtle after them, determined to settle that 20-year  score.  </P> <P> A word about clumsiness, and then about Art. Clumsiness looms large in this  legend. Henry, while driving, chokes on bread and olive oil, and manages to  make it all come out his nose. Miles spills wine, and leaves the fire on under  kettles until they melt into the stove. Even Policy Man bungles a burglary by  stopping for a Milky Way at a candy-bar machine and getting his hand stuck in  the slot. The author is telling us, and can't stop telling us, that all these  guys, the good and the bad, are misfits. They don't fit, plain and simple, and  it goes back before the war to their white trash origins.  </P> <P> On the other hand, their music is there as a perfect saving grace, the one  immutable thing in an otherwise terribly imperfect world.  </P> <P> Henry idolizes his grandfather, who first taught him to play the guitar, and,  watching him, thinks, "What a pleasure it was to watch the old man's simplest  gestures; like his handwriting, they reflected an archaic elegance, a flair,  that made Henry think of harmony saxes and Edwin Clapp shoes. . . . Was there  anything as nice as the way old men played? Stephane Grappelli, Furry Lewis,  Doc Watson, Jelly Roll -- absolute harmony of heart and fingers."  </P> <P> There are a few things to complain about:  </P> <P> The accent on Stephane is there, but left off "Norteno" music. The veterans'  parade and migrant workers' strike created in the first half of this novel is  neglected in the second. And there are three characters who "throw back their  head and laugh."  </P> <P> But this is nit-picking (or close-editing) of a fine book that aims at the  highest goal: "What do you think about when you think about trying to be a good  man?" "Loose Jam" deserves respectful reading.  </P> <P>  Next: "The World of Mathematics," edited with commentaries and notes by James  R. Newman (Tempus Books).  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fiji's review of its racially biased constitution  will not be headed by an independent commissioner. Fiji's  cabinet this week decided that only Fiji nationals will sit on  the 11-member commission drawn from all the political parties.  The opposition parties had demanded an independent head to  review the constitution which discriminated against Fiji Indians  giving them only 27 seats in the 70-seat parliament. The  commission's final report is due by the end of 1996.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DEFUNCT FIRM CHARGED ON TOXICS  </P> <P> A defunct storage firm and its former owners have been charged with conspiracy  to illegally dispose of hazardous wastes, including surplus napalm bombs, near  a neighborhood, officials said today.  </P> <P> "This case represents perhaps the most serious type of environmental  misconduct," U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said at a news conference in Salt  Lake City.  </P> <P> He said that the 12-count federal grand jury indictment was the first federal  felony prosecution of environmental crime in Utah. He said the company, EKOTEK,  and its two officers had "duped environmentally conscious businesses into  believing that waste materials were being properly disposed of."  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Finance takes a hard look at self-regulation: Norma Cohen sees obstacles to creating a new structure SELF-regulation, the battle cry of the financial services industry half a decade ago, is now seen as dispensable by some who were once its staunchest advocates. The threat of US-style regulatory supervision once prompted competitors in retail financial services to make compromises with each other. Now, those competitors are suggesting that proposed reforms to self-regulation may be so onerous and expensive that it is hard to imagine statutory regulation being any worse. Plans for a new super-body for retail financial services are coming under attack from many of the businesses it was intended to cover. The plan envisages merging Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance and unit trust industry, with Fimbra, the regulator for independent financial advisers, and moving about one in three members of Imro, the regulator for fund managers, into a new Personal Investment Authority. Imro members, though, have made clear that they are reluctant to join the new body, and the life insurance companies have said they will not join unless all their competitors join as well. The life companies' main targets are the banks and building societies, most of which have opted to have their retail financial services arms regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board. Under the Financial Services Act, businesses may choose their regulator. Such absence of compulsion has been the greatest obstacle to getting the new authority off the ground. Sources familiar with a consultative document to be released on September 24 say it contains a number of carrots and sticks designed to solicit as many members as possible. One stick will be a provision that marketing of unit trusts is specifically an activity regulated by PIA - that is aimed at forcing many of Imro's financial intermediary members into the new body. While Imro regulates their affairs, it lacks the specific authority to make rules regarding the sale of unit trusts. The document proposes that the burden of contributions to the Investors Compensation Scheme will be limited for those businesses which are not independent financial advisers or which do not rely on such advisers to distribute their products. Members of the PIA's formation committee have suggested to the banks a structure for funding the scheme which could limit their exposure to losses from the large number of one-man-band Fimbra members who account for the largest category of claims. Claims of up to Pounds 50m a year will fall to independent advisers and those who rely on them for product sales; other PIA members will only have to pick up claims above that. The Pounds 50m ceiling is higher than that for which that category of member is responsible now. Claims above a second ceiling will be charged to all financial services groups. But banks say that falls short of the sort of protection they want. If plans to form the PIA are scrapped, it will leave un-answered the central question that prompted its consideration in the first place: how to fund the government's compensation scheme for small investors. In 1991-92, large insurance companies paid Pounds 14m to the compensation scheme on behalf of the small independent financial advisers that sell their products but cannot afford to pay their levy. Insurance and unit trust companies paid an additional Pounds 27m on their own behalf and have said they are not prepared to continue to bail out their smaller members. Unless new, richer groups can be made to pay more into the scheme, it cannot continue, they say. Banks and others say that in talks with the PIA's formation committee there has been little to encourage them to join. For instance, Imro members sought a rule to require the PIA to vet all members, even those transferring from Fimbra and Lautro, hoping to drive out of the industry the businesses that account for the largest number of claims on the compensation scheme. If such vetting were made a condition, though, the PIA may not win the support of the 70 per cent of Fimbra members which it needs to approve a merger. Banks and building societies have been seeking a cap on the amount they can be asked to pay into the scheme - a move likely to be anathema to the insurance companies. The banks also sought representation on the board of the PIA equal to the one third expected to go to independent financial advisers. That would require either that the board be expanded beyond its already unwieldy 24 members or that consumer representation be cut - both unpalatable to the formation committee. In the face of what may prove intractable disagreements, the financial-services industry is increasingly coming to the view that government regulation is unlikely to be worse than the system now in place. 'Most of our members believe the Financial Services Act hasn't worked at all,' said one building society representative. A switch to statutory regulation is not likely to be any worse, he said - a view increasingly voiced by the life insurance industry as well. The financial services industry is increasingly adopting the view that failure of self-regulatory bodies to prevent the theft of more than Pounds 400m from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell has thrown the entire system into doubt. In the words of Mr Christopher Sharples, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Authority, self-regulation is drinking in 'the last chance saloon'.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Europe higher in thin trading European government bond markets moved slightly higher yesterday in very thin trading, with the US closed for Independence Day and investors bracing themselves ahead of a busy week of economic data and official policy-making meetings. The US Federal Open Markets Committee meets today and tomorrow to discuss monetary policy, amid speculation that it may raise official short-term interest rates, due to signs of domestic economic strength and to support the dollar after its recent weakness. The Bundesbank holds its regular fortnightly meeting on Thursday, although no significant moves on interest rates are expected. On Friday, US non-farm payrolls data are released and the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations meets in Naples for its annual economic summit. 'Markets squeezed upwards apathetically,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets. 'With slightly more stability to the dollar, and with nothing special domestically to focus on, there was no reason to go down,' she said. 'Ahead of all these events, this is not a market you take a big risk in.' Analysts said bond markets may be boosted by the Naples summit, particularly if pronouncements made on trade relations between Japan and the US stabilise the dollar. The German September government bond contract on Liffe was down 0.25 points at 92.15 in late trading, while the September long gilt future on Liffe was down  3/8 points at 100 11/32 . Confidence returned to the Swedish government bond market after the successful SKr6.5bn auction of seven and 15-year bonds. The average accepted yield on the sale of SKr3.5bn of 15-year bonds was 11.05 per cent and that on the auction of SKr3bn of seven-year bonds 10.51 per cent. Both issues were fully covered, with bids of SKr4.36bn entered for the 15-year and SKr8bn for the seven-year bond. Analysts said domestic retail investors and foreign institutional investors were the main buyers, tempted by the high yields. 'It was a relief,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg. 'But the problems are not going to go away and the next test will be the Treasury bill auction on Thursday and the next bond auction in two weeks time,' he said. Yields had risen dramatically ahead of the auction on fears that the government would be unable to find sufficient buyers for its bonds. These fears were triggered by the announcement on Friday by Skandia, one of Sweden's largest insurance companies, that it was boycotting government bonds in protest at the continuing rise in public sector debt.</p>

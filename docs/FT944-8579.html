			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Eminence grise at World Bank goes The World Bank's eminence grise is leaving to join JP Morgan, the Wall Street bank. Mr Ernest Stern, one of the World Bank's three managing directors but long regarded as the real power behind the throne, will step down at the end of January to join the bank formerly headed by Mr Lewis Preston, now his boss at the World Bank. His successor is expected to be American, maintaining an informal geographical balance among the three managing directors. Mr Sven Sandstrom is a European, while Mr Gautam Kaji, who will take over at the beginning of next month from Mr Attila Karaosmanoglu as the third managing director, is Indian. A name is understood to have been submitted to the World Bank's board of directors but not yet approved. Mr Stern's empire at the Washington-based World Bank includes south Asia, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as treasury, controller and budget functions. He also chairs the loan committee. But his influence has long been thought to spread much more widely, through a network of proteges in the organisation and his role as the institutional memory of the World Bank. 'It would be difficult to describe adequately the breadth and depth of his impact upon this institution,' Mr Preston said yesterday. That influence has made him a target of environmentalist groups, which have criticised the bank for what they see as inadequate attention to environmental questions in its lending and support for damaging structural policies in the developing world. 'One could think of a lot of hopeful things happening with some fresh and more open people,' said Ms Korinna Horta of the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington environmental group. A development economist, Mr Stern was brought into the World Bank by Mr Robert MacNamara, who built the institution up in the 1970s. In charge of operations from 1978 to 1987, he helped shape the Bank's lending policies and its move from project loans into lending for structural and sectoral programmes. He was twice tipped to move to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, first on its creation and then when Mr Jacques Attali resigned, but on both occasions chose to stay in Washington.</p>

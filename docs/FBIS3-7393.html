The realization ratio of inter-Korean trade -- the ratio of  the amount of trade actually realized to the amount the  government approved in advance -- reached an all-time high of  93.9 percent last year, according to the KFTA.    The ratio was only 53.7 percent and 57.9 percent in 1990 and  1991, respectively, before soaring to 81.2 percent in 1992.    A KFTA official said, "you can say the period between 1989  and 1992 was a mock-up stage for inter-Korean trade, but from  last year the trade entered into a stable period."    An official at Samsung Co., which recorded the most trade  with the North last year, said, "South Korean investment in the  North was put off after the inter-Korean working-level contact  ruptured. But trade is still going on."</p>

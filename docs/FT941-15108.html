			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Graham Group flotation to occur early this year BTR has confirmed that it is planning to float off Graham Group, a building and agricultural materials subsidiary, early this year. No timetable for the listing has yet been announced, but a pathfinder prospectus for a public offer and placing is expected within a few weeks. The flotation is likely to value Graham Group at about Pounds 200m. There are two main businesses within the group: Graham Builders Merchants, a supplier to the building and plumbing trade, with 148 branches, and Goodman Croggon, an agricultural hardware wholesaler, with 10 branches. The group employs almost 3,000 people, and in 1992 had a turnover of about Pounds 350m. It is the UK's fourth largest builders merchant, with about 5 per cent of the market. Mr Gordon Yardley, a non-executive director of BTR, is to become non-executive chairman of Graham Group. He was formerly executive director of the BTR division which includes the group.</p>

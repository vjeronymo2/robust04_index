Today,  Changchun's Nanhu Guesthouse was decorated with lanterns and  colored streamers. On the occasion when the Spring Festival is  about to arrive, the provincial party committee and the  provincial government invited the personages from all circles in  the province to the 1994 Spring Festival tea party held at Nanhu  Guesthouse.

Attending the party were leading comrades of the provincial  party committee, the provincial people's congress standing  committee, the provincial government, the provincial committee  of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the  provincial higher people's court, and the provincial people's  procuratorate. Also attending were former veteran comrades of  the provincial level, leading comrades of the People's  Liberation Army units stationed in Changchun, leading comrades  of the provincial armed police force corps, chairmen of  democratic parties at the provincial level, director of the  provincial federation of industry and commerce, representatives  of nonparty personages, principal responsible comrades of all  departments and commissions under the provincial party  committee, responsible comrades of pertinent departments under  the provincial government, and principal responsible comrades of  various people's groups. Also attending were representatives of  intellectuals, teachers, model workers, our compatriots from  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and other overseas areas;  representatives of the people of minority nationalities and  religious circles, and responsible comrades of the provincial  civil aviation bureau and the Changchun railway subbureau. The  total attendance surpassed 200 persons. Representatives from  various circles happily met together to recall the past and  compare it with the present and commonly celebrate the  gratifying achievements scored by the province in the reform and  opening up since last year.    He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  made  an ebullient speech at the party. He first of all extended, on  behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, festive greetings and cordial regards to the fellow  comrades and friends participating in the party.    He Zhukang said: Last year, we took a solid step along the  road of reform and development under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line. We conscientiously  implemented the guidelines of the 14th party congress,  integrated the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics with Jilin's realities, and defined, at the  sixth provincial party congress, the strategic goal of building  a developed border near-the-sea province. As a result, the  people's ideas were enlightened greatly, and their field of  vision was broadened. At the same time, the 25 million people  of all nationalities in the province were encouraged to seize  the opportunity to accelerate development. The whole province,  from higher to lower levels, made concerted efforts to make the  province prosperous. The land of Jilin was filled with the  scene of spring and vitality. Last year, the province's GNP  increased by 14.3 percent over the previous year, financial  revenues increased by 24.2 percent after deducting the  incomparable factors, the targets on pushing the economy onto a  new stage were all fulfilled, new headway was made in science  and technology, education, culture, art, sports, public health,  press, and publication undertakings, living standards of urban  and rural residents improved further, party building and the  building of democracy and the legal system were strengthened,  good results were achieved at the present stage of the  anticorruption campaign, and new headway was made in the  building of spiritual civilization.    He Zhukang said: Our province is now characterized by  vigorous economic development, political stability, national  unity, and social progress. All these achievements are the  results of the hard work of the people throughout the province  under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee. Here, on  behalf of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, I want to express my heartfelt thanks for the hard  work and contributions made by fellow comrades here, the vast  number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers, armed  police officers and men, public security cadres and policemen,  our compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, overseas  Chinese residing abroad, and foreign friends.    After explicitly setting forth the basic requirements for  this year's work, Comrade He Zhukang stressed: To make this  year's work a success, we must further emancipate the mind,  strengthen the common understanding, enhance the concerted  strength, and mobilize the initiative of all fields. The whole  province from top to bottom should truly attend to work and pay  attention to practical results. Leading cadres at all levels  must actually improve the work style and the method of  leadership to do more actual work and stop empty talk. In  particular, leading cadres should conscientiously study Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and study and master the theory of the socialist  market economy. In line with the requirements of unity, high  efficiency, administrative honesty, and practical work, leading  cadres should be strict in managing the party and the government  in order to mobilize the masses to push forward all undertakings.    He Zhukang said in conclusion: In this new year, let us more  closely rally around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade  Jiang    Zemin as its nucleus, and advance along the road of the  socialism with Chinese characteristics and toward the  magnificent objective of building a developed border  near-the-sea province in order to win a new victory in reform,  opening up, and modernization drive.    At the tea party, literary and art workers in the province  staged brilliant performances.</p>

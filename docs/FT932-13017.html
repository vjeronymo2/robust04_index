			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Shattered NatWest tower unfit for use THE 600ft National West-minster tower, one of the City's landmarks, is likely to remain empty for some time. Up to a third of the 12,000 square metres of glass in its windows was shattered in the bomb blast. The bank yesterday started allocating the 1,300 staff who work in the tower to desks at other buildings in the City. It emphasised that none of its data processing or trading functions would be affected by the blast. Nearly all staff and managers in the tower work on its UK branch business - about 50 work on international business - and NatWest said it did not believe their work would be substantially disrupted by having to move offices. Mr Derek Wanless, the bank's chief executive, said it was still assessing the extent of damage to the tower and surrounding buildings, including a hall where its annual shareholders' meeting was due to be held tomorrow. The meeting has been moved to the Whitbread Brewery Conference Centre in Chiswell Street. Mr Wanless said damage to the tower was 'substantially worse' than last year, when it lost about 160 windows in the Baltic Exchange bombing. The bank expects to be able to make an assessment of damage by the end of the week. He said there had been 'slight damage' to the NatWest Markets investment banking subsidiary at 135 Bishopsgate, but trading and other operations would continue without interruption today, and clients would not be affected. The bank said the tower, opened in 1981, had been 'fully insured'. It did not expect to lose files or data as a result of the blast, and operations such as credit cards and local branch services would be unaffected. NatWest's staff who are not needed for work immediately will be advised to take up to two days off work while the bank re-allocates functions. The bank said it was establishing a telephone service to advise employees.</p>

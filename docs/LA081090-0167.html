			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PERU GOV'T. URGES CALM AMID LOOTING, DEATHS  </P> <P> Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's 2-week-old government appealed for calm  today after a drastic austerity plan was met with shantytown lootings and  protests in which security forces killed four people.  </P> <P> Police opened fire on a mob of about 100 people looting a food warehouse in the  northern city of Trujillo overnight, killing one man, police said.  </P> <P> He was the latest victim of the backlash to the new austerity package.  </P> <P> The austerity program, announced Wednesday night, included a 3,100% boost in  gasoline prices, huge price increases in food staples and sweeping exchange and  foreign trade reforms.  </P> <P> Transport was paralyzed across the country for the second day in a row today as  bus companies demanded the government boost fares to match the gasoline price  rise.  </P> <P> Most economists praised the plan as tough but necessary to rescue the state's  bankrupt finances, but it sparked a rash of protests and lootings at shantytown  food markets where security forces killed three people Thursday and injured  four others.  </P> <P> "Some adverse reactions . . . are absolutely normal, but we call . . . on the  population to have patience and stay calm," Labor Minister Carlos Torres said  in a radio interview.  </P> <P> Lima appeared to be calm today. But crowds of people in at least three other  cities swept through markets overnight stealing food, police and radio reports  said.  </P> <P> Supermarket owners posted armed guards at their doors, and most small  shopkeepers closed for fear of looting or because they had no idea what to  charge.  </P></p>

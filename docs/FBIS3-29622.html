			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe urged the government Tuesday [22 February] to  tighten customs inspections of cargo and luggage going to North  Korea to prevent a possible "outflow of Japanese high  technology."    At a luncheon meeting at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of  Japan, Watanabe described customs inspections in this area as  "lax."    "Regarding the inspection of the carry-on baggage of Korean  residents going to North Korea from the port of Niigata,  inspections have been loose," said Watanabe, head of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party's No. 3 faction.    "Bulldozers, for example, have been claimed as carry-on  baggage on the vessels and have been brought back to North  Korea." He maintained that such goods should be subject to more  stringent inspections.    Watanabe, concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign  minister under former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, said that  some Korean residents might have hidden high-technology products  among cargo and luggage brought back to North Korea aboard a  ferry from Niigata.    His remarks followed raids by Japanese police in January on  some trading houses and makers of high-technology products,  accused of exporting to North Korea "spectrum analyzers" for  radio waves that are included on the Cocom list of restricted  technology.    Cocom refers to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls. Press reports said North Korea might have used  the equipment to upgrade the accuracy of the guidance system of  its "Nodong" missiles.    Watanabe said, "because Japan has laws to prohibit the  outflow of high-technology products to North Korea, it should  invoke the laws strictly."    Watanabe urged Pyongyang to accept international inspection  of two undeclared nuclear sites, on top of the seven declared  nuclear facilities whose checkups it said it will accept.    "Unless North Korea accepts inspections of the undeclared  sites, it will never be able to clear up suspicions," about its  alleged nuclear arms manufacturing program, he warned.    "It is quite insufficient to allow the inspection only of  the  (seven) nuclear facilities it had earlier declared" to the IAEA,  he said.    Watanabe also urged the governing coalition not to take  retaliatory measures against the United States, even if the  administration of President Bill Clinton imposes the "Super 301"  punitive trade rule.    "Japan should not react emotionally," he said. "I can  understand the U.S. frustration well, as Japan has run a chronic  50 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States."</p>

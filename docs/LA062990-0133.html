			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Guess Lawyer Offers to Arbitrate Fee: Marshall B. Grossman, chief trial lawyer  for the Los Angeles clothing maker, withdrew his opposition to the destruction  of a jury verdict form that had been partly filled out when Guess settled its 6  1/2-year legal dispute with Jordache last month. Guess' owners regained control  of the company, but they feuded with Grossman during the Los Angeles County  Superior Court trial and have refused to pay a $10-million bonus he was  promised if they won back control. Attorneys speculated that Grossman wanted  the verdict form preserved as evidence in a fight for the bonus.  </P></p>

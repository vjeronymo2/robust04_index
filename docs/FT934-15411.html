			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Nourishment for an infant industry: Medics increasingly see value in nutritional supplements - unlike many big drugs companies Nutritional supplements are fast becoming a fad in orthodox medical circles. Doctors who 10 years ago would have been scornful of healthy adults taking vitamin pills, evening primrose or fish oil are today recommending them enthusiastically to protect against cancer, heart disease and other common ailments. A steady stream of clinical trials is showing that food supplements can bring health benefits to a wide range of people - and not just to patients suffering from rare nutritional deficits. During the 1980s, evidence accumulated that regular consumption of fish oil reduced heart attacks and that evening primrose oil could treat a variety of disorders from pre-menstrual pain to eczema. The spotlight in the 1990s has fallen above all on the so-called 'anti-oxidant' supplements such as vitamins C and E, which suppress natural chemical reactions that damage cells in the body. 'Over the past three years there has been a tremendous shift in knowledge and opinion about anti-oxidants,' says Professor Anthony Diplock, head of biochemistry at Guy's Hospital, London. 'There's now a quite massive body of evidence, largely epidemiological, that these nutrients can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer and also cataracts.' Hundreds of studies over the past decade have shown a strong link between diet and disease - for example, that eating plenty of fruit and vegetables helps to prevent cancer and that consumption of fish reduces heart disease. What is new is the convincing evidence that nutritional supplements, in the form of pills and capsules, can reinforce the beneficial effect of a healthy diet. This summer the Harvard School of Public Health published an epidemiological study of 120,000 nurses and doctors which showed that taking additional vitamin E for at least two years cut the risk of heart disease by about 40 per cent. And last month a US-Chinese study of 30,000 people in rural China found a 13 per cent reduction in cancer deaths among those who took anti-oxidant supplements over five years. Such evidence is likely to fuel the growth of the nutritional supplement market, which is already worth about Dollars 5bn worldwide and expanding by 10 per cent a year. (Good international estimates are hard to come by - partly because the boundaries between nutritional supplements and foods on the one hand and medicines on the other vary around the world.) Statistics for the UK, based on figures from manufacturers and market research companies, show sales of health supplements up 12.5 per cent last year to Pounds 215m. Evening primrose oil grew fastest - up 80 per cent to Pounds 32m. The proportion of the adult population taking supplements has risen from 19 per cent in 1986 to 32 per cent now, says Mr Alan Clements, marketing director of Seven Seas, the leading UK brand. Yet the orthodox pharmaceutical industry continues to keep its distance from nutritional supplements and shows little interest in turning them into prescription drugs. Indeed the whole thrust of pharmaceutical research today is in the opposite direction. Most synthetic drugs are designed to block one specific biochemical process in the body, whereas supplements achieve a wide-ranging effect by making up for a natural chemical deficit. One reason why drug companies prefer synthetic chemicals to natural products is that their patent protection is far more secure. Another is that licensing regulations are more clear-cut for straightforward medicines than they are on the borderline between drugs and food supplements - where there are still radical differences between national policies even within the EC. Roche of Switzerland is the exception among the pharmaceutical giants. It manufactures vitamins in bulk for other companies and also sells them itself as food supplements and medicines. In 1992 Roche's vitamin sales rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn. Roche has an active research programme developing drugs from vitamins, including powerful new treatments for acne and other skin disease based on chemical derivatives of vitamin A. Apart from Roche, the world supplements industry consists mainly of relatively small companies concentrating on national or regional markets. Very few have the financial resources or the management expertise to develop new drugs from their products, although these would give them a substantial new revenue stream from essentially the same ingredients; even with the current pressure on pharmaceutical prices, drugs have larger profit margins than food supplements. A striking exception here is Scotia, an emerging pharmaceuticals company that is being floated on the London stock market later this month with an expected capitalisation of Pounds 160m. Dr David Horrobin founded the company in 1979 with the strategy of selling evening primrose oil as a nutritional supplement - promoted by clinical studies showing its wide-ranging health benefits - and ploughing the profits into drug development. Scotia now has two prescription drugs based on 'essential fatty acids' extracted from seeds of the evening primrose; they are licensed for treating breast pain and the skin disorder, eczema. Others in ad-vanced clinical trials include drugs for cancer, complications of diabetes, arthritis and blocked arteries. Dr Horrobin concedes that some doctors are occasionally suspicious of Scotia because apparently different medical problems can be treated with very similar drugs. But he points out two things. 'First, each fatty acid has highly specific actions, and small differences in structure can lead to dramatically different effects,' he says. 'Second, the n-6 family of fatty acids, which are found in evening primrose and other oils, are essential for the structure and function of every cell membrane in the body. Thus shortages or imbalances of those fatty acids can disturb the function of every tissue, leading to a diverse range of symptoms.' The other group of essential fatty acids, the n-3 family, is particularly important in the brain, the heart and blood circulation and the regulation of inflammation. Fish oil is the main source of n-3 fatty acids. The only medicine in the UK based on fish oil is Maxepa, for which Seven Seas, a Hanson subsidiary, received a licence in 1987. Doctors can prescribe it for lowering the level of harmful fats in the blood. Sales of Maxepa are relatively modest - about Pounds 2m a year in the UK, compared with Pounds 20m a year for the company's fish oil supplements. But Seven Seas, unlike Scotia, does not want to change from being primarily a supplements manufacturer to a drug company, says Mr Clements. 'Scotia is an R&amp;D-based company, while we're really a marketing company that is more suited to the consumer marketplace.' Compared with synthetic chemicals, medicines based on nutritional supplements tend to be slow and gentle in their effects. That can make it hard to satisfy regulatory authorities of their effectiveness in small-scale clinical trials. Scotia, for example, put in a licensing application for Efabetic, its proposed treatment for nerve damage caused by diabetes, on the basis of a trial with 111 patients. It led to a statistically significant improvement, but the UK Medicines Control Agency told the company that 'convincing efficacy had still not been demonstrated on a sufficiently large number of patients'. Scotia is now sponsoring further clinical trials and hopes to submit a new application late next year with data from 400 patients. The barrier is just as high in the US. One company trying to overcome it is La Haye Laboratories of Redmond, Washington - founded in 1986 with a somewhat similar strategy to Scotia in the UK. It sells Icaps Plus, a mixture of anti-oxidant vitamins and minerals, as a nutritional supplement, and has a similar but more powerful blend in the final phase of clinical trials for treating two eye diseases. 'I believe it will be the first nutritional product approved (as a drug) by the Food and Drug Administration,' says Mr Larry Laks, the company's executive vice-president. La Haye is taking no chances; its clinical trials involve 2,400 patients. In addition to the epidemiological evidence, scientists are beginning to understand how anti-oxidants work 'at the basic molecular level', Prof Diplock says. In very simple terms, they destroy 'free radicals' - reactive molecules which can damage cells and trigger diseases. And, even if they do you no good, most supplements are unlikely to cause any harm. Prof Diplock, who has just completed a scientific review of all the safety evidence on vitamin E, found that it had no adverse effects even at doses of 3 grammes a day - 300 times the US recommended daily allowance. As the chorus of medical voices singing the praises of vitamins and nutritional supplements grows, the industry seems certain to expand rapidly. At the same time, it may attract more attention from other large pharmaceutical companies looking for a source of safe new drugs.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Rise in house sales forecast as prices continue to drift THE VOLUME of UK house sales is expected to recover by as much as 15 per cent next year but prices are likely to go on falling, according to industry and independent forecasts. Forecasters believe buyers will be tempted back into the market by low interest rates and cheap house prices, prompting the first annual increase in house sales in four years. Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, said yesterday the number of UK house sales could rise by 13 per cent next year from 1.06m to 1.2m. This compares with a peak of 1.98m sales in 1988 at the height of the property boom. The bank warned that prices would continue to drift down even when sales started to rise, because of the large backlog of unsold properties. Buyers concerned about rising unemployment and the state of the UK economy would not countenance higher prices. Mr James Morrell, who prepared the forecasts for Charterhouse, predicted that prices would fall next year by a further 1 per cent after a 6 per cent decline this year. The bank forecasts 6 per cent price rises in both 1994 and 1995. Mr Morrell said house prices had fallen to their lowest level in relation to average earnings since the 1970s and this would attract buyers back into the market. A survey of more than 300 housebuilders by the House Builders Federation found that 43 per cent of companies expected sales to rise next year. Another 27 per cent expected sales to stay static, while the remaining 30 per cent forecast further falls. House prices in the south-east have fallen on average by about 30 per cent since the 1988 peak. Mr Morrell said: 'People who bought in 1988 would have to wait until the turn of the century to recover their money, assuming that prices continue to rise at about 6 per cent a year from 1994 onwards.'

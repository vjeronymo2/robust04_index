			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SHELTER SAYS OXNARD WANTS TO SHUT IT, OPEN OWN CENTER  </P> <P> Representatives of the county's only year-round homeless shelter accused Oxnard  officials Tuesday of conspiring to close the Zoe Christian Center while working  to develop their own city-run shelter.  </P> <P> In an emotional speech to the City Council, Zoe founder Fred Judy said the  city's effort to "manipulate and successfully cut off some major funding" for  the center was based on racial discrimination.  </P> <P> "They have deliberately planned and generated negative support and attitude  toward our organization," said Judy, who along with the Rev. Jim Gilmer, the  center's executive director, is black.  </P> <P> To support his assertions, Judy cited an internal memo from a Thousand Oaks  city planner that said support of the center "may have political liability"  with the city of Oxnard.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi called allegations of political maneuvering "absolutely  false" and said the conflict with Zoe centers primarily on a zoning dispute.  </P> <P> "We're doing all we can to help them out," he said.  </P> <P> The future of the Zoe center, which provides shelter and counseling for about  150 people a day, was placed in jeopardy when the city Fire Department issued a  report in June, 1988, that pointed out that it is next to a fertilizer company  where toxic chemicals are stored. The council has since said the center is too  close to the hazardous chemicals.  </P> <P> Zoe Center had been operating for five years on a temporary permit in an area  zoned for industrial and manufacturing uses. That permit expired last year.  </P> <P> Judy contends that Oxnard's failure to renew the permit or rezone the area has  prompted several organizations, including the U.S. Department of Housing and  Urban Development, to cut off funding to Zoe. He accused Takasugi and other  officials of spreading inflammatory information about the center.  </P> <P> He estimated that Zoe has lost more than $1 million in grants since 1988. The  center's annual budget is about $700,000, according to an Internal Revenue  Service report.  </P> <P> Oxnard Housing Director Sal Gonzalez said that the city has never tried to  persuade any organization to cut off funding to Zoe and that it is trying to  find a permanent site for the center.  </P> <P> However, Gonzalez acknowledged that Oxnard officials asked the Assn. of Ventura  County Cities in March to form a joint-powers agreement to help develop a  homeless shelter in Oxnard.  </P> <P> Gonzalez said Judy and Gilmer will be allowed to bid to operate the proposed  city-run Oxnard shelter.  </P> <P> On Monday, Ventura city officials told Judy that the city is withholding  $200,000 in support to Zoe until Oxnard's joint-powers proposal is completed.  </P> <P> "Well, it seems to me that somewhere along the line we are being eliminated  from the picture," Judy told the Ventura City Council.  </P> <P> During the Oxnard City Council meeting Tuesday, Judy revealed an internal memo  from Thousand Oaks planning officials that he said proves Oxnard has tried to  force the closure of the Zoe center.  </P> <P> In the memo to Thousand Oaks City Manager Grant Brimhall, Senior Planner Olav  Hassel said support of the joint powers agreement is "an alternative to  additional assistance to Zoe."  </P> <P> The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, says that "there appear to  be two political groupings in the county pursuing the development of new  shelter facilities" and that "commitment to the Zoe project may have political  liability."  </P> <P> The memo identifies the two groups as the city of Oxnard and Zoe supporters.  </P> <P> However, in an interview Tuesday, Hassel tried to back away from statements in  the memo.  </P> <P> "My comments in that internal memo are an overreaction," he said. "It's obvious  that my analysis oversimplified the situation. I don't think that funding the  Zoe Center is a political issue. It's a zoning and environmental issue."  </P> <P> Gonzalez said the facts in the memo were correct but that the assumptions about  political groupings were inaccurate.  </P> <P> Ventura Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who also chairs an Assn. of Ventura  County Cities subcommittee on homeless housing, said he was surprised by the  statements in the Thousand Oaks memo.  </P> <P> "What cropped up in the memo may be something the city of Oxnard is planning,  but it was never discussed by the committee," he said.  </P></p>

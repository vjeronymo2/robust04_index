			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LORD, GLENDALE COME OF AGE AND KNOCK OFF CERRITOS, 71-63  </P> <P> A year of playoff experience continues to pay big dividends for the Glendale  College men's basketball team.  </P> <P> Last season, a mostly freshman Vaquero team folded in the final minutes of a  second-round game against then-defending state champion El Camino.  </P> <P> Wednesday night against Cerritos, Glendale once again found itself in a close  game with a defending state champion.  </P> <P> This time, however, the sophomore-dominated Vaqueros stayed calm and upset the  Falcons, 71-63, in the semifinals of the Southern California regional playoffs.  </P> <P> Glendale (24-11) will meet Rancho Santiago, a 105-86 winner over Harbor, on  Saturday night.  </P> <P> The winner will advance to the eight-team state final March 8-10 at the Bren  Center at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Cerritos finished its season 22-11.  </P> <P> "Tonight, we really stepped up when it was crucial," Glendale Coach Brian  Beauchemin said. "We made some very big plays."  </P> <P> None were bigger than two steals by Justin Lord with less than 2 minutes 30  seconds left.  </P> <P> Glendale, which led for most of the game, had taken a 64-60 lead on a basket by  Gary Fowler with 2:27 left when Lord deflected a Cerritos pass in the backcourt  that resulted in a steal by Fowler. Vigen Serop made the Falcons pay for their  error by sinking a pair of free throws with 1:40 left to put the Vaqueros  ahead, 66-60.  </P> <P> Lord then provided the crushing blow on Cerritos' ensuing possession when he  stole a pass at the Falcons' free-throw line and dribbled the length of the  court for a dunk.  </P> <P> "Our defense is what won us the game," Lord said.  </P> <P> Dave Swanson's hot hand also contributed significantly to the Vaqueros'  victory. Swanson, a sophomore forward from Alemany High, celebrated his 21st  birthday by scoring a game-high 27 points and grabbing a team-high 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> Lord added 19 points and Bruce Heicke and Fowler scored 11 and eight points,  respectively, for the Vaqueros.  </P> <P> Scott Roczey scored a team-high 20 points for Cerritos as the Vaqueros limited  guard Wayne Gipson -- the most valuable player of the South Coast Conference --  to 11 points, six below his season average.  </P> <P> "Last year, we peaked out at this time," Swanson said. "This year, our  determination is still peaking."  </P> <P> Glendale led, 31-29, at halftime behind the play of Lord, who scored 14 points.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros got a break three minutes into the game when Cerritos forward Clay  Schwartz, who averages 10 points and a team-high eight rebounds, sustained an  ankle injury that kept him out of the rest of the game.  </P> <P> Glendale also took advantage of the Falcons' cold shooting to forge a 17-10  lead with 14:47 left in the half.  </P> <P> Cerritos then went on a 9-2 run and tied the score, 19-19, on a basket by  Roczey, who had 10 points in the half.  </P> <P> Glendale went back on top, 27-21 on a three-point shot by Swanson.  </P></p>

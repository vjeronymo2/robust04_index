			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / EU may change banks' property loan rules The European Union is considering changing the rules which govern the amount of capital banks have to set aside against commercial property loans. There are loans of Ecu580bn (Pounds 456bn) in the EU. Under the terms of a deal agreed by EU governments in 1989, banks in Germany, Denmark and Greece provide only half the amount of capital against commercial mortgages as their counterparts in other member states. The regulations must be harmonised by 1 January 1996. Banks in the three countries could be asked to set aside an estimated Ecu4.7bn additional capital to bring them into line. Alternatively, the rules which apply in these countries could be introduced across the EU. Any change could have a marked impact on the structure of corporate lending in Europe and on the behaviour of property markets. The European Commission has asked a group including Britain's Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, City University Business School, WestDeutsche Landesbank and Compagnie Bancaire to consider whether the rules distort the market and whether they should be removed or applied generally, which would have the effect of increasing banks' capacity to lend against property. Mr Peter Champness, who will chair the research panel on behalf of the Royal Institution, said: 'German banks would be particularly affected by a requirement for higher ratios and their exposure to property-related lending is significant throughout Europe.' The European Mortgage Federation, which represents mortgage banks, said that institutions in Germany, Denmark and Greece would have to reduce lending activity and increase interest rates by about 0.25 per cent if they are forced to set aside additional capital. It is calling for the lower capital requirement which applies in these countries to be extended to all member states. The Federation argues that mortgages are less risky than other forms of commercial lending if professional property valuations are carried out and regulations governing loan-to-value ratios are in force. For example, commercial mortgages only qualify for the lower capital requirement in Germany if the sum borrowed does not exceed 60 per cent of the value of the property. Some national bank regulators are likely to oppose such a change on the grounds that it would take the EU out of step with international banking regulations. The Basle Accord on capital adequacy, which sets capital requirements for international banks, treats mortgages in the same way as other commercial loans. The Federation said that the Basle regulations were designed to cover large international banks while European legislation deals with national institutions which are not exposed to the same risks.</p>

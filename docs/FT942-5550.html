			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Short-covering lifts prices after volatile session The heavy selling that has battered European government bond markets in recent days abated yesterday, allowing several markets to edge higher. After a volatile session, prices were lifted in the afternoon by short-covering in the futures markets as traders squared positions ahead of today's US employment data. The UK gilt market, which had dramatically underperformed the rest of Europe in the last few days, outperformed its neighbours in a sharp rebound, especially among longer-dated maturities. Supported at the open by firmer US Treasuries, longer-dated gilts were further boosted by investors shifting funds from the short end of the yield curve to the long end. However, many saw the gains as largely technical after the recent sharp declines. 'There hasn't been a huge amount of cash buying - the market outperformed today because it massively underperformed in the last few days,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets. Moreover, many traders were squaring their positions ahead of the US data, causing a short-squeeze in the gilt future. Despite the market's strong performance, few felt it heralded the end of the sell-off. The long gilt futures contract jumped by more than two points to 101 29/32 , while the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose by more than three points to around 103 1/2 , its yield falling by 36 basis points on the day to 8.41 per cent. The sharp recovery caused the 10-year benchmark's yield premium over its German counterpart to narrow by some 30 basis points to 160 basis points. French bonds ended lower despite the Bank of France's 10 basis point cut in its intervention rate to 5.30 per cent. The auction of FFr19.9bn of debt, including FFr16.5bn of the new benchmark 6 3/4 per cent bonds due October 2004, went relatively well, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1 on the 10-year bond and a 3.1 bid-to-cover ratio on the 6 per cent bonds due October 2025. However, according to one Paris trader 'it was a purely professionally driven auction'. He added that the lack of retail demand for the paper put heavy pressure on prices after the auction announcement. The June notional bond contract on Matif fell by 0.68 points to 115.88, although it recovered to around 116.30 in after-hours trading on Globex. With most parts of Germany closed for Corpus Christi holiday, the bund market was somewhat calmer, although the bund futures contract on Liffe remained volatile. By late trading it had risen 0.30 points to 92.52. Italian bonds also staged a cautious recovery, mainly on short-covering in the futures market. The June BTP future rose by 0.39 points to 107.43. In Spain, the Treasury at its latest auction allotted around Pta90bn in three and five-year paper but accepted no bids for 10 and 15-year bonds. This put a damper on market sentiment, and the June bond future fell by 0.15 points to 93.60. US Treasury bond prices improved yesterday ahead of this morning's crucial jobs data. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  17/32 at 86-29/32, with the yield slipping to 7.338 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/8 at 99 15/16 , to yield 5.891 per cent. Although the fundamental factors pushing European bonds lower this week had no direct influence on Treasuries, analysts are beginning to see the trend overseas as positive for the US market. The retreat in Europe could bring an influx of funds into US government securities, according to this view, especially if today's data on labour market conditions in May proves favourable. This prospect appeared to have played some part in the rebound on Wednesday afternoon. The improvement had come even though that morning's economic news contained a red flag on inflation. Yesterday, the news was more positive for bonds. The Commerce Department said new orders for factory goods had dipped by 0.1 per cent in April. Economists had forecast a slight gain. The decline suggested that the Federal Reserve's moves to tighter money this year are having the desired effect of slowing the economy and easing any incipient inflationary pressures. The April index of leading indicators told much the same story. It held steady after a gain of 0.7 per cent the previous month. The data, combined with fairly stable commodity prices, brought a constructive mood to the market. There was still an air of restraint, however, with the May employment data looming today. Analysts are expecting an increase of 275,000 to 300,000 in non-farm payrolls. Bonds are likely give back all of the week's price gains and more if the figure exceeded expectations.</p>

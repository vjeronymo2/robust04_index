			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Costs of accountancy watchdog soar The costs of the accountancy profession's most senior regulatory body have increased by nearly half, the 1993 accounts showed yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Spending on the Joint Disciplinary Scheme was Pounds 1.44m in the year to December 31, from Pounds 1.03m in the previous year. The scheme estimates that an additional Pounds 1.63m not yet allowed for in the accounts will be needed to complete work on its five current investigations, even before any costs if the verdicts are appealed against. This compares with an estimate of Pounds 670,000 for completing its two outstanding inquiries last year. No cases were completed in 1993, but an additional three cases were taken on. The original two are Barlow Clowes, the fund management company, and the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Last year it started probes of Robert Maxwell companies, those associated with International Signal and Control Group, which was bought by Ferranti, and War on Want, the charity.</p>

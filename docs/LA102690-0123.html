			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIERRA CLUB CHAPTER ENDORSES FERGUSON  </P> <P> Reversing its decision to stay out of congressional politics, the area chapter  of the Sierra Club has decided to support Democrat Anita Perez Ferguson in her  bid to unseat Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura).  </P> <P> After weeks of holding out, one member of the Sierra Club's Los Padres chapter  executive board switched positions to provide the pivotal vote in favor of  Ferguson, said Beverly Full, the chapter's political action chairwoman.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the chapter's recommended endorsement was forwarded to the Sierra  Club's national political committee in Washington for ratification. "An  endorsement is under consideration right now. . . ," said Betsy Loyless,  assistant political director in Washington.  </P> <P> Ferguson, a Santa Barbara education consultant, said she was "terrifically  pleased" that the Sierra Club has joined a number of other environmental groups  endorsing her. "This gives us the right amount of time to get the message out  that the environmental community supports my candidacy."  </P> <P> Lagomarsino said he was surprised by the decision of the chapter, which has  6,000 members in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.  </P> <P> "I really think they are misinformed or strictly political because I have done  a heck of a lot for the area," Lagomarsino said.  </P> <P> One major accomplishment that he noted was his role in strengthening air  pollution controls over diesel generators on offshore oil rigs.  </P> <P> He added that the Sierra Club's decision is shortsighted. "I sit in a very  important position on the Interior Committee and plan to stay there. We handle  more environmental legislation than any other committee."  </P> <P> Full said most area Sierra Club leaders decided not to endorse Lagomarsino  because he has received consistently low marks on a score card of environmental  votes kept by the League of Conservation Voters.

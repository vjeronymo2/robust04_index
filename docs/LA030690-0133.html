			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> EX-OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF IMPROPER MAILING  </P> <P> The state Fair Political Practices Commission has accused former Santa Ana City  Councilman Wilson B. Hart of improperly mailing thousands of letters during the  1989 council campaign.  </P> <P> According to the complaint, the Friends of Wilson Hart Committee sent out  11,000 letters purportedly by former Santa Ana Police Chief Raymond Davis  suggesting that the other City Council candidates had "conflicts of interest."  The mailings were paid by Hart's committee.  </P> <P> The letters were in violation of the state's 1974 Political Reform Act because  Hart failed to identify himself as the sender or mention his committee, the  complaint said. According to the act, "the name of a candidate and his or her  controlled committee must appear in at least 6-point type on the outside of  each piece of a mass mailing."  </P> <P> In another letter, Hart's committee sent a reprint of a newspaper article that  further described conflicts of interest by the other candidates. "The mailing  emphasized the fact that Mr. Hart had not been mentioned in the article as  having a conflict of interest," the complaint read.  </P> <P> In those letters, Hart also did not identify himself or his committee as the  sender.  </P> <P> The FPPC filed the two-count complaint Monday against Hart, who finished the  April 4, 1989, election in third place. Hart, an attorney, faces up to $2,000  in fines for each count if he is found guilty. He will have to go before an  administrative judge, who would then make recommendation to the commission.  </P> <P> Hart declined to comment on the charge, which was filed in Sacramento.  </P> <P> The complaint was brought after the FPPC received "sufficient evidence to bring  about enforcement action," said Sandra Michioku, a commission spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The identification of candidates are needed in mass mailings so that voters can  assess the political messages in the campaign material, Michioku noted.  </P> <P> Hart was a councilman from 1984 to 1988. He lost to Councilman John Acosta in  1988 after the city was divided into different wards because of redistricting.  </P> <P> Hart had been running against swap meet operator Richards Norton, who won the  race. The other candidates were businessman Lyle Overby, transportation  official Lisa Mills and real estate agent William Camp. LILY ENG  </P></p>

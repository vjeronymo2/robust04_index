			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . Current issue of Newsweek calls "Look Who's Talking" John Travolta's  "first hit since 1980's 'Urban Cowboy.' " Naw. "Staying Alive" (1983) grossed  $150 million worldwide.  </P> <P> . . . The ad folks started casting around town last week for "The New Camel  Man" for TV commercials to run around the world (not here, of course, where  they're banned). They want the same old type: Harrison Ford, Sam Shepard, Clint  Eastwood, etc.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 7, 9 May EESTI SENUMID, P.EVALEHT, p. 1; "News </F> Bulletin" No. 88/94]    [Text] President Lennart Meri interrupted his visit to  Portugal and returned a day sooner than planned because of the  statement by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Gratchev.    Gratchev announced in Moscow on Friday [6 May] that Russia  may keep its troops in Estonia indefinitely unless the issue of  the retired military be settled according to Russia's demands.  He added that the forces could be increased "in order to  protect military sites in Estonia."    Head of the Russian negotiations delegation Vasili Svirin  declined from commenting the minister's threats. He had earlier  assured that the troops stationed in Estonia will not be  reinforced.    President Meri attended an international meeting in Arrabida  near Lisbon, dedicated to the prevention of conflicts by the UN  and the NATO. "A threat by one UN member state to use military  force against another member -- Estonia -- is a serious matter.  For that reason I interrupted my visit, hurried back and  discussed the ways of countering the threat on Saturday  evening," Meri said in his speech held on Mother's Day.    Tendencies of increasing reliance on force and attempts of  realisation of the "near abroad" policy are evident in Russia's  policy, Foreign Ministry Vice Chancellor Raul Malk commented the  Russian defence minister's threats. Malk pointed out that the  Gratchev statement contradicts the CSCE and the UN documents on  the troops withdrawal from Estonia. "The Gratchev statement is a  direct challenge to the authority of international demands. The  Russian defence minister's threats of stopping the military  withdrawal and reinforcement of present troops prove Moscow's  increasing attempts to force its will on other states and  international organisations," Malk commented.    He also stressed the fact that Gratchev made his statement  while the negotiations were still going on. This can be  understood as a way of exerting pressure on Estonia, as well as  a Russian decision to give up negotiations, Malk said.    The states which remain indifferent witnesses of the  tendencies in Russian politics will accept a grave  responsibility, the vice-chancellor warned.</p>

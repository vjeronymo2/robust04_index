			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Markets seek clues to 'neutral' rates: What Greenspan may mean by such an interest level There is a question hovering like a dark cloud over financial markets. What does Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, mean when he talks of a 'neutral' level of short-term interest rates? The question is critical because Mr Greenspan has indicated publicly that he intends to raise rates until they reach a neutral level consistent with sustainable non-inflationary growth. The problem is that the Fed has given no indication of what such a rate would be. Confusion about the meaning of neutrality partly explained the adverse market reaction to the Fed's first tightening move - the quarter point increase in short rates announced on February 4. It was immediately clear that rates were still below a neutral level. Markets therefore discounted further rate increases, causing a plunge in bond prices and a rise in yields to nearly 7 per cent. Tuesday's quarter point increase, taking short rates to 3.5 per cent, was better received, presumably because it took rates closer to Mr Greenspan's goal of neutrality. Bond prices surged and share prices advanced modestly, rather than plunging as in early February. Many analysts now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged for a few months, in the hope that markets will calm down. But because 3.5 per cent is almost certainly not what Mr Greenspan regards as a neutral monetary policy, nagging doubts will remain. In recent decades, says Mr Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, the federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money for banks - has exceeded consumer price inflation by an average of 180 basis points, or 1.8 percentage points. Since the underlying rate of inflation is at least 2.5 per cent, and quite possibly 3, this implies a neutral rate would be between 4 and 5 per cent. However, during periods when inflation was subdued - such as the 1950s  - the gap between inflation and short-term rates was closer to 100 basis points or 1 percentage point. So optimists on inflation - such as President Bill Clinton's economic advisers - may believe the present Fed funds rate of 3.5 per cent is already at, or close to, neutrality. If economic growth slows down after overheating in the final quarter of last year, as most forecasts suggest, monetary policy might not need to be tightened much more. And bond yields could move back down to, say, 6.5 per cent. Mr Greenspan may have more sympathy for this view than some analysts suspect. On several occasions he has noted that rapid economic growth need not be inflationary provided it reflects rapid productivity growth  - which the US has certainly enjoyed in the past two years. It is thus conceivable that the Fed regards 4 per cent as an upper bound rather than a lower bound when estimating neutrality. But this hardly lets bond investors off the hook. The Fed's talk of raising rates to neutral levels was probably only the first step in a gradual process of conditioning political leaders to the need for a tighter monetary policy. In a strong business cycle upswing, such as that under way in the US today, rates typically have to be lifted, temporarily, well above neutral levels. It thus seems almost inevitable that the Fed will push rates well above 4 per cent even if it remains confident about the inflation outlook. For what it is worth, historical experience suggests rates will rise substantially from present levels. The average increase in short rates during previous episodes of tightening was nearly 6 percentage points, or nearly 4 percentage points excluding the inflationary 1970s. That suggests short rates could rise to 7 per cent or more in the next few years. How rapidly the Fed raises rates will depend on trends in real growth and inflation, which in turn will be influenced by the tightening already announced. The sharp rise in bond yields since early February has already caused fixed-rate mortgage rates to rise from 7 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Since these rates are fixed over the term of the mortgage, home-buyers are scrambling to complete purchases before rates rise another notch. But over the next few months, higher mortgage rates are likely to cool the housing market. Some deceleration in the heady growth of business investment - the leading sector in this productivity-driven recovery - can also be expected in response to the increase in long bond yields. But the impact will be modest and will probably not begin to take effect much before the end of this year. Fed tightening will also raise the cost of money for many consumers and small businesses who borrow at rates linked to banks' prime lending rates. Yesterday, several US banks, including Chemical Bank in New York, announced a quarter point increase in prime rates to 6.25 per cent. However, the margin between prime rates and money market rates remains generous by historical standards. Since banks are highly profitable, any increase in prime rates may lag behind increases in the Fed funds rate. Opponents of further Fed tightening will argue not only that recent interest rate moves are already having a negative impact on growth, but that prices are anyway remarkably subdued. In February the annual rate of consumer price inflation was 2.5 per cent; wholesale price inflation was under 1 per cent. Mr Greenspan's unpopular task is to prevent a resurgence of inflation as the recovery matures - something that has accompanied every previous post-war business cycle. See Editorial Comment</p>

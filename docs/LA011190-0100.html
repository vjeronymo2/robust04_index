			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE TENTATIVELY CHOOSES SUCCESSOR FOR RETIRING CITY MANAGER  </P> <P> The Hawthorne City Council has tentatively selected Public Works Director James  H. Mitsch to replace retiring City Manager R. Kenneth Jue.  </P> <P> Mitsch was chosen to be the next city manager during a closed-door session  Monday, according to city officials. Jue, who has been with the city for 24  years, notified the council two weeks ago that he will retire effective Dec.  31, 1990.  </P> <P> The council is expected to confirm Mitsch's selection at its Jan. 22 meeting.  </P> <P> Jue, 57, became city manager in 1977 after being city engineer for 11 years and  working 13 years as assistant engineer with the city of Inglewood. Jue, who  recommended Mitsch as his replacement, said he wants to retire while he is  young enough to enjoy some of his favorite pastimes -- such as woodcraft and  motorcycle riding.  </P> <P> Jue's annual salary is $105,000, and he will retire with a yearly pension of  about $66,000, according to Doug Gates, Hawthorne's personnel director.  </P> <P> Mitsch came to the city in 1966 as assistant city engineer and has held several  positions at City Hall, including city engineer. He was also acting city  manager for almost a year in 1971.  </P> <P> In interviews this week, city officials said Mitsch is the best qualified to  succeed Jue and that they expect a smooth transition.  </P> <P> City officials characterized Mitsch as a highly qualified replacement who  understands the city's inner workings and who knows how to stay clear of  internal political squabbles.  </P> <P> "He works well with everybody," Jue said. "It should be a smooth transition."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ginny Lambert agreed. "He's the very best person to fill Kenny  Jue's shoes," she said.  </P> <P> However, Mitsch's role in City Hall has not always been free of controversy. A  county grand jury criticized him in 1983, saying a local engineering company he  owned posed a potential conflict of interest. In 1987, he was suspended by the  city when it was learned that he still owned the firm.  </P> <P> Mitsch later sold the company, and city officials said this week that the  conflict-of-interest allegations have been put to rest.  </P> <P> Jue received accolades for his years of service to the city. Jue -- who is  regarded by his City Hall colleagues as a quiet and reserved man -- is also  known as a hard worker who is respected and admired by his staff.  </P> <P> Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth said Jue has done an excellent job as city manager.  She praised him for helping to organize several redevelopment projects that are  about to start in the city.  </P> <P> Ainsworth said she is happy the council decided to hire a replacement from  within City Hall. "I've been here long enough to know that when you promote  from within, it makes it a smoother transition and the employees are happier,"  she said.  </P> <P> Although Jue's tenure with the city has been generally characterized in glowing  terms, he has had some difficult times, too.  </P> <P> Last July, Jue came under fire by some staff members and city activists when he  recommended that the city lay off as many as 32 employees to resolve an  anticipated $2.5-million budget deficit for 1989-90.  </P> <P> The financial crisis stemmed from an unexpected drop in revenue from sales  taxes and paramedic fees, according to city officials. To avert the layoffs,  the City Council voted in August to increase numerous municipal fees.  </P> <P> Jue said this week that city officials will need to find new ways to pay for a  proposal to hire at least five new police officers to help fight the city's  increasing crime rate.  </P> <P> Jue and Mitsch have had a long-term off-duty business relationship. For at  least eight years they have been co-owners of an Inglewood apartment building.  In addition, Mitsch once owned Centinela Valley Engineering, a Hawthorne firm  founded by Jue. Jue divested himself of the firm two years before Mitsch  acquired it.  </P> <P> Mitsch's difficulties began in 1983, when a Los Angeles County grand jury in a  report on Hawthorne government criticized his involvement with Centinela Valley  Engineering as a possible conflict of interest.  </P> <P> At the time, Mitsch denied that Centinela Valley Engineering did any surveys in  Hawthorne, but Jue said there were indications that the firm had conducted  surveys in the city.  </P> <P> Jue said that after the grand jury report was released he told Mitsch to sever  all ties with the company. But in August, 1987, after learning that Mitsch had  continued to work with Centinela Valley Engineering, Jue suspended him for 30  days.  </P> <P> In interviews this week, both Jue and Mitsch said the problems surrounding the  engineering company have been addressed.  </P> <P> "It was put to bed," Jue said of the matter. "He got a penalty and he divested  himself" of the company.  </P> <P> Said Mitsch: "It's been resolved."  </P></p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: EMAP bid decision likely tomorrow EMAP, the media group, should learn tomorrow if its bid for Trans World Communications (TWC) can proceed in a High Court judicial review with wide-reaching ramifications for the radio industry. EMAP, which already owns three radio licences, is planning to skirt around the present regulations forbidding ownership of more than six licences, by putting two of TWC's five licences into joint ownership with Schroders, Emap's merchant bank. Guardian Media Group, which holds a 20 per cent stake in TWC, is seeking to prove that the Radio Authority has exceeded its powers under the 1990 Broadcasting Act in approving EMAP's plan. Industry analysts believe that if the court upholds the Radio Authority's decision, it will prompt a number of similar moves within the sector and accelerate the rationalisation process already under way. It could also herald similar moves within the television sector, whose rules governing ownership of broadcasting licences also originate from the 1990 act. The radio regulations are also being tested by Daily Mail and General Trust which recently set up a joint venture company in order to increase its stake in Chiltern radio. As a newspaper owner, it cannot hold more than a direct 20 per cent stake in a broadcast group. Daily Mail and its joint venture company currently hold 29.99 per cent of Chiltern. The government is currently examining the radio ownership rules under its cross-media ownership review, with the licence-owning arrangement widely seen as ripe for abolition.</p>

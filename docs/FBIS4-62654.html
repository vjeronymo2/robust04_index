			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 17, BNS -- The U.S. Department of  Defense and the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense intend to sign a  memorandum on defense cooperation already this year, according  to the results of talks held in Vilnius Monday [16 May].    Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said he  expects  the memorandum to serve as a basis for other documents that  would define specific forms of defense cooperation, including  acquisition of weapons by Lithuania.    The assistant U.S. secretary of defense for regional  security  affairs, Charles Freeman, said the memorandum, which is under  preparation, provides for wide-ranging cooperation and expressed  hope that Lithuania and the United States will smoothly approach  its signing.    At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Freeman said the  United States intends to sign similar accords with all countries  in East and Central Europe, except a majority of former Soviet  republics. The official said the fact that the Baltics are  offered such cooperation witnesses the continuity of a policy  according to which the United States never formally recognized  the annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviets  in 1940.    U.S. and Lithuanian delegations, headed by Linkevicius and  Freeman, met Monday to discuss possibilities for closer defense  cooperation, as well as to exchange views on the preparation of  Lithuania's "Partnership for Peace" presentation document, the  defense doctrine, the national security concept and the creation  of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. Both delegations met with  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas.    U.S. experts gave a positive evaluation of Lithuania's  defense doctrine, the national security concept and the  partnership presentation document. Linkevicius said the latter  document should be submitted to NATO for consideration May 25.  The U.S. delegation welcomed the Baltic peacekeeping battalion  initiative.    Freeman said the U.S. Congress is expected to decide soon on  assistance to peacekeeping initiatives in East and Central  Europe. He said the U.S. Government wants to see political,  economic and defensive integration of the Baltic states into  transatlantic systems. As regards Lithuania national defense  system, Freeman said the country made a step forward and  continues to move in the right direction.</p>

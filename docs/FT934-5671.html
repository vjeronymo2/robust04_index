			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Furrowed brows look to lean year: Deborah Hargreaves and Alison Maitland on the shift in UK agriculture away from family holdings The ranks of shiny new tractors unveiled at the Royal Smithfield agricultural show in London today would cause more than a glint of envy in Mr Peter Swift's eye. Mr Swift, a Lancashire vegetable and cereal farmer, has watched neighbouring producers on large arable farms enjoying a bonanza year; many of them have seen their incomes rise faster than the average for all farmers last year. But Mr Swift faced the prospect of losing his 92-acre holding this summer when mounting debts meant he was unable to hire help for the swede harvest. In the end, two friends helped him at weekends. 'I'm not ashamed to say I've been living on charity for six months,' he says. Far from investing in new machinery, he does not own a tractor and is rushing to harvest his crops to curb hire costs. He has only stayed in business because of a sympathetic bank manager, he says. In contrast, Mr Adrian Peck, who farms 1,000 acres in Cambridgeshire - the grain belt of Britain where farms are large and the farmers the richest in the UK - has just bought a new tractor. He has been able to take advantage of a boost to his income caused by the 20 per cent devaluation last year of the 'green pound' which is used to translate prices set by the European Union into sterling. In total, British farmers are an estimated Pounds 135m better off this year thanks to the devaluation. Mr Swift receives little support from Brussels because most of his crops are not covered by the European Common Agricultural Policy. He is left victim to the vagaries of the free market. Such mixed fortunes highlight the shift that is taking place in agriculture in the UK, away from traditional, small, family holdings. Competition is intensifying as world prices for many commodities fall - and European Union-supported prices in particular. But while the larger farmers may be enjoying a breathing space, the pressures on farmers are set to increase. Additional reforms of CAP are likely to cut subsidies even further and a possible new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would step up competition. Together European agriculture ministers have agreed that EU farmers should be exposed increasingly to the free market and the impact of the Brussels farm support price regime gradually diminished. So far, however, the effects have been softened in the UK by the devaluation of the green pound, which has increased cereal prices and boosted payments under the controversial set-aside scheme which pays grain farmers to grow less. Mr Peck hopes to receive a cheque soon from the government for close to Pounds 13,500 for leaving 150 acres of his land lying fallow this year. Some of the farmers receiving compensation payment are rich landowners - a fact that particularly galls Mr Swift. Unlike almost any other form of state income support, agricultural aid is not means tested. UK farmers have been helped further by low interest rates and the 40 per cent tax allowance on farm equipment that the government announced in the March Budget and which lasted until the end of last month. Sales of tractors  -regarded as an important indicator of farmers' fortunes - were up 30 per cent in the 10 months to the end of October after record-low sales last year. But they are still only about half the level of 10 years ago. The National Farmers' Union expects the continuing impact of devaluation will result in growth in average farm incomes this year exceeding last year's 23.6 per cent increase, thanks to the continued impact of sterling's devaluation in the first half. But optimism is patchy. Not all sectors are feeling the effects of devaluation. And particularly pessimistic are smaller farmers who have not been protected so much by the CAP, even though the scheme was originally supposed to help them. Mr Swift sees little hope for farmers like him: 'There is no future for a family farm like ours - we're only just surviving. I'm not really making a living, I'm just paying bills.' He, and other small farmers, are increasingly looking to find part-time employment. Mr John Earl, a pig farmer from Kent, says he is selling his animals at 90p a kilo when it costs him Pounds 1 a kilo to rear them. Pork prices are not supported under the CAP. 'We are tightening our belts, but we can't go on in that situation for long,' he says. Smaller farmers are facing pressure to diversify into leisure or tourist facilities. 'It is part of a general pattern; the large farms are getting bigger and the family farms are being squeezed to look for alternative income,' says Mr David Lloyd-Jones who runs holiday cottages on his mixed livestock farm in Wales. Among the farm industry as a whole there is a fear that the larger operators will not long escape such gloom and that the good times currently being enjoyed will soon turn into lean years. Last year's CAP reforms were designed to be neutral for the European farmer on an average income; compensation payments would be made for three years to counteract the planned falls in prices. But Mr Sean Rickard, the NFU's chief economist, says Britain's arable farms are larger than the European average and tend to grow more grain per acre. Compensation payments will not offset the price falls. Separately, in the next few years, once the effects of devaluation have worn off, payments for set-aside are likely to fall short of revenues foregone. Moreover, after the three years covered by the current CAP reforms, many farmers believe support prices will be reduced again. A Gatt agreement would also have the effect of cutting EU support prices even further, bringing many close to world levels. Mr Peck fears that he and his large-farmer counterparts will have to reckon with competition from big farmers from, for example, Australia and the US. He points to wheat farms in Australia which are on average twice as big as his and more highly mechanised: 'how could we in Britain compete with that - we'd have to dig up the countryside,' he argues. Mr Malcolm McAllister, managing director of Booker Farming, which farms directly or advises on the management of 45,000 acres in England and Scotland, says a Gatt agreement would squeeze less efficient producers and hasten the concentration of farming. 'Farming will move to areas of natural advantage - our best farms in East Anglia are world-competitive cereal producers. But if you're a struggling Cumbrian wheat grower you will give up. That shift is already happening but the CAP reform and a Gatt deal will hasten it,' he says. Faced with these mounting pressures, many farmers believe that the short-term gains they are enjoying offer a limited chance to pay off some debt and invest in equipment or land. 'This is an opportunity for farmers to re-group and restructure, making them better able to withstand the effects of the Gatt when it comes,' said Mr David Naish, president of the NFU. There are signs that some producers are already heeding his advice. Farm debt levels in England and Wales peaked at Pounds 6.6bn in August 1991 according to the Midland Bank, dropping to Pounds 5.8bn by October this year. Yet a survey published today by Adas, the government's farm advisory service, suggests that investment by farmers, though rising this year, is in long-term decline; sales of farm machinery are 34 per cent lower than in 1988. Farmers are notorious for not underplaying their misfortunes. But at least for the larger farmers, the bonanza they are currently enjoying means there is little excuse for not taking action to secure their future against the uncertainties of increased competition in years ahead. That, though, will be little consolation for the small players such as Mr Swift.</p>

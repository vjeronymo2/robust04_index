			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alusuisse to sell US aluminium business Alusuisse, the Swiss aluminium, packaging and chemicals group, is to sell its lossmaking US aluminium business, Consolidated Aluminium Corporation (Conalco). The buyer is Ormet Corporation, the fourth-largest producer of primary aluminium in the US. The sale, for an undisclosed price, marks a further step in Alusuisse's strategy to reduce dependence on aluminium, which is suffering from overcapacity and depressed prices. The weighting of the group's aluminium division has shrunk from over two thirds of sales in 1988 to an estimated 43 per cent this year. Analysts are predicting a strong revival in company profits after disappointing results in 1993, when net income slid 31 per cent to SFr83m (Dollars 62.6m) on sales of SFr6.2bn. Alusuisse said yesterday it planned to focus its North American activities on expanding its profitable packaging and chemicals businesses. Conalco employs some 1,400 and has production plants in four US states.</p>

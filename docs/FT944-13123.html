			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (7): Neighbourly undertakings - Tom Burns examines the change in the relationship with Spain The economic relationship between Portugal and Spain is undergoing a significant change. Cross-border trade and investment between the two countries was once extremely limited, but it is now buoyant and, despite Portugal's traditional nervousness about its big Spanish neighbour, it is set to increase further. 'Before 1986 (the year when Portugal and Spain joined the then European Community) it was as if Lisbon and Madrid were looking in opposite directions,' says Miguel Athayde Marques, executive chairman of ICEP, the government's trade and investment board. 'One of the most important consequences of 1986 was the rapid integration of the two economies.' Far from being back to back, the economies of Portugal and Spain are now interacting with each other and are mutually benefiting as a result. Inevitably Spain, with a GDP that is six times that of Portugal and a population that is four times bigger, is setting the pace, but Portugal, where per capita income is at best 75 per cent of that in Spain, is gallantly holding its own. Nobody is claiming that the Iberian peninsula forms a trading bloc similar to that of Scandinavia, or that Portugal and Spain can be grouped together as are the Benelux countries. There has been too much historical antagonism for that, too many inferiority complexes on the part of the Portuguese and an overdose of superior machismo on the part of Spain. A merger between TAP and Iberia, the two national airlines, for example, is ruled as 'quite out of the question', by a Lisbon official. 'Even if that made economic sense, which it doesn't, it would be unthinkable because it is a matter of national pride.' Similarly, Portugal is anxious, as far as it is possible, to keep Spain at arm's length in Portuguese-speaking nations such as Angola, Brazil and Mozambique which Lisbon considers its natural stamping ground. Thus Telefonica, the acquisitive Spanish telephone operator which is rapidly building up a Latin American empire, could at best be a financial partner in a Portuguese-run development of telecommunications in Angola. Echoing a similar sentiment to the one expressed by the Spanish embassy in Lisbon, a Portuguese diplomat said that 'mentalities are the hardest to change'. Spaniards are viewed suspiciously by the Portuguese as over big, over aggressive and, increasingly, as over here. For all the self-evident reservations, the ice has nevertheless been broken by the onset of European Union cash transfers, the volume of which can be multiplied by the joint presentation of cross-border infrastructure projects. The common EU umbrella has put the foundations for shared economic strategies in place and it is gradually overcoming Portuguese misgivings. It is precisely because of the shared EU membership that bilateral trade has increased tenfold in the past decade. The value of Portuguese exports to Spain which stood at Dollars 187.5m in 1983 was Dollars 1.9bn last year and that of Spanish exports to Portugal has risen over the period from Dollars 429.6m to n. Spain is now Portugal's principal foreign supplier and some 25 per cent of all imports from the EU are Spanish. Spain has, in turn, become Portugal's third market after Germany and France and it absorbs 19 per cent of exports to the EU. The remarkable feature of the trading relations between the neighbours is the very large spread of similar items that are interchanged, and it is this trade pattern which points to the integration of two economies that share a common industrial profile based on small and medium companies. The main Portuguese export to Spain is motor vehicles but this item represents just 5 per cent of the total value of what Portugal supplies to Spain. Likewise, motor vehicles are the leading Spanish export to Portugal, representing 12 per cent of the overall value of exports, and the next two export items represent 5 per cent and 3 per cent of the total value of Spanish merchandise acquired by Portugal. In the way that investment usually follows trade, the companies of both countries are setting up branches across the border. 'The first place a Spanish small company that wants to consolidate its export market thinks about is Portugal,' says Luis Bonhomme of the Spanish Embassy in Lisbon. 'Portugal is what the Spanish entrepreneur knows best for it is the natural extension of his own domestic market and exactly the same is true about Spain for the Portuguese businessman.' Again the figures show a remarkably rapid growth. Spanish investments in Portugal Dollars 2m, scarcely totalled Dollars 21m in 1985, the year before both countries became members of the EU, and they totalled Dollars 812m last year, a year when Spain displaced the UK as the biggest direct investor in Portugal and when 25 per cent of all Spain's foreign investment was directed towards Portugal. The story is a similar one on Lisbon's side of the border. Direct Portuguese investment in Spain between 1991-1993 totalled Dollars 609m and it has gone from representing 50 per cent of the total value Portuguese foreign investment in 1991 to 78 per cent last year. Close to 60 per cent of the value of the foreign business projects approved by ICEP, in a programme aiding small and medium Portuguese companies to open up abroad, concern direct investments in Spain. Reflecting the wide spread of the trade pattern between the two economies, and again underlining the economic integration between Portugal and Spain, the cross-border investment flow is characterised by many companies making comparatively minor outlays. There are some 2,500 Spanish companies in Portugal but only 10 appear in the list of the top 500 companies in Portugal and the biggest, the Cepsa energy group, is ranked 73rd. There have been daring acquisitions from both sides of the frontier. Among recent deals, Portugal's Cimpor cement company has bought a producer in north-west Spain, Tafisa, Spain's leading fibre wood company, has been purchased by Sonae, Portugal's biggest conglomerate, and the Colep packaging business has acquired a sizeable unit in Spain, Johnson and Wax Espana. The most ambitious cross-border Spanish moves have concerned the financial sector and, in particular, the controversial Banesto assault on Banco Totta e Acores, the profitable fourth-ranked domestic institution. The four main Spanish banking groups are now all present in Portugal and together they are estimated to control just over 17 per cent of Portuguese banking assets, nearly 15 per cent of bank deposits and close to 16 per cent of banking loans.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              TRADE BY MAIN DESTINATION AND ORIGIN (% OF TOTAL)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         1988     1989    1990    1991    1992    1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports fob   EU                    71.6     71.5    74.0    75.4    74.9    75.6   of which:   Germany*              14.7     15.7    16.7    19.1    19.2    19.7   Spain                 11.2     12.5    13.6    15.1    14.7    14.5   France                15.2     15.1    15.5    14.4    14.2    15.3   UK                    14.3     12.3    12.1    10.0    11.2    11.4   Netherlands            5.9      5.7     5.7     5.7     5.4     5.2   Italy                  4.2      4.2     4.0     4.0     3.9     3.0 Efta                    10.5     10.3    10.2     9.7     8.8     7.8 US                       5.9      6.0     4.8     3.8     3.5     4.3 Japan                    0.8      1.1     1.0     0.9     0.8     0.8 Opec                     1.1      0.7     0.6     0.6     0.6     1.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total incl others      100.0    100.0   100.0   100.0   100.0   100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Imports cif  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EU                      67.1     68.0    69.2    72.0    73.7    72.1   of which:   Spain                 13.1     14.5    14.5    15.9    16.6    17.8   Germany*              14.6     14.5    14.4    14.8    15.0    15.0   France                11.5     11.7    11.5    11.9    12.8    13.0   Italy                  9.2      9.1    10.0    10.3    10.2     8.7   UK                     8.3      7.5     7.6     7.5     7.2     7.5   Netherlands            4.8      5.5     5.8     6.1     6.9     4.9 Efta                     7.3      6.3     6.2     6.0     6.0     6.1 US                       4.3      4.4     3.9     3.4     3.0     3.1 Japan                    3.6      3.1     2.6     2.9     3.1     3.2 Opec                     5.0      6.1     6.8     4.8     3.9     5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total incl others      100.0    100.0   100.0   100.0   100.0   100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * West Germany only until July 1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: National Institute of Statistics, Indicadores do Comercio Externo  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

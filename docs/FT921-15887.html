			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (15): Vested interests stall growth - Agriculture, Government must grasp the nettle of reform WITH A rapidly expanding population, desperate shortage of arable land and an unsustainable rural-urban drift the importance of Kenya's agricultural sector to the economy and to increasing standards of living has never been more important. Yet in spite of the generous flow of foreign aid to Kenyan agriculture the government still appears to have failed to have grasped the three fundamental policy reforms necessary to increase agricultural growth by more than 3.5 per cent per year. These are; price and trade liberalisation, rolling back excessive government interference in marketing and creating a payments system which will provide greater incentives to smallholder farmers to increase yields by applying fertiliser. The signs of the government's failure in agriculture are apparent. In 1992, for example, Kenya will have to import at least 5m bags of its annual maize requirement of about 30m-31m bags, the main food staple. Although maize production has been hit by bad weather in 1989 and 1990, inadequate government reforms have meant that for the first time in several years maize will join wheat and sugar as deficit crops. A poor policy environment, combined with a slump in world prices, has also severely affected smallholder production of coffee. The government continues to articulate the ambition of food self-sufficiency for a land-hungry population of 27m people growing at about 3.6 per cent a year. Wheat will always be difficult, with the government having to import about half of the annual demand of about 440,000 tonnes but there is no real reason why Kenya should not be able to produce enough maize and sugar to meet domestic demand. The recent changes needed in agriculture were first identified by the government in the mid-1980s and were followed up by an Agriculture Sector Adjustment Operation, funded by the World Bank. The problems of maize production and marketing and reducing the suffocating role of the state-run National Cereals and Produce Board were high on the reform agenda. Next year's import needs of maize are a clear sign that the reforms identified have only been addressed half-heartedly. It has once again revealed that a powerful alliance of vested interests, both private sector merchants and public sector bureaucrats, continue to frustrate the goals outlined by government. Agriculture continues to play a pivotal role in the country accounting for 30 per cent of gross domestic product, 70 per cent of employment, and 60 per cent of the foreign exchange earnt from merchandise exports. Smallholder farmers (less than 10 acres) are the dominant part of production, combining subsistence food crop and livestock production with varying amounts of cash crops. Throughout the 1980s the average rate of agricultural growth was 3.5 per cent a year - not enough to keep pace with population which grew about 4 per cent a year in that decade. With only 18 per cent of Kenya's land judged to be of high or medium potential, prospects for further growth depend on increasing crop yield. The World Bank estimates that yields of crops and livestock could be doubled with progressive farming techniques. With a better policy environment exports of coffee, tea, horticulture, milk and beans could be increased. The constraints to growth in agriculture are; poor price incentives, delayed payments by government marketing boards, low use of yield increasing inputs such as fertiliser, the suffocating role played by government in marketing and inadequate availability of financing to smallholder farmers. Progress was made between 1986-88 under the first agriculture adjustment operation in increasing producer prices and beginning the deregulation of maize and beef marketing. But the government showed poor commitment to a fundamental overhaul of NCPB and other parastatals, the removal of supply constraints on fertiliser availability and a critical examination of public sector investments in agriculture. Grain marketing and the role of NCPB became the main thorns in the side of international donors. These last policy objectives have become the focus of the ongoing Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation signed with the World Bank in late 1990 and funded by a bank loan of Dollars 75m with additional financing from bilateral donors and the African Development Bank. This two-year operation has two main aims. First, to improve maize producer incentives through prompt payments to farmers, increase efficiency of maize marketing by abolishing controls on the movement of maize and to reduce the role of the NCPB and therefore its budgetary burden. The second is to increase the timely availability of fertiliser at lower costs. According to the bank, to achieve an agricultural growth rate of over 4 per cent per year, fertiliser consumption must increase at an estimated rate of 11 per cent per year. In addition, the bank and other donors are involved in reforms of the coffee payments system to farmers and restructuring of the cotton and sugar industries. In the maize sub-sector the government has made some reforms - it wrote off NCPB's Ksh5bn debt, closed down over 400 NCPB buying centres, slashed the staffing levels of the board and began the phased liberalisation of trade and movement of maize across district boundaries. But in the face of concerted pressure from vested interests the government recently retracted some of the progress on movement of maize, cancelled the provision to allow free movement of 90 bags (eight tonnes) and revoked licences given to private traders. This backtracking has put in jeopardy the disbursement of the second tranche of the loan. 'The NCPB is fighting for its life,' said one western donor. 'It does not want to go down and it is fighting to the bitter end.' The influence of vested interests in the private sector is much more apparent in wheat and sugar. In 1990, private traders were allowed to import 300,000 tonnes of wheat - above the import needs of about 220,000 tonnes. Much of the imports came from Saudi Arabia where wheat is heavily subsidised. Large profits were made by private traders exploiting the difference between the world market price of about Dollars 130 a tonne and the controlled Kenyan price of about Dollars 230 a tonne. The British government complained about the opportunities for corruption and absurd profits from private imports and wheat farmers said they were being driven out. In sugar, private traders have made large profits. Kenya should be self-sufficient in sugar but the price incentives for growers and processors are inadequate to guarantee supply. Of the five sugar processing factories in which the government has a majority share holding only one makes a profit on more than 200,000 tonnes of output. Much sugar production is smuggled across the border into Uganda with the involvement of senior government officials. Like many other sectors of the economy agriculture continues to suffer from a lack of real commitment to the necessary policy reforms and poor government implementation capacity. The worrying signs of food insecurity should encourage the government to grasp the nettle of reform and combat the powerful vested interests who are doing so much to hold back agricultural growth.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Committee attacks 'lack of long-term policy on EC' THE Commons foreign affairs committee yesterday implicitly criticised the government for its lack of a long-term policy on the European Community and recommended early steps to clarify its ideas on the subject, Robert Mauthner writes. In its second report on Europe after Maastricht, the committee also called for improved contacts between the European parliament and national parliaments, though stressing that the latter should not become subordinate to the Strasbourg parliament. 'The United Kingdom needs to decide what sort of European Community it wants and to push for it,' the report said. 'Planning for this should begin immediately after the Maastricht treaty is ratified, to avoid being put in a position of simply reacting to ideas from other member states.' The committee also recommended that the House of Commons be given greater opportunities to express its views to the executive on proposals for Community action. The Commons would need to re-examine its role in respect of EC legislation, particularly in the light of the enhanced legislative powers given to the European parliament under the terms of the Maastricht treaty. Given the conflicting views about how the principle of subsidiarity would be applied, and as a way of associating the Commons more closely with the European Community's legislation, the committee recommended that the government report regularly to the House. This could take the form of six-monthly reports on 'developments in the European Community', setting out the way the principle of subsidiarity was being applied. The principle states that the Community should take decisions only on matters which cannot be dealt with more effectively by national governments.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> QUEEN SHOWING AGE ON 5 NOTE  </P> <P> Queen Elizabeth is finally showing her age on a new bank note which portrays  Britain's 64-year-old monarch with a double chin, wrinkles and slight bags  under her eyes.  </P> <P> "It makes me look so old," the tabloid Sun newspaper today quoted the Queen as  telling artist Roger Withington, who designed the new note.  </P> <P> "But then I suppose I am old."  </P> <P> The Bank of England insisted the queen had aged gracefully on the turquoise  note, which updates the one on the old blue five-pound ($8) note and other  denominations by 25 years.  </P> <P> The monarch's profile on coins and stamps also dates from the 1950s.  </P> <P> The new note appears Thursday. It is smaller and, the Bank of England said,  harder to forge than its predecessor.  </P></p>

On September 17, 1993, the Commission issued its Second Order on Compliance Filing and First Order on Rehearing (September 17 Order) finding that the Settlement with modifications as directed therein implemented the fundamental concepts underlying Order No. 636. The September 17 Order accepted the Settlement and approved the accompanying tariff sheets, with certain exceptions and modifications, directed FGT to refile final tariff sheets, and accepted such tariff sheets to be effective on October 1, 1993. Various parties requested rehearing of certain aspects of the September 17 Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 23, 1993, FGT filed its Third Revised Volume No. 1 which reflected the revisions required by the Commission's September 17 Order.

On January 18, 1994, FGT filed tariff sheets reflecting the changes in compliance with the December 16 Order.

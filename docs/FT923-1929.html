			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Frontier areas back treaty FRONTIER areas of France voted generally in favour of Maastricht and closer relations with their EC neighbours, while farmers, particularly the poorer ones in the south and south-west, took out their frustration with EC policy by voting solidly No. Giving some interim results at about 9.30pm local time, Mr Paul Quiles, the interior minister, admitted that 'rural areas, clearly in the south-west and less clearly in other regions, had voted against the treaty'. By contrast, frontier areas, presumably less xenophobic than inland regions, showed solid support for the European treaty. Predictably, one of the highest levels of pro-Maastricht support came from Strasbourg, home of the European parliament, with a 72 per cent Yes vote. In general, Alsace and Lorraine along the German border, Rhone-Alpes adjacent to Switzerland, and Pyrenees-Atlantiques bordering Spain showed pro-Maastricht majorities, Mr Quiles said. The big surprise was Brittany, remote from any other country except Britain across the Channel. Far from being a hotbed of anti-European sentiment, as hoped by Mr Philippe De Villiers, the leading Maastricht opponent from neighbouring La Vendee, a clear majority of Bretons backed Maastricht. The Breton cities of Rennes and Quimper recorded majorities of 65-70 per cent for Maastricht. However, the region of Nord-Pas de Calais, for all its links with Kent and neighbouring Belgium (or because of such links), voted against the treaty. Earlier opinion polls had showed serious gains by the No campaign in the Paris region. In the event, the region split, with the city of Paris producing a 61 per cent vote in favour of the treaty, but its suburbs, where the National Front and the Communists are strong, showed a majority dislike of Maastricht. But the further south, the higher the level of general opposition to Maastricht, culminating in the 58 per cent No majority vote in Corsica. Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, whose job it was as European affairs minister to lead the pro-Maastricht campaign, found it impossible to convince her Vaucluse region of the European treaty's merits. The unnerving closeness of the referendum verdict was heightened by the fact that, despite the confident opinion poll predictions of a Maastricht victory, the first results showed a majority for the No vote. This was because the first results came in from small towns and rural areas, where the polling booths closed two hours earlier, at 6pm French time, rather than in the big cities, where voting continued until 8pm.</p>

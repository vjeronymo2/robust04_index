			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Better use of buildings urged MUCH of the increase in student numbers planned for the 1990s could be accommodated in existing buildings if better use were made of them, according to a report by the university and polytechnic funding councils. The report says more than half the 300,000 increase in students could be accommodated if higher institutions improved space management and remodelled buildings.</p>

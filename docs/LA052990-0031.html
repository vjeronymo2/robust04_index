			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 MEN MISSING IN 2 INCIDENTS OFF VENTURA COAST  </P> <P> The Coast Guard was searching Monday for two men reported missing in separate  incidents off the Ventura County coast.  </P> <P> The names of both men were withheld pending notification of relatives.  </P> <P> A 36-year-old Rincon man was windsurfing south of Punta Gorda from one to three  miles offshore about noon when he apparently fell from his board. A witness  called the Coast Guard after the man, an experienced windsurfer, did not get  up, Petty Officer Michael Dooley said.  </P> <P> It was uncertain if weather was a factor.  </P> <P> The search was expected to continue until early this morning.  </P> <P> In another incident about 30 minutes later, a 49-year-old man fell into the  ocean while sailing about two miles off Mandalay State Beach, Dooley said.  </P> <P> "The man attempted to recover a dinghy and fell overboard," Dooley said. His  sailboat was towed in by the Ventura Harbor Patrol because a woman on the boat  did not know how to sail, Deputy Harbor Master Leigh Ross said.  </P> <P> The search for the man was suspended late Monday and was scheduled to resume  this morning.  </P></p>

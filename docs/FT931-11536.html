			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: Unix's survival at stake - Technically Speaking A FEW days before Christmas last year, Novell, a US computer networking company whose annual sales are now close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) signed a letter of intent to acquire Unix Systems Laboratories, a company in which AT&amp;T has a majority stake and which is responsible for the licensing and development of the Unix computer operating system. The deal, worth Dollars 350m, has to be ratified by 11 other computer companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL, Motorola and Sun Microsystems. It is nevertheless remarkable, given the history of Unix, that there has been a dearth of comment on a development which may fundamentally reshape the open systems movement. It may simply have been the imminence of the New Year; others see more sinister forces at work. To recap briefly: open systems imply a common set of rules for interworking so that no supplier has a technical advantage over any other in developing standard products. Unix is one of a number of operating systems vying to be adopted as the open systems standard. The development of such an operating system would have to be free from the control of any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers. Unix was created by AT&amp;T at Bell Labs but has since been widely licensed, leading to a damaging multiplicity of 'standard' versions. These include Sunsoft's Solaris and IBM's AIX. The competition includes IBM's personal computer operating systems OS/2, the Open Systems Foundation's OSF1 and Microsoft's Windows NT, a new operating system which has yet to be launched commercially. AT&amp;T established USL, and encouraged other companies to Take stakes in it, to promote the idea of Unix development independent of itself or any other company. In doing so, it showed it had learned the lessons of the 1980s when plans to establish a standard Unix between AT&amp;T and the aggressive workstation company, Sun Microsystems, provoked an industry war. Novell, however, is one of the industry's newly emerging dominant forces with some 60 per cent of the global market for networking software. The 1990s are set to be the decade of computer networking so Novell, along with Intel and Microsoft, can claim to be an architect of the new world order in computing. So by selling off USL to Novell, has AT&amp;T thrown away the idea of an independent Unix? And if it has, does it matter? The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be? One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and have thrown in the towel. Windows NT - standing for 'New Technology' - is Microsoft's first multiuser, multitasking operating system suitable for powerful network servers. It is Microsoft's attempt to lay siege to the market for enterprise-wide computing, taking advantage of the shift away from mainframes and mainframe operating systems. Microsoft has a deserved reputation for tenacity in bringing reliable products to market even if there are several false starts on the way. But coming as it does from a background in stand-alone personal computers, it has little experience of enterprise data processing. It knows this very well and is taking steps to remedy its deficiencies. But multiuser computing is complex and critics argue that Windows NT will have to go through several versions before it approaches the reliability and robustness of Unix. Many believe that Unix represents the best opportunity of developing a genuinely open operating system for the 1990s and beyond. With the loss of an independent USL, however, there may be again a proliferation of Unix variants - to nobody's advantage.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter European Pounds 5.6m fund raising The board of Jupiter European Investment Trust proposes an open offer and placing to raise up to Pounds 5.6m net, and to reorganise the company into a split capital investment trust through a scrip issue of zero dividend shares. The reorganisation should bring the market value of the ordinary shares more closely into line with the underlying net asset value - the discount was 22 per cent on July 17. The trust's life will end on December 31 2000. Holders of ordinary shares and warrants can apply for up to 7.2m shares and 1.44m warrants at 78 1/2 p, on a 1-for-1 basis. Some 6m shares and 1.2m warrants have been placed, subject to clawback. The scrip issue of zero dividend shares will then follow, again on a 1-for-1 basis. It is proposed to change the accounting date to August 31 and to pay semi-annual dividends in future. The initial annualised dividend is forecast at not less than 1.67p.</p>

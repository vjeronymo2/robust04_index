			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 2 November, the Atomic Energy Commission of Japan  (JAEC; chaired by Science and Technology Agency (STA) Director  General Satsuki Eda) decided to change the existing policy of  disposing of low level radioactive waste from nuclear power  plants basically by burial underground or ocean dumping so that  the latter, ocean dumping, will not be used in the future. This  measure was taken out of consideration for the fact that ocean  dumping of radioactive waste by Russia has rapidly strengthened  sentiment for a total ban on ocean dumping.    The government has expressed the plan to vote in favor of a  total ban on ocean dumping at a conference of London Treaty  signatories, which will convene in London on 8 November, and the  JAEC's decision confirms this. STA says that ``this will not  affect Japan's nuclear energy policy immediately'' because Japan  is not dumping in the ocean at this time.    The JAEC maintains that ocean dumping of low level  radioactive nuclear waste has no special effect on public health  according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  standards. However, judging from the Japanese and international  reaction to ocean dumping by Russia, it believes that ``from a  political and social viewpoint, it would be extremely difficult  to carry out ocean dumping.'' It says that hereafter,  ``underground burial will be used,'' and it is seeking to expand  those facilities.</p>

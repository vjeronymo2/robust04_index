			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALUD, MEDINA ON HIGH AFTER LOW EVENING;  </P> <P> BOXING: BOTH FIGHTERS WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN OPPONENTS ARE DISQUALIFIED FOR  ILLEGAL BLOWS.  </P> <P> What are the chances of two championship bouts being decided by low blows the  same night?  </P> <P> It happened on a wild and crazy Monday at the Forum.  </P> <P> Challenger Jesus Salud was awarded the World Boxing Assn. junior-featherweight  title when referee Larry Rozadilla disqualified Juan Jose Estrada in the ninth  round.  </P> <P> Less than an hour earlier, the 6,166 fans saw Manuel Medina win the heretofore  vacant WBA Intercontinental junior-lightweight title over Edgar Castro in the  seventh round.  </P> <P> The main event was called after a left to the groin felled Salud.  </P> <P> Estrada had points deducted in both the sixth and seventh rounds for low blows  and landed a few more in the eighth that went undetected.  </P> <P> "Salud was hurt badly," said Rozadilla. "He had said he wouldn't go on after a  couple of the other low punches. I told him he would lose if he didn't. But  this time I knew he couldn't continue."  </P> <P> Actually, the fight was decided near the bell ending the second round when  Estrada, the 122-pound champion from Tijuana, was rocked by a left hook.  </P> <P> Estrada wobbled to his corner and never recovered fully. He was well behind on  all scorecards after being knocked down by a left-right combination in the  sixth.  </P> <P> Estrada won only at the pay window, collecting $50,000 to $15,000 for Salud,  who began his career in Honolulu and now lives in San Diego.  </P> <P> Referee Burton Gilliam disqualified Castro when he tagged Medina with his  fourth illegal punch.  </P> <P> Medina, 18, who didn't begin his pro career in Tijuana until he was 13, had  been floored by hooks below the belt in the second and third rounds.  </P> <P> He also was felled by a left in the third, but he was quicker and more active  than Castro and was ahead on two cards and even on the other.  </P> <P> In other bouts, super-middleweight Vincent Durham won a five-round decision  over Fred Thomas and lightweight Jaime Castillo won a four-round decision over  Eddie Alvarado.  </P></p>

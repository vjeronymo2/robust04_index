			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F> 1627): "As Problems on Mainland Market Gradually Become  Conspicuous, Central Authorities Adopt Measures to Prevent  Crisis"]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--According to an  authoritative source here, the central leadership maintained:  Since July last year, thanks to the adoption of stringent  measures to energetically rectify the financial order, the  problem of funds has been gradually alleviated. However, the  problem of market has begun to raise its head remarkably. It is  expected that for a period of time to come, the problem of  market will become more conspicuous than that of funds. The  central authorities will make plans to solve the problem to  avoid a market crisis which may possibly occur.    The authoritative source said: As the central authorities  saw it, the robustness of the domestic market in the previous  period of time was largely a result of man-made price hikes.  For example, the robustness in the car market was such a case.  On the one hand, vehicles were purchased with public money, and  on the other hand, foreign-invested enterprises upgraded their  vehicles one after another by making use of preferential  policies. Hence, there was a service-life cycle of 5 to 10  years. Moreover, the mainland pursues a control policy over car  purchases and as a result, car prices have stood at a high  level, thus landing China's car industry in a predicament.  Again, take the consumption market for example. From 1992 to  1993, there was extreme unfairness in distribution on the  mainland. Consequently, commodity demand was generated by  upstarts, and the entire society's expenses characterized by  high wages and bonuses driven by such demand were not  sustainable. Moreover, domestically there was also unfairness  in distribution between different trades, enterprises,  departments, and even wage earners. A considerable number of  poor counties in our country are unable to pay out wages. The  price scissors of agricultural and sideline products are  widening. Therefore, the robust consumption market will surely  cool off.    Based on an analysis of the market prospects, the central  leadership suggested:    1. It is necessary from now on to closely watch and study  the market problem and adopt prompt measures to solve it. The  injection of funds must be made after taking on board changes in  the market. Otherwise, if we still increase input when the  market has already gone down, it will end up in stockpiling of  products and it will difficult to avoid sharp fluctuations in  the economy.    2. Enterprises must make great efforts to improve  themselves, change the way they operate, raise product quality,  increase product varieties, and pay close attention to  scientific and technological development and technological  transformation. Construction banks and industrial and  commercial banks must ensure enterprise technological funds.    3. Great stress should be placed on readjusting the price  policy and developing markets. Prices of domestic products such  as television sets, washing machines, and refrigerators can be  cut a little to achieve larger sales at a smaller profit. Taxes  on some products can be reduced. The price problem should be  resolved in accordance with the laws governing the market rather  than by rushing headlong into mass action.    4. Examination and approval procedures for controls over the  purchase of domestic limousines should be scraped. We must  consider cutting the selling prices of domestic vehicles.    5. Enterprise should make vigorous efforts to export more  goods and develop both domestic and international markets. To  promote export, apart from prohibiting enterprises to engage in  real estate and stock trading at a profit, we must ensure the  need of funds for the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange.    6. The growth rates of township and town enterprises should  be scaled down. Now township and town enterprises are keeping  too many products in stock. We should no longer support them in  turning out unsalable products blindly. Township and town  enterprises must pay attention to industrial structural  readjustments and product variety and quality. When it has  surpluses in procurement funds, an agricultural bank must  support township and town enterprises in carrying out  technological transformation and scientific and technological  development to readjust the industrial structure.    7. Labor prices call for attention. To make labor more  appealing to foreign investors, it is necessary to bring the  strong point of domestic labor being relatively cheap into play.  Now a relatively too rapid labor wage increase has become a  trend in some coastal regions. Too high wages will hamper our  competitiveness in developing an export-oriented economy.</p>

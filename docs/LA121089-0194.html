			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION ACTIVISTS IN STAND-OFF;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATIONS: PROTESTS AT CLINICS IN LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTIES  CULMINATE IN FULLERTON.  </P> <P> Hundreds of anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates converged on a Fullerton  women's clinic Saturday, culminating a morning of rallies and protests at  various clinics in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> Police estimated the crowd at 300 and said it was equally divided between  members of Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group, and by pro-choice forces.  </P> <P> The stand-off was peaceful. Pro-choice advocates rallied in front of the  Women's Center on Orangethorpe Avenue, singing "Joy to the world, choice has  come" and other modified Christmas carols. Nearby, anti-abortion protesters sat  and sometimes kneeled in entrance ways, as they prayed and sang hymns. There  were no arrests.  </P> <P> Earlier, anti-abortion activists had skipped from clinic to clinic, apparently  attempting to elude pro-choice advocates, who were tracking them throughout the  morning. Both sides claimed victory at rallies that began shortly after noon.  </P> <P> "Our numbers are growing and growing and growing," said Eleanor Smeal,  president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority, a national abortion rights group  based in Los Angeles. A crowd that sported blue pro-choice buttons, signs and  T-shirts cheered.  </P> <P> "We are determined to make this a pro-choice Assembly and a pro-choice  governor's mansion," said Smeal, past president of the National Organization  for Women. Moments later, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a  Democratic candidate for governor, came to the makeshift podium.  </P> <P> "We will stand shoulder to shoulder until we have our right to protect our  reproductive freedom," Feinstein said. Women, she said, found "sanctuary" with  the Roe vs. Wade decision by the Supreme Court that established the legality of  abortions in 1973.  </P> <P> But in the court's Webster decision, which earlier this year gave states  broader powers on the abortion issue, "this basing was thrown to a political  arena and the vagrancies of state legislatures, which are all controlled by  men," Feinstein said.  </P> <P> About 20 feet away and a short time later, Russ Neal, director of the Southern  California Operation Rescue, addressed his followers, who carried graphic  posters, prayer books and Bibles.  </P> <P> "This was a very successful rescue," Neal said. "We have heard that they had a  full schedule of abortions today and we got here before they opened and before  those children who would have been killed were killed."  </P> <P> Owners of the clinic could not be reached for comment. Kathy Spillar, national  coordinator for the Fund for a Feminist Majority, said the facility had planned  to remain closed Saturday and that no abortions had been scheduled. The clinic  offers a variety of health services.  </P> <P> Carla Black, a member of Operation Rescue who described herself as a counselor,  said she persuaded one pregnant woman on her way to the clinic to reconsider  her plans for an abortion. Black said the woman was taken by other Operation  Rescue workers to the Crisis Pregnancy Center, which she said was an an  anti-abortion center that helps pregnant women.  </P> <P> The day began early for both sides. Spillar said more than 500 pro-choice  activists had been dispatched by 5 a.m. to 26 clinics throughout Los Angeles  and Orange counties that had been considered potential targets of Operation  Rescue on Saturday. The anti-abortion group had announced it was planning a  "rescue" -- during which members try to form blockades and keep clinics from  opening -- but, as in the past, Operation Rescue leaders kept secret the  precise targets until early Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Before converging in Fullerton, Operation Rescue sent forces to clinics in El  Monte, Long Beach and Tustin. Pro-choice activists said patients were scheduled  for early morning appointments and thus managed to avoid protesters at the  Doctor's Family Planning Clinic on Irvine Boulevard in Tustin. The patients  were inside before 8 a.m., while Operation Rescue workers did not arrive until  about half an hour later. In Long Beach, patients also were treated as  scheduled, pro-choice activists said. They said the El Monte clinic was not  scheduled to open Saturday.  </P> <P> By 9 a.m. most of the day's activities were focused in Fullerton, where  pro-choice and anti-abortion activists staged rallies and then lingered until  the afternoon.  </P> <P> "I'm always fearful people won't cross over the Orange curtain, but Los Angeles  and Orange County coalesced today in big numbers," said Barbara Jackson, a  member of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Orange County. "Pro-choice people are  going to support women's rights anywhere in the country, even Orange County."  </P> <P> Demonstrations were less peaceful in Brookline, Mass., where 60 Operation  Rescue demonstrators were arrested for blocking patients from entering a  clinic. Authorities videotaped the anti-abortion protesters and said they would  use the tapes in a pending civil suit against Operation Rescue. The  anti-abortion group has been charged under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt  Organization law by Brookline officials hoping to recoup overtime costs for  police assigned to maintain order at the protests.  </P> <P> Hundreds of pro-choice and anti-abortion activists braved freezing cold  Saturday to rally at the Brookline clinic.  </P></p>

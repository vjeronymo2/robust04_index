			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Johanna Korhonen and Hannu Sokala: "The End of </F> the Recession Made the Government Stimulate"]    [Text] The nonsocialist government of Esko Aho (Center  Party) announced on Friday [4 February] that a new period had  begun in Finland's economy. The government stated that the  recession had ended and started stimulation through borrowing.    A decision was made on starting stimulation back in  December,  but last week the government's desire to stimulate became so  strong that it sent bills involving the first stimulation  package to the Eduskunta a week earlier than had originally been  intended.    "These measures are extremely urgent," Aho said on Friday  when presenting the government's proposal for this year's first  supplementary budget. The objective of the proposal, which is  part of the stimulation package, is to get companies to invest.    In the same breath Aho announced that the recession had  ended: "The recession may be considered to have ended in the  last quarter of this year, since the Finnish economy has been  growing since then."    In actual fact the economic crisis may be considered to have  ended only when unemployment slackens. It can happen only when  investment starts to rise, i. e., when companies procure new  machinery and equipment for increasing production.    "Through the stimulation package it is desired to create the  kind of incentives that will cause at least some investments to  be made earlier, so that they do not pile up at the same time in  the traditional manner," Raimo Sailas, the budget chief of the  Ministry of Finance, said.    The Central Federation of Industry and Employers predicted  recently that large investments would not start until 1995-96,  when the Finnish attitude toward membership in the European  Union becomes clear.  <H5>  It Is Useless for Companies To Expect New Measures </H5>   Raimo Sailas said that he does not believe that companies  will wait to see if there are new stimulation packages, although  he admits that "this is a familiar game." According to him "it  is useless for companies to expect" completely new stimulation  measures.    At present the only large industrial investment is the  renovation of Outukumpu's plants in Harjavalta. A decision on  building the Metsa-Botnia pulp plant in Rauma is expected next.    The government will encourage companies to invest through a  special investment credit. This means that companies will be  permitted to deduct 7 percent of the expenditures for productive  investment. According to an estimate by the Ministry of Finance  the credits will cut a 700-800-million-markka hole in the  government's tax revenues.    In addition to the investment credit, the supplementary  budget presented on Friday contains 1.7 billion markkas worth of  public-sector investments and procurement speedups. Minister of  Labor Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative) calculated that public and  private investments together could now reach a value of 4.6  billion markkas.  <H5>  Lobbying Efforts Broke Records </H5>   In December the government decided to make citizens' buying  power increase by arranging for an increase of 150 million  markkas in child allowances and 100 million markkas in health  insurance benefits. In addition the government canceled its  earlier decision to tighten up taxation. Taken altogether these  decisions will increase government borrowing this year by  approximately 3 billion markkas or about 4 percent.    Companies and officials around the country have attempted to  publicize their own projects to the Ministry of Finance in  recent weeks.    "The flood of letters and lobbying attempts by businesses  and  the new provincial associations have broken all records," Raimo  Sailas said.    The government is proposing 455 million markkas for highway  work and 440 million for the railroads. Accelerating public  investments will benefit road builders in particular.    The government calculates that the stimulus package will  increase domestic demand this year by 5 billion markkas.  According to an estimate by the government, the rate of growth  in total output will speed up from the 1 percent forecast in  fall to 2 percent by virtue of the package.    According to the Ministry of Labor, the package will produce  16,000 new jobs. In comparison to the December statistics this  would mean a reduction in unemployment from 21.8 percent to 21.2  percent.  <H5>  Good Year End Surprised Government </H5>   Up to December the government opposed an expansion of  borrowing, claiming among other things that stimulus would stop  the drop in interest rates. Interest rates have continued to  fall, however, even after the government's change in direction.    Raimo Sailas from the Ministry of Finance could not give a  precise answer to why the government decided just now on a large  stimulus package.    "In October and November of last year the notion prevailed  that development would be much weaker than it apparently turned  out later. Surprisingly the development was not so bad, and  consumer demand livened up. The intent of the stimulus is to  prevent our tailspin from continuing."    Sailas admitted that one could discuss the timing of the  stimulus. "Well, yes, this is not at all a fine-tuning matter,  but it certainly will not overheat the economy. We shall not see  how lasting the growth in consumption is until the new tax cards  come in."    The government's economic policy has been criticized on the  grounds that delaying stimulation has deepened the recession  more than previously.    Sailas explained the late beginning for stimulation by the  fact that when the recession was at its deepest "one could not  know at all what is now known.    ``If even in the fall of 1992 people had been certain that  the balance of payments would come into equilibrium so rapidly,  it would have been possible to start operations that would have  prevented the recession in domestic markets from deepening. In  addition to us the so-called markets would have had to be  assured of this notion. If things had been that way financial  policy could have been a few degrees looser.''    In Sailas' opinion economists and other citizens have a  tendency to overestimate the capabilities of fiscal policy, i.  e., the regulation of government revenues and expenditures. "I  have tried to emphasize more and more that it is more important  to attempt to create a stable framework for operations than to  run after fluctuating forecasts or attempt to fine-tune fiscal  policy."</p>

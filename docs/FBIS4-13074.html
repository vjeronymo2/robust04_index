			<p>BFN     [Text] The Golboddin-Dostam militia once again embarked on  aggression against the Islamic army's positions and put the  residential regions of Kabul city under a rain of rocket and  mortar fire. The military correspondent of the BAKHTAR  INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the criminal Golboddin-Dostam  militia, following yesterday's failed attack -- launching  rockets and firing heavy weapons -- last night also launched  hundreds of rockets from the type of SAKAR, BM-12, BM-21, and  mortar mine on residential regions of Kabul city. As a result  of the launched rockets, which mostly landed on the residential  regions of the 11th, 10th, fourth and second wards of the city,  a number of our compatriots were martyred and a number were  seriously injured. As a result of this lunatic action of  Hekmatyar, in addition to loss of life, a number of residential  houses, and government buildings located in the above wards were  either destroyed or damaged. One mosque located in Khairkhana  III was demolished.    The report adds that the infamous Golboddin-Dostam militia  last night embarked on infantry aggression against the positions  of the Islamic state's forces from the direction of Bala Hesar.  It was foiled in the same way as their other unsuccessful  attacks. With the blessing of Almighty God, courageous  resistance by the mojahedin and soldiers of the Islamic army,  the enemy was forced to retreat. A responsible security source  put the enemy losses at 20 dead and 10 injured.    Military observers believe the recent actions by the  Golboddin-Dostam mercenary militiamen in Kabul are an effort to  recompense and disguise the repeated defeats of militia in the  north and to disrupt the peace process in the country. The  murderer and adventurist militiamen of Golboddin-Dostam can only  see their political-military survival in fighting and in  continuation of tension. This claim can be entirely  substantiated by Golboddin Hekmatyar's (?utterance) made  yesterday at a meeting with the peace delegation consisting of  ulema from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and some Jehadi  leaders and personalities of Afghanistan. In reply to a  question by a peace-seeking ulema who asked Hekmatyar to  refrain, for the sake of holy Koran, from further bloodshed,  destruction, and further defaming of Jehad and Islam, and asked  him to open supply routes for the Muslim and innocent people of  Kabul and to stop firing blind rockets, Hekmatyar with anger and  disrespect said: I will fight for another 25 years against the  Islamic sovereignty and people. And I would not reverse until I  gain power.    This is happening at a time when esteemed professor  Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of  Afghanistan, despite unforgivable crimes committed by Golboddin,  has displayed flexibility and [words indistinct] in honor of the  peace delegation from the fraternal countries of Saudi,  Pakistan, and Bangladesh, as well as Jehadi leaders and  personalities of Afghanistan. Relying on the usual strategy of  the Islamic state, which is resolving the country's issues by  talks and understanding, Rabbani declared a unilateral  cease-fire in Kabul. But the Golboddin-Dostam militia, ignoring  the cease-fire, have been attacking the positions of the Islamic  army and residential regions during the past two days with heavy  weapons and infantry forces. The Islamic state's forces  responded to these attacks by defending their positions and  safeguarding the life and property of the civil population in  Kabul city.</p>

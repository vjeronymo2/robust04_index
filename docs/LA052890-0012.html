			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BOND ISSUES;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT FINANCING ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN;  </P> <P> LIKE CREDIT-CARD ACCOUNTS, THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH SACRAMENTO CAN GO INTO  DEBT BY SELLING BONDS.  </P> <P> California should consider lengthening its motto to: "Eureka -- we found  bonds."  </P> <P> Next week, the state's voters will decide the fate of seven proposed bond  issues totaling $5.1 billion. That's on top of $5.5 billion approved in 1988,  by far the most general-obligation debt authorized in any election year. And  even before this binge began, the state owed $8 billion from previous bond  issues.  </P> <P> Another big bond package is already being prepared by the Legislature for the  November ballot, and there is no end in sight to the demand for megabucks to  build the public-works projects needed by the state at the start of the 21st  Century.  </P> <P> California was essentially forced into heavier bond financing by the tax revolt  of 1978, which placed limits on spending but left a loophole for financing  projects through voter-approved bond issues. The Gann spending limit does not  apply to funds raised through the sale of bonds, thereby encouraging officials  to accomplish as much as possible on the installment plan.  </P> <P> In addition, environmental organizations have discovered that they can sell  bond issues to the public by way of the initiative process, as they did in 1988  with a $776 million parks proposal and as they are attempting in June with a $2  billion passenger-rail construction measure. Gerald Meral, executive director  of the Planning and Conservation League, has spearheaded the use of bond  initiatives as a means of circumventing the legislative budget process and  mobilizing the environmental movement in the state.  </P> <P> Californians generally approve bond proposals because debt is easier to sell to  voters than higher taxes and because inflation helps government make its  payments with relatively cheap dollars. One standard argument for using credit  financing is that bonds pay for projects that will be used by future citizens,  so it is only fair that they share the burden.  </P> <P> But just like individual credit-card accounts, there's a limit to how much  government can go into debt or burden future generations. State Treasurer  Thomas Hayes, supported by Wall Street debt-rating organizations, warns that  the markets can absorb only about $2 billion in California general-obligation  bonds a year without impairing the credit of the state. "The bond market is not  a bottomless pit," Hayes says.  </P> <P> California's reliance on bonds also carries heavy risks of unfulfilled  expectations of citizens and possible strain on future budgets. Because the  politicians and the public are authorizing bonds faster than they can be  prudently sold, there could be long delays in delivery of the benefits promised  by bond sponsors.  </P> <P> Richard Larkin of Standard and Poor's, one of the three major credit rating  agencies, says his firm would consider downgrading California bonds if the  state starts to exceed $2 billion a year in sales. The effect would be an  increase in interest rates and thus increased cost to taxpayers over the life  of the bonds, typically 20 years.  </P> <P> California has not yet reached the danger point. It has the highest credit  rating and still gets favorable interest rates. But that could change rapidly  if the pace of bond issuance continues to accelerate.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, recently urged local officials here to  better protect the Huangdi Mausoleum.    Li Ruihuan is a member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party  of China and honorary chairman of the China Huangdi Foundation.    Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) is a legendary ancestor of the  Chinese nation and yesterday was a traditional festival on which  Chinese commemorate their ancestors.    The Huangdi Mausoleum was of great significance for  fostering  Chinese culture, stimulating patriotism, strengthening national  integration and advancing the modernization drive, Li said.    In the course of the Chinese modernization drive, how to  unite overseas compatriots to the maximum extent and give full  play to their potential and intelligence has always been a major  topic, Li said. He pointed out that Huangdi is a highly  representative figure in the history of the Chinese nation.    He called on the local government to give strong support to  the repair and renovation of the mausoleum and to collect funds  through public donations.    He noted that there must be a long-term plan for the repair  and protection of the mausoleum.    Li Ruihuan conducted an investigation in Shaanxi Province on  April 3-6. He inspected the No. 2 pit of the terracotta  warriors being excavated and attended the public rites in honor  of Huangdi yesterday.</p>

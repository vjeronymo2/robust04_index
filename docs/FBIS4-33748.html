			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (PL) -- Today, the Cuban Foreign  Ministry confirmed that two Canadian citizens will stand trial  in Cuba for participating in a group of people's attempt to  illegally leave the country, which ended in two tragic deaths.    Michael Benditti and Robert Shymko arrived in Havana on a  boat from Florida and stopped over at the "Marina Hemingway"  naval base, claiming that they planned to continue their trip to  Varadero Beach, 140 km from Havana.    Nevertheless, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Miguel  Alfonso, the Canadians in fact traveled to Guanabo Beach,  approximately 25 km from the capital, to facilitate the illegal  departure from the country of eight people which, apparently,  had been previously agreed upon.    The group's haste to leave prompted an accident on the beach  which claimed the lives of two swimmers and caused serious  injuries to another, he added.    Consequently, it has been officially announced that the two  Canadians have been arrested and will be subjected to legal  procedures established for such cases.    The spokesman explained that the foreigners have already  been  visited by officials from the Canadian Consulate in Cuba and  that legal procedures against them are following their normal  course.</p>

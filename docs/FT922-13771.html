			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: USF&amp;G sees first-quarter profit USF&amp;G, the large but troubled Baltimore-based insurer, yesterday told analysts that it expected to beat current market expectations when it reports figures for the first quarter of 1992, posting a very small profit for the period. Mr Norman Blake, the company's chairman, said that net income for the quarter will be around Dollars 2m to Dollars 5m, and that this will translate into a loss per share of around 9 to 12 cents after paying preferred stock dividends. Analysts had been predicting a loss of some 30 cents a share. In the previous year, the first-quarter figures showed a net loss of Dollars 55m, or 70 cents a share. For the full year, the deficit amounted to Dollars 176m, having reached Dollars 569m in 1990 - in part, a reflection of charges arising from a restructuring of the business. Mr Blake acknowledged yesterday that the insurance environment remains 'soft', but suggested that the improved figures stemmed for the realignment of the business. USF&amp;G has taken steps to overhaul its business under Mr Blake's command - pulling out of workers' compensation business in certain states, for example, ceasing to write new personal lines insurance in others, and slashing both head office staff and branch offices. Analysts, however, have questioned whether - in the process of improving the bottom-line results - the fairly drastic cutbacks would undermine USF&amp;G's franchise. Part of the insurer's problems stem from souring real estate investments, and Mr Blake acknowledged yesterday that his predictions for the first quarter allowed for some further strengthening of real estate reserves, together with core insurance loss reserves. Shares in USF&amp;G increased by Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 9 3/8 on Wall Street yesterday, having been close to Dollars 50 in the late-1980s. Value Line ranks USF&amp;G as the 13th largest property-casualty insurer in terms of premium volume, and around 60 per cent of its written premiums relate to commercial coverage. There has been talk of some improvement in personal lines pricing, although few insurers think the cycle has turned, but commercial lines pricing has been highly competitive and a further shake-out in capacity is thought necessary.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: SIB issues guidance on derivative instruments The Securities and Investments Board yesterday published two guidance papers on trading derivative instruments on exchanges, designed to clarify how the UK's Financial Services Act should be applied to derivatives. The first paper deals with incentive schemes initiated by exchanges in order to encourage trading activity, while the second paper provides guidance on what constitutes a proper trade and a proper market. Both reviews were sparked in part by last year's scandal on the London Futures and Options Exchange (FOX), which involved the rigging of its now defunct property futures contract. Mr Barry Gittins, who is in charge of derivatives and securities regulation at the SIB, said the papers were designed to make it simpler to apply the Act to derivatives. The FSA's rules on acceptable practice are focused on securities, and do not give specific rules on how to deal with derivatives. Mr Gittins added that a review of over-the-counter derivatives trading, an even more complex area, may be undertaken in the future. Mr Michael Jenkins, who took over as chairman of FOX in the wake of the property futures trade-rigging scandal, welcomed the guidance papers, which he described as 'overdue'. He said that it was 'right for regulators to issue guidance on the interpretation (of the FSA) so that exchanges can issue rules accordingly'. Comments on the draft guidance on proper trades and proper markets are invited by the SIB. Incentive Schemes in Relation to On-Exchange Derivatives, Pounds 2. Draft Guidance on Proper trades and Proper Markets in Relation to On-Exchange Derivatives, Pounds 5. Available from the Securities and Investments Board, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC4Y 8RA</p>

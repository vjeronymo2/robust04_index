			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Olivetti plans rights issue as losses rise sharply to L650bn OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, yesterday announced a L903bn (Pounds 411m) rights issue and said it would report a sharply increased net loss of about L650bn for 1992. The cash, to be raised through new shares and convertible bonds, will be used for expansion, notably in the increasingly linked areas of information technology and telecommunications. 'In the short term, the money will be used to bring debt down to zero,' said Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, whose listed CIR holding company controls the group. 'But we want to use the funds to accelerate Olivetti's development into new areas,' he added yesterday. Last week, Olivetti took a stake in EO, a Silicon Valley start-up company marketing 'personal communicators' - pocket telephones with inbuilt fax and computing capabilities. Olivetti's 1992 loss, to be announced officially in May, will be nearly 50 per cent larger than the L460bn lost in 1991. Sales fell 6.8 per cent to L8,020bn and operating losses surged to L230bn from L28bn. But Olivetti's more aggressive price cutting on personal computers had triggered a 35 per cent rise in sales in the final quarter, he added. At the year-end, Olivetti's net debt stood at L960bn. The dividend will be omitted again, Mr De Benedetti said. He added that Olivetti faced further heavy restructuring costs of up to L250bn this year, as it planned to shed a further 3,500 workers. The amount set aside for restructuring charges fell to L260bn in 1992 from L338bn in 1991, but the actual figure spent was L170bn higher, as it included money provided for in 1991, Mr De Benedetti said. He said the rights issue, priced at the shares' nominal value of L1,000, indicated Olivetti's determination to survive. CIR would subscribe its full quota, costing about L300bn. Shareholders will be offered six ordinary shares for every four shares, of whatever category, now held. Shareholders may subscribe to at least half their entitlement in the form of new equity, and the remainder as six-year convertible bonds which will pay interest of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent, and be interchangeable with the new ordinary shares.

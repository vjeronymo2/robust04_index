			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Irmgard Schwaetzer, construction minister </F> and FDP deputy chairperson, by Ursula Welter; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Welter] The Federal Assembly  will elect a president -- a successor to Richard von Weizsaecker  -- in Berlin tomorrow. Roman Herzog rejected general dual  citizenship. He was criticized for that by the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP]. Still, the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] hopes that the FDP will  support Herzog in the third ballot. The CDU/CSU has threatened  that the climate in the coalition will deteriorate if the FDP  does not comply with its wishes. Will your party yield to  pressure?    [Schwaetzer] No, on no account. It would be better for the  CDU/CSU to cease these threatening gestures because this is no  way to behave between partners. It is simply bad form. By the  way, the threats will certainly have an effect on the FDP, but  by no means the desired one. The FDP will discuss its future  plans completely independently between the individual ballots.  The FDP will support Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. We have an  excellent presidential candidate. It would have been good for  the CDU/CSU if it had endorsed our fine candidate instead of  desperately searching for a candidate of its own.  Unfortunately, this was not the case. Anyway, the FDP will not  yield to pressure. We will calmly discuss our behavior in every  individual ballot.    [Welter] Thus, we have to discuss the hypothetical case  that, after the deliberations between the ballots, you might  arrive at the conclusion that Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher will not  participate in the third ballot. This possibility cannot be  ruled out completely. Will it then be possible for the FDP to  vote for candidate Herzog whom it criticized strongly in the  past?    [Schwaetzer] A candidate that has been nominated by another  party is never the ideal or desired candidate of the Liberals.  Thus, the FDP will have to deliberate carefully which candidate  it should support. I am optimistic that the FDP will vote  largely unanimously for a certain candidate. This might require  a longer process of discussion, but this is the way many  decisions are made within the FDP. My personal opinion is -- I  already stressed this before some of the candidates were  nominated -- that what we need in the next five years is a  president who can build bridges, who can bring people together,  and who does not polarize society. Particularly because other  countries are observing Germany with a sharp eye, it is very  important for the head of state himself to represent a  confidence-building measure.    [Welter] You have just described the qualities of the future  president. Yet, you mention no name.    [Schwaetzer] This is not my task at the moment. We support  Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and we will vote for her. [passage  omitted]</p>

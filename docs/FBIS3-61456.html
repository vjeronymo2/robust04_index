			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. G. Grishchenko; UDC 537.847.4] </F>   [Abstract] Geometric optics is used to resolve  electromagnetic wave scattering on an optically dense revolving  body with a multilayered absorbing coating. The unknown  scattering field is found by adding the rays re-reflected in the  coating at the point of observation. A recurrent algorithm is  developed for constructing a ray pattern of the field for a  multilayered body, whose boundary is depicted by arbitrary  smooth functions. In order to determine the accuracy of the  solution, it is compared with the results of rigorous  calculations and with experimental data for a sphere, round  cylinder and oval body. Figures 5; references 10.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Property: Lloyd's losses squeeze owners hit by recession - No crisis yet but crunch could be coming THE HUGE losses incurred by Names (the members) at Lloyd's, the London insurance market, have not had a major effect on the property market. Not yet. A few well-publicised cases - such as Pitchford Hall in Shropshire, which the National Trust could take over if the National Heritage Memorial Fund finds the money - have led people to think the crisis has arrived. But estate agents agree that this is not so although Justin Marking, in the country house department at agent Savills, believes the cracks are starting to appear. The Lloyd's losses are only part of how the recession has hit the landed and nearly-landed classes, forcing them to put their houses on the market. Failed businesses are a more frequent reason, usually when owners have pledged the houses as collateral for bank loans or bought them in the company's name, trusting that expanding profits would take care of any over-investment. Soaring maintenance costs (and no VAT relief on regular repairs) are another factor. But the worst is that agricultural income is only a dribble nowadays  -if not an outflow - and has taken the price of farm land down with it. Norman Hudson, consultant to the Historic Houses Association, says the effects of Lloyd's will not affect the large country houses that have been in the same family for generations as they are usually in entail and the 'owner' is only a life tenant. Likewise, it is on receivers' instructions that Marking is selling two large estates: Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex (Pounds 5m) and Heveningham Hall in Suffolk (Pounds 4.5m). Again, there is no link with Lloyd's. Free from serious trouble are the lucky (astute?) Names who were not in the disastrous LMX syndicates but aimed for lower returns from boring business like aviation and motor insurance. Some will have low losses this year - but many actually will have received a cheque. There are about 22,500 Names in Lloyd's, the same as in 1983-85. Membership peaked in 1988 at more than 32,000, dropping slightly in 1989. The Names who have borne vast losses for those years, and who still do not know what their eventual liability will be, are about 25 per cent of the membership. In the unlikely event that all had to sell their houses, prices would fall from their present low levels, but it would not be a market melt-down. If there is an autumn rush to sell, the houses at risk are the old rectories and manor houses, and houses and flats in London, belonging to Names who entered Lloyd's during the 1980s when the threshold became more affordable, and enticing talk of 'making your assets work for you' flowed through the shires. Newcomers used their houses as collateral, not to Lloyd's itself (which would not accept a main residence as evidence of wealth) but to the bank which guaranteed their wealth (for an annual fee of Pounds 1,000) to Lloyd's. A high valuation of the property let the Name subscribe to a larger line of underwriting. This system infuriates such suffering Names as Harriet Crawley, who asks why Lloyd's did not then inquire what the guarantee was based on. 'If they are serious about getting people with greater means, you should not be able to put up a flat in lieu of money,' she says. 'The real question is: Have you got any money?' The guarantees could pose a tricky dilemma for the banks. If Lloyd's draws down on these, do the banks pull the plug on the Names and sell their houses? Or do they encourage them to trade through now that Lloyd's is becoming a leaner, healthier organisation asking higher premiums and with tighter policy wordings on asbestosis and pollution? While the banks ponder, they have begun quizzing Names more closely about the value of their property and chattels - even how much a wife's jewellery is worth. Wiser (or luckier) Names who have been in Lloyd's a long time are philosophical. They can afford to be as, over the long run, they are still on top. And, rather than being guaranteed by a bank, their deposits will be in securities which are easy to sell (unless they decide to take a picture off the wall, or sell a cottage or some fields). Such Names can argue that the property market fall was coming, anyway, and had nothing to do with Lloyd's. Values in 1988/89 were too high in real terms - and markets do correct themselves eventually. Yet, while Lloyd's has had little effect so far on the British property market, it still could. No one wants to be forced to dispose of his house. But if trouble is on the horizon, it might be better to act now, even though the post-election price euphoria has vanished. Do not hold off for a better price, as it might not be there when the time comes. A Name in Northamptonshire bit the bullet last year. Faced with selling his house or his farm, he got rid of the house in which he had grown up and squeezed into the ex-farm manager's house. He will farm when he retires from the City and, with Lloyd's bills still continuing, is glad now of the extra cash from selling early. The estate agents insist that good properties will sell, even now, so long as the guide price is reasonable. But they are still harried by over-optimistic vendors who have not got over the 1988 valuations. For most people, the effect is negligible. If you get less for the house you sell, you will pay less for the one you buy. The only loser is the Treasury, since inheritance tax valuations also have tumbled. But for the understandably angry Names who are stumping up to pay other Names for the LMX losses (as well as sharing in a massive transfer of wealth from the UK shires to the Middle West of the United States in the asbestosis and pollution claims), this is Cold Comfort Farm.</p>

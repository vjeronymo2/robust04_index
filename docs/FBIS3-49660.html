The hardliners within the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of  Romania -- the ruling party] have mentioned you as one of the  ministers that should be replaced. Have you noticed any signs  that they are preparing for your deposal?    [Spiroiu] That statement was made some time ago by [PDSR  Vice President and Senator Ion] Solcanu. I have never asked him  why he said that, and I do not think I ever will. In any  democratic system, the ruling parties have the right to set up  the governmental teams; therefore, it is only natural that they  should ask for various portfolios.    [Baesu] Did they request that you become a PDSR member?    [Spiroiu] No, never. But let me finish answering your first  question. I learned that during the talks that were held on the  government reshuffle, various parties requested the portfolio of  defense [reference to the National Romanian Unity Party]. Aside  from this, I have not noticed any other signs that they are  preparing for my deposal and no one has tried to obstruct me in  my work.    [Baesu] You and [Foreign Affairs Minister] Teodor Melescanu  are the only ministers of the Vacaroiu cabinet surrounded by a  certain kind of consensus. Despite the fact that you are a  member of the PDSR government, [opposition leader] Emil  Constantinescu recently stated that the CDR [Democratic  Convention of Romania] will support you. Except for the  aforementioned hard liners within the PDSR and [Greater Romania  Party Chairman and Senator] Corneliu Vadim Tudor in his weekly  ROMANIA MARE, no one else has attacked you. How do you explain  this unusual situation of yours?    [Spiroiu] That is quite simple. Beginning in May of 1990,  ever since I have been defense minister, my principal goal was  to keep the armed forces out of the political struggle. We have  been equidistant to every party and never flirted with any of  them. As far as Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor is concerned, the  reason he is attacking me has nothing to do with politics. He  has a brother who is a colonel in our forces and the senator  asked me to promote him to the rank of general, something I  rejected, as his brother does not meet the necessary  preconditions. That is why the senator has been assaulting me.    [Baesu] Could it be that the consensus around your person is  required by the parties' similar interests, namely that the  country should join NATO, and that is why the opposition is also  backing your efforts, especially considering the fact that the  opposition believes you are a person who is liked in  international circles.    [Spiroiu] They might really like me, considering that last  year, eight defense ministers of NATO's European member states  visited Romania. The activity of our ministry to implement  reform is quite appreciated; that might be the reason of their  having accepted me.    [Baesu] Does that acceptance also mean that NATO circles are  manifesting a certain amount of interest in Romania?    [Spiroiu] The NATO countries are interested in seeing that  Romania remains a stability factor in an area that is  considerably tensioned.    [Baesu] Certain politicians of the opposition believe that  our country will not be accepted as a full member of that body,  among other things, owing to the current political regime.    [Spiroiu] In NATO circles, I have never heard anyone say  that Romania should not be admitted because of that. This is an  issue that depends on the decisions taken by the Atlantic  Alliance regarding the admittance of new members. Their latest  statement shows that for the time being, the extent to which  they are prepared to expand the organization is the Partnership  for Peace. At the Brussels summit meeting (of 9-10 January,  editor's note), they will adopt a declaration regarding that  partnership, which is not a collective relationship but rather a  bilateral one. Every single Central and East European state may  apply for and establish ties with NATO. There are a number of  preconditions regarding the military body. Everything we  currently do in our armed forces is done according to the plans  elaborated by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC],  which shows Romania's willingness to join the military  structures of both the WEU [Western European Union] and NATO.    [Baesu] Of course Romania is willing, but will it ever be  admitted?    [Spiroiu] For the time being, there is a consensus among  them that the alliance is not prepared to admit any new members.    [Baesu] Is that delay too dangerous for us, considering  especially how close we are to Russia?    [Spiroiu] It is our own interest to gain admittance as soon  as possible. However, it is not important that we should gain  admittance, but rather that no one should be discriminated  against by admitting other Central and East European states  first. We are struggling for a security area equally valid for  all, without any discrimination, without establishing new  boundaries. Of course, Russia's interests should be observed  and we should avoid creating the impression that our approaching  the alliance is done because of our hostile stance regarding  that country.    [Baesu] What would happen if they would decide for a  two-step admittance of the East European countries to NATO?  What if Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland are admitted  first?    [Spiroiu] A two-step admittance to the NATO structures would  generate insecurity, instability, suspicion, and it would  generate a feeling of isolation that would bolster the  conservative forces, such as those in Russia, for example.    [Baesu] Under such circumstances, could we be forced to  strike an alliance with Russia?    [Spiroiu] Such a thing is out of the question. For the time  being, in my opinion, military alliances are already  old-fashioned things and after the Paris Charter was signed,  they have no real purpose. NATO itself, which we wish to join,  has lost its role as an organization opposing the Warsaw Pact.  This is another NATO that has developed a third dimension for  itself, namely to support the countries that have set out on the  way of democratic reforms.    [Baesu] Still, the emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the  Russian political scene does not pose any peril for us? Mikhail  Gorbachev has recently stated that he [Zhirinovskiy] is  supported by the KGB. What are the consequences for Romania of  the apparition of this person, whom some people call the second  Hitler?    [Spiroiu] Mr. Gorbachev has hopefully made that statement on  the basis of some evidence. I, as a military person, cannot  make any similar assertions, as I lack the evidence. However,  on the basis of what I do know, I can assert the following  things: No real security system can be achieved with the  democratization of Russia. That is why we morally support the  democratization process taking place in Russia. Zhirinovskiy is  the representative of extremist and conservative forces. His  apparition could be dangerous if he comes to power and if he had  a much larger audience than the one he currently has. Heaven  forbid he should be supported more massively, because if he  becomes the ruler of the country, that would strengthen the  forces that are striving to rebuild the Soviet empire with all  its imperial characteristic features. Thus, that would not only  endanger the security of the neighboring states but world  security as well.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dhaka, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed his total  satisfaction with his four-day official good-will visit to  Bangladesh.    "It is a short-time but a fruitful visit", the Chinese  foreign minister said, adding his talks here would immensely  help further develop the close bilateral ties between China and  Bangladesh.    Qian Qichen replied to a volley of questions at a crowded  press conference here this morning.    Replying to a question on "the South Asia nuclear-free  zone",  Qian Qichen noted that domestic situations in most South Asian  countries are now turning to stable. The relations among  countries of the region have been improving and regional  cooperations have also been developing, he said.    However, the foreign minister said, "there are still some  destabilizing factors in South Asia. There are still some  differences among the countries of the region".    "We don't want arms race in the region. Because, any arms  race in South Asia will be no of benefit to peace and stability  in the region", he said.    Qian Qichen noted under the present international situation,  the security of a country will mainly depend on the economic  development of the country and that is the conception of  "economic security".    If the developing countries could not achieve their economic  development and fail in improving the living standard of their  people, "it will be very difficult for them to have security",  Qian said.    Replying to a question on the improvement of bilateral ties  between China and India, Qian said Sino-Indian relations were  developing but made it clear that this should by no means affect  China's friendly cooperations with other countries of the region.    About Bangladesh's share of the water from India, the  foreign  minister said it was natural that Bangladesh would ask for its  rightful share in the waters of the rivers coming through other  countries. "We hope that the issue could be resolved through  bilateral discussion and negotiation between India and  Bangladesh", he added.    As regards the Kashmir issue, Qian Qichen stressed that  "China's position on the issue remained unchanged". China hopes  that India and Pakistan could settle the dispute left over by  history through peaceful negotiation taking into account the  United Nation's resolutions and the relevant agreements reached  between the two countries.</p>

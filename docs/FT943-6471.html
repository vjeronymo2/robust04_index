			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nestle lifts water stake Nestle, the world's largest food and beverages group, is raising its indirect stake in the San Pellegrino mineral water company. The Swiss group said it had enlarged its stake in Compagnie Financiere du Haut-Rhin (CFHR), a Luxembourg company which has majority control of San Pellegrino, to 42 per cent from 28 per cent by buying shares from the Italian Gardini and Malgara families. It expected to raise its CFHR stake further to 49 per cent through purchases from the Mentasti family, which controls it. Nestle, which has been building its mineral water interests rapidly in the past few years, also has a direct stake in San Pellegrino, believed to be about 14 per cent.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Unidanmark expects loss in first half UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second largest banking group, expects a first-half loss this year, weak conditions in the bond and share markets since the end of last year and continued difficulties in the domestic business sector, Mr Jens Chr. Kirketerp Jensen, the chairman, said yester-day. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said that it was reaffirming the bank's A1 Eurocommercial paper rating. The rating has been on credit watch since February 24. The bank has made substantial losses on involvement in London's Docklands, the commercial and residential development in east London. 'Not only has the market and the economy collapsed. The promises of improvements in the infrastructure in the area were not met either,' he said. The bank reported a DKr1.6bn (Dollars 251m) loss in 1991 after making large bad loan provisions.</p>

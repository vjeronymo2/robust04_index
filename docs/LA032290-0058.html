			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COAST'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM OUTLASTS PIERCE  </P> <P> In what amounted to a replay of last year's state junior college championship  match, Orange Coast College defeated Pierce in five games in a tense 3 1/2-hour  South Coast Conference match Wednesday night at Pierce.  </P> <P> The score was 15-12, 7-15, 15-12, 17-19, 15-7.  </P> <P> The Brahmas, who lost the state title to OCC in five games last season, were  defeated by the Pirates for the fifth consecutive time.  </P> <P> Pierce (10-2 in the SCC) lost in three games at Orange Coast earlier this  season and lost all three meetings with the Pirates last year. Orange Coast  (11-1 in the SCC) moved into sole possession of the conference lead in the  first match of the second round of the SCC.  </P> <P> Pierce Coach Ken Stanley said before the match that it would be a war, and he  was right. "It's sort of a pride match," Stanley said. "They annihilated us  earlier this year. It was embarrassing."  </P> <P> The fourth game was easily the best of the match. Pierce trailed, 14-10, and  fought off six game points before tying the score, 14-14.  </P> <P> The Brahmas took the lead on Tony Zapata's service ace, but OCC fought off five  game points and tied the score, 15-15, on a Pierce net violation.  </P> <P> The Pirates went ahead, 16-15, but Pierce tied it on Chad Blatchley's kill.  Orange Coast went ahead, 17-16, but Pierce scored the next three points, ending  the 48-minute game on the seventh game point when Jamal Thompson stuffed Craig  Buccola's kill attempt.  </P> <P> Orange Coast jumped to a 4-2 lead in the decisive fifth game and widened its  margin to 10-6 when Ed Gilson hit long. The Pirates outscored Pierce, 5-1, the  rest of the way, winning the match when Matt Lyles crushed a kill off  Thompson's attempted block.  </P> <P> The first game was an exercise in sideouts. Neither team led by more than two  points until Tyler Bates was called for a lift, giving OCC the victory.  </P> <P> Pierce controlled the second game from the outset, jumping to a 4-1 lead, then  a 10-4 advantage, forcing two OCC timeouts. The Pirates closed to 10-7, but  Pierce scored the final five points, winning the match when Bates set Thompson  perfectly and the 6-4 freshman hammered the ball down the middle.  </P> <P> Pierce got 41 kills from Ed Gilson.  </P></p>

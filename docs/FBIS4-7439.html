			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang cannot  accept an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) proposal for  inspection of its radiochemical laboratory, a senior North  Korean official said Thursday.    Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to  the  United Nations, said Pyongyang is willing to allow IAEA  inspectors to witness the changing of fuel rods at the Yongbyon  nuclear reactor, but that it cannot accept additional checks of  the radiochemical laboratory.    He said, "We have allowed every inspection to ensure the  continuity of nuclear safeguards. We have shown everything to  the IAEA, and the proposal for additional inspection of the  laboratory is an absurd demand."    North Korea sent a message to the agency Wednesday proposing  that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming changing of fuel rods  at the country's five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.</p>

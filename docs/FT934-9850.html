			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Minewater studied following closures THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog, will this week begin studying the movement of underground minewater as British Coal starts to scale down its pumping operations in County Durham. British Coal spends Pounds 1m a year operating nine pumping stations in the centre of the county, but the recent closure of County Durham's last pits means there is no operational reason to continue pumping. The NRA warned British Coal, which is obliged to give only 14 days' notice if it intends to cease pumping, that it could face legal action should pollution occur. The prospect that the pumping of almost 8bn gallons a year may be halted has raised concern that water might rise through abandoned mine workings.</p>

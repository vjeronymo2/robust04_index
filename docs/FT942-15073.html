			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Premiership battle could shatter Japanese coalition The prospect of a sweeping realignment in Japanese politics grew dramatically yesterday after a third prime ministerial candidate emerged. The Liberal Democratic party, which ruled the country for 38 years until it was ousted last summer, was threatened with a split when Mr Michio Watanabe, a party faction leader and former foreign minister, said he may form a breakaway party. If he does so, the dominant right wing of the fractious coalition which took office in August may back him for the premiership, a move which would be likely to bring the departure of the left from the current seven-party government. Mr Watanabe's supporters said he was preparing to put himself forward as a prime ministerial candidate against the two other likely contestants, Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister. 'For me, the nation is more important than the LDP,' said Mr Watanabe, after a two-hour meeting with Mr Kono in which the LDP leader failed to talk him into loyalty. Separately, five LDP members of parliament under the leadership of Mr Michihiko Kano, a rising star of one of its two largest factions, yesterday left the party to form an independent party. Five more said they might follow. Until yesterday, Mr Hata was the clear front-runner to succeed Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister in a parliamentary vote next week. Mr Hosokawa announced his resignation last week because of allegations of financial impropriety. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, deputy leader of the Japan Renewal party, the core of the coalition's right wing, is open to partnership with Mr Watanabe and his supporters. If this did happen, up to 90 members of parliament on the coalition's left wing could leave in protest, so Mr Watanabe would have to bring with him enough LDP defectors to compensate. The New Harbinger party, a 15-member group inside the current coalition, confirmed that it wanted no future cabinet posts but would co-operate with the alliance. The coalition can make no progress in preparing a new government until Mr Watanabe clarifies his intentions, said officials. Coalition leaders are due to meet tomorrow to discuss strategy. Mr Hata yesterday appeared to signal a willingness to work with Mr Watanabe. Old-style party baron makes grab for power, Page 2</p>

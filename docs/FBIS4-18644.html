			<p>BFN     [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The Bundesbank has again  loosened its interest reins very slightly: In the latest  security transaction under repurchase agreement, it allotted  short-term money to the banks at the marginal interest rate of  5.73 percent -- 0.03 percentage points under the previous level;  80.4 billion German marks [DM] were allotted, relevant  transactions for DM82.1 billion had become due.    The great majority of the allotments ranged from 5.73 to  5.75  percent. The rate for security transactions under repurchase  agreement is regarded as the central bank's third key rate.  Because of the volume, it is far more important for the money  market than the classic discount and Lombard key rates, which  are currently 5.25 and 6.75 percent respectively.</p>

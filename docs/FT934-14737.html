			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Brown coal doubts for PowerGen THE Anglo-American consortium which is poised to break into eastern Germany's energy industry must decide by today if it will accept the deal to buy the country's second largest brown coal field. The Treuhand privatisation agency has set this deadline amid concerns that Britain's PowerGen, a big partner in the consortium, is reconsidering its stake in the mining operation. PowerGen's board agreed to the contract on Wednesday to acquire a 40 per cent stake in a power generating plant at Schkopau, near Leipzig. This will give the consortium access to the high-voltage grid run by Veag, eastern Germany's main utility company, and a strategic foothold in eastern Germany's lucrative energy sector. Schkopau will be fuelled by Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle (Mibrag), the giant lignite fields which the consortium is supposed to be buying from the Treuhand, and over which PowerGen is reported to be having second thoughts. 'It would be madness for any side to pull out at this stage,' a banker involved in the negotiations said. 'If PowerGen is worried that energy demand will not be sufficient to consume the amount of coal it mines, they should think again. Mibrag has secured long-term coal contracts.' NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho, the two other consortium partners, want to wrap up the 18 months of talks on Mibrag.</p>

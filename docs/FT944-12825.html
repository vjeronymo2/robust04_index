			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / This Week: Music The muses of two very different generations of rock music release new albums this week: Joni Mitchell's Turbulent Indigo (Reprise) is characteristically serious and moralistic, but always intelligent. Sadly, however, Mitchell seems to have mislaid her sense of fun temporarily. An idea of her mood can be gleaned from the cover, on which her face is transposed on to a Van Gogh self-portrait. About a million miles from the sensibility of this well-crafted album is Madonna's Bedtime Stories (Maverick/Sire), in which our heroine goes soft and gooey after years of abrasively flaunting her sexuality before us. Without wishing to sound like an old woman, it simply doesn't work; most depressing of all is the lack of attention to the quality of her songs, which actually used to be one of her strong points. Christmas compilation fever is already beginning to break out in the shops. It is hard to imagine that there is a new way of packaging Motown's peerless collection of classics, but Motown - The Ultimate Hits Collection claims to have remastered 46 tracks (41 of them Top Ten UK hits), from Mary Wells to Boyz II Men, for our rediscovery. I'm afraid I still prefer the scratchy singles. INXS - The Greatest Hits (Mercury) celebrates the band's 17 years with a resume of their best-known material. Russian spirituality seems to be going down a treat in the faithless west these days. Latest releases in a growing genre are Rachmaninov's Vespers (Philips), featuring Nikolai Korniev conducting the St Petersburg Chamber Choir (they are midway through a European tour), and Night Vigil (Deutsche Grammophon), a live recording of the Russian Orthodox Palm Sunday all-night service from the Cathedral of the Transfiguration in St Petersburg. Staying with that city, Sony Classical have released nine new recordings in their St Petersburg Classics series, which is dedicated to rediscovering the music and the artists of the former Soviet Union. Among the releases are symphonies by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and Shostakovich's moving chamber symphony In Memory of the Victims of Fascism and War. Gavin Bryars, whose Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet was one of the unlikely successes of last year, has based his latest work on one of the greatest tragedies of the century. The Sinking of the Titanic (Point) takes as its starting point the reported fact that the ship's band kept playing even as she went down. Bryars's sombre piece is intensely uncomfortable to listen to, but it is a remarkably bold and haunting experiment.</p>

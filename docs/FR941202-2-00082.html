The note would allow continued operation of Unit 1 during Cycle 5 at 100 percent maximum steady state power level with one main steam safety valve (MSSV) inoperable per steam generator. This note applies only during the current fuel cycle (Cycle 5) for Unit 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment is being requested on an exigent basis to return Unit 1 to 100% power because the current condition (one inoperable MSSV per SG), is limiting Unit 1 to 98.2% power until the next refueling outage (the next Unit 1 refueling, Cycle 6, is scheduled for April 1995). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed technical specification (TS) amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The primary pressure peaking events [loss of condenser vacuum (LOCV), feedwater line break (FLB), and control element assembly (CEA) ejection events] were analyzed to provide a comparison of pressure response using a base case with a moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) of 0.0 [delta <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->  K/K]/ <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and ten operable main steam safety valves (MSSVs) per steam generator (SG) and a second case using an MTC of ^1.0 E^4 [delta K/K]/ <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and nine operable MSSVs per SG. The analyses performed confirmed that the existing safety analysis (i.e., the analysis of record) for PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5 will remain valid for 102% rated thermal power operation with one MSSV inoperable in each SG. That is, the reactor coolant system (RCS) and secondary system design pressure limits will not be exceeded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis of the pressure peaking events was conservative and included the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The actual MTC expected for full power operation for the remainder of PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5 is more negative, and thus more beneficial, than the ^1.0 E^4 [delta K/K]/ <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F used in the reanalysis (actual MTC measured on October 20, 1994 was ^2.039 E^4 [delta K/K]/ <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F). Thus, the mitigating affect on peak system pressures would be expected to be even greater then those reported herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The core parameters used in the reanalysis (other than MTC) are generic and selected in the most adverse direction. Less adverse cycle specific or time-in-cycle specific values were not used in the reanalysis of PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The inoperable MSSVs are assumed to be in the first bank of MSSVs which have the lowest lift setpoint pressure (i.e., 1303 psia). In fact, one of the two MSSVs currently inoperable is from the third bank of MSSVs (with a higher lift setpoint of 1370 psia) and the other MSSV is in the first bank. If the actual MSSV lift setpoint pressures had been simulated, the results would be less adverse since there would be more relief capacity near the beginning of the event to reduce the pressure peak. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The analyses performed demonstrates that the current licensing basis analyses results remain valid at 102% rated thermal power with one MSSV inoperable in each SG and that all safety system settings will remain unchanged. The PVNGS TS currently allows operation at 98.2% Maximum Steady State Power Level (ACTION a. of Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.1.1) with one inoperable MSSV per SG. The analysis shows that for the current Unit 1 fuel cycle, operation at 102% Maximum Steady State Power Level with one inoperable MSSV per SG is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Standard 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is no reduction in the margin of safety since the analysis performed, crediting the remaining operable MSSVs, shows the results of the analysis of record remain valid. That is, the RCS and secondary system design pressure limits will not be exceeded at 102% rated thermal power with one MSSV inoperable in each SG. In addition, all other safety limits and safety system settings remain unchanged. The actual MTC expected for full power operation for the remainder of PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5 is more negative, and thus more beneficial, than the ^1.0 E^4 [delta <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->  K/K]/ <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F used in the reanalysis study (actual MTC measured on October 20, 1994, was ^2.039 E^4 [delta K/K]/ <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NR staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

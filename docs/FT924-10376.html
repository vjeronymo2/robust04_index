			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: PIBS portfolio launched - At a glance Johnson Fry has launched a 'personal PIBS portfolio' investing in the permanent interest bearing shares issued by building societies. The portfolio will invest only in PIBS issued by the top ten societies. As of October 21, the fund would have offered an 11.42 per cent gross yield (yields will probably have changed since then). The minimum investment is Pounds 20,000 and income will be paid quarterly. There is an initial charge of 4 per cent but no further charges for four years. A Pounds 20 per quarter administration fee will be charged thereafter. Exeter PIBS fund, Page III.</p>

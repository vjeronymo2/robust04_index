			<p>BFN     [Text] Ninety-nine Thai fishermen released by Vietnam after  being arrested and detained for fishing inside Vietnamese  territorial waters reached Samut Sakhon port on Friday night on  three fishing boats that were seized with them.    Two of the fishermen returned with serious health problems.  One is suffering from Aids and the other cannot walk due to  atrophied legs.    Fifty of the 99 are the crew members of three fishing  vessels, the Watcharin 1, Prasong Charoenchai, and Lim  Charoenchai 3, from Samut Sakhon province. They were arrested by  Vietnamese officials on Jan 29.    The Foreign Ministry negotiated with the Vietnamese  government for the release of the crew members and the three  boats on behalf of the boat owners.    The owners had to pay Vietnam US$800 for each of the  returned  fisherman.    Forty-nine other fishermen imprisoned earlier were released  after Sanchat Thephatsadin, the Thai consul in Ho Chi Minh City,  contacted the Vietnamese officials to pay the $800-per-person  fine after no one else came forward to act on their behalf.</p>

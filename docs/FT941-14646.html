			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Swiss biotechnology fund raises SFr170m BB Biotech, a Swiss bio-technology investment fund launched last November, is raising SFr170m (Dollars 114m) in a warrant rights issue. Mr Martin Bisang, a director of Bank am Bellevue in Zurich which manages the fund, said the issue was in response to strong demand for the fund's shares. At yesterday's close of SFr2,830, the shares were at a 7 per cent premium to net asset value. BB Biotech, which raised SFr325m in November, is already one of the largest biotechnology funds. Most of its investment is concentrated in four US companies: Alza, Amgen, Biogen and Genentech. Shareholders will receive one warrant for every share held, and two warrants will entitle the holder to buy one new share at the net asset value on February 28.</p>

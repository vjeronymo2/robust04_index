			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Aetna Life to shed 10% of its workforce Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, one of the biggest US insurance companies, is to drop two insurance products and shed 4,000 jobs - almost 10 per cent of its workforce - at a cost of Dollars 1bn to after-tax earnings in the year just ended. The measures are the latest in a series of actions that have already resulted in the loss of almost 8,000 jobs over the last three years with the aim of revitalising profits. The businesses being dropped, written through Aetna Life Insurance, involve the sale of guaranteed investment contracts and single premium annuities to companies and other large sponsors of retirement plans. Both of the products offer guaranteed returns to investors regardless of the performance of the underlying investments. Aetna, following a trend set by other insurance groups, said that it was dropping the products because they were capital intensive and unprofitable. At the end of 1993, the company had Dollars 14.7bn of assets under management attributable to the products, of which Dollars 6bn was invested in commercial mortgages and real estate. Aetna plans to continue to expand its remaining asset accumulation businesses, the company said, including individual and group variable annuities for small and not-for-profit customers and also pension investment management services for its larger customers. The 4,000 job cuts will be spread across the group's businesses with the aim of cutting costs. The move follows a reorganisation in 1990 which resulted in Aetna's splitting its three large divisions into 15 smaller profit centres so that the performance of each business unit could be more closely monitored. Aetna said that without the charges for the latest measures, its 1993 results, which are due to be released on February 9, would show an operating profit of slightly more than Dollars 600m.</p>

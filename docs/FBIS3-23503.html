Afanasyev under the rubric "Topical </F> Theme": "Would Be Glad To Serve..."]    [Text] The experience of domestic and foreign military  reforms shows that when they are implemented, the central issue  was and remains the professional training of military cadres.  The current military reform, in the course of which the  foundations are being laid and the prospects defined for the  development of the new Russian armed forces, is no exception. A  study of the readiness of officers who are graduates of military  academies for professional activity is of particular interest in  this regard. This interest is explained by the fact that  tomorrow, serving in official positions, they will largely  determine the state of the army, its image and the level of  training.    The changes in all spheres of the life of society are having  an objective influence on the consciousness of citizens,  including officers. The nature and results of this influence  were of interest to a group of research sociologists of the  Academy of Humanities, who conducted a poll of the enrolled  personnel in the final-year courses at the VVA [Military  Aviation Academy] imeni Yu.A. Gagarin and the VVIA [Military  Aviation Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy in 1992.  Some 211 people were selected under a quantitively regulated  sample to provide sufficient representativeness.    The results of the poll established that most of the  respondents were guided in the choice of the profession of  officer first and foremost by socially significant motives (Fig.  1). Some 81.8 percent of those polled, in evaluating the  usefulness of the labor of an officer compared with other types  of activity, noted its high or very high significance. These  data provide grounds to suppose that the greater portion of the  respondents were guided in their choice of profession by moral  incentives, and the prestige of the profession of officer in  society played a substantial role in the formation of the  professional-military thrust of their choice.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-004C-09A>           Fig. 1. Reasons for the choice of the profession of </FIG>          Most of the graduates have a high regard for their labor as  before. The difficult processes in the life of society, however,  are more and more adjusting the social portrait of the graduate  of the military academy. Significant changes in the system of  value orientations are being observed in the environment of the  servicemen as well. These polls show that more than half of the  officer graduates today place tranquil service conditions, low  tension, high earnings and sufficient time for relaxation in  first place when evaluating their service activity (Fig. 2). A  tendency for the displacement of values orientations from  socially to personally significant is clearly pronounced. It  became clearly in the polling that most of the respondents  consider the receipt of high earnings to be the most important  thing for themselves. The officer--the representative and  expressor of state and social interests--thus has personal  rather than social values in the forefront.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-004C-10A>           Fig. 2. Choice of values in service activity </FIG>          The process of further cutbacks in the size of the army and  the uncertainty of the future is having a negative effect on the  mood of academy graduates. Some 80.41 percent of the respondents  have a pessimistic assessment of their prospects, and only 18.92  percent are optimistic about the opportunities to continue their  service. The problem of the drop in prestige of officer service  in society also cannot pass unmentioned. The opinions of the  graduates are quite well-founded, and reflect that picture (87.4  percent had a negative answer to the question of the prestige of  the service).    A dilemma faces the graduates of military academies, and  many  officers in general--to continue to serve or to resign into the  reserves?    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Your attitude toward the |number of replies        |percentage               |  |alternatives--continue t-|                         |                         |  |o serve or be discharged:|                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I intend to be discharge-|12                       |5.6                      |  |d in the near future     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |the desire to be dischar-|34                       |16.1                     |  |ged arises only once in  |                         |                         |  |a while                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I would be discharged, b-|14                       |6.5                      |  |ut I am afraid of not fi-|                         |                         |  |nding work               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I would be discharged, b-|27                       |12.7                     |  |ut I do not have enough  |                         |                         |  |time served for a pension|                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I will be discharged as  |35                       |16.6                     |  |soon as I obtain suitabl-|                         |                         |  |e housing                |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I do not yet intend to b-|81                       |38.8                     |  |e discharged             |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I do not even permit mys-|6                        |2.8                      |  |elf to think about being |                         |                         |  |discharged               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |other variations         |2                        |0.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TOTAL                    |211                      |100                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The table shows the attitude of Air Forces academy officer  graduates toward this problem. Just 2.8 percent expressed a firm  desire to serve. Uncertainty in the responses was typical--54.9  percent of those polled had a difficult time giving a clear-cut  answer, which is most likely explained by the lack of clear  prospects and the situation in the country. The vividly  pronounced readiness of most of the attendees to be discharged  from the army cannot help but cause alarm. Many (35.8 percent)  are being held back from that step only for reasons of a  socio-economic nature--the lack of housing, not enough time  served, the fear of not finding work. This fact cannot help but  make one wonder about the qualitative composition of the future  command personnel of the Air Forces. One can hardly hope that an  officer who is inwardly ready for early discharge, and wishes  for it, will perform the duties entrusted to him by the state  and society in a creative manner and with good return.    The desire of graduates to be discharged into the reserves  was verified during the questioning with the aid of a control  poll. Data were obtained in that that make it possible to  conclude that more than 40 percent of them do not wish to serve.  The main reason determining the desire to be discharged is the  lack of social protections and dissatisfaction with material  status--38.8 of those polled. Another 33.6 percent explain their  decision by the decline in prestige of military service, 11.21  percent by its lack of prospects, and 7.76 percent by negative  phenomena in the army and society.    Study of the readiness of graduates of Air Forces academies  for service has confirmed that one of the main components of  this concept, complex in composition, is the  military-professional thrust of the officer. It is expressed in  the high significance of military affairs for him and the  military specialty he has selected, as well as in the level and  pattern of his official aspirations. All changes in this thrust  most naturally have an effect on the state of professional  readiness. The data cited make it possible to conclude that a  reduction in military-professional thrust is being observed in  some of the graduates of Air Forces academies. The negative  consequences of this process are obvious.    The principal contradictions, among those affecting the  formulation of the professional readiness of the officer, are  manifested between the constantly increasing demands on the  officer corps and the not clearly expressed desire to conform to  them; the need to protect the Fatherland and the low social  status of the officer in society and lack of social protections;  and, the desire to improve knowledge and skills and the presence  of various types of regimentation.    Sociological analysis makes it possible to determine the  areas of work that will be able to provide for the resolution of  these discrepancies in the future, and to formulate some  recommendations.    It seems expedient, then, to alter the system of selection  both for all types of military-training institutions (including  the military academies) and for assignment to positions. The  principal criteria should become the level of  military-professional thrust, the individual capabilities and  features, the overall development of the intellect and the level  of specialization attained. This would make it possible, with  the scientifically substantiated organization of selection, to  avoid subjectivism in the resolution of personnel issues and to  eliminate protectionism. We do not yet have at our disposal  reliable, comprehensive techniques that would make it possible  to accomplish these tasks. But they do not exist only because  they have not yet been in demand. The combined efforts of  various specialists, with the corresponding social demand, will  provide an opportunity to develop the necessary techniques in a  relatively short time.    It would be expedient, on an organizational plane, to  individualize the process of professional training for the  officer, with the aim of making fuller use of individual  capabilities, abilities and characteristics. The content of  training should be as close as possible to the practices of  military activity; this requires, on the one hand, an  optimization of existing forms and methods of training and, on  the other, substantial changes in the theoretical and practical  training of instructors. A modern physical plant and the  development of a system of incentives, along with changes in the  methodological support for the teaching process, deserve  particular attention.    The solution of the problems of social and legal protections  for officers (and all servicemen!) and their provision with  acceptable material conditions seems very important. If the  state needs today's military professionals, it should provide  full-fledged solutions to these problems. Otherwise, the outflow  of more than the worst personnel from the army in the very near  future will lead objectively to a clear reduction in the level  of professional readiness of the officers, which could call into  question not only the practice of military reform, but even the  very idea of it.    It seems obvious that the comprehensive realization of the  above recommendations is an essential condition of their  utilization for the attainment of positive results. That is  because incomplete work or omissions in any of the three areas  noted will make it impossible to achieve the desired  effectiveness in the training of cadres for the new Russian Army.    From the Editors. The sociological research  whose data have been employed by the author was conducted in the  summer of 1992. The economic situation and the problems  connected with it have scarcely become less acute since that  time. Military reform, however, is proceeding. Thanks to the  adoption of a series of legislation, and first and foremost the  Law on the Status of Servicemen and the Law on Pension Support  for Servicemen, the situation has obviously changed. We will  acquaint the readers in coming features with how the mood of Air  Forces cadres is changing in the course of military reform, and  how the greater social and legal certainty of the status of the  officer in society is affecting them.

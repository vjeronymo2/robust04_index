Will Baghdad find a Normandy to make a flank breakthrough of  the oil embargo?    Observers here noted that Iraq's latest move signaled a new  strategy in its anti-sanction drive, namely, to open a flank  battlefield outside the U.N. resolutions framework by selling  oil profits to certain states in private.    When U.S. President Bill Clinton took office at the White  House in January 1993, Iraq changed its early post-Gulf-war  policy toward the U.N. which was characterized by passive  cooperation and positive resistance, pinning great hope on the  new commander-in-chief of the pro-sanction coalition.    However, Iraq turned back to the U.N. again following the  U.S. missile attack against Baghdad in June and adopted a new  policy of "weapons for oil." As a result, the country in  November accepted U.N. Resolution 715 which calls for long-term  monitoring of Iraq's weapons industries.    While asserting its full compliance with all relevant U.N.  resolutions, in particular Resolution 687, Iraq has been  launching a campaign to press for a U.N. commitment to Article  22 by closing the chapter of weapons destruction and monitoring  and opening a new one to allow Iraqi oil exports.    The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with the  weapons  issues, however, answered that there are still doubts about  Iraq's weapons-related information and that an observation of  the monitoring mechanism was a must for an indefinite period.    In addition, the U.S. and its Western allies tried to attach  to the precondition for lifting the sanctions Iraq's recognition  of Kuwait's sovereignty and boundary and resolving the issues of  the Kurds and Shiite Moslems.    Disappointed at the futility of its sacrifice in the main  battle field, Iraq began earlier this year shifting its focus to  a flank battlefield in an effort to break the sanctions, which  are pushing Iraq to an endless abyss. It resumed oil sales to  certain ex-partners.    Observers said that such an action is well based on Iraq's  abundant oil reserves and on the contradictions between the  anti-Iraq coalition members.    The basic reason for maintaining the sanctions is not Iraq's  failure in fully compliance with the U.N. resolutions, but the  West countries' failure in compelling Baghdad to guarantee their  post- sanction interests in the Gulf region and particularly in  Iraq, which possesses the second largest oil reserves in the  world.    The United States, which has gained great profits from the  oil-rich Gulf states since the 1991 Gulf war, is facing  ever-increasing economic conflicts with the West European  countries, which are not content with their status quo in the  Gulf.    In fact, the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy,  Japan, South Korea and others have never stopped their secret  deals with Iraq, each planning to gain great profits from the  post-sanction Iraqi oil exports and economic reconstruction.    Choosing France, whose oil imports from Iraq after the  sanctions accounted for one-third of its total, as the Normandy  for opening the second battlefield, Iraq hoped to lure more to  follow and finally disintegrate the pro-sanction coalition.    Iraq's strategy is to take concerted actions in both  battlefields.    If it succeeds in the flank battlefield, the U.N. sanctions  will collapse automatically, if not, the potential benefit  gainers will intercede for an early lifting of the sanctions  against Iraq.    On the other hand, Iraq has also enhanced its efforts in the  main battlefield.    Iraqi President Saddam Husayn Sunday [13 March] called for  an  immediate lifting of the sanctions or Iraq will end them on its  own. Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Riyad al-Qaysi is on a  mission to Russia, China, France and other members of the  Security Council. And Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz is  expected to hold Tuesday a new round of talks with UNSCOM  chairman Rolf Ekeus on ending the sanctions.    However, the U.S. will not allow an easy flank breakthrough  of the sanctions to happen in the near future. It will  coordinate its stance with the West European allies to guarantee  their long-term interests in Iraq and the Gulf region at large.    Moreover, Iraq's Gulf neighbors will inevitably stand in the  way of an early lifting of the sanctions, not only because the  potential threat to their safety has not been eradicated, but  also because Iraq's re-entry into the oil market will reduce  their profits.    It can be predicted that Iraq still has a difficult way  ahead.</p>

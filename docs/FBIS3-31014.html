			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- The parliament of the  Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna has decided that the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be a union  of three constituent nations enjoying the same rights.    The Bosnian Croats' constitutional rights and right of  self-determination can be exercised through the Bosnian Croat  Republic of Herceg-Bosna in a union of three republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, provided that the right is observed of the  other two constituent nations, Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, to  have their own republics based on the same principles -- says a  declaration adopted by 400 participants in the parliament  session of the Bosnian Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna late on  Tuesday.    According to this document, Mostar, the largest town in the  Herzegovina region and its administrative centre, in which  pitched battles are being fought between Bosnian Croat and  Bosnian Moslem troops, is to be the capital of the Bosnian Croat  Republic of Herceg-Bosna and 'an indivisible urban entity.'    The participants in the parliament session held in Livno, a  town in western Herzegovina, have supported Franjo Tudjman's  policy i.e. his 'peace initiative,' in particular the agreement  on the normalization of relations between Croatia and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia signed within the international  conference on the former Yugoslavia in Geneva last month.</p>

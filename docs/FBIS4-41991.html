			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "FBI Is Ready To Take on </F> Russian Mafia"]    [Text] Washington -- FBI Director Louis Freeh will spend  the coming week in a number of Central and East European  countries. Naturally, he is also visiting Moscow. He cannot  fail to visit Moscow. Because the main topic of his visit is  "Russian crime."    In this instance you cannot avoid using inverted commas.  "Russian crime" is just a term. Its meaning is broader than the  words which reflect the phenomenon. Russian crime does not mean  crime in Russia. Nor does it mean crime committed by Russians.  It does not even mean crime which has carved out a niche for  itself in Russia.    The topic of the visit by L. Freeh and five other ranking  representatives of the Department of State, the Drug Enforcement  Administration, and the Department of the Treasury will be the  peculiar status of organized crime in the world, which has now  become a fact of life following the collapse of the communist  system.  <H5>  Everything Can Be Bought </H5>   "The Criminal World," a book published recently by Claire  Sterling, a journalist specializing in organized crime, recounts  that, a few hours after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November  1989, Giovanni Tanomento, a well-known Sicilian mafioso who was  living in (West) Berlin at the time, received an instruction  from his bosses to immediately go on a buying spree in East  Berlin. "What exactly should I buy?", the mafioso asked in  amazement. His boss replied: "Everything. Restaurants,  discotheques, pizzerias, everything."    Judging by initial results, the end of the Cold War was a  boon not so much for capitalism, democracy, and the  market-oriented economy as for organized crime. In a world of  crumbling authority, in a world where people without money,  capital, or assets either owned or temporarily controlled  immense amounts of wealth on a quite tenuous basis, in this  world of chaos and disorganization there has proved to be no  more organized force than crime.    The wholesale arrival of democracy and the weakening or  disappearance of carefully guarded national borders has  facilitated the international activities of criminal structures  to an even greater degree. It become apparent at the recent  U.S. Senate hearings from evidence given by leaders of the FBI,  Germany's criminal investigation police, and the Russian  Ministry of Internal Affairs that the upsurge in organized  postcommunist crime has caught everyone unawares. Many experts  believe that the pooling of resources and finances by Sicilian  godfathers, Colombian drug barons, Japanese "Yakuza" gangsters,  and Russian gangs could turn the world into a nightmare compared  to which "teetering on the brink of nuclear war" would seem like  a transient problem.    Recent history provides several examples of organized crime  subsuming whole states. At the U.S. Senate hearings, M.  Yegorov, Russian deputy internal affairs minister, repeatedly  answered questions on whether criminals could reach the very  highest levels of the Russian administration. The general from  the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not deny the possibility  that organized crime could place its own protege in the Duma or  the Federation Council, but he assured the senators that for the  foreseeable future the Kremlin was out of the criminals' reach.    In the opinion of C. Sterling, whose book "The Criminal  World" we have already cited, Russia has become "the world  capital of organized crime." Without denying this threat, the  FBI director described such views as "exaggerated and unfounded"  at a news conference just before his departure.  <H5>  He Did Not Read the Decrees [Dekrety] </H5>   The FBI director refused to comment on Russian President  B.N.  Yeltsin's recent decree on urgent measures to combat crime.  Journalists asked L. Freeh whether this decree, with all its  major restrictions on citizens' civil rights, would really be  useful in overcoming organized crime. The director preferred to  answer that he had not had time to read the decree.    I have reason to believe that the text of the decree has  been  made available to the FBI leadership. It is likely that L.  Freeh preferred not to complicate relations with his hosts on  the eve of his important visit.    On 4 July, Independence Day, one of the most important and  solemn U.S. public holidays, Louis Freeh will open an official  FBI mission in Moscow. It will not be a purely representative  mission. A considerable number of Russian nouveaux riches,  happy and shameless possessors of dirty millions, are laundering  their money in America or through banking structures directly  linked to America. Russian law enforcement organs do not have  access to bank secrets in the West and are unlikely to have such  access in the future. The FBI has far wider powers.    The FBI's Moscow bureau will enable rapid communications to  be established between the two countries' police forces, as well  as ensuring that mutual assistance can be offered. At his news  conference, the director clearly intimated that he regards the  possibilities as limitless, but much will depend on how  day-to-day work progresses, how far the two sides can trust each  other, and how noticeable the results are.    The second objective of the trip, the program for which  includes visits to Ukraine and Belarus, and also Poland, the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, will be helping to  coordinate these countries' police services. Once fairly close,  the relations between East European states in this sphere have  degenerated into exclusivity and mutual mistrust literally  within a matter of months. L. Freeh hopes that it will be  possible to restore the professional contacts which are very  important in the struggle against organized crime. To this end  the United States is planning joint courses for the police  forces of East Europe.    Many experts consider it fortunate for the international  community that criminal groups are by nature not inclined to  coordinate their activities, they are characterized by an  insurmountable urge to delineate zones of influence. It is no  surprise that, following the collapse of communism, old criminal  structures are being squeezed out by new, more brutal, and more  aggressive structures.    During the visit the U.S. delegation will suggest to its  East  European partners that they exploit this fact by establishing a  computerized data base. This information will have to be  protected from criminal groups which in many countries have  their own network of paid agents in the police, the courts, and  Prosecutor's Offices.  <H5>  Everything Is Still in the Future </H5>   As a representative of the country which has the longest  (and  possibly the most successful) record of combating organized  crime, L. Freeh warned against unrealistic hopes. He said it  would probably never be possible to defeat mafia structures on a  national and international scale once and for all. The task was  to drive organized crime into a corner, deprive it of its  international scope, and severely restrict its potential to move  funds around.</p>

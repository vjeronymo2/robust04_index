			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS SAN PEDRO REZONING PROPOSAL;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: MEASURE THAT WOULD EXCLUDE APARTMENT AND CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENT  FROM OLD SAN PEDRO IS REJECTED.  </P> <P> A San Pedro citizens committee Wednesday night approved a detailed rezoning  proposal, ending for now debate on the most contested section of a long-awaited  community plan.  </P> <P> The proposal, which downzones much of the community, is largely the same as the  one presented in January to the San Pedro Community Plan Advisory Committee by  its zoning subcommittee.  </P> <P> The committee rejected an amendment that would have excluded apartment and  condominium development from the Old San Pedro area. That issue had caused  angry exchanges between committee members at a meeting last month.  </P> <P> In approving the plan -- based on a block-by-block review of the seaside  community's zoning -- the committee limited comment among members and the  public on specifics of the proposal, acknowledging that its decisions are not  set in stone.  </P> <P> "As (Ulysses S.) Grant said, 'I am prepared to fight this out all winter,' "  said Noah Modisett, chairman of the advisory committee. "But we all know this  is going to be changed, and we need to move ahead."  </P> <P> When the community plan is finished -- including a proposed historic zone and a  specific plan for the downtown business area -- it will go to Councilwoman Joan  Milke Flores and then to the Planning Department, which must hold public  hearings.  </P> <P> The limited debate at Wednesday's session was considerably toned down from the  contentiousness in San Pedro about these issues, which include preserving  historic homes, encouraging construction of low-cost senior housing and saving  the Barton Hill area for low-income residents.  </P> <P> Many residents and committee members backed off previous hard-line positions on  those issues after Modisett passed around a letter from a city planner praising  the committee's work.  </P> <P> "The important fact is that your committee has given us a good point to start  this process," wrote Don K. Taylor of the Planning Department. "The proposal  must still go through a long public hearing process. The decision will  eventually be made by the City Council. You should expect that even your best  proposals may be subject to modification as we hear from the public during this  process."  </P> <P> The committee was appointed by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores in 1988 to help  guide future growth in an area of Los Angeles that has undergone dramatic  growth and development in the past decade.  </P> <P> Zoning recommendations approved Wednesday include:  </P> <P> Permitting developers in most of Old San Pedro -- the neighborhood that runs  from 10th to 21st streets between Palos Verdes Street and Pacific Avenue -- to  build three units on a lot, subject to "certain design standards to be  established by the committee."  </P> <P> Substantially increasing the density allowed on the block bounded by 8th, 9th,  Centre and Mesa streets, but "only if the property is developed for senior  citizens."  </P> <P> Zoning Rancho San Pedro, a city-owned, low-income housing project, for  single-family housing as a way of preserving the project. Any other type of  development would be subject to a public hearing process. It is now zoned  mostly for duplexes.  </P> <P> Allowing commercial and manufacturing development on Harbor Boulevard from 3rd  Street north to the Harbor Freeway on-ramp to discourage development of housing  there.  </P> <P> The committee, in a 12-5 vote, defeated an amendment to the plan that would  have virtually excluded development of anything but single-family homes in the  Old San Pedro area after nearly an hour of discussion.  </P> <P> Committee member Doug Shepardson proposed the amendment last month, saying  single-family zoning would encourage the preservation of older houses. He said  that under the recommendations accepted Wednesday night, it would be more  profitable for developers to raze older homes for apartments and condominiums.  In recent years, hundreds of old homes have been torn down by developers  attracted to the area by soaring land values.  </P> <P> Opponents of the amendment argued that many older houses in the area are  dilapidated, and said new, controlled development of condominiums would be the  best way to improve the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Despite the amendment's defeat, most preservation advocates cautiously endorsed  a wording change that ensures the committee will determine design and setback  restrictions for any condominium development in the area.  </P> <P> In addition, some preservationists found a grain of victory in the defeat  because some of the amendment's opponents had begun to speak openly of the  importance of preserving single-family homes in San Pedro.  </P> <P> "Now they are all talking about historic preservation. There is a definite  change in the tone of this committee," said Bill Manuel, a local lawyer and  preservation advocate. "That's a victory of sorts."  </P> <P> Preservationists hope to create a historic preservation zone in Old San Pedro  to set architectural and landscaping requirements for the area. Manuel, who is  chairman of the historic preservation subcommittee, will present  recommendations for the establishment of the historic zone at the committee's  April meeting.  </P> <P> Though the committee seemed content to approve the entire zoning plan in the  interest of moving forward, some members said the proposal to downzone the  Barton Hill neighborhood to allow only single-family homes could push out  lower-income residents.  </P> <P> "If we change the zoning in that neighborhood (to allow only single-family  homes), we will gentrify the area. We will place people who live there out of  the market so they cannot live there," said committee member Armando Sanchez.  </P> <P> Sanchez said the proposed change could prevent the residents in the mostly  Latino area from building rental units on their property, which they do to  supplement their income, and said it would also encourage its "yuppification."  </P> <P> "We don't want to change the . . . area so much that we don't recognize it 20  years from now," said Barton Hill resident Nadine Janisee.  </P> <P> But Leron Gubler, chairman of the zoning subcommittee and executive director of  the Chamber of Commerce, said the proposed zoning changes would protect the  Barton Hill area because it would trigger a public hearing process for any  multiunit development.  </P> <P> Having put the hotly contested zoning questions behind it, the advisory  committee will meet again in April to take up discussion of the Historic  Preservation Overlay Zone and other issues.  </P></p>

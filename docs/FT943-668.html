			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Sears The diversity of Sears' interests arguably helps insulate the group from the full severity of a downturn in individual segments of the retail market. But, as yesterday's interim results show, the range of the group's activities also has the unfortunate effect of muffling the impact of recovery. The figures showed unequivocal evidence of earnings momentum in at least three main businesses, namely footwear, mail order and Selfridges. Results from all three reflected the successful implementation of well thought-out measures to cut costs, enhance systems and boost sales by revamping store formats. Elsewhere things went wrong. The two black spots were the Adams childrenswear chain and the Olympus sports shops. The decline at Olympus can be blamed on testing conditions in sports footwear, but Adams suffered from trying to change too much too quickly. There is much to hope for at Sears. Margins, which were 6 per cent last year, are still a long way below the 10 per cent which the management believes is achievable. The rolling out of new formats in footwear and the Selfridges' revamp will certainly help narrow the gap. But Adams' problems, the worst of which have now been dealt with, highlight the lack of focus inherent in so broadly diversified a group. This is especially so within the loose agglomeration of businesses grouped under the High Street Fashion heading. Based on consensus forecasts, the group will make pre-tax profits of Pounds 145m-150m this year, putting the shares on a small premium to the market. Given that the group's current low tax charge is rising, the rating looks demanding.</p>

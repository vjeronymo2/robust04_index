			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Your problems are also our problems: With these  words, Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup today ended his  lecture at the Latvian National Defense Academy. He also ends  his visit to Latvia today.    In the lecture at the National Defense Academy, the Danish  defense minister was explaining resolutions that will probably  be passed at the summit meeting of the NATO member states in  Brussels on 10 January. At the end of his lecture, Haekkerup  promised that Denmark would also be granting to Latvia all kinds  of assistance in the future.    Haekkerup also held a news conference this morning about his  visit to Kurzeme province yesterday. He visited the Russian  military facility--the Skrunda radar station and the 45th  Kuldiga battalion of the Latvian Home Guard. Haekkerup stressed  that the radar station should not be left in Latvia and that the  dismantling of the radar should be agreed on at Latvian-Russian  talks. Haekkerup also positively assessed the Latvian Home Guard.</p>

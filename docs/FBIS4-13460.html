			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kuwait, 21 Apr -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first  deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, has  stressed that there are no political parties in Kuwait and that  the establishment of parties would not be allowed there.    In an interview with AL-ANBA today, Shaykh Sabah said that  the new government had not been chosen to represent any  particular trend or orientation, but had been chosen from all  the sons of Kuwait.    He added that what distinguishes Kuwait is that all its sons  belong to one family and there is no discrimination or  preference for any of its sons over any other except on the  basis of his abilities and aptitudes.    Al-Sabah said that even if their opinions differ on some  matters, the opinions of all Kuwaitis ultimately serve the  interest of Kuwait.    He said that the new government faces the challenges of  implementing the law and extending the rule of law, and will not  be a government of challenges to persons or trends as some  people are saying.

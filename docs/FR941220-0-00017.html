			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 409.43(c) requires only that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan of care be signed by a physician who meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification and recertification requirements of &sect;424.22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the bill for services is submitted. This requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively precludes from signing the plan of care a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician who has a significant ownership interest in, or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant financial or contractual relationship with, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHA. We do not believe that this requirement restricts the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability of HHA patients to receive care from multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that &sect;409.43(d) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to clarify that oral (verbal) orders must be signed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dated by a registered nurse or qualified therapist but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need not actually be transcribed by them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that it would be allowable for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated member of the HHA staff to receive oral orders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the phone as long as the orders are reviewed, signed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dated with the date of receipt by a registered nurse or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified therapist before the services are furnished. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have revised paragraph (d) to require that the ``orders must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be put in writing and be signed and dated with the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt by the registered nurse or qualified therapist (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in &sect;484.4 of this chapter) responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnishing or supervising the ordered services.'' This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision closely reflects the current policy governing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of oral orders in the hospital setting (see 42 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 482.23(c)(2)). It is also important to note that other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal or State laws or regulations may restrict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel allowed to receive oral orders. To ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency with the Medicare HHA conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, we have also revised &sect;484.18(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be required to sign the oral order before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bill for services is submitted to the intermediary. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters complained that physicians are slow to sign these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders in a timely manner because they have no motivation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have not revised this requirement. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a longstanding Medicare requirement that is intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that the HHA obtains the physician's signature on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oral orders (which confirms that the services were furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a physician's order) in a timely manner. We believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the removal of this requirement would ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither the physician nor the HHA have any motivation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain the physician's signature in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked for clarification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a plan of care or oral order may be transmitted by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facsimile machine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Yes. The plan of care or oral order may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitted by facsimile machine. However, the hard copy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the order with the original signature must be retained and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made available to the intermediary, State surveyor, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized personnel upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that we allow the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer-generated ``alternative signatures'' for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician's signature on the plan of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not believe that this rule is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate place to establish criteria for the acceptance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of computer-generated alternative signatures. However, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do generally support the use of this technology and intend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make revisions to the Medicare HHA and Intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manuals to specify the conditions under which these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signatures may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be required to review the plan of care at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every 62 days. The commenter believed that some patients'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for care can be predicted for more than 62 days, and so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the physician's review should only be required when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have not accepted this comment. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that requiring the physician's review of the plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care at least once every 62 days protects patient health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety by ensuring a minimum level of physician oversight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it is true that some patients' needs for services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are relatively stable, this requirement ensures regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician review of all patients' care and minimizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chance of a patient receiving long periods of inappropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or ineffective care. This requirement is also intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinate with similar physician review requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in &sect;&sect;424.22 and 484.18, thus allowing the HHA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the requirements of three regulations with a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the plan of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be terminated just because a beneficiary does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive at least one covered skilled service in a 62 day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in this rule, a beneficiary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be in need of either intermittent skilled nursing care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuing occupational therapy to qualify for Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage of home health services. If the physician's plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of care does not order any of these services, we presume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the beneficiary no longer needs any of these skilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services and therefore does not qualify for Medicare home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health coverage. However, we understand that some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals need skilled care at intervals of more than 62  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days and so therefore allow coverage of services furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to beneficiaries who do not require at least one qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled service in a 62 day period if the physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents that such an interval without skilled care is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to the treatment of the beneficiary's illness or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury. We do not agree that the beneficiary should be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to continue to receive nonskilled services indefinitely when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is no documented need for a skilled service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Skilled Service Requirements (&sect;409.44)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that the statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the preamble of the proposed rule regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessity of basing coverage decisions on objective clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence should be included in the text of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. We have added a new paragraph (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to &sect;409.44 (and redesignated subsequent paragraphs) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include this general statement concerning coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations. We also believe it is important to note  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this principle has been explicitly stated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare HHA Manual as Medicare policy since 1989 and so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not represent a change in the current process of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare coverage determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

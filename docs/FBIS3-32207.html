			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Itamar Franco by Jose Bastos </F> Moreno in Brasilia; date not given]    [Text] [Moreno] What are the main characteristics of Itamar  Franco's administration?    [Franco] An atmosphere of freedom reigns in the country. The  government has given free rein to the press, which criticizes  and does as it pleases because I have always believed that life  looses all meaning without freedom and that mankind will be  unable to find peace without justice.    [Moreno] There is a tug-of-war between the government and  Congress over the passing of the economic plan. Is there any  risk that Congress may reject this plan?    [Franco] I invited the presidents of both chambers of  Congress and gave each of them a letter. Governability is not  the sole responsibility of the executive branch. It is shared  by Congress and the judicial branch. The government is doing  its share. Never in contemporary history has a president of the  Republic given so much support to a finance minister. Never in  contemporary history have we seen a finance minister appear  before Congress so many times to debate and discuss matters.  His plan may be amended and he may agree with these amendments.  We have established a democratic dialogue with Congress through  the finance minister. What has Brazil seen so far? It has seen  many economic plans implemented without the knowledge of  Congress. Plans were implemented overnight without congressmen  being able to even voice an opinion. We are now doing the  opposite -- the government holds talks, backs off, moves  forward. We currently want Congress to express its opinion on  the economic program. If it considers it a good plan, then let  it pass it. If Congress considers it a bad plan, let it then  specify what is the best plan for our country. The vote of  congressmen should not be based on political considerations  because it is a presidential year and the [finance] minister may  or may not run for the presidency. Brazilians are not  interested in this. They are interested in whether the program  submitted to Congress can curb inflation.    [Moreno] Isn't it a contradiction that Congress increased  taxes on individuals and not on companies?    [Franco] That was really most unfair. It was a relatively  insignificant act and yet it affected the political situation.  It caused the government's plan to become somewhat -- the  expression is popular but to the point -- crippled. It was  unfair from a social standpoint. This injustice will have to be  compensated during the next congressional stage on the measures  the government wants Congress to pass.    [Moreno] The workers want an audience with you, Mr.  President, to ask you to veto this tax increase. Will you veto  it?    [Franco] I granted an audience to Mr. Medeiros (Labor Force  President Luiz Antonio de Medeiros) to whom I showed the letter  I sent to Congress. We discussed that injustice not long ago.  If they come to see me, I will have to get the finance minister  to examine the consequences of the workers request on the  economic program. If he considers they may be improved, we can  retrace our steps. Ours is a democratic government and we can  either go forward or backwards. But -- and let us be very clear  -- changing our ideas will, to a large extent, depend on the  finance minister. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the  income bracket affected by the tax increase is not that of  workers. Workers will not be affected. If workers come to see  me they will have to explain which workers have been affected.  The low income bracket is not affected.    [Moreno] Most of your former ministers failed to vote on  the issue. Did this upset you?    [Franco] They must have had their reasons. They do not have  to explain their reasons to me. My former ministers and former  congressional colleagues must explain to the Brazilian public.  They may have had some sort of a problem. I cannot believe,  after being a minister of this administration for more than 15  months, how a congressman could fail to attend a session in  which issues of such importance for the government would be  voted on. There must have been some reason. I will not call  for explanations. It is up to the public to question these  congressmen.    [Moreno] Some former ministers, however, are already  covertly  criticizing your administration. One of them has even said your  administration has no face.    [Franco] I ask the Brazilian people: How can a minister who  worked with the president of the Republic for 15 months and had  the president's full support during these 15 months begin to  think, after only 30 days, that the government has no face? Has  the government lost its face during these 30 days or is the  minister losing his face? Criticism must be made clearly,  openly. The press permanently states that my administration is  weak. In what sense? Does the press want me invert the  institutional order? Does it want the president to adopt  authoritarian measures? Does it want to see the president  govern the country without the Congress, without the judicial  branch? What is the administration's weakness? Is being  democratic a weakness? As Otavio Mangabeira [former foreign  minister from 1926 to 1930] used to say, democracy is a frail  plant. Our democracy is still a frail plant. We are obeying  the principles of democracy, which we might very well quote  here: Without liberty there is no reason to live and without  meeting the demands of justice men will never achieve peace.    [Moreno] From your tone we can perceive that this criticism  affected you most.    [Franco] I just ask: What is the government's weakness? The  government has an economic plan. It supports its finance  minister and has been supporting other ministers. Where is the  government's weakness? In the fact of having an earnestly  democratic president? Some would like to see the democratic  order inverted. Others would like to see the government disrupt  the structure of Brazilian parties. Should we disrupt it the  way others did here in South America?    [Moreno] Perhaps, Mr. President, the idea of a weak  government is associated with your precarious support in  Congress. So far you have not achieved a solid majority or even  a circumstantial majority to approve basic bills.    [Franco] That has a certain logic, but I ask: Do political  parties have a strong structure? Often we see that political  parties have internal problems and some times very strong  confrontations. Today Brazilian political parties are fragile.  How was the government formed? The nation was paralyzed in  amazement and submerged in discouragement and a rebellious  feeling. We had to coordinate fragmented forces to form a  government. Parties represented in the government turned  against the government. In a parliamentary system the cabinet  would have fallen as a consequence of the crisis in Congress.  Ministers in the government represent political parties. They  stopped being named by their political parties as of 15  December, but they were until then.    [Moreno] Political parties argue that a group of personal  friends from Juiz de Fora [Franco's home town] run the show.    [Franco] What group from Juiz de Fora? We have people from  Juiz de Fora here, but what power center from Juiz de Fora are  they talking about? Such a power center does not exist. On the  contrary, the people from Juiz de Fora at the Planalto Palace do  not participate in the high-level discussions on the country's  problems. Here we discuss problems with Senator Pedro Simon and  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. We used to discuss them  with Deputy Antonio Britto and today we talk about them with  government leader Luiz Carlos Santos. We operate that way. Or  is the criticism moved by the feeling that the president is a  man from a country town and, therefore, he cannot govern the  country? Is it because a man from the provinces cannot rule the  country? Is it that only powerful men can become president?    [Moreno] Do you feel the closeness of the presidential  election might affect your government? Criticism against you  increases as the elections get nearer.    [Franco] The time has come for those who criticize the  government to present their candidates for the presidency of the  Republic. They are all party members. They will have a great  opportunity to solve the country's problems. Let us see if they  have the courage to face the public. I would like to see them  in public squares, at the elections, discussing issues with the  public. I hope they will have the courage to face the public,  but not as candidates for deputy or senator, I want to see them  as presidential candidates. I am very interested to see who  will be the candidates for the presidency of the Republic. I  want to know about those who continuously say that they know how  to solve the country's problems, that national problems are  easily solved, and that they are not solved only because the  government is weak, because Mr. Itamar Franco is not prepared  for the presidency. If they are so wise and so prepared they  should not hide behind a candidacy to the Senate or the Chamber  of Deputies. I take advantage of the opportunity to call on  them to step forward, now is the right time to do it.    [Moreno] Will you support any candidate?    [Franco] For the time being, the government has no  candidate.    [Moreno] It has been said that you have two candidates:  Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Antonio Britto.    [Franco] They are two great names, but I am not saying they  will be our candidates.    [Moreno] Will you stay out of the succession process?    [Franco] I do not know. We will look at the candidates. I  need to know who the candidates are. If you are asking if  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is a candidate, my  answer is: I do not know if he is candidate. He has not yet  discussed that with me. He merely sent me a letter to inform me  that at this moment he is not thinking about becoming a  candidate. I do not know if tomorrow he will decide to be a  candidate.    [Moreno] Is it true that you are becoming impatient about  Cardoso's failure to produce tangible results in his fight  against inflation?    [Franco] Never before has a finance minister had so much  support from the president of the Republic. I am giving him my  full support because I believe in his work and in his desire to  serve his country.    [Moreno] What are you planning to do after completing your  term in office?    [Franco] I will go back to my life as an ordinary citizen. I  do not plan to seek any elective office any more. Many people  want me to resign in April so that I will be eligible to run for  governor of Minas Gerais State, but I have declined. I will not  deny that it has always been my dream to become governor of  Minas Gerais. I was unfortunately defeated in the ballot boxes.  I did, however, serve several congressional terms for Minas  Gerais. I want to become an ordinary citizen again. I have  asked God not to let power get to my head. Power is a temporary  thing. While in office one may acquire a false notion of power.  Your entourage will desert you as soon as you leave office.  All I want to be is a voter.    [Moreno] Did you get excited about the proposed idea to  allow  the incumbent president to seek his reelection without having to  leave office?    [Franco] I do not want to interfere in the constitutional  revision process by raising this issue, but I will say that it  is not a tradition in Brazil to reelect presidents or governors.    [Moreno] What is your opinion about the efforts of your  friend [Senate government leader] Pedro Simon in bringing the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party], PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and PTB  [Brazilian Labor Party] together to support a single candidate?    [Franco] I do not see it as an easy undertaking now. It  would have been easier before when two forces like the PMDB and  PSDB were united. The PSDB branched out of the PMDB. I see it  difficult now. But I am not saying they could not get together  for the presidential election. All this will depend on the  patriotic spirit of each sector. [Late PMDB Deputy] Ulysses  Guimaraes managed to bring Tancredo Neves' Popular Party  together with the PMDB.    [Moreno] Have you already been tempted to seek undemocratic  solutions?    [Franco] I wouldn't say tempted. I have received many  letters and petitions urging me to do so.    [Moreno] From important sectors of society?    [Franco] From various sectors. I have never been tempted to  do that because I am a democrat.</p>

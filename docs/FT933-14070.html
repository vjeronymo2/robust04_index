			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Turkey outlaws pro-Kurds party: Prospects shrink of negotiations with rebels TURKEY'S constitutional court has outlawed the Kurdish-backed People's Labour party (HEP), ending the possibility of informal dialogue with the rebel Kurdish Workers party (PKK). The court move came at the end of a week of intense consultations between the government and political parties to find a common stance on the Kurdish rebellion. The judgment coincides with violent clashes in the Kurdish south-east where security forces are stepping up operations against PKK rebels fighting a nine-year campaign for Kurdish independence. The 18 HEP deputies elected in 1991 formed a new party last week, pre-empting the court decision.  Nonetheless, the court move also calls for the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity for Mr Fehmi Isiklar, the respected former chairman of HEP who could now face serious charges related to party activities. The HEP is the nearest thing to an explicitly Kurdish nationalist party and is popularly seen as a PKK front - a charge some HEP deputies have not been too anxious to contest. The ruling is likely to be exploited by Kurdish hardliners as well as politicians and those in the Turkish military who view any lifting of restrictions on Kurdish television and newspapers as concessions to terrorism.</p>

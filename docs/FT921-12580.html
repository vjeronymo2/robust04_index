			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Polo passions split a village: The 'foreigner' whose plans have caused outrage LIFE IN the village of Shiplake, on the river Thames between Reading and Henley, west of London, might appear almost as serene and uneventful as it was in 1850 when Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the poet, married Emily Smallwood in the village church and wrote about the Thames along the silent level/Streaming thro' his osier'd aits. It is shaped by the seasons on the river. High summer brings the ceaseless motions of boats: sleek gross cruisers, polished skiffs, stumpy launches and sturdy punts. Come autumn and winter, the boathouses are closed, the craft disappear. A silent, clammy chill settles on the water. Scratch Shiplake's surface, though, and strong passions are revealed. Tension seethes, antipathies flourish. Two volatile elements are at the heart of the trouble: a foreigner - and a sport. Between them, they have fractured the village's cherished tranquillity. The sport is polo, a game favoured by the well-born - and unusual for being played at the highest level by people whose chief qualification often is not talent, but wealth. Imagine that John Paul Getty, having endowed a new stand at Lord's, should open the batting against Australia. It is only a little less odd that one of the four players in one of the most formidable teams in English polo, the Ellerston Whites, should be its patron, Kerry Packer, reputedly Australia's richest man. Packer has bought his way into the game with a grandiose disregard for cost. His reward is to play with the best - for all that he is in his 50s with a near-fatal heart attack behind him. It is not Packer's performance on the field that interests the people of Shiplake, however. It is the subtle but determined way in which he was able to transform his estate at Stedham, 50 miles away in West Sussex, into a polo centre, in spite of fierce opposition - and with no more than a nod in the direction of the planning laws. Initially he told the local council that he was researching strains of hoof-resistant turf and, therefore, did not need planning permission. Eventually, the council tried to check his ambitions and battle was joined. Packer won. He was allowed to run his estate as a polo centre and, crucially, to stage official matches, although he was not allowed to put up grandstands or marquees, instal public address or television equipment, or land helicopters. Urs Schwarzenbach, a Swiss financier who owns one of Shiplake's grandest riverside houses, is another polo enthusiast. Like Packer, he has his own team, the Black Bears. And he, too, has ambitions for his property - more modest than those of the Australian, but equally contentious. In addition to his principal residence, Thamesside Court, Schwarzenbach owns two adjoining mansions as well as a farm which covers much of the open land along the river between Shiplake and Henley. He says he was bitten by the polo bug a few years ago. But it was only last year, when a massive construction programme began, that the nature of the infection began to dawn on his neighbours. It included digging a lake, levelling and sowing two playing fields, laying roads and building bridges, and erecting nearly 100 stables. What alarmed neighbours more than the noise and the dust of building, however, was that no planning permission had been sought. Schwarzenbach's view - was that what he did on his land was his business. Matters came to a head one Saturday last June when Schwarzenbach entertained his polo friends on a grand scale. A temporary stand appeared beside one of the pitches and a PA system announced itself. Mercedes, Rolls-Royces and Range Rovers towing horseboxes purred up the drives; helicopters descended; ;security men patrolled. 'This,' says the neighbour who leads the anti-Schwarzenbach movement, 'is what he calls 'sticking and balling' with a few chums. He has come here and is flouting our planning laws. I can't believe he would get away with it in Switzerland, and he's not going to in Shiplake.' The owners of the villas, bungalows and mock Tudor piles strung along the bank upstream of Schwarzenbach were, they say, ready and willing to welcome the newcomer. But they claim he has broken the rules and upset the even tenor of communal existence. Schwarzenbach himself remains resolutely in the shadows. Those who speak for him - architects, planning consultants, flooding experts, noise specialists and lawyers - have done their best to persuade local people that they have nothing to fear. Exhibitions have been staged and brochures circulated. The message is that velvet lawns, stables, avenues of newly-planted saplings, the distant sounds of cantering ponies and stick against ball represent a vast improvement on the unkempt, pick-your-own fruit farm and boat-building business that disfigured the land previously. Schwarzenbach also has promised repeatedly that he will not stage tournament matches but his neighbours remain sceptical, their suspicions fuelled by his application to build a helipad beside one of the polo fields. The South Oxfordshire District Council has now has issued enforcement notices requiring the dismantling of virtually all the polo-related works. Schwarzenbach has lodged appeals and applied for planning permission. All sides seem ready for a stern battle.</p>

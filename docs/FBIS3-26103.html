			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Pan Yue (3382 6460) and XINHUA </F> reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)]    [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- A national work  conference of nationalities affairs commissions was held in  Beijing today. The conference will relay and study the  guidelines of relevant central directives on improving  nationalities work in the new period, review the achievements  and experiences gained in recent years in this work, and study  and arrange this year's nationalities work.    Wang Guangying, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, and Wang Zhaoguo  attended  today's plenary session. Ismail Amat, state councillor and  concurrently minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission, delivered a report. He said: In recent  years, China has made continuous progress and scored great  success in nationalities work during the course of reform and  opening up. After the central nationalities work conference in  1992, various minority areas greatly expedited economic  construction, reform, and opening up, thereby making speedy  progress in economic construction. Township and town enterprises  in minority areas developed greatly with the assistance of  nationalities affairs departments at all levels. Poverty relief  efforts in those areas yielded notable results, releasing  approximately 250,000 people from poverty in two years.  Minority areas made tremendous headway in various social  services on the basis of economic development. The new type of  socialist relationship among various nationalities was further  consolidated and developed. People of all nationalities showed  an even deeper love of their united and multinational  motherland, and they worked even more conscientiously toward  rejuvenating the Chinese nation. Meanwhile, enormous progress  was made in instituting a legal system governing nationalities,  resulting in the enactment and implementation of many laws and  regulations in this regard. Relations among various  nationalities and work regarding nationalities are being  gradually written into laws.    Ismail Amat said emphatically: People engaged in  nationalities work should seriously study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm themselves with  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  seriously study new circumstances and problems encountered by  minority nationalities and minority areas in the course of  establishing a socialist market economic system, energetically  promote economic development, reform, and opening up in minority  areas, and constantly make new contributions to the unity and  progress of various nationalities.    Conferees included chairpersons of nationalities affairs  commissions of various provinces, autonomous regions,  municipalities directly under the central government, and cities  with independent decision-making power; leading comrades in  charge of work regarding nationalities from some provinces and  autonomous regions; and responsible comrades from relevant  departments under central state organs.</p>

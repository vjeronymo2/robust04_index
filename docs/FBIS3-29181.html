The following is a summary of his remarks. A  more detailed report of the interview will appear in the April  issue of the monthly THIS IS YOMIURI (on sale on 9 March).  <H5>  Future of Japan-U.S. Relations </H5>   [Oikawa] Japan and the United States failed to reach an  agreement at the latest summit talks due to a dispute over the  issue of numerical targets. For the first time, Japan clearly  said "no." How do you assess this unprecedented development?    [Ozawa] Changes in Japanese-U.S. relations are inevitable  amid the historical trend of searching for a new world order  after the collapse of the Cold War structure. As a nation which  has grown more independent, Japan finds itself in a difficult  position. From a position where it once enjoyed the safety and  comforts of the cradle, Japan must now act with responsibility  as a mature nation. I believe it was proper, in that sense, for  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to say that this cannot be  done, this is wrong, or that things are not yet ready.    However, this does not mean that saying "no" is all that  matters, although the popular sentiment seems to be that it  feels good to do so.    I am most concerned not about what happens to the economic  framework talks, but that it will be terrible if the  relationship of trust between Japan and the United States  disintegrates. If we are asked whether Japan, as a member of  the international community, is handling various issues,  including the domestic market and security, competently, the  truth is, we still cannot say with confidence that "Everything  is under control; we do not have to be told."    If the Americans think of us as saying "no" only when it  suits our purpose, and relying on others when we want to, then  the relationship of trust between the two countries will be  bankrupt.    [Sasaki] I think we have come to take on very heavy  responsibilities. Particularly economic issues. On the  surface, current issues resemble those during the bubble  economic boom in the 1980's, but actually, the position of both  countries and the environment have changed. I believe we were  able to negotiate in such a manner because the political regime  has changed.    [Ozawa] Although the coalition government has been termed a  precarious mosaic or glass work, it has more breadth than the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] administrations. The most  effective means to revitalize the economy is deregulation. It  is not good that we should be told by the United States to open  up our market. (This is) Japan's own problem. While there is a  need for regulations to protect the weak, too many regulations  dampen the sense of self-reliance on the part of both  enterprises and individuals, and there can be no notion of  taking responsibility for one's own actions.    [Oikawa] When it comes to deregulation, there is the problem  of the bureaucratic system. The bureaucrats were also an  obstacle during the time of (former) Prime Minister Yasuhiro  Nakasone. How will the exercise of political power change this?    [Ozawa] It is only natural for people to resist when what  they are used to doing is going to be changed. So my point is,  the resistance of bureaucrats is not a problem. If there is a  problem, this has to do with the people who live by the  regulations we have just mentioned. In the past, the  bureaucrats, and even the politicians, did not have to make  political decisions in the real sense under the Cold War  structure. Their only job was to draw up the budget, and  distribute the revenues equally.    On the whole, we followed the decision of the United States,  and it was enough just to agree. In that sense, it was not true  politics. The same was true for the bureaucrats, they  concentrated on trivial things like regulations and subsidies.  We would like the bureaucrats to use their heads for greater  political issues, such as Japan's role in the international  community.    [Sasaki] How do you look at the issue of the DPRK's  suspected development of nuclear arms taken up during the  Japan-U.S. summit talks?    [Ozawa] It is very significant that the leaders of Japan and  the United States reached basic agreement on the North Korean  issue. This might be the first time a Japanese prime minister  has made a clear statement. So far, we had remained ambiguous.  Japan should act properly in line with the agreement reached at  the summit meeting.    Pictures of Political Reorganization    [Oikawa] How would you reorganize the political world?  Prime Minister Hosokawa has pointed out the possibility of  reorganizing the political world during the current Diet session.    [Ozawa] I have the same view as the prime minister. I  somehow understand it because the plan to introduce 300  (single-seat constituencies) was proposed by the government  before. In this sense, I think (political reorganization) will  be made at considerably faster speed than what the mass media  are saying. I do not mean to say it is going to be a merger  only among the coalition parties or a course of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] alone. I have a feeling that the  coalition parties and the LDP will be involved in the  realignment.    [Sasaki] To some degree, the 1955 regime of Japanese  politics and the economic structure were inseparable. I would  like to ask you how we should change Japan's economic structure  and what kind of impact will the difference between those, who  are trying to keep the existing system, and others, who are  trying to make major changes to the existing system and thereby  allowing political power to take leadership, have on realignment  of the political world.    [Ozawa] I think the difference between those, who think the  current system should not be changed, and others, who think  changes are needed, boils down to the differences of opinions  regarding periodic recognition and historical views.    We should actively buckle down to technological development.  Another thing the government has to deal with is wide-ranging  environmental issues. The government should not introduce  measures for maintaining total demand or opening up a new  industrial field. Instead, the government should launch visions  or guidance.    The government should do these two things. At the same time,  the government should also study an ideal form of welfare state  or welfare system and deal with the issue of how much burden the  people should bear. I think these three points will be major  pillars of political realignment.    [Oikawa] How will the things you have just said be related  to images of the parties? Can you explain it in concrete terms?    [Ozawa] The LDP and opposition parties feel at peace in a  society with many regulations.    Originally, the regulations were made to ensure the people  would get fair and equal chances. But, regulations have  negative aspects. Regulations can be easily linked to corruption  when abused by people in power. Political reform can correct  this point.    [Oikawa] Can you explain how the progress or process of  political realignment is being promoted?    [Ozawa] I still cannot foresee visible phenomenons.  However, the revised political reform bills will be approved in  mid-February. I think people's attention will shift to political  reform as soon as the bills are passed.    [Oikawa] Do you think that such a thing as the course of  government, or the government's role in international society  will be one of the issues of political realignment?    [Ozawa] Yes, I do. I think differences of opinions  regarding policies, what a nation should be or what politics  should be like will become major factors. We should introduce a  fundamental security act and thereby clearly spell out the  ideals of a peaceloving and UN-centered nation.    [Oikawa] Can you comment on elections, including the issue  of nominating joint candidates, under the new electoral system?    [Ozawa] Many lawmakers do not have a thorough understanding  of the new electoral system, and neither does the general  public. Parties will nominate candidates. The proportional  representation also applies to single-seat constituencies too.  Because of these, they still understand that the words  "cooperation in elections" and "joint candidate" apply to  organizations which confirmed things during elections in the  past. However, (under the new electoral system) political  parties and groups are not required to be confirmed as  organizations that are allowed to conduct election campaigns. I  think the coalition parties will have to compete in the next  election as a single party.    [Oikawa] How will coalition parties handle their policy  differences?    [Ozawa] It is absolutely unnecessary to think which party is  good and which party is not, or who is good and who is not. For  example, I think Mr. Hosokawa should remain as prime minister.  Those who have the same opinion should gather together. I do  not know how other politicians (think), but I think that when  the coalition parties merge into a new party, they will do so  without confrontation over basic policies.    [Sasaki] Political reform will necessitate a personnel  reshuffle at the final stage. What are your opinions?    [Ozawa] (Shinseito) would invite those who seek candidacy  and select candidates from them. I am a second-generation  politician. Second-generation politicians tend to be criticized  because of their advantageous positions to win candidacy. Such  criticism will disappear if candidates are selected through a  strict test. But I sincerely hope that incumbent Diet members  will be exempted from the test because if they all fail the  test, that would be very embarrassing (laughter).  <H5>  Future Policy Tasks </H5>   [Sasaki] Following the legislation of the bills connected  with political reform, there will arise many problems on the  mechanism of making political decisions. One of them concerns  reform at the Diet, and I would like to hear your views on this  issue.    [Ozawa] Under the current situation, you can still see the  influence of the 1955 system. For example, the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is undergoing a very serious  agony. In handling the issues on the new multilateral trade  negotiations (at the Uruguay Round), on bills connected with  political reform, and on the tax cut, they would have voiced  their opposition without giving any thought if it were still an  opposition party. However, they have now come to feel that they  must fulfill their political responsibilities. On the other  hand, if the 1955 system had continued, all these three issues  would never have been settled.    As for the issue on how deliberations should be actually  carried out at the Diet, I think opposition parties should be  mainly held responsible for checking the government. Therefore,  the Diet's functions should be strengthened. For example, the  Diet should be more sufficiently staffed. And the system of  appointing government delegates [to assist cabinet members in  Diet deliberations] should be abolished. Deliberations at the  Diet should be conducted among politicians. These plans must be  put into effect. Then, the people will think that a new Diet  has started, and politicians will be able to carry out more  intensive study. When politicians come to have accurate  knowledge, bureaucrats will listen to them. Bureaucrats may  have a low opinion of politicians when they talk incoherently.  In the past, politicians have spent an overwhelming part of  their energy on election campaigning. In the future, we should  make political parties take responsibility for 20 to 30 percent  of campaigning so politicians will have enough energy to study  issues and debate with bureaucrats, and so deliberations can be  conducted among the ruling and opposition parties at the Diet.    [Oikawa] You have advocated the system of assigning Dietmen  from ruling parties to the government by creating posts for two  to three deputy ministers [fuku daijin] and four to six  political councillors [seimu shingi-kan] at each individual  agency and ministry. How would you explain this point?    [Ozawa] Politicians, particularly politicians from ruling  parties, should be held responsible for administration. At the  Diet sessions, those politicians from ruling parties who are  assigned to official posts should be asked to engage in  deliberations with Dietmen from opposition parties.    [Oikawa] In concrete terms, when and how will this system be  introduced?    [Ozawa] Since this issue has been brought up for discussions  at a meeting of senior leaders of ruling parties, I hope the  system will be put into effect at the current Diet session.    [Sasaki] It seems that opinions are divided among the ruling  coalition parties on the issue of whether an organ for  monitoring the development of political reform should be set up  at the Diet or in the cabinet. What do you think of this?    [Ozawa] If politicians have become genuinely mature, I think  it will be desirable to set up this organ at the Diet. However,  under the current atmosphere involving both ruling and  opposition parties, it will be very difficult for the government  to carry out its administration if such an organ should be set  up at the Diet and entrusted with the task of administrative  reform and supervision. It is because the organ is bound to  concentrate on faultfinding.    [Sasaki] Deliberations at the Japanese Diet are known for  being extremely detailed.    [Ozawa] Discussions are usually held on insignificant  issues. Originally, the opposition should be responsible for  monitoring ruling parties. However, the Japanese, including  members of both ruling and opposition parties, have normally  kept in mind that bureaucrats imply the government [o-kami]. At  Diet sessions, even Dietmembers from ruling parties are asking  bureaucrats questions. Dietmembers from both ruling and  opposition parties prefer listening to answers given by  bureaucrats. And I am arguing that it will not do to have such  an awareness.    [Sasaki] At what forums do you plan to bring up the issue on  power decentralization for discussion? In my opinion, unless  local governments make moves, there will be no changes in the  overall political trend no matter how the central government  tries to make moves. What do you say?    [Ozawa] Many Japanese speak of "deregulation." However,  there is hardly anyone who truly hopes for deregulation because  it is comfortable to live in a regulated society, and this  argument also holds true with localities. While complaining  that "it is very troublesome to make petitions to the  authorities," local government officials get scared when "they  are given funds and authority and asked to carry out some  policies by themselves." Speaking of power decentralization in  the true sense of the words, however, there are cases where  central government offices may refuse to surrender their  authority but there are also cases where the other side is not  keen on decentralization.    [Oikawa] How would you actually implement Diet reform  and decentralization of power?    [Ozawa] When things are doing just fine, it is difficult to  start something new. For instance, the national welfare tax has  been termed abrupt. However, the aging society is gradually  becoming visible, and the people are beginning to think  seriously. From now on, many things will need political  decisions. The political authorities should take the  responsibility and make decisions on such issues as the problem  of the Korean peninsula. Things will not turn out as planned  even if you write a time schedule during peace time.    Basically, the international community has become volatile.  We need to build a system able to cope with this. In a sense,  this constitutes political reform. This means the political  authorities should take the responsibility to make and implement  their decisions. At least, we need to create two groups capable  of taking the reins of government. Three would also be alright.  The international situation and domestic affairs may become  explosive. The question is whether we will be able to respond  promptly. As to what should be the priority and how decisions  should be made, the regime in power can decide about that.  [passage omitted on Ozawa's assessment of postwar politics]  <H5>  What Kind of Person Is "Ichiro Ozawa"? </H5>   [Oikawa] Some people are accusing you of forming a dual  power structure in the ruling coalition in the same way as  Kakuei Tanaka and Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] did in the past. What do you think of this?    [Ozawa] The head of the administration needs leadership. He  can fully exercise the leadership only when he is accepted by  the people of the time. In this context, I think Mr. Hosokawa  should remain as leader for the present. I do not think I am  the right person to be leader. Besides that, I have no  intention of obtaining that highest post.    My position is different from those of Messrs. Tanaka and  Takeshita. I am not a behind-the-scenes strong man. In LDP  style, I am a secretary general. My title is the chief  secretary of Shinseito. If a new party is formed and I am asked  to assume an executive post, I will accept the offer as long as  I am a member of the House of Representatives. I think it is  not right to compare myself with Messrs. Tanaka and Takeshita.    [Oikawa] Some criticize you by saying that you act  "high-handedly" and have "fascistic ideas."    [Ozawa] I am responsible for my remarks and behavior. In  Japan's village-like society, people do not clearly state their  opinions. Also, responsible leaders do not make clear their  views and behavior. So far, Japanese politicians have tried to  form consensus and do what others agree to. In this regard, my  remarks and behavior are different from those of other  politicians. I have not chosen to become the target of  criticism. But I am responsible for what I have to say so long  as I am elected as a politician.    [Oikawa] While you sometimes disappear from the public eye,  you are calling for "pursuing open-door politics." Don't you  think you contradict yourself?    [Ozawa] That is what the mass media has said. I do not  disappear like a mole. Since I got ill, I have tried to take a  rest. That is all. I go shopping with my wife and go to the  movies. I do not want (my private life) to be disturbed by the  media.    [Oikawa] When you were questioned about the political  donations you received from major construction companies, you  just said: "The donations were handled in accordance with law."  You did not explain exactly how the donations were handled.    [Ozawa] They were handled properly in accordance with the  current judicial order. Other politicians also handle their  political donations in the same way. Some people have said that  "the political funds control law has many loopholes," and that  "Ozawa has clearly evaded the law." I have heard the criticism  of this kind. There are many special cases provided by the  current tax law in which political donations are treated as  legal. Also, the tax authorities may in their discretion decide  whether they are legal or not. If you say this system is bad,  that is tantamount to saying that those who handle political  donations in accordance with this system are also bad.</p>

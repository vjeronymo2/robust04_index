			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for drug sector DRUG SECTOR stocks were held back by a US press article giving an outline of the proposed Clinton health reforms. The draft document outlines plans to halve the planned growth in health spending by the end of the decade, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Most of the reductions are expected to come from market competition rather than from government imposed price cuts. Share prices of the big UK pharmaceutical companies operating in the US jumped a few weeks ago when it appeared that President Clinton's administration would not impose drug price cuts. Yesterday, analysts were reminded that the US climate for pharmaceuticals companies had changed and costs will be brought down. Glaxo, largest of the UK health multinationals, faced additional pressure ahead of a meeting by the US Food and Drug Administration to discuss ways of licensing asthma inhalers. Glaxo, which makes and sells the Ventalin treatment, fell 26 at one stage and closed 17 off at 623p. SmithKline Beecham, which faces problems with over-the-counter licensing in the US for a version of Tagamet, its anti-ulcer product, slipped 13 to 404p and Wellcome weakened 9 to 723p. Medeva, which has applied to market a generic asthma product, closed marginally up at 112p.</p>

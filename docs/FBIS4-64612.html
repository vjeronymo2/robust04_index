			<p>BFN     [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand  National Assembly, who concluded his official visit to France as  the guest of his French counterpart, has returned to Turkey. In  a statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Cindoruk said that  during his visit, he held positive and fruitful meetings with  the French president, parliamentary officials, and  representatives of political parties.    Noting that he held a one and-a-half-hour meeting with  French  President Francois Mitterrand, Cindoruk remarked that the  meeting yielded beneficial and important results for Turkey.  Cindoruk said that during the meeting, he had the opportunity  to respond to some of Mitterrand's views and concerns. Cindoruk  stated: I believe that I was able to explain Turkey's problems  to him properly. There is no concern with regard to our  country's democratization and human rights and its close ties to  West Europe. If there were any reasons for concern on these  subjects, they were presented to us and we offered the necessary  explanations.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering the comments, the agency has decided to add the following clarifying language to &sect;583.6(c):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (4)(i) Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the supplier produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly plant) of the equipment. Except as provided in (c)(3), material is considered foreign to whatever extent part or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent value added in the United States or Canada, traced back to raw materials. For any material which is imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the material originated in the United States or Canada. Neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value added in the United States or Canada backwards; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to value added in the United States or Canada is considered foreign.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A supplier located in the United States or Canada uses sheet steel to produce exterior panels which are shipped to a final assembly plant. In determining the valued added in the United States or Canada of the exterior panels, the supplier must subtract the price it paid for the sheet steel except to the extent that the supplier determines that the price paid represents value added in the United States or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For the minor items listed in the &sect;583.4 definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of its material originated in the United States or Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States or Canada.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In clarifying how suppliers are to calculate value added in the U.S./Canada, NHTSA believes it is important to keep in mind the statutory requirement that it adopt regulations that provide the best and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers. In order to make perfect determinations of the value added in the U.S./Canada of all passenger motor vehicle equipment, it would be necessary to trace all costs involved in producing such equipment, including the costs of all component parts, all the way back to raw materials. Even if such an effort were possible, it would be extremely costly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of submissions from GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi and AIAM in response to its request for comments, NHTSA explained in the NPRM that it agreed with the general premise that tracking and reporting requirements should be limited to ``first tier'' suppliers (including both suppliers which deliver equipment to the manufacturer itself and ones which deliver equipment to an allied supplier). The agency stated that no requirements would be imposed on suppliers earlier in the chain, but noted that suppliers which are subject to the proposed information requirements may need in some cases to arrange to obtain information from their suppliers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A basic issue raised by APMA's comment is how, in the absence of extensive tracking requirements, ``first tier'' suppliers will know enough about the content of the materials they purchase from other sources, for incorporation into their equipment, to make the required determinations about U.S./Canadian content. In fact, the suppliers may not know, or be able to find out, the amount of the cost of such materials that represents value added in the U.S./Canada. APMA's comment also raises the issue of how suppliers are to treat such things as costs and profits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

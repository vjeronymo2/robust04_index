			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Company cars' change of direction likely to pick up speed THE COMPOSITION of UK car sales is expected to change following the simplification of company car benefit tax, Britain's volume car makers said yesterday. Mr Tony Brigden, director of fleet sales for UK market leader Ford, said company car users were likely to seek voluntary 'downsizing' of vehicles to lower individual tax bills. 'But this trend was in progress anyway through a general desire for smaller cars and environmental factors, so all that the new scheme will do is maintain this pressure,' Mr Brigden said. More important was the removal of the current regime's combination of engine capacity and price bands. 'Manufacturers can plan without having to take account of false restrictions, and product planning can be driven wholly by market forces,' he said. Company car tax is based wholly on a percentage of cars' retail list prices plus 'extras'. Car manufacturers, however, expect little negative effect on sales volumes. Companies at the lower end of the luxury and specialist sports car sectors, such as Jaguar and TVR , are likely to welcome the new structure, to be introduced next year. Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin, however, which both sell cars in the Pounds 100,000 plus category, stand to be badly affected by the fact that there is no 'ceiling' on the new tax scheme. The user of a 'perk' Rolls-Royce Silver Spur costing Pounds 115,000, and covering fewer than 2,500 business miles, will pay tax of Pounds 16,100 for the private benefit of the car under the new scheme. This is based on paying tax at the top marginal rate on 35 per cent of the retail list price of the car. Under the existing scale charge system, entering its final year next month, the charge will be only Pounds 6,024 - the same as for private use of a Jaguar, or any other car costing above Pounds 29,000. Under the new system the owner of a Pounds 33,600 Jaguar XJS, for example, will see his tax bill reduced from Pounds 6,024 to Pounds 4,704. Rolls-Royce expressed its dismay at the absence of any 'cap' on the tax scheme and said it was 'considering what action we might take' between now and the scheme's introduction. Jaguar, wholly owned by Ford, said that 'in overall business terms it will be very helpful to us in the UK market'. It has been disadvantaged by the sharp increases in taxation accompanying the two price thresholds of the current system - at Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 - and has had to produce 'tax break specials' in a not very successful effort to compensate. Now it, too, expects to be able to rationalise its model range and production. In particular, Jaguar expects an end to the practice of cars being ordered without extras, even air conditioning, so that the list price can be brought under the tax threshold.</p>

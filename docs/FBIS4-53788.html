			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hong Son-kun] </F>   [Text] It has been learned on 18 May that the government  has decided to allow U.S. motor companies to establish joint  ventures for financing installments sales in the ROK within this  year. Accordingly, U.S. motor companies, including Ford, will be  able to sell cars in installments through their own financing  companies from 1995.    The government policy is a partial acceptance of U.S.  pressure to allow U.S. companies to establish installments  financing companies on the grounds that not allowing the  participation of U.S. companies in the establishment of domestic  installments financing companies is discriminatory and a  violation of the provision requiring foreign companies to be  given equal treatment as domestic companies. The government  previously decided to allow ROK companies to establish  installments financing companies in the first half of this year.    A relevant government official revealed that as the U.S.  demand has emerged as a core subject of the trade dispute  between the two countries, the government has decided to  partially accept the U.S. position by allowing the establishment  of installments financing companies by ROK companies first and  later by U.S. companies after a certain period. The ROK  Government notified the U.S. Government of the policy towards  the end of April in trade talks.    The official said, however, that the government policy would  not allow for 100-percent ownership by U.S. companies, but only  investment amounting to 49 percent in a joint venture with ROK  companies.    Ford Motors has reportedly led the demand for the  establishment of installments financing companies in the ROK by  U.S. companies.</p>

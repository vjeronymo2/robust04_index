			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: ML parts with chief executive ML HOLDINGS, the aerospace and electronic components group, yesterday parted company with its chief executive just a day before publication of the group's preliminary results. Today's figures will show that the company fell into loss for the year to March 1992. ML's directors decided unanimously at yesterday's board meeting that Mr Peter Pollock would cease to be chief executive. He was not available for comment. Mr Timothy Sallitt, chairman, became acting chief executive and said that a replacement for Mr Pollock had been found from an engineering company. He would take up his post 'within weeks rather than months'. Mr Sallitt said that although the timing of the announcement of Mr Pollock's departure could have been better, the decision was not directly related to the results. The change in chief executive was prompted more by 'a question of management style than bottom line performance', he said. ML Holdings shares fell 7p to 31p. The change comes after a particularly difficult period for the company. One of its biggest contracts, for the JP233 airfield denial bomb which was used in the Gulf war, came to an end last year. The JP233 accounted for Pounds 34m of the group's Pounds 64.8m turnover in 1987, but only Pounds 1m last year. It was one of the factors that a year ago led to a 41 per cent decline in profits to Pounds 6.3m. Mr Pollock's salary was cut by 38 per cent to Pounds 149,000. Mr Sallitt became chairman in March with the remit to turn the company round by strengthening its non-military businesses. He decided that a new chief executive was needed. His chosen candidate accepted the offer of the post yesterday. Mr Sallitt became a non-executive director of ML last year, having left the board of Hawker Siddeley in 1990.</p>

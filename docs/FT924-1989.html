			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Shake-out forecast in pulp and paper EUROPE'S paper and pulp industry faces accelerating rationalisation, according to Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, the region's largest paper group. Mr Berggren, speaking at the FT world pulp and paper conference in London, pointed out the industry remained far too fragmented. Many plants, particularly in France, Italy and Spain, were outdated and small. In these countries there were uncoated woodfree paper machines still running which dated from before the war. Mr Dick Eykel, board member at KNP, the Dutch group, blamed overcapacity for the industry's woes. Prices were at the lowest real levels for the last few decades. 'It's a shame when some markets are growing at 9.5 per cent that an industry is capable of ruining itself through overcapacity. It's a question of bad management,' said Mr Eykel. He called for companies to time investments better. The industry's restructuring should ultimately lead to a more stable environment and growth patterns which were less cyclical, said Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British group. The consolidation should help reduce the degree of over-investment by combining expansion plans. The far more consolidated US industry had achieved an average return over the last 15 years of 12 per cent compared with the European industry's 8 per cent.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Cunard chief set to face protest on QE2 Cunard chief executive John Olsen, speaking at a press conference in New York, where he acknowledged there had been difficulties on board the Queen Elizabeth 2 after a recent Pounds 30m (Dollars 45m) refit. Asked to comment on reports of exploding toilets on the vessel, he said the biggest single issue had involved the plumbing. He was later due to board the vessel to avert a threatened sit-in by 150 passengers. Report, Page 16</p>

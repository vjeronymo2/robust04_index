He highly praised the efforts taken by  the Russian president and diplomats for averting NATO threatened  air strikes in Bosnia, noting that Russia "demonstrated its  capability of moderating by peaceful means armed conflicts  exhausting both big and small nations".    Shaposhnikov expressed sincere support of Russian soldiers  serving now in the U.N. peacekeeping forces in former  Yugoslavia, assessing their mission as a historic one. On day  of Fatherland's defenders, the Marshal wished Russian  servicemen, wherever they are staying at the moment -- in  Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina or on Afghan border -- to be  steadfast, self-controlled and to fulfil their military duty in  the way Russians have always done, from the time of the battle  of Kulikovo to the Great Patriotic War.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ERA ENDS IN DEATH OF LAST FULL-BLOODED KWAAYMII  </P> <P> The last full-blooded Kwaaymii Indian, Tomas Lucas, 87, died Thursday on the  land where his forebears had lived for centuries.  </P> <P> Lucas was born during a snowstorm in 1903 in the same area of the Laguna  Mountains in northeastern San Diego County where he died. He attended public  school and later moved away from the reservation and married an Anglo woman.  During World War II, he moved with his family to the Pacific Beach neighborhood  of San Diego, working in defense industries and later for a San Diego building  contractor. He retired at 70.  </P> <P> About five years ago, he returned to the Lagunas, to the former Kwaaymii  reservation land where he had been raised.  </P> <P> The 320-acre Lucas Ranch was once the home of the tribe, who lived high in the  Laguna Mountains most of the year, moving their entire village down to the  desert during the coldest months of winter.  </P> <P> During his final years, Lucas told and retold the story of his people to  anthropologists and archeologists who visited his home off Sunrise Highway. His  voice took on a sing-song quality as he repeated the legends that had been  taught him as a youth, stories of the abundance of nature and the heroic deeds  of his ancestors.  </P> <P> The Kwaaymii elders, aware that he was the last of the tribe, forced the young  members to learn and repeat the tribal history, and in recent years Lucas,  despite failing hearing and eyesight, repeated it hundreds of times to  educators and scientists who sought him out.  </P> <P> "I guess that I'm the only one today that remembers the past," he told a  reporter last year. "I was the only child and no kids to play with. At night, I  was bound to listen. Listen to stories, listen to prayers.  </P> <P> "By keeping my ears open, as I most generally have, I picked up quite a few  things. Some things I wasn't supposed to know I heard anyway."  </P> <P> Children of Spencer Valley School near Julian and their teacher, Luanne Lynch,  often visited Lucas to hear his tales. Lynch, with the aid of a school video  camera, captured hours of Lucas' monologues and calls them "invaluable" because  of his clear memory and voice.  </P> <P> Lucas told of his people being decimated by white men's diseases -- scarlet  fever and influenza -- and of being driven off their lands by settlers seeking  rangeland for their cattle.  </P> <P> When Lucas was born in 1903, the Kwaaymii no longer made the journey down to  the desert in winter for fear that white ranchers would seize their mountain  lands while they were away. But Lucas could point out the trail down the  mountain to Mason Valley that his ancestors took and would describe the pile of  tiny pebbles that grew to a mound because each passing Indian would toss on a  stone to ask the Great Spirit for a safe journey.  </P> <P> His land contains the site of a Kwaaymii village whose residents were wiped out  in some mysterious way. Lucas speculated to a reporter that the mass deaths  were from food poisoning, ptomaine probably, caused from some contamination in  a communal meal.  </P> <P> There are metate holes that Indian women, including his mother, used to grind  acorns into meal. There are meadows where deer and other game were plentiful  and where yellow buttercups formed lush carpets in the spring after winter  rains.  </P> <P> Lucas' mother, Maria Alto, also lived in both the Indian and Anglo worlds,  becoming an accomplished horsewoman, an artist and a successful cattle rancher.  She fought to have her son enrolled in a "white school," where he could learn  English and receive an education.  </P> <P> Lucas' daughter, Carmen, said her father fought for 18 years to obtain title to  the Kwaaymii lands, which were his right as the last surviving member of the  tribe. She said the deed of patent was finally approved by Congress and signed  by then-President Harry Truman in 1947.  </P> <P> In his final days, Lucas contracted pneumonia, Carmen Lucas said.  </P> <P> "He knew he was dying. He told us so. He told us of his disturbing dreams where  he was surrounded by angels, but when he reached out to touch them, their wings  turned to paper," she said.  </P> <P> Carmen Lucas and her sister, Jacquelyn Pfingst of San Diego, and three  grandchildren survive him.  </P> <P> His funeral services, like his life, will include Indian and Anglo elements.  Tentative arrangements call for a visitation from noon until 8 p.m. Tuesday at  Paris-Frederick Mortuary in El Cajon. His body will then be taken to Lucas  Ranch, where an all-night wake is scheduled to begin at sunset Wednesday.  </P> <P> Burial services are tentatively scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday at the burial  grounds on the Lucas Ranch, where his mother and more than 90 other Kwaaymii  ancestors lie.  </P></p>

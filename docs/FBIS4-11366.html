			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nubia Aparicio S.] </F>   [Excerpts] The popularity of Ernesto Perez Balladares,  presidential candidate for the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary  Party], has declined, while that of Ruben Blades of Papa Egoro  Movement [MPE] increased abruptly, according to a special poll  conducted by the Dichter and Neira firm.    When asked who they would vote for if the presidential  elections were held today, 28.4 percent of those polled said  they would vote for the PRD candidate, 24.8 percent for Blades,  16.2 percent for Carles, 14.3 percent for De Gruber, 2.3 percent  for Vallarino, 1.4 percent for Lewis Galindo, and 0.2 percent  for Munoz.    According to the latest three polls, support for the PRD  candidate among voters has been continually declining. Although  Perez Balladares remains in the lead with only 3.6 percentage  points over Blades, his popularity level continues to decline.  According to the latest poll conducted at the national level  between 8 and 10 April, Perez Balladares' popularity level was  set at 34.5 percent. In this same poll, Blades (third place)  registered 17.3 percent of voters' support, Carles (second  place) 18.6 percent, and De Gruber (fourth place) 11.3 percent.    This survey is based on a aleatory sample of 1,209  individual  interviews administered on a face-to-face basis by the  interviewer among residents of the Republic of Panama, age 18 or  older. LA PRENSA ordered the survey to be conducted after  President Guillermo Endara aired some videos of the previous  military regime over a national television network in which the  acts of corruption of the military government that remained in  power for over two decades were unveiled.    Meanwhile, singer Blades ranked first among voters'  preferences in the special poll, when asked who they would vote  for in case a civic alliance led by Ruben Carles was formed,  while Perez Balladares's popularity for the 8 May election  continued to slide. Blades got 30.5 percent of voter support,  Perez Balladares obtained 29.5 percent, Carles 23.2 percent,  Samuel Lewis Galindo 2.8 percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz 0.5  percent of the preferences. The aforementioned voters were  asked: In case there is an alliance and the candidates were  only Blades, Perez Balladares, Carles, Lewis Galindo, and Jose  Salvador Munoz, who would you vote for?    According to the poll, in case Mireya Moscoso de Gruber led  the civic alliance, Blades would remain in the lead with 31.8  percent, Perez Balladares would get 29.2 percent, the Arnulfist  Party candidate 21.4 percent, Lewis Galindo 3.2 percent, and  Munoz 0.3 percent.    If Eduardo Vallarino presided over said civic alliance,  however, the singer would garner 38.5 percent of the vote, Perez  Balladares 29.8 percent, the Christian Democratic Party  candidate only 7.3 percent, Lewis Galindo 4.2 percent, and Munoz  0.5 percent.    When asked who they would vote for if the elections were  held  today, 28.4 percent of those polled said they would vote for the  PRD candidate, 24.8 percent for Blades, 16.2 percent for Carles,  14.3 percent for De Gruber, 2.3 percent for Vallarino, 1.4  percent for Lewis Galindo, and 0.2 percent for Munoz. [passage  omitted]    The margin of error of this survey is 3 percent. The poll  was it was conducted 22 and 23 April.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / US reaffirms its hard line towards Cuba THE US this week firmly rebuffed speculation that there would be a thawing of relations with Cuba, despite speculation that President Bill Clinton might relax the decades-old embargo. Mr Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for Inter-American affairs, pledged total support for last year's controversial Cuban Democracy Act, which tightened many areas of the embargo, including extending it to foreign subsidiaries of US companies. Speaking at a conference sponsored by the conservative Cuban-American National Foundation this week, Mr Watson addressed directly 'a misconception that has emerged from time to time in the press and elsewhere. . . that the Clinton administration intends to soften its policy towards the Cuban regime. That is false. We can neither trade nor negotiate away the human and political rights of the Cuban people.' Mr Watson's speech, however, was not laced with the traditional squeeze-Castro-into-submission rhetoric favored by many of the most conservative Cuban-Americans. Instead he focused on the need to increase the flow of information into Cuba and said the Cuban Democracy Act had allowed substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to go to private organisations in Cuba. Members of more moderate groups who favour negotiations with the communist state said they were not surprised by the administration's tough talk especially given crucial support the powerful foundation gave Mr Clinton in last year's elections. 'He is sacrificing a rational policy for a campaign pledge,' said Mr Kevin Harris of the Cuban-American Research and Education Fund. But there were promising signs in the actions if not the words of the administration, he said. Last month, for example, Cuba turned over to the US two suspected cocaine traffickers who had fled to the island. In another sign of co-operation, the US in September agreed to repatriate Cubans who came to the US in the 1980 Mariel boatlifts and have been convicted of felonies in the US. Congressman Robert Torricelli, one of the loudest advocates of maintaining the stringent embargo on Cuba, said he had asked Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, to prosecute a group of US citizens who he said violated the embargo by traveling to Cuba as tourists.</p>

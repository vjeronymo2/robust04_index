			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Lamfalussy preaches peace THE MAN who will be keeping an eye on the next phase of European economic and monetary union yesterday got his first look at the people who will be keeping an eye on him. Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the Belgian president-elect of the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European central bank, was quizzed by members of the European parliament, revelling in their new powers to vet important institutional appointments in the European Union. But while the deputies blustered through the three-hour session, Mr Lamfalussy remained unruffled, like a grey-suited Mahatma Gandhi, softly preaching a policy of passive resistance to currency speculators and imprudent finance ministers. Mr Lamfalussy, who will launch the EMI on January 1, 1994, renounced weapons such as capital controls and central bank intervention. 'I think the only way to influence the market is (with) the credibility and sustainability of policies,' he told MEPs. 'Credibility leads to (exchange rate) stability.' Were current government economic policies credible? Mr Lamfalussy refused to be drawn, but he said recent combinations of monetary and economic policy at least seemed to be having some positive effect on the European recession: 'Whether government policies were deliberately wise or whether they were just lucky I don't know, but the result isn't too bad.' It was too soon to consider reforms to the discredited exchange rate mechanism, following the recent series of currency crises, he said. As a result, Mr Lamfalussy said he thought it 'improbable' that the EU would meet the Maastricht treaty's first EMU target by 1997. Instead, a few of the strongest EU economies would probably press on with monetary union in 'jumps', rather than pursuing an unworkable 'gradualist' approach, he said, adding 'it isn't an easy solution, but I think it's a practical solution' - provided all EU members accepted the discipline of stable real exchange rates. Mr Lamfalussy will launch the Frankfurt-based EMI in January, and he told MEPs it would have a staff of some 200 people. They would help him act as an impartial 'honest broker' between independent central banks, which he said had to have a clear mandate to preserve price stability. But certain MEPs seemed unconvinced that Mr Lamfalussy, a Belgian baron and distinguished central banker, would have a real influence over street-fighting finance ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke of the UK. But the MEPs approved his candidacy - unanimously. Editorial Comment, page 19</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOLING THE MEDICAL-COST EPIDEMIC  </P> <P> A program to develop national standards for a variety of medical procedures  could lead to a major breakthrough in the effort to improve health care in the  United States while containing its cost.  </P> <P> The implications are profound. Agreement on standards would help eliminate  unnecessary operations at a time when studies indicate that many interventions  are inappropriate. Beyond that, however, the establishment of agreed parameters  would influence medical education, strengthening the direction of instruction.  It would also establish a better base on which charges of malpractice can be  more rationally judged to eliminate the unnecessary tests and other procedures  that doctors sometimes undertake simply to create a defense against potential  legal action.  </P> <P> The agreement brings together the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, the American  Medical Assn. and a newly established Academic Medical Center Consortium that  includes UCLA. Called "The Clinical Appropriateness Initiative," the joint  program will address immediately the increasingly costly and dangerous practice  of unnecessary surgery.  </P> <P> By the end of the year, RAND and the academic centers will complete proposed  appropriateness standards on four widely used procedures: cataract, aortic  aneurysm, coronary artery bypass surgery and carotid endarterectomy. This will  include precise indications of when intervention is or is not appropriate. This  work will then be translated by the AMA -- working with the medical specialty  societies -- into "user friendly" guidelines for practicing physicians and  surgeons.  </P> <P> In agreeing to the plan, the AMA has apparently made a significant shift of  policy from what had appeared to be hostility to efforts to intrude on the  individual doctor's authority for medical decisions. That is a welcome  recognition by the AMA that existing practices produce a high ratio of  unnecessary operations and costs that have spiraled out of control. It is a  tribute to the work at RAND, under the direction of Dr. Robert H. Brook, in  devising a way to interpret under what circumstances intervention is  appropriate.  </P> <P> The success of the consortium will largely depend on decisions at the federal  level. Generous contributions from the John A. Hartford Foundation and the  Commonwealth Fund, and in- kind contributions from the AMA, RAND and the  academic institutions, are funding its initial work. But federal support also  will be required.  </P> <P> Fortunately, establishment of the consortium coincides with the creation last  December by Congress of the Agency for Health Care Research and Policy within  the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency's mandate includes  preparation of practice guidelines as part of a broader study of cost and  quality elements of the health-care system. The agency will be spending more  than $30 million this year alone to fund practice guideline research compared  to the $1.5 million in foundation grants available to the consortium. A  substantial part of the federal funds will be needed for the work of the  consortium if duplication of research efforts is to be avoided and development  of the guidelines accelerated.  </P></p>

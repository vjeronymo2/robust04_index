			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese State  Council has approved the investment of 41.7 billion yuan in  railway construction this year.    Han Zhubin, minister of railways, told a working meeting  here  today that due to insufficient funds, the ministry's initial  plan is to invest 29 billion yuan in capital construction, of  which 26.65 billion yuan will go to large and medium-sized  projects, and 2.35 billion yuan to smaller projects.    Han said that this year tracks will be laid on 2,100 km of  new lines, with 234 km operational; 1,335 km of multiple tracks  will be laid, with 1,293 km operational; and 194 km of rail  lines will be electrified.    Last year China's railway construction used investments of  22.5 billion yuan, 12 billion yuan more than in the previous  year. Tracks were laid on 1,437 km of new lines and 1,073 km of  multiple- track lines.    To fill in the gap between available funds and actual demand  for capital construction, the ministry of railways will further  expand its use of overseas funds.    A preliminary agreement has been reached with the World Bank  on using its seventh railway construction loans, totalling about  550 million U.S. dollars; and a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars  will be taken for the first time from the Asian Development Bank  for building the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.    The ministry is also negotiating with the Japanese  Government  on projects to use the fourth group of Japanese yen loans.  Sources said that the yen loans -- equivalent to over two  billion U.S. dollars -- will be used for key railway  construction projects.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price The speed with which Saudi Arabia and Iran distanced themselves from Opec's disappointing production agreement augurs badly indeed for the oil sector. By setting its next meeting as soon as April, Opec had already indicated that it had no great confidence in the deal's staying power. But for the Saudis to undermine it publicly, just as they appear to have done their best to stymie agreement in the first place, was an unexpected blow. The question is what they hoped to achieve by such an uncompromising stance. The oil price dropped below Dollars 18 per barrel yesterday. Given the combination of oversupply and recession, it is hard to see why it should recover. Perhaps the only hope is that cheaper oil will stimulate demand further out. But that seems a weak motive for shaking the cartel's foundations.</p>

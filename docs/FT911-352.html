			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rowntree Mackintosh offers 37-hour week one of the most significant concessions on shorter hours outside the engineering and water industries. The offer provides a fillip for the campaign by UK unions to reduce working hours. The success of engineering unions in winning 37-hour deals in plants throughout the country has so far failed to spread significantly to other industries. Rowntree's offer, presaged at the start of the year when the company invited union leaders for talks on hours, was made last week during pay negotiations. The company proposed a 9 per cent pay deal and said it was prepared to reduce the 39-hour week by an hour in November and another hour in May 1993, subject to discussions at the company's plants. Deals would have to be made at factories on how the hours reductions should be arranged and on ways to limit the costs of the reductions, the company said. Union leaders said they would be balloting immediately on the 9 per cent offer, which they expected would be accepted. They believe there could be opposition to the hours proposal, however, because of the conditions attached. These include a shortening of tea breaks, one of the issues which caused controversy in negotiations in the engineering industry. Engineering unions claim that more than 500,000 of their members are covered by agreements for reductions in the previous norm of 39-hour weeks. Some water companies have also conceded hours. Elsewhere unions are attaching shorter hours claims to almost every pay submission, but with limited success. British Rail and British Gas have both offered reduced hours, but on terms that have so far proved unacceptable to the unions. Rowntree's proposed deal appears more likely to be acceptable, even if hard bargaining may be needed before implementation. The company, part of Nestle, the Swiss foods group, employes 5,000 process workers, although the offer does not cover those who work in Glasgow.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / FT Law Report: Negligent valuer pays no damages SWINGCASTLE v GIBSON House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Brightman, Lord Griffiths, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord Lowry): April 18 1991 A MORTGAGEE who lends in reliance on a negligent valuer's report, and who would not have lent but for that report, cannot claim damages from the valuer for loss of contractual interest due from the borrower on the loan sum if the borrower defaults. But, in addition to the difference between sums paid out and sums recovered, he can claim interest at a commercial rate on the loan sum, to compensate for the time he was deprived of its use. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the defendant valuer, Mr Alastair Gibson, a chartered surveyor, from a Court of Appeal decision (FT, April 6 1990) upholding a County court assessment of Pounds 7,136 damages owed by him to the plaintiff, Swingcastle Ltd. LORD LOWRY said that at the beginning of 1985 Mr John Clarke and his wife were in financial difficulties. Their home was mortgaged. They owed Pounds 1,700 to a building society and Pounds 6,300 to a finance company. Being anxious to pay off those debts, they went to brokers whose business included putting borrowers in touch with lenders. The brokers instructed the valuer to survey the property and give a report for the benefit of whoever might become their lending principals. The valuer placed the forced sale value at Pounds 18,000. Relying on his valuation, Swingcastle lent Mr and Mrs Clarke Pounds 10,000 secured by a first charge over the property. The entire loan was used to pay the Pounds 1,700 and Pounds 6,300 debts, and the Pounds 2,000 brokers' fee. The loan was repayable by 120 monthly instalments at 36.51 per cent annual interest. If the borrowers went into arrears, the lenders were entitled to add outstanding interest to the principal sum and charge interest on the whole, at 45.619 per cent. The borrowers quickly fell into arrears and surrendered possession on June 30 1986. The lenders sold the property for Pounds 12,000. Completion took place on February 27 1987. On September 4 1987 the lenders issued a writ against Mr Gibson, claiming damages for loss allegedly sustained by them in reliance on his negligent valuation. They pleaded loss comprised of Pounds 19,912.96, being the 'amount required to redeem the loan as at February 27 1987', Pounds 401.35 estate agents' fees, and Pounds 983.25 legal costs. Those sums, less the Pounds 12,000 sale proceeds totalled Pounds 9,297.56. Liability was admitted in the County court and it was admitted that but for the valuer's negligence the lenders would not have made any loan to the borrowers. The sole issue was the measure of damages on the basis that, on a competent valuation the lenders would have made no loan. About some of the figures there was no dispute. The lenders' outgoings included the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35 and the Pounds 983.25. On the other side of the account, the lenders had received Pounds 1,734 from the borrowers between February 1985 and April 1986, and Pounds 12,000 from the purchasers of the property. The disputed ingredient was the Pounds 19,912.96. The lenders arrived at that figure by calculating the amount of principal and interest outstanding, having regard to the initial 36.51 per cent rate, and the 45.619 per cent penal rate. In the County court Judge Harris QC allowed the claim and gave judgment for Pounds 7,136.41 with interest and costs. The valuer's case was that damages should have been assessed on the basis that the lenders were entitled to be placed in the position that they would have been in if they had received a competent valuer's report and had consequently made no loan. He said damages were to be calculated on the footing that the lenders should (1) take credit for the Pounds 10,000, the Pounds 401.35, and the Pounds 983.25; and (2) give credit for Pounds 1,734 paid and Pounds 12,000 received on sale of the property; and that the lenders had for two years been deprived of the use of Pounds 10,000 which they would not have lent but for the negligent valuation. In the court of Appeal Lord Justice Neill reviewed a number of authorities including Baxter v Gapp (1939) 2KB 271 which had been successfully relied on in the County court. He concluded Baxter was binding and that the judge was right to assess the damages in the way that he did. He then considered the case as if it were free from authority. He began with the principle in Livingstone v Rawyards (1880) 5 App Cas 25,39, that damages should 'put the party who has been injured . . . in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong'. He said that where a client would not have lent at all but for the negligent valuation, a number of approaches to assessment were possible. One was that the lender could be awarded unpaid interest owed when the security was realised. That was the method adopted in Baxter. But, said Lord Justice Neill, 'to award damages on this basis is in effect to treat the valuer as the guarantor of the contract of loan'. In the absence of authority he would have rejected that solution. Other methods, he said, were to award a sum equivalent to what the money would have earned as interest on another loan, or on deposit or if invested elsewhere. Whether any of those methods suited a case would depend on the evidence. Baxter was regarded by all three members of the Court of Appeal as authority for accepting the lenders' approach to the claim for interest. In Baxter, (1) the trial judge calculated interest by reference to what the mortgagor had failed to pay under her contract; but (2) the appropriate rate of interest was never an issue between the parties or in the mind of the court. The real issue was whether the plaintiff could recover consequential loss. Having regard to point (1), the case was almost by accident an authority for the proposition by which the Court of Appeal in the present case found itself reluctantly bound. Baxter was not an attractive precedent. The approach seemed contrary to principle. The aggrieved party was entitled to be placed in the same position as if the wrong had not occurred, not to receive compensation for lost interest at the contractual rate. The valuer's approach in the present case, and Lord Justice Neill's analysis, were correct. What the lenders lost was the use of the Pounds 10,000 while locked up in the loan. There was no cut and dry solution to calculating the amount of damages in cases of this kind. It depended on the evidence. The lenders ought to have presented their claim on the basis that, if the valuer had advised properly, they would not have lent the money. Where they went wrong was to claim that the valuer deprived them of interest they would have received if the borrowers had paid up. The fallacy of their case was that they had been trying to obtain compensation for the borrowers' failure, not damages for the valuer's negligence. Taking Pounds 10,000, Pounds 401.35 and Pounds 983.25 on one side, and Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 1,734 on the other, the lenders were Pounds 2,349.40 in credit. In the absence of evidence as to how the lenders financed the loan or how the money, if not lent, could have been profitably employed, 12 per cent interest was the proper rate at which to recompense the lenders for being deprived of their Pounds 10,000. Two years would yield Pounds 2,400, but one might ask whether it was reasonable for the valuer to bear liability to date of sale in February 1987, the property having been surrendered in June 1986. It was for the lenders to prove their case. They had not appeared. In the light of that fact and the figures, it would not be fair or sensible to remit the action to the County court for new assessment. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For Mr Gibson: Roger Toulson QC and Roger Stewart (Reynolds Porter Chamberlain). Swingcastle was not represented.</p>

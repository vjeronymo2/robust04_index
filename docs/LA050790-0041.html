			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 33 INMATES DIE IN ARGENTINE PRISON BLAZE  </P> <P> Thirty-three inmates died and 12 others were injured, two of them seriously,  when a fire swept through part of an Argentine prison, authorities said Sunday.  </P> <P> The blaze broke out Saturday night in a special cell block on the fifth floor  of the Olmos Penitentiary that housed prisoners who had been recognized for  their good behavior.  </P> <P> Prison officials said the trouble began after inmates set fire to mattresses to  block guards from entering a cell to break up a prisoner dispute.  </P> <P> "The fire was started intentionally. They burnt mattresses and it got out of  control and spread throughout the block," prison director Julio Barraza said.  </P> <P> The flames spread rapidly, trapping the victims, he added. Many of the 259  prisoners in the block were due to be released within the next 12 months for  good conduct.  </P> <P> Some of the 3,000 prison inmates worked alongside firefighters to help quell  the blaze, which completely burned the block, prison officers said.  </P> <P> Buenos Aires provincial Gov. Antonio Cafiero said after visiting the prison  Sunday morning that he would propose a reduction in the sentences of the  survivors.  </P> <P> The privately owned news agency Noticias Argentinas quoted residents living  near the prison as saying they did not hear shouts and noises that are usually  associated with prison riots.  </P> <P> At dawn, names of the dead were announced over loudspeakers to sobbing  relatives and friends gathered outside the prison.  </P></p>

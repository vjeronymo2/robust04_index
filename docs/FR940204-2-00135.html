Each class of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of a Fund will be identical in all respects, except for differences related to: (a) The method of financing certain Class Expenses, which are limited to (i) transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, reports, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class or to regulatory agencies with respect to a specific class of shares; (iii) blue sky registration or qualification fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class of shares; (vi) different levels of 12b&hyph;1 Plan and/or Services Plan fees and expenses (``Plan Payments'') incurred by a class of shares; (vii) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (viii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (b) priorities with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions (which priorities would reflect only the impact of Class Expenses properly allocated to one class); (c) the net asset values of the various classes of shares in a portfolio that may differ as a result of the allocation of Class Expenses; (d) voting rights of the classes with respect to the Plans; (e) the different exchange privileges, if any, of such classes as described in the prospectuses (and statements of additional information) of the portfolios and consistent with any order granted pursuant to this application; (f) class designation differences; and (g) the conversion of shares of one class to shares of a second class up to six years after the purchase of the shares of the first class, which classes differ with respect to the distribution services and administrative support fees payable by such classes of shares.

The directors of a Fund, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the creation of additional classes of shares from time to time by an affirmative vote prior to the creation of any such class. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to create any additional class of shares will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors' determination that the creation is in the best interests of both the Fund involved and its shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of a Fund, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

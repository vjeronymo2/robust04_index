			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRANIFF LIKELY TO DEFAULT  </P> <P> Braniff Inc. acknowledged today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission that the company will probably default on payments to unsecured  creditors and not make distributions to stockholders.  </P> <P> Braniff Inc., the Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> -based parent company for Braniff Airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  protection last fall and began liquidating assets to cover its $300 million in  debts.  </P> <P> But with the sale of its last major asset -- the rights to buy 74 Airbus  Industrie A-320 planes -- Braniff is conceding that most of its creditors will  not be paid and that its shareholders will not receive distributions.  </P> <P> It is also likely that $100 million of Braniff junk bonds, whose holders  include Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Connecticut National Bank of Hartford, and  Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank in Atlanta, will not be repaid.  </P></p>

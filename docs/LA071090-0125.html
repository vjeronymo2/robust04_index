			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAUER RETAINS HIS LEAD IN TOUR  </P> <P> Steve Bauer of Canada retained his lead in the Tour de France Monday, but the  first of the mountain stages on a warm day bothered him.  </P> <P> "The heat was a problem," said Bauer, who holds a 17-second lead over Ronan  Pensec of France after nine stages.  </P> <P> "I did not expect such a hard stage. I hope it will be cooler up in the  mountains.  </P> <P> "To keep the yellow jersey more than one week, it's probably the best of my  career. But it's a stress. In the race you have to watch out for everybody."  </P> <P> Italy's Massimo Ghirotto won the ninth stage, a 122-mile stretch from Besancon  to Geneva, breaking away with Spain's Eduardo Chozas in the first of the  mountain passes. They were timed in 4 hours 46 minutes 7 seconds.  </P> <P> Bauer has held the top position in the overall standings since the first stage  a week ago Sunday.  </P> <P> Defending champion Greg LeMond is sixth, 10:09 behind.  </P></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (1): Better times on the way - Madeira is riding the crest of an expanding economy. Development has been boosted by the expansion of tourism and by Portugal's membership of the European Community which has showered the islands, one of Europe's poorest regions, with aid MADEIRA, a small group of islands in the Atlantic some 900km south of Europe, known for its natural beauty and a sleepy lifestyle is buzzing with activity. A visitor returning after several years' absence may berate the loss of tranquillity in Funchal, the regional capital, as construction workers hammer away at roads and buildings and rush-hour traffic chokes up the city centre, but for most Madeirans these are signs of better times. After several decades of near-isolation and grinding poverty, life in Madeira is improving noticeably and expectations have risen. Madeirans are still poor by European standards - per capita income in Madeira is less than 30 per cent of the EC average and only 60 per cent of that on the Portuguese mainland - but living conditions are better than they were a generation ago when emigration was the only alternative for many Madeirans looking for jobs and a better life. About 1m emigrants of Madeiran descent live abroad, roughly four times the islands' current population of 253,000. Today, emigration has stopped, and some Madeirans have returned, wealthier than when they or their parents left, to start up new businesses. Unemployment has declined to 4.8 per cent, though under-employment remains widespread in traditional industries. There are several reasons for the change. The 1974 revolution in Portugal, of which Madeira is a distant region, brought for the first time a significant measure of autonomy to the islands, and local politicians were quick to grasp the new opportunities. Relations with Lisbon may be strained at times by Madeira's capacity to make a nuisance of itself, but the fearless crusade launched by Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, Madeira's somewhat eccentric but astute president, in defence of the islands' interests has paid off. Madeira today runs much of its own affairs, it has its own elected assembly, and the regional government can spend its tax revenue as it sees fit. Economic development was boosted, first by the expansion of tourism, then by Portugal's membership of the European Community which has showered Madeira - one of Europe's poorest regions - with aid. Tourism, now the islands' most important source of revenue, expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s - between 1976 and 1991 the number of visitors more than doubled. The islands' somewhat old fashioned image and its lack of beaches helped to avoid the pitfalls of over-development and mass tourism, but the industry created thousands of new jobs and demand for new services. Then, as an autonomous region of Portugal, Madeira benefited considerably from the economic boom that followed Portugal's entry into the Community in 1986. Whether vision or chance was behind the decision to keep Madeira within the EC - unlike the Canaries which stayed outside - no-one doubts it was the right choice. 'The European Community has played an important role in our development, and it is perhaps the most important factor for our future,' says Mr Miguel de Sousa, regional vice-president responsible for the economy. The regional government has proved particularly adept at ensuring that Madeira was not and is not forgotten in Brussels or Lisbon when budgets are drawn up. According to Madeiran statistics, the EC has allocated through a multitude of programmes more than Esc95bn for Madeira for the period 1986-93. This is roughly equivalent to Madeira's total gross domestic product for one year. The impact of EC aid is visible in new infrastructures, health care provisions and improved training and education - a new university and research centre are being established with EC support - though illiteracy at 20 per cent of the population is still a serious problem even if it affects mainly older generations of Madeirans. Moreover, a large proportion of EC-related investments have yet to be made, and the next few years will see development accelerate. That help will be vitally important as many of Madeira's traditional activities are declining or face an uncertain future as international competition intensifies. The completion of Europe's internal market by 1993 poses an additional challenge to Madeira. Agriculture is the second most important activity, employing 21 per cent of the workforce, but it is inefficient and hampered by difficult terrain - only one third of the land can be cultivated. Bananas are the main crop, contributing 45 per cent of the value of exports, but Madeira faces increasing competition from producers outside the EC. The area under banana cultivation is to be cut back, and quality raised in an effort to safeguard the crop's future. 'We can't stop producing bananas. If we stopped now, we would become a desert,' says Mr de Sousa. Madeira's famous fortified wine - not all of which is sweet - still accounts for almost 20 per cent of exports, but it is facing increasingly difficult market conditions in spite of attempts to promote it as an upmarket drink such as port. To overcome these drawbacks, the government is encouraging diversification into market gardening produce, other tropical fruit and exotic flowers, but in the long run agriculture is likely to lose more ground to newer industries. Traditional industries are also facing difficult times. Madeiran embroidery is renowned for its quality, but it has become dependent on Italy as its principal market, and even there, cheaper imports from China are undermining the future of Madeiran exports. Many believe the industry's survival is at stake as fewer people are willing to do the painstaking and poorly paid work involved, and as markets are undercut by the arrival of cheaper, if less elaborate, products from other sources. To compensate for the decline of traditional industries, the government is placing high hopes on tourism and the service industries, and on transforming Madeira into an international business centre. After several years of gestation, and slow beginnings, the offshore financial and services centre is finally taking off with 21 banks and more than 500 companies licensed to operate. The growth of a new industrial free trade zone in Canical, on the island's south-eastern coast, has been slower, with only 10 companies licensed. A new deep sea port at the site of the free zone will be completed in September, and work on modernising and expanding the international airport less than 10km away is due to begin later this year and to be completed by 1996. Along with other improvements to infrastructure and telecommunications, this should increase Madeira's attraction for companies. By bringing new industries to Madeira, the free zone is seen as a potentially important source of new jobs. It will also reduce pressure on Funchal which is fast becoming overcrowded and help to promote development in the eastern part of the island. But tourism will remain the most important activity. Its development will have to be carefully controlled if Madeira is to retain its attraction as a mid-market destination for those looking for quiet holidays in an attractive natural environment. Some diversification to encourage visitors in the low summer season, and conference-related travel, may also help, though again, it will need to be carefully thought out so as not to clash with maintaining Madeira's traditional clientele. The future is open, and Madeira is in the fortunate position of being able to make its choices now as it rides the crest of an expanding economy. Elections to the regional assembly are due in October and Mr Jardim's social democratic party is expected to increase its majority further. This gives the present team a unique opportunity to decide which way Madeira will go. Mr de Sousa says: 'This decade will be a crucial one for Madeira. At the end of it we will not be rich, but the most important things will have been done. I'm optimistic.'</p>

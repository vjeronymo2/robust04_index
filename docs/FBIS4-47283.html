K. Karklit, All-Union Institute of </F> Refractories; UDC 666.762.852.001.4]    [Abstract] Degradation processes were studied in silicon  carbide refractories exposed to high-temperature gas streams.  Fired and unfired specimens were made from powders with grain  sizes ranging from Nos. 3-125. The fired specimens were made  with either a silica or a nitride binder, or they were  siliconized (10-15% carbon in the refractory mass and  firing in  silicon vapors), and silica glass, bentonite, ferrosilicon, and  boron carbide were added to impart strength to the silica binder  and inhibit SiC oxidation. The unfired specimens were made with  Bakelite binder polymerized at 180-200C. Specimens of each  type of refractory with select physical and mechanical  properties were tested in a high- temperature (2650-2730 K) and  velocity (2300 m/s with a 1.2 air- fuel ratio) gas stream  created by igniting alcohol in oxygen (nearly 13%  O[.sub]2[/]). Test duration was 15 s, which is much shorter  than usual for this type of test. The specimens were  cylindrical, 50 mm long and 20-25 mm in diameter. Change in  specimen height during the 15-second test period was recorded  photographically. Oxidation of the SiC with the formation of  SiO, SiO[.sub]2[/], and CO was the main process resulting in  a dramatic alteration of the composition and properties of the  specimens in the layer below the one exposed to the gas stream.  The degradation processes occurred at the fastest rate within  the first 5 s, after which the rate stabilized. The silica  binder specimens had the greatest specimen height and mass loss  rates (0.88 and 1.92 average specimen height loss, in mm/s, and  degradation rate, in kg/sq m x s, respectively), followed by the  siliconized specimens (0.85 and 2.46) and those made with the  nitride (0.77, 1.81) or Bakelite binder (0.68, 1.63). The latter  also had less SiC oxidation and a correspondingly lower  proportion of SiO[.sub]2[/] in the layer concerned. Figures  9, tables 5; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

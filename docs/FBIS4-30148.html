			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam's land grabbing activities along the  eastern border in Memot District, Kompong Cham Province, are  spreading further without solution from any of the authorities.  Cambodians living in this area are very angry because they have  lost land on which they work to earn a living.    A rubber plantation official who requests anonymity says  that  in the past, standing on the mound in Bos Ta Kok village in Da  commune, Memot District, and looking toward the Daeum Dong  Prampil Daeum village, one can see the zinc-sheet covered roofs  of Vietnamese houses built along the border. This area is an  important smuggling point where Vietnamese wait to buy goods  from Cambodia.    Now some Vietnamese have trespassed and intruded into Bos Ta  Kok village in Da commune by clearing and leveling aroud 100  hectares of red earth and openly took over between 20 and 30  hectares of scattered rubber tree plots which had been the  property of an official named Ret. The rubber plantation  official also says that local people dare not poke their heads  into this area because nearly all of these land-grabbing  Vietnamese are armed. They look like an army unit. It is not  known yet what will be done with the plot of land the Vietnamese  have cleared and leveled, but latex is siphoned off daily.  These Vietnamese have let it be known that they will not  withdraw because this piece of land protrudes along the border  and they consider it theirs.    The rubber plantation official, quoting many local  residents,  says that it is not only land in the Bos Ta Kok area that the  Vietnamese have annexed; border markers along the entire  district border have been moved deep inside Cambodia. The  important thing is that along this border the Vietnamese have  deployed troops, disguised as civilians, for protection. They  are armed with assorted weapons, and at some places tanks have  been stationed in the trenches. Only their cannons can be seen.    Is the government aware of this land expropriation in Bos Ta  Kuk? Upon ceiving this information, please investigate and solve  the problem immediately. First of all, the district authority  has to immediately report to the Interior Ministry in order to  solve the problem through legal means.</p>

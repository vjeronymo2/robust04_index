			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada wins LWT News that Granada had won control over television station LWT after a hard-fought battle refocused attention on television stocks yesterday. Once leading LWT shareholder Mercury Asset Management had accepted the offer for its 14.2 per cent stake on Thursday, it was expected that Granada would win. But the leisure group will now be issuing 112m new shares to fulfil its 13-for-10 share offer. If some of the big LWT stakeholders - particularly the LWT management which has 10 per cent - decide to cash in the new shares there will be a big overhang of Granada stock in the market. Granada shares ticked off 3 after the announcement but closed a penny up at 561p. LWT ended 5 higher 731p. The denouement of the bid removes the last leading aggressor within the sector. Consequently, bid hopes that had surrounded Yorkshire Tyne Tees and Scottish receded. Yorkshire fell 16 to 327p, although Hoare Govett is believed to be preparing a buy note arguing that the stock is cheap at this level. Scottish dropped 23 to 551p. Carlton Communications bounced 28 1/2 to 945 1/2 p after recent underperformance. The shares were lifted by news that Disney is to release the film Snow White on video; Carlton produces all Disney's videos. Several analysts were also said to be preparing positive recommendations. Bioscience group Zeneca, which is expected to show profits of around Pounds 645m on Thursday, fell 3 to 752p. In spite of expectations of a healthy increase in full-year profits on Monday, Hong Kong bank HSBC fell 3 to 938p, the shares reacting to the latest slide in the Hong Kong market. Among other Hong Kong related stocks, Standard Chartered recovered from earlier weakness to close 3 ahead at 1227p but Cable &amp; Wireless slipped 10 to 459p. British Gas was the most heavily traded stock in London for the second day running. Consideration of Thursday's figures fuelled concern over the company's ability to maintain real dividend growth. NatWest Securities advised clients to maintain neutral to underweight positions while Merrill Lynch lowered its rating to short-term neutral from above average. The shares fell 10 to 318p on turnover of 14m. Royal Insurance showed a delayed reaction to a higher than anticipated dividend. Unable to respond on Thursday because of sharp falls in the market the stock bounced 14 to 292p yesterday. BZW and SGST reiterated buy recommendations. Elsewhere in the sector, Commercial Union improved 27 to 630p after Wednesday's big profit increase. Sun Alliance rose 10 to 349p, but General Accident eased 8 to 629p ahead of figures on Tuesday. It is expected to show a profit of Pounds 270m to Pounds 285m compared with a loss of Pounds 29.3m last time. The sector was unsettled by comments from Guardian Royal Exchange on Tuesday that insurance premiums appeared to be softening. GRE recovered 5 to 213p. A broker's report that gloom surrounding the Scotch whisky industry may soon lift added to a strong showing in the drinks sector. Grand Metropolitan, which said sales of its J&amp;B brand were up 3 per cent year-on-year, jumped 14 to 471p. Guinness gained 9 to 523p and Allied Lyons 10 to 615p. The report by Sutherland &amp; Partners forecast 'a modest recovery' for the UK industry this year after four years of decline. A big bounce in Forte was put down to a technical situation by dealers. 'A big buyer has shorted the market,' said one, adding that the shares had recently fallen and looked oversold. The shares climbed 12 to 259p with turnover hitting 3.2m. Regional hotelier Stakis added 2 to 86p after falling behind recently. The management were also involved in presentations around the City. Buying - and spurious talk of a possible takeover - receded in Carrs Milling and the shares slipped 9 to 208p. The stock had been bid up after Northern Foods sold its near 5 per cent stake in the pet food and bakery group earlier in the week. Hazlewood Foods gained 2 to 155p following an analysts' visit. Engineering group Siebe continued to sparkle and the shares gained another 11 to 605p, on hopes of a bullish presentation at SG Warburg on Friday. Materials group Cookson were in demand ahead of next week's results and the shares moved 6 ahead to 269p. Inchcape put on 4 to 555p with Robert Fleming said to be positive. Property leaders bounced following their recent weakness. British Land gained 5 to 433p after this week's purchase of a 30 per cent stake in developer Stanhope, off a penny at 40p. Land Securities rose 7 to 716p and MEPC 9 to 495p. The decision by building societies to either raise fixed mortgage rates or suspend some fixed mortgages altogether added to the interest rate uneasiness among housebuilders. Banner Homes shed 8 to 156p, Barratt 8 to 266p and Bryant 3 to 177p. Good results on Thursday helped Provident Financial shares to a rise of 23 to 522p. Other statistics, Page 13</p>

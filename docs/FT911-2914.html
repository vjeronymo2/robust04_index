			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK INDEX futures con-tinued to weaken yesterday as the market worried about the depth of the recession and the prospects for an immediate reduction in UK interest rates. The June FT-SE 100 index closed 12 points lower at 2,502 as a fall on Wall Street and a decline in sterling kept prices under pressure. June FT-SE remained at a weak premium to the spot FT-SE index, indicating nervousness in the futures market about the short-term outlook for UK shares. By the close, June was around 20 points above the spot index, compared with fair value of a 30-point premium. Traded options reflected growing unease over the market's longer-term prospects. Barclays de Zoete Wedd executed a large trade in the Euro FT-SE index options, involving the purchase of December 2,325 puts and sale of December 2,225 and 2,125 puts. The Euro FT-SE options accounted for 8,773 lots of the market's overall turnover of 28,409. Marks and Spencer was again traded actively, 1,644 contracts changing hands. Nomura has followed other securities houses in expanding its UK and European derivatives coverage. It has increased its derivatives team to 12 following the appointment of Mr Chris Broadhurst, formerly of Goldman Sachs, as senior manager in equity derivative sales.</p>

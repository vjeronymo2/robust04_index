			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Survey of Greece (6): Newcomers are making their presence felt - Banking WHATEVER may be happening elsewhere in the economy, Greek banking is thriving. Six new private banks have opened in the past two years, one state-controlled bank was privatised and three new foreign players joined the market. This adds up to a 30 per cent increase in Greek banking institutions. While it is true that the new banks are small operations, often with no more than the minimum capitalisation of Dr4bn (Dollars 21m) and only two or three branches, they are making their presence felt. It is not only foreign banks and larger private banks that are cutting costs and thinking hard about new products for a more competitive environment. The big state-controlled banks, which between them control some 75 per cent of assets and 80 per cent of loans, are at last starting to modernise. Life is easier for borrowers as a result, despite interest rates kept high by inflation. A year ago, rates for working capital hovered around 29 per cent, rising to more than 33 per cent when taxes and commissions were added. Now the basic rate is about 23 per cent, although this may depend on a corporate customer's bargaining power. 'It's a much healthier situation,' says one banker. 'But the mentality of corporate customers is changing, from relationship banking to shopping around for a particular deal.' One advantage enjoyed by the new banks is having to place only 20 per cent of their reserves in government paper, according to central bank requirements. The reserve ruling is being phased out altogether over the next year, but that is not much consolation for older banks which have 40 per cent of their reserves - the regulation amount until last year - tied up in Treasury bills. In 1991, the government arranged for Dr1,600bn of these reserves to be converted into medium-term bonds with a three- to seven-year maturity. The idea was that they should form the basis of a secondary market in government securities. But given the present squeeze in Greek financial markets, with the government financing the public sector wage and pension bills with monthly issues of T-bills at attractive rates, this plan proved too optimistic. Instead, the banks have turned to repos - fixed term selling and repurchase orders of government debt - in a big way. Government securities are still tax-free, which accounts for a flight of savings from the banks last year with the introduction of a 10 per cent tax on interest earnings on deposit accounts. Bank deposits grew overall by only 5.4 per cent in 1991 to Dr8,856bn. In the first two months of this year, they showed a decline of Dr105bn. The crowding-out effect, together with shrinking margins on traditional lending business, are making all Greek banks look more closely at fee-based activities. Spreads have fallen sharply as lending rates came down but the basic savings rate, set by the central bank, remained at 18 per cent. The new banks are setting up mutual funds and developing private banking as they try to find the right operating niche. Their specialities range from shipping lending to mortgage loans and consumer credit. Established banks, too, have launched mutual funds and moved into leasing and underwriting. In a country with only 2,400 bank branches to serve a population of 1m, there is plenty of room for banks to grow. Yet however successful they become, the private banks will find it increasingly hard to make headway if the big state banks focus on competing effectively. 'If the state banks can throw off their chains, they have the muscle to push the rest of us aside,' says a foreign banker. The impetus for reform at state-controlled banks is coming from new management appointed by the government last year, consisting of younger Greek bankers who were working abroad or for foreign banks in Athens. Under their guidance, the state banks have substantially increased their capital base over the past 18 months and raised provisions for doubtful loans. Following the example of some foreign banks, they have strengthened their dealing rooms to international standards. As long-overdue investment in new computers is made, automated telling machines are appearing around Athens branches and the leading tourist resorts. But no state bank has yet dared to suggest that cheque books and credit cards should replace the pass-book system, still the basis of personal banking in Greece. But the effects of change are beginning to show. Commercial Bank, the second biggest state bank, reported an 85 per cent increase in profits to Dr35bn. Its subsidiary, Ionian Bank, also did well with a 42 per cent rise to Dr15.65bn. Mr Takis Arapoglou, chairman of Ionian, says: 'We stopped the state bank accounting practice of accruing unpaid interest on non-performing loans. But we still have some way to go in clearing up our portfolio.' If the state banks are to have a chance of becoming efficient, two things must happen. First, regulations that make it virtually impossible for staff to be dismissed have to be revised, enabling operating costs to be cut. Like other public institutions, state banks are a target for making patronage appointments. Then the curious legal status of the state banks must be changed so that they can no longer be used as instruments of government policy. At present, the finance minister has a proxy vote on behalf of their main shareholders - the state-controlled insurance companies and welfare funds, the universities, even the Orthodox Church. So far the government has proved reluctant to give up this privilege and set the state banks free.</p>

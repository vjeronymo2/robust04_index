			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maryana Chorna: "The Supreme Council Has </F> Proceeded From Frictions to Factions. 'Clannishness' Has Begun"]    [Text] Kiev-Lvov--On the very first day of the  session of the new Supreme Council, it became clear that the  flow of Ukrainian politics had ultimately split into two  streams--the one that is next to the microphone and the one that  is beyond it. The first works for the benefit of television,  whereas the second works for the benefit of history.    At the front stage, next to the microphone, a provisional  presidium consisting of the representatives of leftist,  rightist, and centrist forces was elected in a traditional  manner. Meanwhile, in the space away from the microphone, the  civilized process of the formation of parliamentary factions and  groups of deputies went on. The Supreme Council gave its  preference to the association of people's deputies on the basis  of their political sympathies rather than along regional or clan  lines, thus breaking down the walls between oblast delegations  and setting the minimum strength of a faction at 25 persons.  This was a favorable solution not only because it would stop the  "Brownian motion" characteristic of the previous Supreme  Council, but also because, having structured itself, the  parliament will for the first time reveal to the voters its  true, although terrifying, identity. Small deputy groups which  do not have the needed 25 persons will be forced to choose  between ideologically similar allies and the heroic fate of Don  Quixote. It appears that the new reality will alter the party  array of Ukrainian politics beyond recognition. No trace of the  old parties will remain half a year from now. New political  bearings will call for new leaders.    The formation of the Reforms deputy group, in which two  reformist centers joined, is considered to be the most prominent  among the latest events away from the microphone. The centers  had peacefully drifted through Ukrainian politics without  drawing closer to each other prior to that. Two presidents--of  the Market Reforms Foundation and the Foundation in Support of  Reforms--Volodymyr Lanovyy and Viktor Pynzenyk, united in a  single parliamentary group, having neglected the intense issues  of leadership. Serhiy Sobolev (the We electoral association from  Zaporozhye) became the coordinator of the bloc. Rule-of-law  democracy and economic reform are the political priorities of  the Lanovyy-Pynzenyk alliance; their accomplishment is  guaranteed by lawyers, economists, and politicians well known in  Ukraine who became members of the Reforms deputy group--Serhiy  Holovatyy, Viktor Shyshkin, Taras Stetskiv, and Hryhoriy  Omelchenko. It is paradoxical, but a few deputies who were  supported during the election by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists] signed the statement on the creation of the  Reforms group. Having covered all of Ukraine, from the Donbass  to the Carpathian Mountains, with authoritative individuals, the  Reforms group has firmly taken the position of the political  center.    The prototype of the Statehood deputy group, with which 16  deputies announced their affiliation as of 13 May, is found to  the right of the Reforms. A group of deputies who are URP  [Ukrainian Republican Party] members initiated the creation of  the group. Statehood includes deputies from Right-Bank Ukraine  and focuses its attention on preserving the integrity of Ukraine  and separating it from the Russian umbilical cord. If the group  fails to reach the 25-person cutoff, most of its members will  undoubtedly migrate to the Pynzenyk-Lanovyy alliance.    An association that survived under the rubble of the MBR  [Interregional Bloc for Reforms] and merged with the remnants of  the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in the  Unity group shows the opposite tendency. Valeriy Babych, who  inherited from the MBR a program of federalization and the  closest possible relations with Moscow, was destined to become  its leader rather than Hrynyov or Kuchma. Contrary to its name,  the Unity group is a motley, unstable parliamentary creation in  whose entrails the replenishment for adjacent parliamentary  groups will always be growing.    As of 17 March, the documents of the MDF-Center faction,  headed by Leonid Kuchma--yet another MBR splinter--were also  sitting in the secretariat of the Supreme Council.    The Center deputy group promises to be the heavy artillery  of  Ivan Plyushch on the parliamentary front. Its foundation  consists of the party of power of all hues, which has roots in  the most remote nooks and crannies of our state. This  association will suffice for two parliamentary groups. The  Plyushch party will certainly take advantage of this,  considering that two groups mean two votes in the presidium.    The quality of the cadre composition of the  Communist-Socialist-Peasant swarm of people's deputies dictates  its own laws of association in the left wing of the Supreme  Council. More respectable Socialists might want to dissociate  themselves from the clamorous Communist limited-liability  company, but they are lacking five or six individuals in order  to form a faction. They would have taken in several of the most  reasonable Communists, but Lenin's tribe would not want to palm  off less than 20 on them, fearing an independent game of the  Moroz party.    The Communist Party has decided not to go for small change  and to face the parliamentary trial as the monolithic bloc For  Social Justice and People's Power (95 persons).    In turn, it is very doubtful that there will be enough  radicals to create their own group. They will hardly scrape up  25 persons even if the combined UKRP [Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party], the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] and all  nationally concerned Rukh members (of the Host of Volyn kind)  belong to it. The KUN with its deputies firmly sat down between  two stools. They will now either have to place themselves under  Khmara, having ultimately left the democratic camp, or honestly  join the pole of Statehood, having forsaken nationalist  principles. Actually, it will be both. Understandably, this  current in the parliament will not transcend the borders of  Western Ukraine, as it remains a single-region, marginal  problem. While lively packs of deputies from more abundant blocs  vigorously milled around the hallways, the "heroes of all times  and nations" remained in ominous solitude.    As always, Rukh is in a haze. God only knows whom its people  will join. The bright star of Serhiy Holovatyy is already  shining in someone else's sky. The radicals are looking toward  the door; Ivan Zayets is quarreling with the "great hetman"; it  is unknown what is next.    The migration of deputies in the corridors revealed what it  should have revealed--an array of forces in Ukraine to which no  external movements and parties correspond. There is a clearly  defined liberal center, which has struck equally powerful roots  in the east and the west. The spectrum between Lanovyy and  Pynzenyk holds everything--from Donetsk to Lvov. The  post-Communist camp is to the left of them. Geographically, this  means the center of the Right Bank and the Left Bank.  Politically, it means the party of power and its immediate  environs all the way to the Labor Congress. Further on, the  steppes of the Left Bank and the south are represented by  leftist extremists drawing on a powerful stratum of the local  Russian-speaking underclass. Ukrainian national democrats who  cultivate the political values of statehood, that is,  Christian-Democratic values in European terms, are located to  the right of the center, to the right of the steep bank of the  Dnieper. All key Ukrainian parties have placed themselves under  this common denominator. The extreme radicals rave on the left  and right banks. Those on the Right Bank draw on the "nationally  aware" underclass which is socially symmetrical to its Donbass  counterpart but is separated from it by an insurmountable  barrier of "nationalist" demagoguery on one side and  "internationalist" demagoguery on the other. Amid all of this,  the pro-Russian camp proper, which is concerned about just one  problem--how to go back to the condition from before 1  December--springs about on the Left Bank. This company embraces  everything--from the Civic Congress to what remains of the MBR.  The system of factions in the new parliament that was approved  right away will force our politicians to occupy a niche in one  of the blocs one way or the other, and will thus slow down the  process of "building a party for yet another charismatic  leader," which will be worse for the leaders and better for the  people. So far, this process has developed in the space away  from the microphone. However, it will shortly reverberate in the  parliament one way or the other.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Bausch and Lomb Indian venture to make Ray-Ban sunglasses BAUSCH and Lomb India, a joint venture between the Indian Bhai Manjit Singh group and the US eyecare company, yesterday formally inaugurated India's first integrated plant to manufacture eyecare products, including Ray-Ban sunglasses, at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan. The plant, with an investment of Rs290m (Dollars 10.2m), is also Bausch and Lomb's first attempt at setting up an integrated optics plant, manufacturing on one site a range of eyecare products such as soft contact lenses, cleaning solutions, deproteinising tablets, metallic frames and Ray-Ban sunglasses. The US company has a 39.9 per cent equity stake in Bausch and Lomb India, with an initial investment of Dollars 1.10m. While the agreement was signed in 1990, test marketing for the products began in June this year. The company is the first to introduce ready-to-wear soft contact lenses onto the Indian market - lenses would otherwise be made to order. The joint venture is part of Bausch and Lomb's plan to establish itself in markets in different parts of the world, where the market for contact lenses and other eyecare products is underdeveloped. In the past few years, Bausch and Lomb has begun developing the untapped markets of Turkey, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Venezuela. Mr Daniel E Gill, chairman and chief executive of Bausch and Lomb, said that the Indian venture is a logical extension of this globalisation.</p>

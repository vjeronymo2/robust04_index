			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD IS BLOCKED OFF TO THE COCAINE TRADE  </P> <P> Unable to halt a tide of drive-through drug traffic in a four-block area of  Sepulveda known by cocaine buyers and peddlers as "C Street," Los Angeles  officials blocked off the streets Tuesday to prevent the criminals from getting  in.  </P> <P> At 9:30 a.m. police began setting up barricades at entrances to the Columbus  Avenue neighborhood at Nordhoff Street, Rayen Street, Sepulveda Boulevard and  Parthenia Street.  </P> <P> Officials said a force of 12 police officers will man the roadblocks and patrol  the four-block area on foot and in cars 24 hours a day. Police would not say  how long the barricades and the officers will stay in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The street blockade is similar to the "Neighborhood Rescue Operation" launched  by police in a drug and gang-riddled neighborhood near MacArthur Park near  downtown last month.  </P> <P> Police said the Columbus Avenue neighborhood, just three blocks east of the San  Diego Freeway, has been the "hot spot" in the San Fernando Valley for drug  dealing. A Valley narcotics unit had been making about 50 arrests a month on  the two-block stretch of Columbus.  </P> <P> And while police said the recent addition of officers on foot beats in the  neighborhood had slowed drug and gang crimes, the problems have stubbornly  persisted, prompting the roadblocks.  </P> <P> "It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in our society that we are  closing streets off," said Police Lt. Gary Rogness, head of a Valley-based  narcotics unit. "But it is a measure that needs to be taken in that area to  restore the neighborhood."  </P> <P> The police received no resistance to the barricades from residents of the  neighborhood Tuesday. Many who stood by during a press conference at Columbus  and Nordhoff termed the efforts overdue but possibly not enough.  </P> <P> Edward Greva, 77, said he welcomed the barricades and the increased police  presence. He said he takes daily walks in his neighborhood, but never at night.  </P> <P> "You'd be a fool to go out at night," he said. "This is a tough neighborhood.  At night you hear hollering like mad out on the street. There are gunshots."  </P> <P> When police put barricades up in a Pico-Union neighborhood near MacArthur Park  on Oct. 19, officials reported an immediate slowdown in drug and gang activity.  </P> <P> The same effect was predicted for Columbus Avenue, which has become known as "C  Street" among the cocaine buyers and sellers, police said.  </P> <P> "We anticipate it will be controlled almost immediately," said Capt. Mark  Stevens, commanding officer of the Devonshire Division.  </P> <P> Stevens said the streets were closed under a 30-day emergency permit from the  city Department of Transportation. He said the Police Department will seek  approval of permanent closure of the streets through the City Council.  </P> <P> Stevens said only residents of the neighborhood, their friends and people who  have business in the neighborhood will be allowed to enter through a checkpoint  at Rayen Street and Sepulveda Boulevard.  </P> <P> However, the checkpoint was informal in practice on Tuesday. Officers did not  check the identification of those requesting entrance to the neighborhood.  Those who said they lived there were waved through after being told what the  roadblock operation was about.  </P> <P> Authorities said neighborhood enforcement efforts will continue even after  visible criminal activities drop.  </P> <P> "It can't be a one-time effort," said Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district  includes the neighborhood. "It has to be sustained. Today is the beginning of  an ongoing effort."  </P></p>

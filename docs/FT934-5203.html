			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Councils link to boost economy Swindon, Bristol and Gloucester yesterday launched a joint initiative to address the economic issues facing their region. A declaration supporting the so-called West of England Initiative was signed by councillors from Thamesdown, the borough council for Swindon, and the two cities. Backing is also expected from Bath City Council. The initiative is intended to work with the Western Development Partnership, an agency set up to provide a regional forum, and with businesses, local authorities, Training and Enterprise Councils and higher education. It reflects growing awareness in the west of England that more regional co-operation on strategic issues is needed.</p>

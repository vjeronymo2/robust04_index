			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Greenpeace attacks Waste Management on eve of flotation GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, is renewing its attack on the US methods of Waste Management (WMI), the world's largest waste disposer, which is raising Pounds 450m for European expansion. But WMI has accused Greenpeace of 'outrageous manipulation of information'. In today's statement, timed to influence the flotation of 20 per cent of WMI's international operations on April 7, Greenpeace is warning European investors to 'consider the dangerous practices' of the US group. The share sale, valuing WMI at more than Pounds 2bn, in one of the largest flotations in recent years, will be achieved through a placing in London and offers for sale elsewhere including the US. Earlier this year Waste Management and Wessex Water, its partner in a joint venture set up last year, refuted allegations in a Greenpeace report on WMI's operation in the US. 'Greenpeace's stated belief is that NO waste disposal is acceptable because the group maintains that waste simply should not be produced,' said WMI. Greenpeace has claimed that WMI paid Dollars 45m (Pounds 25.9m) in US-related environmental penalties and settlements during the 1980s. According to WMI, the Dollars 45m included capital costs of meeting ever-tightening environmental standards. Waste Management said it had a 'good relationship' with most environmental organisations, and consultants Arthur D Little had conducted an external audit which placed WMI 'firmly among the leaders of industry as a whole with regard to corporate environmental management'. Last December Chicago-based WMI paid a Dollars 1.9m penalty after a consent decree - a form of out of court settlement - following what it called a difference in interpretation of the laws at its Sauget, Illinois, hazardous waste incineration plant. The case revolved around alleged violations of the operating permits at the facility and carbon monoxide levels in its incinerator. WMI said the CO levels had not constituted a threat to the environment. In 1990, WMI paid a Dollars 3.75m penalty in connection with operating procedures at its Chicago hazardous waste incineration plant.</p>

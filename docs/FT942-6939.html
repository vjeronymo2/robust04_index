			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Seeking the profitable route Mr Patrick Ponsolle says he is attracted by difficult challenges. His appointment yesterday as co-chairman of Eurotunnel, with the task of helping to steer it to profit, would appear to fit the bill. In succeeding Mr Andre Benard, who is stepping down from the position at the age of 71, Mr Ponsolle does, however, have some cards up his sleeve. 'He is well-connected, has a lot of financial experience and is very ambitious', says a former colleague from Cie de Suez, where Mr Ponsolle, 49, has spent much of his career. The first two attributes are largely the result of his time at Suez, the powerful industrial and financial group where Mr Ponsolle rose to the position of managing director. But they also reflect a stint in government administration. After graduating from the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground for many of France's top civil servants, he worked in the economics ministry, serving as an aide to Mr Laurent Fabius, the socialist budget minister who later became prime minister. 'He is a quintessential product of the French financial establishment', says one French banker - referring to Mr Ponsolle's track record. This, along with his connections, is likely to prove an asset in the financial and commercial negotiations with which he will now be faced. 'It will be much harder for French banks and institutions to say no to Ponsolle than to Benard, who was a relative outsider', says one member of the underwriting syndicate for Eurotunnel's rights issue. If Mr Ponsolle is widely known, however, he is also widely known for being ambitious - a factor which helps explain his departure from Suez. One of the favourites to replace Mr Renaud de la Geniere as chairman of the financial group in 1990, the appointment of Mr Gerard Worms blocked Mr Ponsolle's path to the top job. 'He had hoped for the big prize and it is no surprise that he has looked somewhere else', says one former colleague. In his new job, which will start in July, Mr Ponsolle says he will work alongside Sir Alastair Morton, the British co-chairman, and Mr Georges Christian Chazot, the managing director. 'We will form a trio, sans problemes', he forecast yesterday. He has few illusions, however, about the task that awaits him. 'The first steps have been taken, but there is a lot of hard work to do.' If he succeeds, he will be fulfilling the ambitions of his former employer. After the nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1957, Mr Jacques George-Picot, then head of Suez, declared his determination to build a tunnel under the channel. Mr Ponsolle inherits a tunnel, he must now make it pay.</p>

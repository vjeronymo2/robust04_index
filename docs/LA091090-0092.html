			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> UNEVEN TRIO OF SITCOMS FROM CBS, NBC  </P> <P> The curtain goes up on three new comedies tonight. Starting with the best and  working downhill. . . .  </P> <P> Lenny Callahan needs money to help pay for his father's operation and is angry  that he can't get a loan:  </P> <P> "I'm being rejected by S &amp; Ls run by convicted felons who steal from their  own customers and then ask the government to bail 'em out with my tax dollars.  Pardon me, but this is a load of crap that wouldn't fit in a Winnebago."  </P> <P> His wife, Shelly, wants to know if he means a full-sized Winnebago.  </P> <P> All right!  </P> <P> Starring comedian Lenny Clarke as a hardhat who moonlights as a doorman,  "Lenny" is a somehow-enjoyable, rough-around-the-edges, loud-mouthed CBS comedy  that sort of bullies its way into your heart. It premieres at 8:30 tonight  (Channels 2 and 8), to return Sept. 19 in its regular 8 p.m. Wednesday time  period.  </P> <P> Get the earmuffs ready. I mean, this Lenny is just too noisy and intense to be  endured for more than a few minutes, right? Actually, no -- he grows on you.  And much of what he utters -- to his wife, kids, mother and father -- are  monologues that epitomize the frustrations of working-class America.  </P> <P> Although sometimes seeming to try too hard, Clarke is mostly terrific. Watching  him work is like watching a burly bouncer snap off one-liners, and Lee  Garlington is swell as his wryly humorous wife.  </P> <P> The premiere is uneven, its laughs easily able to fit inside a Winnebago.  However, Lenny has some very nice moments with his father (Eugene Roche), and  his relationship with his slug of a brother (Peter Dobson) -- whose pouffed-up  hair looks like it's held in place by Krazy Glue -- is just a sketch.  </P> <P> Give this man a loan. This is a series with promise.  </P> <P> "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is being touted as a sure hit. If it becomes one, it  will be because of the raw likability of its star, rapper Will Smith, not  because of his acting skills or even anything that's been written for him in  this NBC comedy that premieres at 8 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39.  </P> <P> The tall, gangly Smith (better known as Fresh Prince) plays a Philadelphia  street kid named Wil who is packed off by his mother to live with a rich aunt  and uncle in Bel Air. This is set up in the opening credits, which are longer  than some series.  </P> <P> The adjustment isn't easy. Right away, Wil can't tolerate the butler ("I will  show you to your room, Master William"). But the big clash is with his snooty  uncle (whose pretentious dinner party he is forced to attend) and his preppy  and materialistic cousins.  </P> <P> Street smarts triumph over upper crust, however. Soon, Wil is "maxin' and  relaxin'," and you with him, all the while enjoying this charmingly irreverent  guy a lot, even though the premiere is tainted by buffoonish caricatures of the  rich and phony and a script that is only moderately amusing.  </P> <P> Enough of the big three networks losing viewers to the brash programming on  Fox. No more Mr. Nice Guy.  </P> <P> "Uncle Buck," for example, is CBS' reply to the raunchiness of Fox's hit  "Married . . . With Children." The trouble is that although "Uncle Buck" is not  as boorish as "Married . . . With Children," it also is not nearly as funny.  </P> <P> In fact, "Uncle Buck" is not funny at all. Even having a character named Mrs.  Crappier doesn't make it funny. Premiering at 8 tonight on Channels 2 and 8,  it's less a comedy than a slobedy, a gross sitcom-version of the John Candy  movie about an irreverently snidecracking, slovenly hulk of a man who becomes  the guardian of his nephew and two nieces.  </P> <P> TV's Uncle Buck (Kevin Meaney) repeatedly blows cigar smoke into their faces.  But it's CBS that's blowing smoke -- into the faces of viewers by even airing  this half-hour of bilge, whose tone is set by these episode-opening words from  6-year-old Maizy (Sarah Martinek): "Miles, you suck!"  </P> <P> CBS says this is all right because 6-year-olds talk like this in real life,  and, of course, its mission is to reflect reality. Uh huh. Soon after, Buck  uproariously squirts mustard into his own face, meanwhile, it's time for, yes,  the obligatory Tender Moment, when his essential goodness is revealed and we  all reach for our hankies.  </P> <P> To puke in.  </P></p>

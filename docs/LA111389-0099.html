			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SALVADOR OFFENSIVE MOVES INTO SUBURBS; OVER 150 DEAD IN HEAVY REBEL FIGHTING  </P> <P> Government troops fired on leftist guerrillas from helicopter gunships in the  suburbs of San Salvador today in their attempt to defeat a rebel offensive that  left at least 150 dead in the heaviest fighting of the 10-year-old civil war.  </P> <P> Sporadic bursts of machine-gun and mortar fire echoed through the city as  rebels dug into positions and the government tried to rout them.  </P> <P> Rightist President Alfredo Cristiani, whose U.S.-backed government had been  holding peace talks with the guerrillas until last Wednesday, declared a state  of siege Sunday and the military imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew.  </P> <P> The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrillas started the  operation with attacks on Cristiani's official and private residences Saturday  night, but the president was not harmed.  </P> <P> Among the dead was an American, identified as Christopher Babcock of Washington  state, a teacher at the American School in San Salvador, who was hit in the  head by a grenade fragment.  </P> <P> An FMLN spokesman, Arnaldo Ramos, said in a television interview that the  offensive began because "the government has presented proposals that demand  surrender" and because of an Oct. 31 bomb attack in which 10 people were killed  at a leftist union headquarters.  </P> <P> U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the number of dead in the  offensive may be as high as 300, including civilians, guerrillas and soldiers,  with more than 300 wounded.  </P> <P> A Reuters photographer saw at least five military helicopters firing into the  streets in the eastern suburb of Soyapango today, scene of some of the heaviest  fighting.  </P> <P> Reports of fighting outside the capital were sketchy, but the guerrillas were  said to have attacked army barracks throughout the country and military sources  said fighting continued in several areas.  </P> <P> The United States, which gives El Salvador about $1 million a day, blamed  Nicaragua, Cuba and unidentified Soviet Bloc countries for aiding the attacks.  </P> <P> But presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the Salvadoran government  seemed to have the crisis under control and that U.S. involvement in the  fighting was "not anticipated."  </P></p>

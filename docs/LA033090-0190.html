			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MAPPLETHORPE CONFLICT RAGES ON  </P> <P> Opponents of a planned exhibition of photographs by the late Robert  Mapplethorpe denounced a group of the pictures Thursday as encouraging child  pornography and damaging to community standards.  </P> <P> "I am firmly convinced that this exhibit has no place in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> The offensive parts of the exhibition are not art and show bad judgment by  those who seek to exhibit them," Donald Klekamp, a Cincinnati lawyer, said  angrily at a news conference.  </P> <P> Klekamp and others at the news conference called on the Contemporary Arts  Center to remove sexually graphic pictures from the exhibit, planned for April  6 through May 25.  </P> <P> Nine of the 175 photographs planned in the Arts Center's exhibition depict  homoerotic or sadomasochistic sex acts or include nude children. The museum  plans to post a warning sign and won't admit unaccompanied minors.  </P> <P> Police and the Hamilton County sheriff have said they are considering filing  obscenity charges if the museum displays the photographs. The museum filed a  lawsuit this week asking for a jury to decide before the show opens whether the  pictures are obscene.  </P></p>

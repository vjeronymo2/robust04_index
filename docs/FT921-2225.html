			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology: Computer auditors take a fresh look at the books A new report* which is likely to set global standards for the audit and security of IT systems was launched in the UK this week. Systems Auditability and Control (SAC), published by the Institute of Internal Auditors, is the first study for 15 years to present auditors with a comprehensive analysis of risks and best practices in the control of IT. Its predecessor in 1977 became the standard reference work for computer auditors. The 1992 version, launched at Compacs, the IIA's annual conference, is designed to be of wider appeal reflecting a trend for auditors to cover both IT and non-IT aspects. SAC has a trenchant message for managers. Some 40 per cent of IT systems fail to meet business requirements, it says, while only 11 per cent of organisations operate effective controls during systems development. Many new systems are late, overrun their budget or are abandoned before completion. 'This is not the auditor's responsibility - it's top management's,' says David Bentley, chief internal auditor at Leeds Permanent Building Society, and chairman of Compacs. Specific IT risks identified by SAC include: poor controls in end-user systems; the openness of systems to intruders; impaired accuracy and integrity of data; and interruption of business due to system or network failure. SAC also details the use of IT in auditing. 'There's no way we can audit a mass of networks and computer systems using traditional techniques,' says Charles Le Grand, director of research at the IIA. SAC is based on a survey of 400 companies worldwide including Rolls Royce, Lloyds Bank and British Petroleum in the UK. It was launched in the US last May and is being translated into French, Japanese and German. *The SAC report, Pounds 147 for IIA-UK members, Pounds 175 for non-members, is available from: The Institute of Internal Auditors - UK, 13 Abbeville Mews, 88 Clapham Park Road, London SW4 7BX.</p>

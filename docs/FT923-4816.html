			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Small boat on a stormy sea: Sweden's economic malaise Sweden is in the middle of a severe economic crisis which the centre-right government of Mr Carl Bildt believes can be solved without abandoning free-market policies. The Stockholm bourse has fallen 3.3 per cent this week, although it rose slightly yesterday, and short-term interest rates of more than 14 per cent are some of the highest in western Europe. The disclosure on Tuesday by Sweden's Central Bank that SKr22bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in capital flowed out of the country last week, forcing it to raise base rates by 3 percentage points to 16 per cent, has done nothing to calm jittery foreign exchange markets. Likening his country to a small cargo boat in stormy seas, Mr Bildt says SKr30bn of cuts in government spending over the next three years, already announced, and cuts in corporate taxation from 30 per cent to 25 per cent should reassure foreign investors. Certainly there are some positive economic indicators. Inflation is running at an annual average of less than 3 per cent, the visible trade balance of SKr41bn is strong, household savings have risen by 2.3 per cent this year, and there has been an improvement of 3 per cent in manufacturing productivity. Over the past 11 months the government has launched a series of measures designed to open the country to the rigours of market forces. These include privatising its 35 state-dominated companies, abolishing restrictions on foreign ownership of Swedish companies, and the removal of the tax on share dealings. This autumn a package is promised to increase the supply of venture capital available for small and medium-sized companies. However, many observers believe Mr Bildt faces severe problems in parliament over the next few months if he tries to implement the unpopular programmes needed to tackle Sweden's budget deficit, which could be as high as SKr160bn-SKr180bn in the current financial year or about 8 per cent of GDP. Last year the figure was SKr70bn. An estimated half of the deficit arises from falling tax revenues because of the recession and the cost of funding unemployment benefit. The rest stems from the extravagant transfer payments of Sweden's welfare state. 'What I cannot understand is why the market should react now to our political situation when it did not do so before,' complains Mr Bildt. He argues his four-party coalition has always lacked an overall parliamentary majority and has had to rely on support either from the right-of-centre New Democracy party or the Social Democratic opposition. But co-operation remains difficult, partly because of the personality clash between Mr Bildt and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader. Last night, however, the Social Democrats called on the government for all-party talks on a national agreement to solve the economic troubles. Political anxieties are of little concern to Sweden's central bank. It is worried about the government's commmitment to reducing the budget deficit, and fears that ministers believe it will correct itself when economic recovery eventually arrives. Mr Bengt Dennis, the bank's governor, provided a breathing space for the government to decide deficit-trimming policies with last week's interest rate rise - but so far the move has had little effect. The government believes the bank should deal with the short-term difficulties of capital outflow while it concentrates on implementing its medium-term free-market strategy. Since July 1989, when Sweden abolished its foreign exchange controls, the country has survived five financial crises, each of which has seen substantial capital outflows. Compounding the current financial crisis are the depth and persistence of Sweden's recession which has severely hit the manufacturing sector with plant closures and bankruptcies. In addition, the financial system is in crisis, with huge loan losses from property speculation in the late 1980s hitting many banks and insurance companies. At the moment the government refuses to change course. Some observers believe Sweden will either have to devalue its currency or accept an austerity programme to cut the budget deficit. Mr Bildt believes 'there is no alternative' to his free-market reforms. But unless the markets settle down, he may be blown off course, plunging Sweden into a political, as well as an economic, crisis.</p>

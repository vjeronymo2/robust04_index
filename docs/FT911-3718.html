			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / CBI finds upbeat outlook on R&amp;D: Survey contrasts sharply with last month's gloomy report from the Lords A SURPRISINGLY upbeat picture of investment in innovation by UK businesses, in spite of the recession, emerges from a survey by the Confederation of British Industry. According to the CBI's second annual innovation trends survey, 55 per cent of UK manufacturing companies are satisfied that their spending on innovation is adequate to meet future competitive pressures, while 37 per cent think it is inadequate. The survey contrasts sharply with the tone of last month's House of Lords report on innovation in manufacturing industry, which claimed that British-owned manufacturing industry could almost disappear if the government did not abandon its 'hands-off' attitude. Mr John Banham, CBI director-general, said yesterday there was no sense of complacency in its trends survey. He added: 'The facts do not sit well with the conclusions of the Lords committee - translated into plain English they were wrong'. Mr Banham said UK businesses spent Pounds 6.5bn on research and development in 1989, a higher proportion of gross domestic product than any other European Community country except Germany. The survey showed that on balance this was being maintained last year. 'All is by no means gloom and doom, which is what you might conclude if you were an avid reader of the Lords report,' he said. Two thirds of the 336 companies taking part in the survey spent up to 5 per cent of sales on innovation - which is defined as the development of new products, processes and services - and just over one fifth spent up to 10 per cent. The survey identified a marked trend downwards in the use of consultants and a rise in expenditure on joint ventures or co-operation with other companies, particularly overseas. New regulations, especially tougher environmental rules, were seen by some companies as an opportunity and by others as a threat. Mrs Fiona Steele, CBI's head of technology and innovation policy, said the survey showed that UK companies saw an increasing competitive threat from EC and other UK companies, rather than from Japan and the US. She cautioned, however, that the survey was intended to identify trends rather than absolute values. The survey was carried out in October and November and follows a more limited pilot study of trends in 1989. It is sponsored for five years by National Westminster Bank's technology unit.

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / US trade deficit narrows THE US trade deficit was Dollars 8.3bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in September, Dollars 300m lower than in August but still one of the biggest in two years, according to the Commerce Department. The slight narrowing reflected unexpected strength in exports, which rose 6.8 per cent from August to Dollars 38.2bn, a record in cash terms. The improvement was broadly based. Imports rose 4 per cent to Dollars 46.5bn, also a cash record. The increase was concentrated in consumer goods. Longer-term trends point to a deterioration. Adjusting for the volatility of monthly figures, exports have barely risen since the spring, while imports have increased sharply. The deficit for the first nine months was Dollars 60.1bn, compared with Dollars 49.2bn in the same period last year. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday said the US credit crunch had shown no evidence of worsening in recent months and may be abating, Reuter reports from Washington. He said banks were more able to speed up lending to spur growth.</p>

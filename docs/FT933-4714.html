			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Croatia becomes Balkan villain: Zagreb seems destined to join Belgrade in international isolation THE Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, has so far avoided punishment for the violent partition of Bosnia in spite of all the western outcry over the Bosnian war in recent months. But failing a radical policy shift, Croatia seems destined soon to join Serbia in international isolation. As the escalation in fighting in central Bosnia shows, Croatia has fulfilled all the criteria that earned Serbia its punitive sanctions last year. Croatian regular army units are backing their Bosnian proxies in a bid to carve out a Croatian mini-state. Relief officials have accused the Croatian Defense Unit (HVO), Bosnian Croat forces, of 'ethnically cleansing' Moslems from villages. Meanwhile, Mr Tudjman this week reiterated his refusal to hand over territory to his Moslem adversaries, in defiance of appeals and threats from the international community to make some concessions to the mainly Moslem Bosnian republic seeking to revive the Geneva peace talks. 'Moslems are demanding part of the coast which would amount to a territorial division of Croatia,' said Mr Tudjman, indicating his belief that the Croat areas of Bosnia were already part of a Croat state. So far western governments have avoided talking about sanctions against the Croats too openly, partly because of strong opposition from Germany. But with the breakdown in talks, the momentum appears to be growing, not least because sanctions could yet provide an easier option than air strikes to swallow. For a western public accustomed to seeing the Serbs as the main villains in the conflict, Mr Tudjman's intransigence is perhaps surprising. However, his position is not new. The main difference between Croatian and Serbian policies towards Bosnia is quantitative. The Serbian army is better armed, bigger and has seized three times as much territory. But the politics of destruction have become devastatingly similar. In March 1991 Serb and Croat leaders met in the Serbian resort of Karadjordjevo to plot Bosnia's two-way split. Their plans were postponed three months later when the rebellion of Serbs in Croatia, backed by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, erupted into full-scale war against Zagreb, leaving Serb rebels in control of almost one-third of Croatian territory under the nominal supervision of a 15,000-strong force of UN peacekeepers. However, his announcement this summer in Geneva of a Serb-Croat plan to partition Bosnia fuelled concerns among the Moslems in Bosnia, and sparked ire among Croatian politicians. Mr Tudjman makes no secret of his assumption the Croat regions in Bosnia will be part of Croatia, but the Serb declaration of a state in Croatia has left him in an increasingly difficult position on Bosnia. Most Croat politicians in Zagreb, except for the powerful 'Hercegovina lobby', have opposed Mr Tudjman's moves to carve up Bosnia. Some nationalists have rejected the partition because their vision of a Greater Croatia includes all of Bosnia. But most fear that the republic's division sets a dangerous precedent for the similar transformation of Croatia into a confederation with Serb rebels. While it seems that Greater Croatia is within his grasp, Mr Tudjman is playing a risky game. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday urged the UN Security Council in New York to demand an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the republic by invoking the threat of air strikes, Reuter reports from Washington. Today Mr Izetbegovic is due to meet President Bill Clinton at the White House.</p>

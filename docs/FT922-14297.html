			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: White Oak Project - Ballet After Swan Lake, what? For those great dancers who left the security and predictability of Soviet ballet, the West offered change and challenge - and routine. Makarova, Nureyev, Baryshnikov, in their very different ways, sought to escape from the classic treadmill to which their gifts and their public image condemned them. For Mikhail Baryshnikov the need has been to reconcile what his dance genius dictated - which was the most disciplined, yet the most ardently daring ventures into classicism - with what must come after, when the wise artist accepts that his gifts have changed physical gear. Hence Baryshnikov's interest in the work of Mark Morris, most sympathetic (because musical and imaginative in steps) of the new generation of post-modern creators. For American Ballet Theatre, when Baryshnikov was its director, came Morris's fluent Drink to me Only. With Morris, when he was at La Monnaie in Brussels three years ago, Baryshnikov found a fascinating persona as the tense private-eye of Wonderland. Lately the two men have united in the White Oak Dance Project, a modern dance ensemble which surrounds and complements Baryshnikov as performer, with Morris providing the chief choreographic identity. Its first London appearance on Thursday night was schizoid. The evening began with the statutory 'introducing the company' romp. The audience - who could not, surely, have been expecting the ci-devant Baryshnikov - see nine dancers in undress of tee-shirts and black tights, thumping about in Morris's little Canonic 3/4 Studies. These are tiny, laboured jokes in which Baryshnikov looks like a monarch slumming, and worse is to come. Rob Besserer is involved in a fatuous mime scene by Meredith Monk, and Carol Parker, topless but in a tarlatan skirt, her face bandaged, is called upon to impersonates a senile ballerina in Martha Clarke's vulgar Nocturne. It contrives to be pointless, vulgar, and not a little offensive in its view of ballet. Miss Parker, with exquisite tact, hides what her absence of bodice might reveal. The artistic indecision implicit in such items is further stressed by Baryshnikov's part in Lar Lubovich's glutinous Concerto 622. This is the ultimate Buddy-ballet, with two chaps being very, very supportive as the slow movement of the Mozart clarinet concerto is sentimentalised by cheap-jack dance. It may not be accidental that after this unpleasant little incident, Baryshnikov appears as the Penitent in Martha Graham's El Penitente. He makes handsome amends for what has gone before. The staging, with its austere Noguchi design, is serious. Terese Capucilli (from the Graham company) and Kenneth Tosti are very good as the Woman and the Christ-figure, and Baryshnikov's concentration, his sense of contrition, are ideal. Ideal, too, his appearance in Morris's Ten Suggestions. These are lightning sketches set to Tcherepnin piano bagatelles. When Morris danced them - and danced them brilliantly - the emotional opulence of his presence and the pink satin pyjama-suit he wore, gave the piece a slightly faisande air. Baryshnikov brings something both innocent and dazzlingly sure to his performance. The pink satin looks in no way ambiguous; the stunning control of Baryshnikov's dancing - tiny fast runs; falls that melt and move on - tell better than anything else he does that he is still what he was: a uniquely gifted dance artist. We see a physical command - a mastery and a freedom in timing; a power to imbue the least action with drama in its dynamics - that reveal Baryshnikov's art undiminished in its truth, still able to grip our attention utterly by its visual and emotional force. The evening ends with Morris's A Lake. In it he uses Haydn's second horn concerto as a basis for dances that manipulate movement ideas with craft, though formula seemed to me more evident than invention. It is carefully made, rather self-conscious in its steps, as in its updated and hideous rococo costumes, and shows Baryshnikov as minimally part of the team. In this it reflects the identity of the whole evening - but without Baryshnikov the programme would be insupportable. The management, incidentally, might remember its duty to the public: a programme change was unannounced. Sadler's Wells Theatre, until April 12. Programming may vary. Box office (071) 278 8916.</p>

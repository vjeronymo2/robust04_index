			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Leyland site to be business park Part of the former Leyland Daf site at Leyland, Lancashire, is to be redeveloped at a cost of Pounds 70m, with the aim of attracting up to 4,000 new jobs during the next 10 years. Launching the scheme to develop more than 1.3m sq ft of new industrial and commercial accommodation, Lancashire Enterprises said yesterday that the centrepiece of the development would be a rail-freight terminal linking the site with the international European rail network. The new private terminal will compete with Railtrack's terminals in Liverpool and Manchester. Mr Jim Mason, Lancashire Enterprises chairman, said: 'We expect our terminal to be operating in about 18 months. It will be the only link into the west-coast line between Crewe and Carlisle and we will exploit this position.' Lancashire Enterprises, a development consultancy set up by the county council in 1982 but now a private company, bought the site last year from Arthur Andersen, receivers to Leyland Daf. The consultancy leased the assembly plant to Leyland Trucks, the company sold to a management buy-out team after the collapse of Leyland Daf. This company now employs 700 people on the site. A further 800 work for more than 15 other companies, many in the automotive sector. Negotiations to acquire 60 acres of adjacent fields will increase the site to 306 acres.</p>

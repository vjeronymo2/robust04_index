			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Hymn for Mao hypes TV sets to China's masses A Chinese Communist party hymn written in honour of Chairman Mao Zedong has been reborn as an advertising jingle glorifying a television set. The song, rendered reverently throughout China after the Cultural Revolution, begins: 'The sun is reddest, Chairman Mao is dearest.' But, in a national television campaign, this has become: 'The sun is reddest, Long Rainbow is newest.' The shock to Chinese ears of recycling the revolutionary in the name of commerce can hardly be imagined. Mr Wang Xiren, a navy propaganda writer who penned the original lyrics soon after Mao's death in 1976, said yesterday he would protest at the commercialisation of his song. He wants the advertisement banned. 'The song revealed the people's love and reverence for Chairman Mao,' he said. 'This distortion is irresponsible. It shows disrespect to the broad masses.' Mr Wang's song is famous among Chinese youth as well as those old enough to remember life under Mao. Three years ago, it was featured on a new cassette of Mao music, played on modern western instruments with the addition of a funky beat. Television viewers, nevertheless, are now wondering who would dare tamper with the once sacred words under a regime which still officially venerates Mao, and how they could get the jingle past the television censors. The answer to both questions is hardly surprising in the emerging business culture of modern China: the People's Liberation Army, which has embraced the profit motive while retaining the political clout to cope with the censors. Long Rainbow is owned by the PLA's commercial arm, Norinco, and the factory, at Mianyang city in Sichuan province, is a converted military radar plant and uses Japanese technology under licence. Ironically, the Long Rainbow plant came into existence because of one of Chairman Mao's follies. In the late 1950s, he ordered that industries be relocated to the interior from areas vulnerable to attack during a war that never happened. The move left factories remote from markets and suppliers. China is trying to revive many of these isolated inland enterprises by upgrading their technology and turning military equipment factories to civilian uses, including the production of consumer electronics. Long Rainbow is one of the more successful examples of this policy.</p>

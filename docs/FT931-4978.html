			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Company failures 'likely to rise' THE NUMBER of companies that failed was stable in the third and fourth quarters last year, but it is likely to rise again for the first three months of this year, according to figures released yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the UK credit insurance group. There were 1,762 business failures reported in the survey in October to December last year, compared with 1,760 in the third quarter. That represented a 6.4 per cent decline in failures over the final quarter of 1991. But Mr Clive Brand, Trade Indemnity's chief economist, said: 'This does not show a sustained improvement. Our survey suggests things are pretty flat. We have to remain cautious.' He said that historically business failures often declined in the fourth quarter of the year, so the reduction was not an indication of recovery. He also warned that there is normally a substantial increase in failures in the first quarter of the year associated with a lull in business activity after Christmas. Trade Indemnity's figures show that 30 per cent of businesses are now working at half capacity and showing no sign of economic recovery. It warned that the number of company start-ups virtually matched the number of businesses failing in the recession. This would create bottle-necks during any recovery which would increase imports and impede economic growth.</p>

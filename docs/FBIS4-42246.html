			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [John Jakobsen report: "`Wise Men' Put a Damper on </F> Optimism" -- from the ERHVERV section]    [Text] The Economic Council -- also known as the "wise  men" -- has put a slight damper on the government's optimistic  expectations for 1994 and 1995.    On the other hand the wise men are confident of a stable  recovery that will also last throughout 1996.    Their forecasts do not stretch any further into the future.  But in the past the government has calculated that the recovery  will last until the end of the century.    This is apparent from the resume that the Economic Council  has published on the eve of the public discussion of their  report itself on 1 June.    The government's Economic Overview, which Economy Minister  Marianne Jelved (Radical Liberal) made public on 18 May,  concludes that economic growth will rise by a total of 4 percent  in 1994. Here the wise men expect growth of 2.8 percent.    The wise men are also restrained about 1995 when they expect  GNP growth of 2.9 percent, while the government predicts growth  of 3.4 percent.    For 1996 the wise men are alone in predicting a figure: GNP  growth of 3 percent.    The difference in the two reports' views of the next two  years can be seen clearly from the unemployment figures. The  government expects unemployment to fall to 330,000 this year and  305,000 in 1995. Here the wise men predict unemployment of  335,000 this year, 317,000 next year, and 305,000 will only be  achieved in 1996. One of the most important explanations of why  there is a difference between the two reports is that they make  different assessments of export possibilities.    The wise men are only expecting a 2.5-percent increase in  exports this year, while the government is expecting a  4.7-percent increase. This pattern is repeated in 1995, when  the wise men expect a 3 percent and the government a 5.3-percent  increase.    On the other hand they are agreed that there will be a major  increase in imports. The wise men say 8.7 percent this year  compared with the government's 9.4 percent. The wise men expect  the high level of imports to continue into 1995 with an increase  of 8.4 percent, compared with the government's 7.5 percent.    According to the wise men, it is the German market that will  have a dampening effect on exports. Germany takes around 28  percent of Danish exports, and the wise men are expecting growth  this year in Germany of only 0.5 percent -- while the government  expects double this -- 1 whole percent.    There are also differences in the views taken of the Danish  consumer. The wise men expect an increase in private  consumption this year of 5.1 percent, growing to 5.7 percent in  1995, where the government keeps to 4.8 and 4.5 percent.    This has major repercussions for the balance of payments.  The trend of a growing balance of payments surplus that has  prevailed since 1986 begins to turn now.    The wise men expect a fall in the balance of payments  surplus  from 35 billion kroner in 1993 to 25 billion this year, 17  billion next year, all the way down to a mere 12 billion kroner  in 1996 -- a total fall of 65 percent.    "This is not an indication that we are squandering the  balance of payments surplus. But when a recovery is domestic  driven, as is the case in Denmark, this has to have an effect on  the balance of payments. We simply have to hope that we do not  repeat the mistakes from the first half of the eighties when we  forgot about export markets and concentrated on the home  market," said Jorgen Damgaard, the Jyske Bank's chief analyst.    The wise men expect the budget deficit to increase by 10  billion kroner in the course of 1994 -- from 40 billion to 50  billion kroner. Thereafter the wise men expect this deficit to  fall in 1995 and 1996 to 36 billion and 22 billion kroner  respectively.    This is due partly to the fact that the wise men are  expecting that the government will be able to limit growth in  public consumption to 0.7 percent in 1994, and 1.4 percent in  both 1995 and 1996.    "Here the wise men have indeed been optimistic. I simply do  not believe that the government will be able to keep growth down  so low," said Jorgen Damgaard, the Jyske Bank's chief analyst.    However, the wise men are more or less in line with the  government's own estimates.    The government's Economic Overview expects growth in public  consumption this year of 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent next year.</p>

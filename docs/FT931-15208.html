			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Low oil prices hit North Sea activity LOW OIL prices forced significant cuts in exploration activity by North Sea oil and gas producers last year, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh brokers. North Sea operators drilled only 116 exploration and appraisal wells last year, compared with more than 170 in 1991, as persistently low oil prices and an adverse exchange rate - world oil trade is priced in dollars - forced them to cut capital expenditure. The brokerage group expects low levels of exploration to continue this year and estimates that about 120 wells will be drilled. Exploration budgets are one of the first expenditures to be trimmed when companies experience hard times. Oil prices were at a 20-year low in real terms last year, with an average sterling price of Pounds 11 a barrel. At the same time, development spending on existing fields rose significantly. That should have a positive effect over the longer term because money spent on developing newly discovered fields will generate more revenue in the next five years as production rises. Producers' cashflow was low last year at Pounds 800m compared with an average of Pounds 2.5bn over the previous five years, largely as a result of the increasing development spending. Cashflow calculated by Wood Mackenzie is an estimate of companies' total revenues in the North Sea minus exploration and development costs and taxation. Oil production reached a three-year high of 1.9m barrels a day last year and Wood Mackenzie sees further growth over the next five years.</p>

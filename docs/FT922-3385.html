			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Masterpiece in a minor key - Cinema JOHNNY SUEDE (15) Lumiere, MGM Oxford St, Gate DOUBLE X (15) Local Release STRAIGHT TALK (PG) Odeon West End THE BEAST (18) ICA Johnny Suede, a writing and directing debut by cameraman-playwright Tom DiCillo, who photographed Stranger Than Paradise and penned the one-man play on which this new film is based, is an example of 'sort of' cinema. It is sort of wonderful and sort of weird. And it is sort of about this sultry-looking innocent (Brad Pitt) who loves suede shoes and rock music, who models himself on Ricky Nelson - complete with well-oiled quiff - and who cannot make up his mind about love. Should he choose beautiful, disturbed Darlette (Alison Moir), who lives with the neighbourhood sadist, or sensible, forthright Yvonne (Catherine Keener), who teaches him how to find stimulating parts of the female anatomy? Johnny, for most of the time, can find scarcely anything. Except for a pair of magical suede shoes which fall from a night sky onto the roof of a telephone booth and become his Oz-like talisman. Johnny lives in a moody, noir-ish city not unlike New York. (Actually it is New York but unnamed.) And he drifts, drifts, drifts, from day to day. This is deeply charming film. It has a sleepy wit and a blissful line in tell-tale decor: strawberries and flamingos for dinky Darlette, no-nonsense hard angles for Yvonne, damp walls and a fridge containing one mouldering carrot for Johnny. In addition Brad Pitt, the young hoodlum from Thelma And Louise, plays the sweet, dim, pompadoured hero with a charisma that reminds me - indeed has reminded everyone to judge by the American press quotes - of James Dean. The spirit of this film is simultaneously nostalgic and 1990s. The pop-historical reference points are rock 'n' roll and 1950s teenage dandyism. But the narrative technique is modern. Wandering stories which appear to be no stories at all have been embraced by Jim Jarmusch, Gus Van Sant, Hal Hartley and Aki Kaurismaki, and their films represent the healthiest crisis cinema has experienced for decades. Johnny Suede is at times more mannerism than meaning, but it still has a bravura aimlessness. When most about 'nothing' - Johnny earning a few daytime cents as a painter-decorator, Johnny daydreaming of an audience of screaming girl fans as he stands on stage crooning about the beauty of suede, Johnny musing malapropistically about girls ('That's the way I'm handling this one, strictly Plutonic') - it is about everything. It is about the way we live, moving in and out of consciousness, feeding our fantasies, dreaming dreams, and making career plans that seldom leave the drawing-board except to dive straight into the waste-paper bin. Tom DiCillo's movie won the Golden Leopard for best film at last year's Locarno Film Festival. Stuck in a one-lake Swiss town you might have voted for it yourself - and suspected your vote was one for desperation. But what seems at times to be last-gasp mannerist minimalism, fin de siecle style, seems at others like a brave fluidity made for the next millennium. Johnny Suede is minor in key but messianic in import. There have been several rumoured sightings of Norman Wisdom over the 25 years since he retired from movie comedy. But some believe, like myself, that they are apocryphal; that the man who bestrode 1950s British cinema with his bicycle cap, ill-fitting jacket and braying pathos was put in a time capsule long ago together with Muffin the Mule and Lonnie Donegan. Now he has been taken out again, and hooray. I enjoyed him in Double X, a colourfully appalling thriller in which Norman plays a runaway scientist-inventor pursued by the criminal mob he invented things for. Just what he invented is obscure. Perhaps it was the rabid-ferret hair dye and stage Irish accent sported by Bernard Hill or the Michael Gambon impersonation kit deployed by Mr Ward. This cheerful rubbish was directed by Shani Grewel. No one seems to have any idea what he or she is doing - she being Gemma Craven as gangland's answer to Shanghai Lily - except for our Norman. He just carries on happily, gasping, giggling, groaning, where The Bulldog Breed and A Stitch In Time left off. Two decades in a time capsule teach one the wisdom of serenely, stoically doing one's own thing. 'Sometimes you gotta get out and honk your own horn' says Dolly Parton as an agony aunt in Straight Talk. Playing Chicago's riposte to Claire Rayner, she hurls motherly advice over the airwaves after stumbling into WNDY Radio as a prospective switchboard girl and being mistaken for the new phone-in hostess who fails to turns up. (Why? We are never told.) Meanwhile, in another part of the movie, a plausible romantic lead has failed to turn up and the part goes to fidgety, semi-crazed James Woods of Salvador. He and Miss Parton bill and coo at each other over that surging outcrop known as Miss P's bosom, Woods playing a reporter out to expose her imposture. Will she be exposed? Or will he fall for the impostress? This is Hollywood at its most amiably confused. There are enough loose ends in the film to harness up a team of chariots. Why, for instance, is the subplot infatuation with our heroine of radio producer Griffin Dunne not resolved? Dunne is the funniest thing here: executive stress written into every twitch of the hand, every palpitation of that boil-in-the-bag face. But he is fast marginalised by writers Craig Bolotin and Patricia Resnick and director Barnet Kellman, who know where the money is. In a film starring Dolly Parton, a competition-destroying landmark, what chance does a mere good actor have to feature in the scenery? At the ICA you may catch a new, uncut print of Walerian Borowczyk's The Beast (La Bete). This is the film that had a thousand Aunt Ednas calling for intensive care when it appeared in the mid-1970s. It is the tale of two beautiful heiresses wrestling with two well-equipped monsters in two different centuries (18th and 20th). L'erotisme fou, painted with the bright unshockable wit that this Polish-born director brought to Blanche and Immoral Tales. Elsewhere in the cinemas the rewards are for those who search. My customary advice in the silly season, which has now arrived in Britain with all its luggage, is to indulge in Creative Filmgoing. A visit to the movies is not contingent upon the week's new releases. Repertory cinemas abound, from London's ICA, Electric Cinema and National Film Theatre to the regional film theatres across the land. Nor is multiple-choice programming confined to the art-house sector. The boldest recent initiative has been that of the Prince Charles cinema where for Pounds 1.20 per ticket - astonishing but true - you can choose among 20 new or classic films shown within a single week: The Prince Of Tides, Cyrano De Bergerac, Apocalypse Now, Father Of The Bride, Bugsy . . .</p>

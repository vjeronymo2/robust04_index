			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Silvia Coello Q.: ``Mangrove Swamps </F> Disappearing'']    [Text] Since 1987, at the start of the shrimp boom in  Esmeraldas Province, the mangrove swamps have begun  disappearing, to be replaced by shrimp-breeding pools. One of  the areas hardest hit has been Muisne which, after having had  3,500 hectares of mangrove swamps, is left with only 20 percent  of that total. People from the island have made serious charges  of illegal tree felling and fraudulent concessions to  shrimp-breeding establishments. The mangrove swamp is  disappearing, and nearly 2,000 users, such as scallop and crab  fishermen and charcoal makers, are being hurt directly.    During the canoe trip that we took last week through the  Muisne area, Nisbaldo Ortiz never stopped raising his hand to  point to the sites where shrimp pools have supplanted what had  previously been a mangrove swamp. We were accompanied by members  of ecological groups, some settlers, and authorities from the  Ecuadoran Natural Areas and Wildlife Forest Institute (INEFAN).    Nisbaldo is a young native of Muisne who has become the  leader of the community's own mangrove swamp defense movement.  Tired of complaining and appealing to the authorities to stop  the illegal felling of mangrove trees, the community residents  decided to create the Ecological Defense Foundation. It has its  own surveillance committee to make constant checks of the area,  so as to catch those felling the trees and attempt to stop them.    Despite the surveillance goals and action, what the  community  has been able to accomplish is very little or nothing. This is  readily discernible, because shrimp-breeding establishments show  up everywhere in this area. Some appear camouflaged. Anyone  travelling along the Muisne River and viewing its shores,  apparently filled with mangrove trees, would have every reason  to think that the mangrove swamps are intact. However, one need  only enter them a short distance to find the large  shrimp-breeding pools.    The Muisne residents estimate that there must be about 250  shrimp-breeding establishments in the area, some small and  others covering many hectares. Added to this are the large  expanses of now infertile mangrove land, which was once used for  shrimp breeding and never reforested.    The original size of the local mangrove swamp on Muisne  Island was 3,500 hectares, and now the largest remaining areas,  between the localities of Bunche and Mompiche, measure 716  hectares. In other words, approximately 80 percent of the  mangrove swamps have been destroyed.    The tree felling boom began in 1987, upon completion of the  paved road leading to Nuevo Muisne, situated opposite the  island. With the start of the indiscriminate tree cutting, the  shrimp boom also began in the area. Besides the threat to nature  entailed by the disappearance of the mangrove swamp, large  groups of humans, such as scallop, crab, and other fishermen,  larvae collectors, and charcoal makers, are being hurt by the  shortage of products and the deterioration in their way of life.  Seven communities and six districts, located between Bunche and  San Gregorio, in Muisne Canton, with approximately 1,680  inhabitants, have been forced to seek their catch far from the  area, or to change their mode of living.    Simon Vega, aged 30, claims to have been catching scallops  and crab in the mangrove swamp all his life.    Now, he also has a tricycle of the type used on the island  to  carry tourists to the beach, ``because if I did not have another  job I could not support my family. In the past, I used to catch  from 300 to 400 scallops in two or three hours. Now, working  almost all day, I can barely collect 40 or 50, and I earn only  4,000 sucres from that.''    However, the problem is not merely a financial one. Simon  adds that anyone entering the mangrove swamp does so risking his  life. ``They do not even let us approach the shrimp breeders'  shores. If you go in too far, they shoot you. One day they shot  and wounded my mother, who is 60 years old and also fishes for  scallops.''    Lourdes Proano, secretary of the canton's Civic Board, who  is  also fighting to defend the mangrove swamp, claims that the  situation has worsened, particularly for poor families and  women, most of whom are engaged in scallop fishing. ``While they  are destroying the livelihood of the people here, the shrimp  breeders have not generated sources of employment for the  residents, because most of the people they hire are from other  places.''  <H5>  Charges </H5>   The Muisne mangrove swamps were one of the best reserves in  the country. The largest one now is the reserve located in the  northern part of Esmeraldas, between Limones and San Lorenzo,  with approximately 40,000 hectares. However, 15 percent has been  devastated by the shrimp breeders' intervention. In 1986, the  mangrove swamps were declared protective woods by law; hence,  felling them is illegal. So, what is the explanation for the  shrimp-breeding establishments' presence in the mangrove swamps?    The members of Muisne's Ecological Defense Foundation show  us  a considerable number of charges that they have brought to the  local and national authorities, who have not adopted any  measures to deal with them. The Muisne residents admit that they  are not optimistic about the type of action taken by the  authorities. They inspect at a given time, halting the work that  is being done on the shrimp pools. ``On those occasions, they  stop everything, but the work is continued afterward, because  the financial pressures are much stronger,'' remarks Lourdes  Proano.    Nisbaldo Ortiz adds: ``On the other hand, a genuine black  market for the sale of mangrove woods has become legitimized.  Through it, the businessmen learn that they must first cut or  destroy the mangrove swamps, and then request the concession.  The local authorities' action has been very slight, and they act  only when pressured.''    Since 1989, the foundation has reported 37 cases of mangrove  felling, only four of which have been handled properly. A report  from that institution states: ``Nearly all the violators were  reported on time, when they had just begun cutting or sawing  mangrove thickets. Yet the vast majority managed to complete  their shrimp pools, because the competent authorities failed to  do their duty by stopping them permanently, confiscating tools,  punishing the guilty ones, and forcing them to repair the damage  they had caused. On the contrary, the collusion of bureaucrats  on all levels in failing to take action is obvious.''    The charges in each case are detailed. They note,  chronologically, how the cutting occurred; and, insofar as land  ownership certificates are concerned, they indicate that the  majority of shrimp-breeding establishments have fraudulent  ministerial decrees.    They also charge that, in both the Muisne area and northern  Esmeraldas, the IERAC [Ecuadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform  and Settlement], in a clear violation of the Forest and Wildlife  Law, is granting permits and concessions to private individuals  in extensive mangrove swamp areas.  <H5>  Lack of Institutional Coordination </H5>   Institutions such as the Merchant Marine, the  Undersecretariat of Fisheries, the Coastal Resources Management  Program, and the INEFAN are supposed to oversee the proper  operation of shrimp-breeding establishments. Luis Valverde,  national forest director, declares: ``There is, however, no  order; rather, they just come and cut trees. The Merchant Marine  is the one responsible for beaches and bays; it should come and  put them in jail. But, in fact, this does not occur. Almost none  of the certificates issued for forming shrimp-breeding  establishments have been authorized by the Ministry of  Agriculture through the INEFAN, at least so long as I have held  this position.''    So, what is the explanation for the shrimp breeding  establishments' unauthorized presence? ``Because there is big  capital here; this is achieved with banknotes here.''    ``Furthermore, the INEFAN is responsible only for the trees.  So, when they are already cut, we have to apply the law stating  that the fine is from one to 10 minimum living wages. The forest  law does not call for criminal type action. So, I think that the  only way to stop the felling is to heighten the awareness of the  citizens. Shrimp exports are the third-ranking item in the  nation's economy; and so, these are very powerful people. It is  not that we oppose the shrimp breeders' establishments or the  nation's progress. They could be started, but in the upper part  of the mangrove swamp, not in the swamp itself.'' This is  Valverde's response.    By law, it is determined that the Merchant Marine has  control  over the beach and bay areas, and that the INEFAN can take  action only in areas declared protective woods. Thus, in one way  or another, the control of the mangrove swamps depends on these  two institutions. Moreover, the Constitution of the Republic  specifies that no institution may become involved in another's  activities. With this situation, Jorge Barba, director of the  INEFAN, claims that the advantage of the institute headed by him  is that the INEFAN law stipulates that it must concern itself  with all the marginal land not being used for agriculture or  livestock raising, such as the mangrove swamps. ``This has  enabled us to accomplish some work; and, for cases such as  these, the Commission for Environmental Affairs has been  created.''    Barba adds that, since the INEFAN has just been created,  plans and maps are yet to be made for this area, so as to study  the problems in detail. ``We are just now meeting with  representatives of the World Bank, and we shall request $60  million for the renewable resources sector. We also intend to  meet with the owners of the shrimp breeding establishments, so  that, instead of being enemies, we can work together.''    The National Campaign for Defense of the Mangrove Swamps and  the South American Mangrove System charged that the national  forest director, through an official memorandum dated 31 August  of this year, set a price per pilot and per hectare of mangrove  trees, thereby legitimizing their destruction.    When Barba was asked about this, he commented: ``We must  give  the mangrove tree a value, in any case, whether it is cut with  or without a permit: we have to collect. It is not a sin to cut  a mangrove tree; the sin lies in its being cut without many more  being planted. So, the problem is not in setting a value for it,  but rather in undervaluing it.''  <H5>  Use Without Destruction </H5>   Good management of resources seeks a break-even point that  will enable people today to meet their needs without denying  opportunity to future generations. The mangrove swamp has done  the country much good; but it cannot stand there untouched,  either. It must be used, but without being destroyed. This  statement was made by Washington Macias, director of the Pedro  Vicente Maldonado Foundation which, together with the Coastal  Resources Management Program (PMRC), has a management plan for  the Muisne area, among others in the country. Macias adds that  the break-even point in a mangrove swamp is reached when more  than 75 percent of its trees are felled.    The Pedro Vicente Maldonado Foundation, jointly with the  PMRC, is working on the process of mangrove tree regeneration.  As Macias indicates, this means that some mangrove tree users  could make use of part of their hectares alternately. For  example, if they use 20 for making charcoal, immediately  harvesting it, and do the same thing, consecutively, with the  other hectares, when they reach 200 hectares the first 320 would  already have been regenerated. He remarks: ``We must see to it  that the communities have direct access to the mangrove swamp  for activities that are not devastating, but, rather,  productive, such as tourism.''    ``In Venezuela, for example, in all their soap operas they  show the Margarita mangrove swamps: which are rather  insignificant from a scenic standpoint when compared with the  mangrove swamps extending from Puerto Bolivar to Jambeli.'' This  claim is made by Macias, who adds that, ``if concessions have  been made to shrimp breeding establishments in mangrove areas,  it is because the law itself is inadequate. Hence, there must be  a heightened awareness among the shrimp breeders.''    For the present, the Muisne residents have begun  establishing  a new strategy for themselves: speaking directly to the shrimp  breeders. ``We think that they sometimes cut down mangrove trees  without realizing what they could be causing. We want to enter  into a joint system with them to save our mangrove swamps.''    Nevertheless, they will demand, officially, that the State  Comptroller General's Office form a committee to audit the  management of the public institutions that have granted  concessions to shrimp breeders since the date when the country's  mangrove swamps were declared protective woods.  <H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5> <H5>  Particular Features of the Ecosystem </H5>   The mangrove swamp is the perfect habitat for scallops,  crabs, and crayfish, because it produces the detritus that is  the food for these species. It is produced when the mangrove  tree dumps tons of dead foliage into the water. The mangrove  swamp is a natural element to protect against downpours and to  prevent flooding in nearby towns and land. It prevents the winds  blowing from the sea inland from salinizing agricultural land.    Generally, since mangrove trees do not have one large root,  but rather are entangled with one another, when they are cut,  even though it be only one tree, there is a danger that the  others will fall.    The tree produces pilots, and the bark on the branches is  useful for making a tanning substance. Other major users of the  mangrove swamp are the charcoal makers.</p>

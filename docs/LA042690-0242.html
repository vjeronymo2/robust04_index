			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AVON TO REVAMP ITS SALES SYSTEM AND CALL BY MAIL  </P> <P> Avon Products Inc. Chairman James E. Preston said today that the door-to-door  cosmetics giant will revamp its sales system and begin direct mail sales in  order to achieve ambitious performance targets.  </P> <P> Avon should post sales increases of 3% to 5% in 1990 and 6% to 8% by 1992,  Preston told a group of securities analysts.  </P> <P> Preston said Avon will begin a "multi-tiered" sales system whereby company  representatives who recruit and train others will receive compensation for  their own sales and also for what is sold by their recruits.  </P> <P> The technique, sometimes called a "pyramid" distribution system, has been used  by Avon rivals Amway Corp. and Mary Kay Corp.  </P> <P> Avon is now embroiled in a battle with an unfriendly investor group, Chartwell  Associates, that holds an 18% stake in Avon and includes representatives of  Mary Kay.  </P></p>

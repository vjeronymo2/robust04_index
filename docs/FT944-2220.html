			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK wins carbon energy tax battle The European Union's attempt to reach a common position on energy taxes looked in tatters yesterday after environment ministers agreed to let member states adopt individual approaches to plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions, A deal reached at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday evening means that opponents of a proposed EU-wide carbon energy tax, led by the UK, have won their battle against the measure. It is an embarrassing blow to the EU ahead of an international conference next March in Berlin to consider further steps to cutting CO emissions. The conference is the most important international gathering on the environment since the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. The EU's failure to agree is particularly difficult for the German government, which had pushed most strongly for the carbon tax ahead of the Berlin meeting. Mr John Gummer, UK environment minister, said he was 'very pleased' with the outcome, which was in line with the broader understanding on a CO tax reached at last weekend's European Council summit in Essen. A British official said this meant that individual countries were free to make their own provisions for meeting emission targets and that the idea of a European Union-wide energy tax 'was dead in the water'. Under the Essen compromise, economic and finance ministers will draw up a 'common strategy' for reducing emissions, which could also include increases in excise duty or extensions of duty to cover new fuels. Although the energy tax measures will be voluntary, Commission officials said the majority of member states would seek to apply them. Business leaders in Europe have lobbied hard against a CO tax, arguing that it would hurt industry's competitiveness in relation to their US and Asian counterparts. Opposition from the UK government has focused on national sovereignty. Earlier this year, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, said the government would not accept the principle of taxes imposed from Brussels. But the tax has found favour in some eco-conscious member states such as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. Other governments support the tax as a means of raising revenue. The European Union is committed to stabilising CO emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 under the Rio Convention on Climate Change. All 12 member states have already agreed the targets and that more measures may be necessary if the targets are to be met. Ironically, the UK can afford to take a tough line on the tax as it is well placed to meet its Rio commitments.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'WHERE PIGEONS GO' TOO SCHMALTZY BY HALF  </P> <P> Art Carney turns up a few kernels of truth among the tears and schmaltz of  tonight's NBC movie, "Where Pigeons Go to Die" (at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39).  </P> <P> T Michael Landon directs, wrote the teleplay (based on the book by R. Wright  Campbell) and stars. He plays 50-year-old Hugh, returning to his hometown after  40 years to sell his dead grandfather's house. But memories of the time he  spent there as a boy with his "Da" (Carney), who gave him lessons in pigeon  training and in life, engulf him in mournful reminiscence.  </P> <P> Landon, the king of TV's heart-warming genre ("Little House on the Prairie,"  "Highway to Heaven"), narrates: "I'm 10 years old again, the cardinal year of  my life, and it's a day that marks the end of my childhood."  </P> <P> The boy Hugh, played by Robert Hy Gorman, is the constant companion of his  beloved "Da," who mixes philosophy with pigeon lore. Da says birds should be  held "firmly but gently, the way you should hold love or life," and "a creature  returns home for the good in it."  </P> <P> When Da is hospitalized with a stroke, Hugh knows he must somehow help Da back  to the home he loves before he dies. Meanwhile, Hugh's prize pigeon is missing  after an 800-mile race. Will he, like Da, make it home?  </P> <P> The script -- and Landon's tragedian narration -- cloy, but less so when  Carney's on screen.  </P> <P> Gorman, a fragile, serious-faced boy, acquits himself creditably. Ronne Troup  and Cliff De Young, as Hugh's mom and dad, don't have much to do, although De  Young shares one moving moment of reality with Carney.  </P> <P> But it's Carney, immobile and speechless in his hospital scenes, using only his  eyes and the lift of his chin, who briefly gives the film the poignancy for  which it strives.  </P></p>

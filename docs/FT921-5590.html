			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Union complains of rise in attacks at benefit offices VIOLENT attacks on staff in unemployment benefit offices and Jobcentres have increased by 50 per cent since the removal of protective screens began in 1989, the CPSA Civil Service union said yesterday The union warned that long-standing industrial action could intensify unless the removal process was halted. Publication of the figures is the latest move in the dispute over the government's decision to move to open-plan offices without security screens or counters. The industrial action, which started in April last year, has cost the union Pounds 1m. The CPSA dispute involves about 100 benefit-office staff who have have been on strike for nearly a year in Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne and London. There was also a one-day national strike last November and other lightning strikes. The union wants security arrangements in offices to be negotiated locally, with independent assessment of risks at offices before security arrangements are altered. It has called on the Health and Safety Executive to act. Mr John Macreadie, CPSA general secretary, said: 'At the same time that counters and security screens are being removed, the frustration of claimants and job seekers is growing. We have a lethal cocktail of anger and despair and this is no time to strip our members of security.' The union said there had been 233 attempted and actual physical assaults in 1990. It predicted that the level would turn out to have been maintained last year and would rise. Before screens and counters were removed, the number was 155. The employment department disputed the union figures, saying there were 118 physical assaults in 1989, 161 in 1990 and 152 last year. Its figures do not include attempted assaults. The Bifu bank workers' union last week produced figures showing that raids on banks and building societies in London had doubled over the past year. Bifu is pressing for more and better security screens.</p>

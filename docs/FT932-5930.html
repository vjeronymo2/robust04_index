			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Mood brightens in wake of auction success LAST WEEK'S auction marked the switch to a more bullish view of the UK gilt market. The difference in sentiment compared with the sombre mood surrounding April's auction was characterised in this way by Mr Chris Anthony, economist at UBS: 'Last time, the economic data was strong, the pound was not doing very well and there had been a downgrade of expectations on interest rates.' Each of those factors looked different on Wednesday, although Thursday's Cabinet reshuffle caused the pound to stumble. On the economic front, the stream of relentlessly good news which increased fears of inflation a few weeks ago has diminished. Last Friday's announcement of a fall in the headline inflation rate to a mere 1.3 per cent confirmed a more sanguine view, for this year at least. Encouraging figures on unit labour costs and slower earnings growth have also been seized on as the mood has veered towards optimism. Even before Mr Kenneth Clarke became chancellor, sparking off speculation about an interest rate cut, economists were saying pessimism on that front had been overdone. Forecasts that the base rate would come down from 6 per cent to 5 1/2 or 5 per cent by the end of the year remained common among both gilt-edged market makers and fixed-income fund managers. The theory is that signs of a faltering economic recovery plus lower continental interest rates will allow a cut in the UK later this summer, without undermining the pound. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Greenwell Montagu, said speculation about a rate cut 'fits in with the debate about funding. It will benefit the short end of the curve and there is also speculation that the next issue will be in the three to four-year area'. Falling yields at the shorter end will steepen the yield curve, which is seen as necessary to facilitate funding of the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement. Some economists believe this process will also involve an increase in yields at the longer end to make issues in that area sufficiently attractive to investors. One economist forecast that yields on 20-year stock might have to rise from the current level of about 8.5 per cent to 8.75 - 9 per cent. He predicted that concerns about the pick-up in inflation would coincide later this year with funding fatigue, bringing most pressure to bear at the long end. But views about that end of the market vary considerably, reflecting divergent schools of thought on the inflation outlook. One fixed income fund manager said the longer end looked attractive 'because we are sanguine about inflation'. The forecast he was working to was 2.5 to 2.75 per cent for this year and less than 4 per cent - the ceiling on the government's target - in 1994. Views on whether or not that ceiling will be breached distinguish the 'oh no, here we go again' school of inflation pessimists (or realists as they would see themselves historically) from the 'it will be different this time' optimists. In terms of the attractiveness of gilts over the next few weeks, there is more consensus and it tends to be positive. An important part of this is the foreign interest being shown in the market, one of the factors behind the auction's success. Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura, said the attractions to overseas investors included the relatively weak currency, especially against the yen, and the yield spread over other large bond markets. In the 10-year benchmark area the yield spread over German bunds has increased from less than 100 basis points in early April to more than 120. The improvement in value compared with the French OAT is even more striking. The difference has soared from less than 20 basis points in mid-February to well over 80. As Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg, said last week, 'the big down move from mid-March to a few days ago has been completed'. The question is how long will the new upbeat mood last?</p>

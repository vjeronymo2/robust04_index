			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Downturn forces Nissan to halve output NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is to halve production at its Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland in the final two months of the year under the impact of the sharp decline in sales of new cars in continental Europe. Nissan, which exports about 80 per cent of its output from its Sunderland plant, is the latest victim of the downturn in European demand for new cars which has forced widespread job losses, production cuts and restructuring across the European motor industry. Elsewhere in the UK, Vauxhall has imposed extensive short-time working at its two assembly plants this month, while Ford, Rover and Peugeot have cut several thousand jobs, and output at Vauxhall, Ford and Peugeot has fallen. Nissan said yesterday that it would move to single-shift working for two months from November 8 by eliminating the night shift in order to cut output from 1,200 cars a day to about 600 cars. Some 2,400 of its 4,600 employees will work only every other week in November and December. They will remain on full basic pay, which averages Pounds 13,164 a year for an assembly-line worker, but will lose night-shift bonuses which average Pounds 183 a month. Nissan halted all recruitment at the Sunderland plant in May, and the workforce is now shrinking through non-replacement at the rate of 180 jobs a year. The production cut is the first big setback suffered by Nissan at Sunderland, the first Japanese car plant in Europe, where it started small volume output in 1986. For the full year of 1993 it is now cutting output by 8.9 per cent to 246,000 from the total of 270,000 forecast earlier this year, and it warned yesterday that production could fall further next year. Output of the Primera large family car will drop to only 93,500 this year from 141,800 in 1992, a 34 per cent decline. Production of the Micra small car, which started in August last year, will total 152,500 compared with the 37,200 produced in the last five months of 1992. Nissan had planned originally to produce at close to full capacity for the first time this year at Sunderland. Production for the year will still be 37 per cent higher than the 179,000 cars it produced last year, but as the plant reaches maturity it is no longer able to insulate itself from the downturn in European demand. The company said yesterday that the impact of recession in Europe was likely to wipe out the pre-tax profit of Pounds 29.6m earned last year by Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), the Sunderland production plant, which was now expected only to break even this year. Nissan is grappling with severe problems worldwide. The consolidated Nissan group is in overall loss for the second year running. It is being forced to close a plant in Japan and in Spain, where its Nissan Motor Iberica operations ran up losses of Pta23.1bn (Pounds 117m) in the first half of the year, it has announced that it is to lay off 5,100 workers at its Barcelona and Madrid plants for 11 days during October and November in order to cut output by 4,000 vehicles. The recovery in UK demand for new cars this year - sales rose by 11.8 per cent in the first eight months of the year - has only protected carmakers to a small extent against the recession in the rest of west Europe. Nissan's high level of exports from its Sunderland plant means it has been hit hard by the overall 16 per cent drop in sales of new cars in west Europe in the first eight months of the year.  ------------------------- UK CAR PRODUCTION  ------------------------- Jan-July 1993      858,617 Jan-July 1992      805,261  ------------------------- 1992             1,291,231 1991             1,236,900 1990             1,295,611 1989             1,299,082 1988             1,226,835 1987             1,142,683 1986             1,018,962 1985             1,047,973 1984               908,906 1983             1,044,597  -------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva November 30 TASS -- Reservations made by the  Ukrainian Parliament when ratifying the START I Treaty hit a  blow on the current regime of nonproliferation of nuclear arms,  Russian permanent representative to the U.N. conference on  disarmament Grigory Berdennikov told a news conference here  today.    In fact, there was no ratification, as major components of  the START I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol and a major  instrument of their implementation were removed, he said.    For instance, the Ukrainian Parliament excluded Article 5 of  the Lisbon Protocol. The article ensures Kiev's joining of the  treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear arms as a non-nuclear  state. What is especially dangerous is that it happened on the  eve of a conference on open-ended prolongation of the Treaty  scheduled for 1995. Ukraine has actually proclaimed itself the  sixth nuclear power.    In the words of Berdennikov, Kiev has also violated the  agreement signed in early September in Massandra, the Crimea, by  the Ukrainian and Russian Government heads to ensure the  withdrawal of all strategic nuclear arms to the Russian  Federation for further dismantling.    The Russian representative called attention to the danger  posed by nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory which are no  longer maintained by Russian specialists. Only Russian  specialists can efficiently maintain the warheads and the  missiles. Thus, all the responsibility for the state of nuclear  arms rests on Ukraine.    The Ukrainian Parliament resolution is not only the issue of  Ukrainian-Russian relations, stressed Berdennikov. It also  concerns other nuclear states, depositaries of the treaty on  nonproliferation and the whole international community.    No doubt, neither the START I nor the START II Treaties can  enter into force due to the Ukrainian steps. Berdennikov said  they would like to convey Russian concern with Ukrainian actions.</p>

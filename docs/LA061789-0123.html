			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE;  </P> <P> TONY COMPLETES DREADED ARCTIC LEG OF TRIP  </P> <P> Tony Aliengena, bone weary after a nine-hour, 1,450-mile transoceanic flight  that began in snow flurries in northern Canada and took him through four time  zones, safely landed his single-engine Cessna early today in this island  capital in the northern Atlantic.  </P> <P> Tony, an 11-year-old from San Juan Capistrano who is trying to become the  youngest aviator to fly around the world, crawled out of his cramped cockpit at  2 a.m. as a setting sun cast a pinkish glow over this seaport metropolis that  is flanked by snow-capped peaks.  </P> <P> Looking very tired, the boy, whose parents normally send him to bed at 9:30  p.m., when asked how he felt, replied abruptly, "Good," and marched straight to  his hotel room on the 12th day after setting out from Orange County's John  Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> Tony, his family and an entourage from another chase plane all checked into a  local hotel, where they are to rest today before attempting to complete the  North Atlantic crossing Sunday with a 1,000-mile flight to Oslo.  </P> <P> A second chase plane, however, was forced to turn back to an earlier refueling  stop in Greenland after a directional compass malfunctioned during the second  leg to Reykjavik.  </P> <P> The twin-engine Cessna, piloted by Colorado businessman Pat Wiesner, returned  to Sondrestrom, Greenland, where it had to be repaired and refueled before he  could rejoin the group. Aboard his plane are three members of a Los Angeles  film crew that is producing a documentary about Tony's flight, as well as  Soviet journalist Alexie Grinevich.  </P> <P> The all-day flight began Friday morning in Iqaluit, Canada, a remote Eskimo  village near the Arctic Circle.  </P> <P> The entourage had been dreading the North Atlantic crossing ever since Tony  departed Orange County June 5 on his Friendship Flight. It began ominously  enough Friday, with snow flurries and blowing winds in Iqaluit, which is in  Canada's Northwest Territories.  </P> <P> At a weather briefing at the Iqaluit airport, the pilots were warned of an  arctic storm system in their path on the way to the refueling spot in  Sondrestrom, on Greenland's western coast.  </P> <P> The storm system was showing the presence of freezing rain at higher flying  altitudes, according to the weather forecast.  </P> <P> Conditions were so poor that Yves Landry, weather meteorologist at the airport  in Iqaluit warned: "If it were me, I would stay home."  </P> <P> In fact, no pilots had yet traversed the ocean route that day, they were told.  But Gary Aliengena, Tony's father and coordinator of the flight, opted to press  on.  </P> <P> Shortly before takeoff, Tony and his entourage donned orange wet suits and  tucked life preservers behind their seats.  </P> <P> Tony's mother, who was riding in another chase plane piloted by Dr. Lance  Allyn, explained the importance of the suits to her 10-year-old daughter,  Alaina.  </P> <P> "If we go down in the water, the water is very cold," said Susan Aliengena, as  she helped her pony-tailed daughter into the suit. "And this will keep you from  dying."  </P> <P> After departing through gray storm clouds during light snow flurries over  Iqaluit, the three planes emerged into clear blue skies and managed to stay  above the storm system centered over the Davis Strait, between Canada's arctic  islands and Greenland.  </P> <P> At Sondrestrom -- a U.S. Air Force Base -- Tony descended into an eerie world  of glacial peaks and aquamarine fjords. Also visible was the start of  Greenland's massive icecap, which runs to a maximum thickness of two miles.  </P> <P> Wiesner's plane developed mechanical problems about one hour after leaving  Sondrestrom on the 800-mile leg to Iceland, so he turned back.  </P> <P> But Tony and Allyn continued on, flying closely to maintain radio contact along  the open expanse of ocean where they were out of touch of air-traffic control  radar.  </P> <P> Tony crossed the east coast of Greenland about two hours after leaving  Sondrestrom, soaring above a foreboding mass of jagged peaks that abutted a  seemingly endless expanse of frozen ocean.  </P> <P> The ocean ice was breaking from the June thaw and was dotted with icebergs.  Soon though, the ocean was concealed from view by a thick layer of low-lying  clouds, which stretched to the Icelandic coast.  </P> <P> At one point, while flying through clear skies, Allyn glanced down at the ice  and tapped the dashboard of his twin-engine Beechcraft King Air lovingly.  </P> <P> "I guess we can stay up here, I don't know," Allyn said.  </P> <P> While halfway over the ocean, Maxim Chikin, another Soviet journalist  accompanying the flight, leaned his head into Allyn's cockpit and asked  nervously: "Where is land."  </P> <P> Finally, after two long hours of cold ocean flight, the snowy cliffs of western  Iceland emerged into view. Chikin rolled his eyes in relief.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT LOG  </P> <P> Tony Aliengena, an 11-year-old from San Juan Capistrano, is piloting a  single-engine plane in hopes of becoming the youngest person to ever  circumnavigate the globe.  </P> <P> Latest Leg  </P> <P> From: Iqaluit, Canada  </P> <P> To: Reykjavik, Iceland, with a fuel stop in Sondrestrom, Greenland  </P> <P> 1,450  </P> <P> 9 hours  </P> <P> Departure: 11 a.m. EDT  </P> <P> Arrival: 2 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time  </P> <P> Next Leg  </P> <P> From: Reykjavik, Iceland To: Oslo, Norway  </P> <P> 1,000 miles  </P> <P> 5 hours (est.)  </P> <P> Departure: uncertain  </P> <P> Arrival: uncertain  </P> <P> Total air time:  </P> <P> 38 hours, 10 minutes  </P> <P> Total miles flown:  </P> <P> 6,680  </P></p>

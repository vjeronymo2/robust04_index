			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, May 2 (XINHUA) -- With the rapid development  of its wool textile industry in the past dozen years, China has  risen to become one of the major wool-processing countries in  the world.    At present, all provinces, municipalities and autonomous  regions of the country have wool textile enterprises. The  country now has a total of 3.3 million wool spindles, which is  five times that in 1980. Besides, it also has 35,000 wool looms.    In 1992, China produced 338 million meters of woolen  fabrics,  350,000 tons of knitting wool and 25 million wool carpets.    The country now has various kinds of advanced  domestically-made and imported equipment for wool processing and  rich varieties of wool products such as cashmere sweaters,  artificial furs, camel hair cloth and other products for  decoration and industrial use. Many of the products are fine  finished goods.    Currently, the output value of the wool textile industry  accounts for 15.7 percent of the output value of the country's  total textile industry.</p>

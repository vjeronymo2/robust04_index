			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to a report  in today's "NODONG SINMUN," the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman  on 13 June issued a statement saying that the DPRK would  immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] and reject any inspection of its nuclear facilities.    The statement says: The IAEA's 10 June resolution is an act  of grave encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.    The statement says: The DPRK Foreign Ministry will take  three countermeasures: First, we will immediately withdraw from  the IAEA. We will consider invalid all the resolutions adopted  by the agency; second, inspections for the continuity of  safeguards which we in our unique status have accepted will no  longer be permitted; and third, the DPRK reaffirms its position  that UN sanctions will be regarded as a declaration of war.    In conclusion, the statement says: The DPRK's aforementioned  position will never change until the nuclear issue has been  solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation.</p>

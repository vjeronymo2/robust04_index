			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our representative in Ciskei reports that members of  the security forces have decided to return to work in the  interest of the state. The rebellion by security forces was the  reason for Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's decision to stand down as  leader of Ciskei yesterday. Brig. Gqozo is reportedly being  held at a military base in Bisho. The volatile situation, which  developed at the stadium in the capital this afternoon, was  defused when Brig. Gqozo failed to arrive and address the crowd.  Fires are reported to have broken out in two prisons where  inmates are demanding a general amnesty.</p>

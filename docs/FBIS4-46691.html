			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Petukhov and Andrey Ryabov: "Do Not </F> Stop Us from Living, Help Us To Survive: About the Social Frame  of Mind of Russians"]    [Text] How do Russians perceive the difficult and  painful process of reforms? What do they think of their  immediate prospects? The spectrum of evaluations is very  broad--from the bravura-optimistic type of "people for reform"  to predictions of an impending social explosion that border on  loud demagogy. However, such ideas frequently prove to be far  from reality. This is indicated, in particular, by the results  of comprehensive sociological research conducted by Russia's  Independent Institute of Social and National Problems in 11  regions of the country.    It might appear at first glance that the evaluations of  Russians coincide with the gloomiest forecasts: 89 percent of  respondents called the situation alarming, a crisis, and  catastrophic, while only 5.9 percent called it ordinary. But  against this background of clearly expressed social discomfort,  data that reflect people's feelings on a personal level look  surprising.    Every 10th person assessed his own situation as good, 64  percent as satisfactory, and only 20.2 percent as poor. As for  personal prospects, here cautious optimism also prevails. A  little more than half the people are convinced that their life  will improve, or at worst remain unchanged.    What is the reason for such an obvious gap between the  estimates of the situation in the country and at the personal  level? Apparently, a majority of Russians do not believe in the  ability of the authorities to ensure an acceptable level of  political and economic stability in the country and to guarantee  both public and personal safety. This conclusion, in particular,  derives from the answer to the question: "What is the greatest  danger for Russia today?" Here the picture, in descending order  of importance, is as follows: the increase in crime, the  impoverishment of the people, the impotence of the political  authorities, the growth in unemployment, the worsening of the  ecological situation, and sliding into civil war. (Incidentally,  the last indicator was much lower than in previous years--in  1992 and 1993 it continuously exceeded 50 percent.) That is, it  is perfectly obvious that Russians are alarmed mostly by  problems that are being resolved not on a personal level but  that require the collective, united efforts of society and the  state. The impetus from below is this: You guarantee the  external conditions of vital activity, and we will resolve  problems concerning our personal affairs by ourselves.    The conviction that the current crisis condition of society  is serious and will last a long time has replaced the  "revolution of expectations." But since this is the case, it  will be necessary for us to extricate ourselves. People already  do not want that much from the authorities. To the question:  "What, in your opinion, should be the role of the state in the  life of our country?"--a majority of those polled answered that  the state should ensure all citizens a social minimum  (inexpensive food products, inexpensive clothing, inexpensive  housing, a free education, etc.), but anyone who wants more  should get it by himself. In addition, 63.8 percent of  respondents expressed the desire personally to engage in  business undertakings. But the idea of total liberalism, that  is, that the state should not interfere in the life of the  citizens and that everyone should depend on himself, was  supported by only 4.2 percent of those polled; 13 percent think  that the state should help only the weak and helpless. Somewhat  more respondents, but also a minority (22.4 percent), are  convinced of the need to return to an equalization system in  which the state, according to the idea, should guarantee the  full equality of all citizens (property, legal, and political).    It would seem that the attraction of people to forces of a  social-democratic nature should correspond to similar values in  the spirit of the idea of a socially oriented market. However,  parties of this inclination do not yet enjoy any special  influence in the country. The reason for this, apparently, is  that influential parties of such an orientation can form mainly  on the basis of a powerful national workers and trade union  movement (as, incidentally, occurred in West Europe) that comes  out under the flag of the idea of social partnership. But in the  sphere of economic relations in Russia, the type of hired worker  with rationalistic-market thinking has not yet developed as a  mass phenomenon. Under such conditions, the creation of a  powerful trade union movement that defends the interests of the  collective hired worker before the employer and of a national  trade union center is very problematical.    But on the whole, the notions of which sociopolitical forces  are capable of giving the country a better future are  distinguished by a lack of clarity and fragmentariness. Of the  respondents, 20.6 percent associate their hopes with democratic  forces, 18 percent--with the Russian nationalists, and 16.8  percent are setting their hopes on assistance from the West,  while 11.5 percent are counting on the Orthodox Church to one  degree or another. In a certain measure, the broad spectrum of  political preferences--from universalism and liberalism to  traditionalism and great power ideas--reflects the state of  confusion of the mass conscience. However, more than half the  respondents associate hopes for getting the country out of the  crisis with social forces of a traditionalist-statehood  orientation--Russian nationalists, monarchists, the Cossack  Host, and the Orthodox Church.    Thus, the political force that will want to claim the role  of  national leader will be compelled to combine in its political  activity the ideas of a socially oriented market economy and  traditional national patriotic and state aims. It can be assumed  that this political force, in order to win popularity, will have  to actively exploit anti-mafia and anti-nomenklatura slogans.    This may be a party or movement of a neo-conservative  persuasion that adheres to democratic rules and procedures in  the struggle and is based on the ideas of a socially oriented  market which recognizes the priority of laws and human freedom  and simultaneously calls for preservation of the traditions of a  strong statehood and the Russian spirit and patriotism.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / FTC to look at Merck bid for Medco THE planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) takeover by Merck, the US's biggest drugs company, of Medco Containment Services, the country's largest mail-order drugs distributor, has run into a potential setback with the Federal Trade Commission's indication that it plans to scrutinise the deal more closely. An FTC request to the two companies for more information about the merger was made at almost the last possible moment under the Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust regulations. The waiting period under the regulations, which would otherwise have expired last Friday, will now stretch until at least 20 days after the two companies respond to the FTC's queries. Merck, which announced the news after the stock market had closed on Friday, said that the request for more information had been made only late in the afternoon and said it had not yet seen details of the FTC's inquiry. It added, though, that it was confident the deal would go ahead in the fourth quarter of the year, as originally planned. The takeover has aroused concerns among some competitors, who fear the deal could cut off an important distribution channel. Medco has said that it will continue to distribute other companies' drugs, although it expects Merck's products to account for a larger proportion of its sales. The deal is also subject to approval by Medco's share-holders.</p>

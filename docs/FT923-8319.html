			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact members asked for more cash THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation is reported to have asked its members for more cash in order to increase its buffer stock buying and shore up prices. Mr Aldo Hofmeister, the organisation's buffer stock manager, told the local news agency here that Inro members would be asked to contribute MDollars 150m (USDollars 60m) in order to support further buffer stock operations. Mr Hofmeister said that Inro countries had till mid-October to come up with the funds. Traders feel that the Inro action reflects increasing frustration with present pricing structures as natural rubber prices continue to fall. At the end of last week Inro bought between 4,000 and 8,000 tonnes of Malaysian rubber and between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes of Indonesian rubber as part of its efforts to stop prices falling.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POWER OUTAGE HITS DURING RUSH HOUR  </P> <P> Most of Pasadena was without electricity for up to two hours Wednesday night  during a power outage that apparently was caused by a faulty switch controlling  a main high-voltage transmission line, police said.  </P> <P> The outage affected about 80 percent of city residents and knocked out traffic  lights through a large swath of the city at the height of rush hour. Police  officers were stationed at major intersections to direct traffic.  </P> <P> Police Sgt. Bruce A. Linsenmayer said police received scores of calls, but none  amounted to anything serious.  </P> <P> "No injuries, no traffic accidents, nothing -- and it happened right at prime  time," he said.  </P> <P> David C. Plumb, general manager of Pasadena's Water and Power Department, said  the switch shut down a 230-kilovolt transmission line for just a few seconds.  But the power loss caused a chain reaction that disrupted other power lines  connected to the system.  </P> <P> Plumb said the department is still unsure what caused the switching problem.  </P> <P> Workers began restoring power soon after the lines shut down and had power back  to all homes by 6:45 p.m. There are approximately 50,000 homes in the city.  </P></p>

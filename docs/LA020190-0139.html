			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FIRED-UP NORDIQUES GO DOWN SWINGING, 6-3  </P> <P> Everything seems to be going from worse to terrible for the Quebec Nordiques.  </P> <P> The rest of the NHL has been beating the hapless team with regularity. They  have the worst record, by far.  </P> <P> There is no sign things will get better. Just before taking on the tough Sabres  Wednesday night at Buffalo, the Nordiques learned that veteran forward Guy  Lafleur has a broken cheekbone and will be out for a month.  </P> <P> Angered over the way it happened Tuesday night in a one-sided loss at home to  the Sabres, the Nordiques had one-goal leads three different times before  losing, 6-3.  </P> <P> The Nordiques felt that Lafleur's injury in the closing minutes of a 5-2 game  was a "sneak" attack by former King defenseman Dean Kennedy.  </P> <P> The Nordiques came out battling Wednesday. There were two fights in the first  32 seconds, and the play was rough throughout.  </P> <P> Benoit Hogue's unassisted goal after a steal, tied the score, 3-3, four minutes  into the final period. Defenseman Mike Ramsey's shot from the point 2 1/2  minutes later dropped out of goalie Scott Gordon's glove into the net and the  Sabres took control.  </P> <P> Detroit 7, Edmonton 5 -- Steve Yzerman had the first four-goal game of his  career, two of them in a four-goal outburst that brought the Red Wings from  behind in the last period at Detroit.  </P> <P> A victory would have moved the Oilers into first place in the Smythe Division.  With Craig Simpson scoring twice, the Oilers built a 4-3 lead, but they  couldn't hold it in the last period.  </P> <P> St. Louis 2, New York Rangers 2 -- It was a good two-game trip to the New York  area for the Blues. After upsetting the Islanders, 2-1, Tuesday night, they  came right back to tie the Rangers.  </P> <P> Brett Hull scored his 47th goal and rookie goaltender Curtis Joseph came off  the bench to stop all 27 shots he faced in the last 47 minutes. Hull has 27  goals in his last 26 games and leads the league in goals.  </P> <P> Washington 4, Minnesota 3 -- John Tucker scored just 35 seconds into overtime  at Bloomington, Minn., to give the Capitals the victory.  </P> <P> The North Stars dominated the first 39:56, firing 34 shots and leading, 2-0.  But when Geoff Courtnall scored on a power play with four seconds left in the  second period, they seemed to lose their zip.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Winnipeg 5 -- Vincent Damphgouse set up Tom Kurvers for a goal at  10:35 of the third period at Winnipeg, then scored himself 24 seconds later,  and the Maple Leafs earned a tie.

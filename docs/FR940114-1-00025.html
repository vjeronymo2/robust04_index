			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to more effectively organize and consolidate the roadway safety components from each of these various guidelines, the agencies propose to create a new guideline entitled ``Roadway Safety''. While the four related guidelines will remain unchanged, the new Roadway Safety Guideline highlights selected aspects from these four guidelines which are recommended to be included in any State Roadway Safety program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of these three new guidelines will ensure that guidelines reflecting the current state-of-the-art are available for each of the National Priority Program Areas listed at 23 CFR part 1205.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Revision of Six Existing Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the original program standards were issued in the early 1970's, much has changed in both technology and societal behavior which affects the methodology and approach to solving highway safety problems. When the standards were originally issued, there were no State laws requiring safety belt or child safety seat use, there was little public awareness about drunk driving, and highway safety was not yet a matter of great public concern. Because the highway safety environment has changed so dramatically during the past twenty years, the agencies propose to update the guidelines to provide current information on effective program content for States to use in producing and assessing their traffic safety programs. Each of the proposed revised guidelines reflects the experience of States in traffic safety program content and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety. They provide a framework for producing and assessing a balanced highway safety program and a tool with which States can assess the effectiveness of their own programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies propose to update only those guidelines which correspond to the programs currently designated as Priority Areas. The agencies strongly believe that focusing attention on the priority programs has the greatest impact on highway safety. The revised guidelines will emphasize these areas of national concern and highlight the effective countermeasures which are available, while continuing to permit States to receive funding for additional areas of local concern when justified, and thus ensure that section 402 resources are being allocated in the most effective manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

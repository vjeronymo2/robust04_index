			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Relations between the  Russian president and the new legislature have aggravated again  after the law-makers set up a lower house commission to  investigate the armed rebellion in Moscow on October 3-4 and  called for a new building to house the parliament, Yeltsin's  chief of staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS and Ostankino  Television.    Filatov disapproved of the setting up of a house  investigatory commission because the Russian Federal  Prosecutor's Office is already conducting an investigation into  the matter on its own. He blamed the president's envoy to the  parliament Aleksandr Yakovlev for the shortfall: He should have  proposed that the law-makers hear the federal prosecutor first  or wait until an official statement was made by the  investigators. Any duplication of investigative efforts  generates mistrust and confrontation, Filatov suggested.    As concerns a new residence for the State Duma, Filatov said  Moscow simply did not have a building to suit the tastes of the  lower house. Commenting on (former Soviet parliament speaker)  Anatoliy Lukyanov's proposal that the Russian legislature be  given the building of the former Soviet parliament in the  Kremlin, Filatov said the building was now occupied by the  president and his staff while the neighboring residence of the  head of state was under repair, which is due to last for three  years.    As for the former Communist Party Central Committee  buildings  in Staraya Square, for which the Duma asked as an alternative,  it housed the federal government and some other departments, the  Moscow regional duma and administration, and the presidential  staff. Filatov said.    The number of rooms in the "White House" which was earlier  occupied by the Russian parliament dissolved last September, is  insufficient to provide offices for all the 450 deputies of the  present legislature, each of whom wants to employ several  assistants for the 80 minimal wages [as received] granted them.  The house committees and commissions, factions and technical  services as well as the Secretariat are also building up their  staffs, who will need at least 1000 offices.    Filatov said a combined version will probably be offered to  the Duma, including the building of the former State Planning  Committee in Okhotny Ryad.    It is more important to avoid squabbling but arrange  constructive interaction between the chambers of the Federal  Assembly, the president and the government. Towards this are  now working the president's representative in the parliament  Aleksandr Yakovlev, Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov and a  department of the president's staff. "This is a daily uphill  job, but I know that President Bill Clinton's staff thinks  nothing is more important than interaction with the Congress",  Filatov stressed.    He added that the presidential message to the parliament on  the state of the federation will urge all three branches of  power to interact constructively in making effective in practice  the constitutional provisions which protect human rights, ensure  reforms and combat crime.    The president has prepared a package of 60 bills on economic  and court reforms, and on the state system, as well as draft  civil, land and environmental codes, Filatov added.</p>

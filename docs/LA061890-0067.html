			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARDINAL DENIES THREATENING POLITICIANS OVER ABORTION  </P> <P> Cardinal John J. O'Connor insisted Sunday that he never threatened to  excommunicate Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. He said his  views on the contentious issue have been widely misinterpreted.  </P> <P> O'Connor, speaking at St. Patrick's Cathedral, said that many politicians and  members of the news media had misunderstood a long column about abortion that  he wrote for last week's Catholic New York, the official archdiocese newspaper.  </P> <P> "I never threatened to excommunicate anybody," said O'Connor, who heads the  U.S. Catholic bishops' pro-life committee and has been an outspoken opponent of  abortion.  </P> <P> "I wish everybody would read what I wrote," he said. "I never suggested that  any other bishop should excommunicate anybody. I have no intention of  excommunicating anybody. I don't say, in any way whatsoever, that I'm  threatening politicians.  </P> <P> "The last thing in the world I want to see is anyone excommunicated," he added.  </P> <P> Many such officials, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, personally oppose abortion  but do not seek to impose their beliefs on others.  </P> <P> O'Connor wrote: "Where Catholics are perceived not only as treating church  teaching on abortion with contempt, but helping to multiply abortions by  advocating legislation supporting abortion, or by making public funds available  for abortion, bishops may decide that, for the common good, such Catholics must  be warned that they are at risk of excommunication."  </P></p>

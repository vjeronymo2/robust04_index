			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTER DEFEATS CORREIA, LYLES IN 76TH-DISTRICT RACE  </P> <P> In a race that drew national attention as a referendum on the U.S. Supreme  Court's recent abortion ruling, Tricia Hunter, a pro-choice Republican, won a  special state Assembly contest that could provide a prelude to the 1990  elections.  </P> <P> Final unofficial vote totals showed that Hunter, a 37-year-old Bonita nurse  whose pro-choice stance attracted traditional Democratic support in the heavily  Republican 76th District, received 49% of the vote to defeat Democrat Jeannine  Correia and two write-in candidates -- one of them fellow Republican Dick  Lyles, a Poway businessman who ran a close second in the August primary.  </P> <P> With nearly 15,000 write-in votes remaining to be counted, Hunter's lead was  insurmountable, even if Lyles receives all of those ballots in the conservative  San Diego-Riverside County district.  </P> <P> According to the final figures, Hunter received 25,302 votes, while Lyles  apparently finished second with about 19,800 votes, assuming he received most  of the write-in ballots cast Tuesday -- votes that will not be verified until  today. Correia finished third with 6,587 votes, while the race's other write-in  candidate, Republican Kirby Bowser, finished a distant fourth in the election  to fill the vacancy created by the June death of Assemblyman Bill Bradley  (R-Escondido).  </P> <P> The turnout in the election was 21%, slightly higher than officials had  anticipated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victory Was Hailed  </P> <P> Though Lyles' write-in status, with its attendant political difficulties, skews  interpretations of the abortion issue's impact on Tuesday's vote, the outcome  was hailed in advance as a harbinger of the emotional topic's enhanced  political import as a result of the states' new court-approved powers to limit  the circumstances under which abortions are available.  </P> <P> "If we can win in this district, we can win anywhere," Robin Schneider,  director of the California Abortion Rights Action League's Southern California  chapter, said during the primary.  </P> <P> Although anti-abortion activists resisted framing the contest as an up or down  vote on abortion, they nevertheless aggressively backed Lyles, recognizing that  a Hunter victory not only would be politically embarrassing but could alter the  Legislature's philosophical balance on abortion rights.  </P> <P> The 76th District campaign's framework was constructed early in the primary  when the U. S. Supreme Court, scaling back the pro-choice latitude established  by its landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, issued its controversial ruling giving  states new authority to restrict abortions.  </P> <P> With Hunter's pro-choice position setting up a compelling ideological showdown  in an eight-candidate field filled with anti-abortion Republicans, the  otherwise obscure race attracted extensive national news coverage as one of the  first tests of the political fallout from the court's July decision.  </P> <P> Drawing support that typically goes to Democrats -- much of it from pro-choice  activists hoping to capitalize on a rare opportunity to gain an ally in a  solidly conservative district -- Hunter narrowly edged Lyles in the August  primary, 14,885 votes to 14,688. Although Democrat Correia finished fifth, the  primary's unorthodox format -- in which all candidates of all parties appeared  on a single ballot -- allowed her to qualify for the runoff by outpolling the  only other Democrat in the race to complete Bradley's unexpired term, which  runs through the end of 1990.  </P> <P> Under normal circumstances, Hunter's 197-vote victory would have caused the  runoff in the heavily Republican district to loom as little more than an  electoral formality. With Republicans holding a 55%-32% registration edge,  victory in the GOP primary historically is tantamount to election in the  district, which stretches from the South Bay to northeastern San Diego County  and into the desert communities of Riverside County.  </P> <P> Lyles' decision to continue his campaign despite his primary loss, however,  created at least some uncertainty about the outcome, consequently raising  concern among Republican leaders who feared that his write-in candidacy could  split the GOP vote, giving at least a glint of hope to Correia, whose chances  normally would be negligible.  </P> <P> Dismissively treating Lyles as a sore loser who failed to accept defeat, Hunter  largely ignored her erstwhile primary opponent in the runoff campaign, refusing  to participate in any forum to which he had been invited in a strategically  shrewd move to curtail his visibility.  </P> <P> But Hunter's campaign advisers, determined to avoid overconfidence born of the  formidable obstacles facing any write-in, regarded Lyles as a serious threat.  Several Hunter mailers singled out Lyles for caustic criticism, including one  that described him as "the choice of the gun lobby, anti-choice extremists and  the Sacramento Cavemen," with the last phrase referring to arch-conservatives  in the Republican Assembly caucus.  </P> <P> Throughout the runoff, the campaign reflected an inherent irony: Hunter, who  owed her very presence to the abortion issue's ascendancy in the primary,  consistently sought to minimize its significance, terming it "only one of many  issues -- and not even one of the top ones -- people are concerned about."  Meanwhile, Lyles, who was victimized by the issue in August, fought to maintain  its preeminence in the runoff.  </P> <P> "In the time it takes you to vote, four babies will die from abortion," warned  a Lyles brochure, distributed outside churches last weekend. The same pamphlet,  which contrasted Lyles' staunch anti-abortion position with the pro-choice  advocacy of both Hunter and Correia, featured a photo of a baby, with a caption  saying: "This little guy wants YOU to vote Oct. 3."  </P> <P> In part, the paradoxical manner in which Hunter and Lyles addressed the  volatile issue stemmed from their recognition of how the political equation  governing its impact had changed dramatically from the primary to the runoff.  </P> <P> As the sole pro-choice Republican in the primary, Hunter benefitted from  saturation coverage that allowed her to catapult from the middle of the pack.  In the runoff, however, Hunter realized that she had nothing to gain from a  one-on-one confrontation with Lyles and that her interests would be better  served by a quiet campaign that dampened passions on all sides.  </P> <P> Conversely, Lyles, who was forced to carve up the anti-abortion vote with four  other Republicans in the primary, saw an obvious numerical advantage in  carrying that banner alone in the runoff. More importantly, Lyles and his  strategists recognized the intense emotion generated by the issue as an  essential ingredient in their uphill bid to win a race in which his name was  not even on the ballot.  </P> <P> "Abortion is the kind of issue that motivates people to turn out and take that  extra step to write in a candidate's name," said Lyles, a 42-year-old  management consultant. "I think it's going to be a major factor -- maybe the  factor -- in the election."  </P> <P> Correia, meanwhile, acknowledged that her admittedly slim chances hinged on a  badly divided GOP vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Election Results  </P> <P> 76th Assembly District  </P> <P> 336 of 336 Precincts Reporting  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.21IN:1.78IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tricia Hunter  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25,302  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 48.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jeannine Correia  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,587  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dick Lyles  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kirby Bowser  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Uncounted write-ins  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14,888  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

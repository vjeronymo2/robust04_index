			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Andriessen given fresh US farm reform ideas MR Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, left Washington yesterday with 'new ideas' presented by US cabinet officers to break the deadlock over farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round. In a day of intensive talks on Wednesday, US and EC officials exchanged suggestions and tried to work out 'new formulas' now to be discussed in the EC Commission, an EC official said in Washington. Senior US and EC officials are likely to meet again over agriculture before the Group of Seven summit in Munich in early July. Mr Graham Blight, president of the Australian national farmers' federation, in Washington yesterday to meet US agriculture officials, said he expected a breakthrough to come before the G7 summit. Mr Blight suggested the 'new ideas' discussed were within the framework of the draft proposal by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general. US officials had given him 'no indication there is something out there that would give us a problem,' he said. During his visit, Mr Andriessen met Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and Mr Edward Madigan, agriculture secretary. Mr Baker's participation was seen as an important political signal to give impetus to the Uruguay Round. Mrs Hills said both sides were trying to narrow the gap between concessions made possible by last week's agreement on Common Agriculture Policy reform, and wider requirements for a Gatt deal.</p>

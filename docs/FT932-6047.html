			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: Paribas confident of continued recovery PARIBAS, the big French investment banking group which clawed its way back to a profit last year, expects to continue to recover in 1993. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, told a shareholders' meeting the group should 'continue its progress' this year. He also identified the first signs of recovery in the property sector, noting a slight improvement in the housing market, although commercial property remained depressed. The precarious state of the property sector forced Paribas, and other French banks, to make big provisions last year. Mr Levy-Lang said providing there was no further deterioration, the group's property writedowns would probably be lower in 1993 than in 1992. It made total provisions of FFr7.8bn (Dollars 1.42bn) last year. Banque Paribas, the investment bank, had performed 'satisfactorily' so far this year, Mr Levy-Lang said. The steady reduction in French interest rates had alleviated the pressure on its trading activities. By contrast, Compagnie Bancaire, the specialist financing business, had been 'heavily affected by the crisis in the property market and small business sector', he said. Its savings activities fared well, although demand for credit had been 'mediocre'. Credit du Nord, the retail banking network, was affected by the sluggish economic environment.</p>

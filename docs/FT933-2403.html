			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Buying through a broker Could you please clarify the position for a private individual, with regard to buying and selling shares on the stock exchange through a stockbroker? I understand that losses may be offset against gains, in a financial year; but are the brokers' charges for buying and selling, and stamp duty costs, allowed to be deducted from any profits arising in individual share transactions. Yes, by virtue of section 38(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) and CGT 13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Talks to tackle rice import ban THE Japanese government is taking its first step to open talks with the US and EC over the country's ban on rice imports, a potential stumbling block to successful completion of the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Mr Masami Tanabu, Japanese agriculture minister, will leave Japan today for talks in Washington with Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and in Brussels with Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. He will reiterate his government's opposition to replacing the outright ban on imported rice with a system of tariffs, and will ask for rice to be exempt from Gatt provisions.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Stocks plod on past the by-elections Voters went to bury John Major on Thursday not to praise him - yet the markets blithely ignored the ceremony. A bad by-election result for the Tories was already in stock prices, market makers suggested. And anyway any number of things - good or bad  - could still happen to the government before the general election, including faster economic growth. There was plenty of time left to factor-in risk premiums to equities, bonds and sterling. Thus, with politics despatched, stocks continued their modest recovery. The FT-SE 100 index climbed back above the 3,000 level from its rout a fortnight ago and ended the week up a net 58.1 points at 3,055.9. But trading volumes remained very light, as the accompanying chart shows. Institutions continue to buy sparingly, confident that equity and gilt bargains will be around for a while yet. Tuesday was one of the quietest days in 12 months. Yet investors might be less sanguine about politics come Monday morning, after the Euro-elections results are released. If the sharp by-election swing against the Government is mirrored in European constituencies, the Tories could end up with no seats in Strasbourg. Then it becomes irrelevant how many speeds the prime minister's Euro-vehicle has. He will have no Euro-MPs left to push it. Third place in the by-elections and 'a disastrous showing' in the European elections would leave the Conservatives 'reeling from a fatal blow to their credibility', says Trevor Laugharne, a Kleinwort Benson strategist, with consequent damage to gilts and sterling. He identifies two particular political risks that would dog the markets: that this government would relax monetary and fiscal policy to curry electoral favour - to the detriment of the inflation rate; and that the next government would more likely be Labour and more interventionist, to the even greater detriment of inflation. The political pressure on markets might not be be so cut and dried, argues Ifty Islam, a bond analyst with Merrill Lynch, in London. A newly assertive Bank of England, and the publishing of the minutes of monthly meetings between the Bank governor and the chancellor, have 'probably reduced the extent to which politics can influence policy'. Moreover, with the economy accelerating and three years until the general election, the Tories for some tax cuts. He also points out that the electorate thinks Labour could govern better than the Tories, even on a number of traditional Conservative issues. Voters expressed greater confidence in Labour on, for example, law and order, defence, tax cutting and beating inflation, in recent Gallup opinion polls. However he adds: 'It is pretty hard to see much of a gap between the main parties on most aspects of economic policy.' Timing may be the crucial question. With governments only facing the electorate every four or five years, markets only focus intensely on politics in bursts before elections. 'Politics are either very, very important or not very important at all,' says Mark Brown, head of strategy at Hoare Govett. A terrific Tory government today might only be worth another 100 points on the Footsie but, 12 months from now as the next election looms, it could be worth 300 points, he hazards. Most analysts consider there is a more imminent risk to the confidence of foreign investors in UK markets which could exacerbate any selling pressure in coming days. Less attuned to the reality of British politics, foreigners could still jump to the conclusion that Labour were socialists intent on shackling the economy and that the Tories were destined, as ever, on liberating it. Yet even domestic investors can find themselves confused. It did not sound like Tory-talk when Stephen Dorrell, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, suggested recently that companies might be paying out too much of their profits in dividends, leaving insufficient money for investment. The prime minister was quick to point out this week that the government had no intention of controlling dividends. But he ducked the issue. The government could still try to raise revenues by reducing institutions' dividend tax privileges. Suspicious about the government's intentions, City lobbyists and analysts remain on high alert. Certainly, companies know how to please the institutions. Hefty dividend rises this week came from BAA (up 12.5 per cent), Amersham International (up 15 per cent), Vodafone (up 20 per cent) and EMAP (up 12.2 per cent). Institutional support was also evident for a number of companies. LIG, the condom maker, launched a one for one rescue rights issue and the new issue market remains open to those companies willing to accept realistic pricings. Not all of them can. British Printing Company, for example, pulled its float on Monday. Its debt load was too great to allow a lower rating. One notable newcomer to London this week was Service Corporation International, the world's largest funeral director. Wanting one foot in the UK market, it launched an Pounds 87.4m hostile bid for Great Southern Group, the second largest quoted UK funeral director. Service, which has grown from one funeral home in Texas 32 years ago to 843 worldwide today, under the chairmanship of Robert Waltrip, likes to please. 'As long as its legal and in good taste, we will try to do what the family wants,' a spokesman said. Great Southern's controlling family only wants Service to go away. A trust holding a 56.1 per cent stake has rejected the bid. Perhaps Barry Field, its chairman, will need another job soon: he is Tory MP for the Isle of Wight.</p>

Han, meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney,  complained that such references create the impression that South  Korea has human rights problems despite its democratic progress,  Foreign Ministry officials said.    Laney, handing over a written statement of explanation,  apologized for U.S. officials' having unintentionally hurt the  feelings of South Koreans with their remarks.    Laney's statement said Washington is fully aware of Seoul's  great strides in democracy and human rights, and "unequivocally  recognizes the fundamental shift in attitude and policy of the  Kim Yong-sam administration towards human rights," as  acknowledged by the 1993 human rights report.    The controversy started when U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State Tom Hubbard told a seminar last week that Washington  wants to see Seoul repeal its national security law.    The comment sparked immediate protests that it was undue  interference in South Korea's internal affairs, while raising  suspicions that the issue had been discussed with North Korea  since Hubbard was chief U.S. working-level nuclear negotiator  with Pyongyang.    Indeed, Hubbard was in the middle of last-minute bargaining  with North Korean officials when he made the remark last week.    Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday that the  United States hopes the "Korean Government and the Korean people  might find it appropriate to no longer have that law in effect"  because it is "subject to abuse and a reflection of an earlier  time."    Laney said the U.S. officials' comments should be seen "as  remarks of close friends and democratic peers."    "I have unqualified confidence in (South Korea's) human  rights practices and its respect for the rule of law," said  Laney in his statement.    Han, while calling the remarks ill-timed, said he personally  believed they came out "accidentally."    "The security law is now revised but at the U.S.  working-level, images of the past apparently remain and that  tends to show up in high officials' speeches and press  briefings," he said after meeting Laney.    "We think the comments were accidental, but we still needed  to drive home a strong message to prevent a repetition of  similar remarks that could be made due to lack of understanding  of the current security law," he said.</p>

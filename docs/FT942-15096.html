			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sweet steak draw - As South Africa struggles in the world spotlight, Weekend FT looks at how food and drink has played a part in the country's culture It augured well. Opposite me on the London Underground were three young South Africans. The men were speaking Afrikaans, but clearly the woman was less happy in this language: 'Where do we get off?' she asked in English. 'Shepherd's Bush', said one of the men. Perhaps they too were dining at The Rotisserie, London's South African restaurant. Like the duc des Esseintes in Joris Karl Huysman's A Rebours (Against Nature), who learned all he wanted to know about Britain from visiting an English tavern in Paris, I aimed to glean the maximum amount about South African food from a restaurant in London. The Rotisserie did not give an overwhelmingly South African impression. I asked the patient and good-natured manager what I should eat. 'Have the tiger prawns and the peri-peri (chilli sauce)'. He said. 'Do I get Mrs Ball's chutney with that?' 'No, you eat that with your steak'. Steak, he said, was a typical South African dish, which did not make South Africa sound very different to the US, Australia or Ireland. 'You have great meat here', he said, 'but you don't know how to cook it. In South Africa we know how to treat good meat.' The meat arrived. It had indeed been treated; bathed in a sweet marinade which not everyone at my table liked. Mrs Ball's chutney was also rather sweet. The atmosphere was young and fun. There were South African wines and good, juicy steaks; but I was going to have to look elsewhere if I was to discover real South African food. One excellent tip I received was to call Emory St Marcus, owner of St Marcus Fine Foods, in Putney, south London. St Marcus is the man who supplies homesick South Africans with their needs, from biltong to chocolate bars. Biltong is dried meat in the manner of viande des grisons bresaola or Bundnerfleisch. The meat is salted, marinated and dried. The word derives from 'buttock-tongue' because it was cut from the buttock, and looked like a tongue. Biltong can be made from any animal. There is currently some speculation as to whether we will see ostrich biltong in the UK once the new British ostrich farm is up and running. Game of all sorts is used and both St Marcus, and Susman's Best Beef Biltong in Sussex makes a venison version. The difference between biltong and the Swiss and Italian versions seems to lie in the marinades. Basic St Marcus biltong has a lot of coriander in the marinade. Pre-cut, it tends to dry out. I much enjoyed the Susman 'wild venison' - gaminess seems to add a dimension to biltong. Also on the dry side is Droewors, which St Marcus compares to the German Landjager. Sosaties are South African kebabs. St Marcus makes versions from beef, lamb and pork. The highly-spiced meat is alternated with pieces of fruit: apricots and pineapple. More to my taste was boerewors, the finely-minced beef sausage which comes in a coil like a Cumberland sausage. The basic mixture of 87 per cent beef and rusk is marinated in vinegar before being filled into runners. Susman's supplies a good many of the top shops in London. St Marcus offers anything from South African fruit juices and wines to some of the more important staples of the Capetown table such as monkey gland sauce and peri-peri.

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Meciar fights for sporting chance in poll True to his sporting instincts, Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's former and, he hopes, future prime minister, likes to introduce his party's candidates for this weekend's general election as 'a new team for Slovakia'. But the game is far from won and Mr Meciar's fortunes have waxed and waned. After he was ousted as premier in March amid allegations of corruption in the privatisation process and economic mismanagement, sup-port for him and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), shot up to nearly 40 per cent in sympathy. But since campaigning began earlier this month for Slovakia's first general election since it split from the Czech Republic, no opinion poll has given the HZDS more than 30 per cent, and its support now hovers around 25 per cent. Unless the party wins at least 30 per cent of seats in the new parliament, Mr Meciar is unlikely to win back the job of prime minister. Many voters have been alienated by Mr Meciar's repeated attacks on President Michal Kovac, whose criticisms of his leadership style led to the former prime minister's ousting, and on Slovakia's Hungarian minority, which he has accused of being too powerful. Slovakia's three ethnic Hungarian parties currently support the present coalition government headed by prime minister Jozef Moravcik. The outcome depends on the 20 per cent of voters who claim to be undecided. Though he still insists HZDS will reach its target, Mr Meciar seems to be fighting a losing battle to convince those voters to back him. Floating voters could opt for the Democratic Left party (SDL) of reformed communists, which dominates the Common Choice grouping with 20 per cent of voter support. As an influential member of the present government, the SDL has transformed its image from old-style communist to progressive social democrat. The SDL is considered almost certain to be a member of the next government because tensions in the party over this transformation could swing it either into the HZDS camp or towards a government similar to the outgoing coalition. But if it chooses to support an HZDS-led government, senior members of the party, including Ms Brigita Schmognerova, have threatened to quit. 'A coalition requires co-operation, and HZDS does not seem able to co-operate with anybody,' Ms Schmognerova says. 'They cannot be part of a stable government.' The campaign has been dominated by Mr Meciar's personality and differing approaches to privatisation. In the last days of his previous administration Mr Meciar approved over 40 secret deals to sell state companies to their managers at give-away prices. Mr Moravcik's government reversed 25 of them after taking office and restarted voucher privatisation, the system popular in the Czech Republic which Mr Moravcik hopes will work similar miracles in Slovakia. Vouchers went on sale before the poll campaign kicked off and so far 700,000 people have bought coupons they can exchange for shares in state companies. Mr Moravcik is also hoping an improved economic outlook will rebound to his advantage. Growth in the first half of this year is a healthy 4.4 per cent after four years of decline, and both inflation and unemployment have stabilised, though they remain high. Foreign investors are waiting in the wings for signs of stability. The parties in the outgoing government accept privatisation as the basis of stability. Mr Meciar does not. He has said he will scrap the voucher programme and begin selling state companies to management again if he is prime minister. Some 700,000 Slovaks might not like to hear that.</p>

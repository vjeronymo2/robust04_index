If the party upon whose motion the deposition was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, any other party may offer the deposition or any thereof in evidence. If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced and any party may introduce any other parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.429 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Ex parte communications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) At no stage of the proceeding between its institution and issuance of the final decision shall an employee of the Department who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the decisional process of the proceeding discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding with any person having an interest in the proceeding, or with any representative of such person:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That, procedural matters and status reports shall not be included within this limitation; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided further,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That an employee of the Department who is or may be involved in the decisional process of the proceeding may discuss the merits of the proceeding if all parties of record have been given notice and an opportunity to participate.

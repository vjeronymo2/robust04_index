			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Dutch group to resume dividend payments INTERNATIO-MULLER, the Dutch trading and technical installation group, is to resume dividend payments for the first time since 1989 after swinging back into profit in 1992 following substantial losses in 1991. The company, which has divested 40 companies over the past two years as part of a strategy of refocusing on its core businesses, said it posted a net profit of Fl 30.1m (Dollars 16.7m) in 1992. This marks a significant improvement from the losses of Fl 121.3m suffered a year earlier, when charges of Fl 92.4m were incurred for book losses and reorganisation costs. In 1992, charges fell to just Fl 7.2m. Internatio-Muller said it intended to pay a dividend of Fl 1 a share over 1992 results, compared with its last pay-out of Fl 3.60 per share over 1989 results. Sales fell by nearly 10 per cent to Fl 2.8bn last year, mainly as a result of divestments and deconsolidations. In the two years since it began its divestment drive, Internatio-Muller has sold off businesses which generated a total of Fl 700m in sales. Operating results, excluding extraordinary charges, swung into a profit of Fl 43m from a loss of Fl 25.2m a year earlier.</p>

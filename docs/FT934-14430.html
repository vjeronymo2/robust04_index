			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: A tauter, leaner Body Shop - The Bottom Line THE Body Shop Bounces Back, was how the company headlined its interim results press release. Pre-tax profits announced on Thursday had indeed recovered from the Pounds 8.3m recorded in 1992 to Pounds 10m, for the six months to end August, bouncing above the Pounds 9.2m made in the first half of 1991. Forecasts for full year pre-tax profits also suggest a bounce, from the Pounds 21.5m in the year to end February to Pounds 25m or Pounds 26m, probably beating the previous record of Pounds 25.2m. But the real question is: has Body Shop bounced back sufficiently from the string of disappointments and poor publicity which has hounded it over the last year or two to return to its former glamour stock market rating? In May last year Channel 4 showed a television programme questioning the commitment of Body Shop - which makes and sells natural cosmetics and toiletries - to not testing its products on animals. In August this year the company and its chairman and managing director Gordon and Anita Roddick won libel damages. A US TV company planning a programme in a similar vein has since dropped the idea. In September 1992 Body Shop fell foul of the stock market when it warned that interim profits would fall because UK sales had been disappointing. The shares, which had peaked early in 1992 at over 350p, fell 108p in a day to 158p. That was followed in January by a downbeat statement on Christmas trading, and the shares fell 15p that day to 153p. To outsiders the group's most obvious problem has been in the UK, where comparable store sales were falling by as much as 10 per cent a year ago and 8 per cent over the last Christmas period. Sceptics point to the progress rival retailers have made in selling 'me-too' products at lower prices. Gordon Roddick dismisses the fear of competition, saying he would be more concerned if no one was copying the Body Shop idea. He believes that its premium-priced products are premium quality and its target market is different. The sales trend has been reversing; by the end of the half year period same-store sales were down 3 per cent and by this Christmas the group expects to have at least halted the decline. But Body Shop's more fundamental problem has been that, having grown rapidly from small beginnings, it has perhaps lost some control of parts of its empire and has lacked the professional management to apply the best disciplines. Independent directors are being sought to bring the board more into line with current corporate practice. The good news is that the company itself is well aware of this. New management has been brought in and is already having a dynamic effect on the business. It recognises that Body Shop has reached maturity in terms of shop numbers in the UK, but that does not mean it cannot improve profits. Applying tighter retail disciplines alone should improve margins. In any case, the UK, although the core business, contributed only 36 per cent of interim profits. The group has a more impressive record internationally than most other UK retailers and it is barely reaching critical mass, let alone maturity, in its most developed area, the US. In other places, such as Europe, Australia and the Far East Body Shop is still in its early stages. Its aim is to become the world's best-known retailer, a target it is some way to achieving. Body Shop has worked hard on its production side and now manufactures 55 to 60 per cent of its volume itself, up from 25 per cent a few years ago. A tighter grip has been taken on finances. Gearing is down to 24 per cent, the big capital expenditure hump has been passed, and excessive working capital has been cut. The company has matured in more ways than one. The rapid growth of the late 1980s is past and multiples of 30 or more will not be seen again. However, the shares - which have risen 23p to 198p since the results were announced - are on a prospective p/e of 22. That is high, even against the sector, and requires profit growth of perhaps 20 per cent a year to sustain. But that is by no means impossible.</p>

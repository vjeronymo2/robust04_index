			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Yugoslavia by correspondent Vladimir </F> Solovyev, including recording of interview with N. Bezborodov,  head of Russian State Duma delegation; from the "Novosti"  newscast]    [Text] [Solovyev] For over three days the first official  delegation of the Russian State Duma to former Yugoslav  republics has been continuing its familiarization with the  details of the Balkan tragedy. After a number of meetings in  the Yugoslav capital at the weekend, the deputies visited Pale  and Sarajevo where they held consultations with leaders of the  Bosnian Serbs and Sarajevo Muslims. They visited the Russian  paratroop battalion in Grbavica, Sarajevo's Serb section. Today  the parliamentarians saw Vukovar -- a Yugoslav Stalingrad -- and  Klisa, the main base of the Russian contingent of blue helmets.    [Bezborodov] We believe that the initiative put forward now  by Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin must be urgently  discussed. It is a question of holding a conference attended by  Russia, the United States, the United Nations, the European  Union, and the parties to the conflict, in order to sit at the  negotiating table as soon as possible and to solve all the  disputes peacefully.    [Solovyev] Some members of the Russian delegation took a  special UN flight to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, today. The  Russian deputies are to meet Serbia President Slobodan Milosevic  tomorrow.</p>

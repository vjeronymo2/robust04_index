			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed-rate loans yield to cash-back incentives Three months ago, fixed-rate loans accounted for 80 per cent of new mortgage business at the Halifax building society, which has 19 per cent of the UK mortgage market. Today, the figure is around 5 per cent. While the change is extraordinary, it is not hard to explain, writes Joanna Slaughter. Long-term, fixed-rate mortgages virtually sold themselves earlier this year because borrowers were paying less for a fixed-rate loan over three or five years than they were for a standard variable rate. But upheavals in the money markets have reversed this situation. The borrower who wants a five-year fixed rate now has to pay a premium of around 1.5 percentage points over the variable mortgage rate. As a result long-term, fixed-rate mortgages have all but vanished. Instead, cash-back incentives show every sign of becoming the mortgage innovation of 1994. Dick Spelman, Halifax general manager, says: 'Cash-backs are marginally more attractive to lenders than discounts. They are still a good deal for the customer.' Cash incentives - which are calculated as a percentage of the mortgage loan  -were relatively modest, initially. But building societies are adept at playing commercial leapfrog and it is now possible to get cash-backs of over Pounds 7,000. More generally, a welcome development is that mortgage lenders are moving away from tying borrowers to an endowment policy or to a personal pension plan and are allowing them an unrestricted choice of repayment vehicle. Similarly, fewer lenders now make their own buildings and contents insurance a non-negotiable part of a mortgage offer. It is still possible to get 100 per cent advances. These can prove a lifeline for house-owners who need to move but remain caught in the negative equity trap. The Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland provide them and others, such as the Household Mortgage Corporation and Skipton building society, have 100 per cent schemes specifically for negative equity victims.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Phoenix of Beirut starts to rise from the ashes of civil war THE chic and wealthy young wives of east Beirut browse through the Coco Chanel and French lingerie stores in the modern glass and steel ABC indoor shopping mall, built after the end of the civil war. After a busy morning buying expensive perfume, cosmetics and designer clothes and enduring occasional power cuts the fashionable women eat a light lunch together before zooming home in BMWs and Mercedes. On both sides of the city, once divided by the killing zone known as the 'Green Line', a new Beirut is rising from the debris of 15 years' fratricidal bloodshed. Two years of peace and five months of government under billionaire prime minister Rafik Al-Hariri has restored confidence to many Lebanese. The government has started to reassert economic control and speeded a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.46bn) public and private reconstruction of the city. The political situation remains volatile and the government faces a Herculean challenge in financing its rehabilitation plans and stabilising an economy awash with corruption, unemployment and poverty. The armed sectarian militias which once mounted checkpoints and ran parts of the city as fiefdoms have been cleared off the streets and replaced with the Lebanese Army. Syrian troops still operate checkpoints, marked by pictures of President Hafez al - Assad taken against a bouquet of red roses, but their presence is more discreet. Much of the business optimism is based on a belief in the miracles expected from the government of Mr Hariri. Mr Michel Sinoura, finance minister, says the government has already made substantial economic gains, particularly in turning round the balance of payments deficit. The Lebanese pound has been stabilised, despite a politically-motivated attack on the currency in late January which was successfully fought off by a Dollars 300m Central Bank intervention. Mr Sinoura says big efforts are under way to slash a soaring budget deficit of LPounds 1,200bn (Pounds 472m) last year by reducing expenditure and improving revenue collection. Stabilising the macro-economic environment and reforming an unwieldy and disintegrated public service are critical in attracting the huge sums required to implement the government's reconstruction plans. On the public sector side the government is trying to speed implementation of a World Bank-backed Dollars 2.3bn three year project for rebuilding and modernising the city's infrastructure. Mr Al-Fadl Chalak, president of the Council for Development and Reconstruction, says the CDR has just completed pre-qualification of tenders for the Dollars 250m-Dollars 280m electricity rehabilitation and expects to award the tender in July. All other projects are almost ready to go to tender. However the CDR has so far received financing pledges for only Dollars 400m. The rest may be raised at a Paris meeting of donors in April. In the private sector, the second main thrust of the reconstruction project is a controversial Dollars 3bn plan to rehabilitate 1.3m square metres, including 660,000 square metres of private property, in the bombed-out centre of Beirut. While western diplomats say the economic plans and achievements of the government are impressive, there are still serious contraints. Politically, Mr Hariri is walking a tightrope between the different factions. The Maronite-Christian community boycotted last year's elections because of the continued presence of Syrian troops in Beirut in contravention of the peace agreement hammered out in late 1989 in Taif, Saudi Arabia. They remain suspicious of the increasing power of Mr Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, at the expense of the presidency, which is reserved for a Maronite Christian. Last month Mr Hariri clashed with President Elias Hrawi over government appointments, marking the end of the political honeymoon. Maronite businessmen, who have a large part of the estimated Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn held by nationals abroad, were accused of leading an attack on the Lebanese pound in an effort to weaken the government. The Kataeb, the Maronite political party, is also torn by an internal power struggle. Another problem is the continued power of the Islamic fundamentalist Hizbollah, which is building its influence through charitable activities. Curbing the Hizbollah and finding a political solution to Maronite discontent are largely dependent on external factors. Hizbollah remains almost untouchable while it heads the forces fighting against Israeli occupation in the south of Lebanon. The Maronites are unlikely to be reassured until the Syrians abide by the Taif accord and redeploy all their 40,000 troops to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Regaining Lebanese sovereignty will be critical to overcoming the looming political problems and without it Mr Hariri will find his grand economic ambitions much more difficult to achieve.</p>

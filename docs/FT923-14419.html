			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Arts: Song recitals To London music-lovers Cheryl Studer is known as the face that launches a thousand record covers. The few live appearances she has made here have told us relatively little about her. In Wagner's Lohengrin or as the gleaming top soprano in Mahler's Eighth Symphony, it has been Studer first and foremost as a remarkable voice who has left audiences wanting more. The recordings have given us more - operatic roles many and various. Those are still eagerly awaited at Covent Garden and there seems to be no sign of them as yet. But, as a substantial makeweight, Studer appeared in recital at the Royal Opera House on Friday with Wagner and Strauss dominant in her programme, on the face of it a sensible choice. Unfortunately there was disappointment in store. The opening Schubert group may have been largely an opportunity to warm up, but it introduced irritants which were to settle in for the evening. The pitch tended to sag in the middle of the voice. The singing bumped along the consonants. Nor was there a lot of spontaneity at this stage in her partnership with Irwin Gage, who was laying bare the inner workings of Schubert's piano parts with cool precision. To my ears, this was the work of a singer who was trying so hard to do the right things that any natural sense of musicality was being pretty thoroughly smothered. One sensed Studer needing to break free from such small scale works and to some extent she succeeded in doing so in Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder, although even there the voice was asking for an orchestral accompaniment if it was to sound at its best. The second half, in which she sang Richard Strauss, remained mixed. Slow songs continued to stagnate; but when speed or muscular strength was called for, as in 'Standchen' or 'Zueignung', the singing took off with the help of Gage's exemplary playing, and Studer's potential as an interpreter of songs could at last be glimpsed. The audience response was enthusiastic. Warm enough, I hope, to encourage her to return in the operatic roles we all long to hear. * By chance, Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder turned up again three days later, when Anne-Marie Owens gave a recital at St. John's, Smith Square. This was an altogether less problematical performance, in which the music flowed easily. This mezzo does not pose difficulties of style for herself and the general amplitude and romantic warmth of the songs were well sustained, even if there is rather more depth in them than she finds. In the past year or two at this hall, Malcolm Martineau has come to judge the acoustics to a nicety and he gave his singer accompaniments with plenty of atmosphere. A Schumann group might have shown a more detailed grasp of the words; the Debussy songs and her Spanish selection settled into a warm-hearted, easy-going mood a little too often. All through, however, one felt musicianship naturally at work, singer and song in harmony together.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "The West Lifts Cold War </F> Restrictions: COCOM Is Dead, but Its Cause Lives On"]    [Text] COCOM was established in 1949 at U.S.  initiative for the purpose of restricting exports of the latest  technologies, in particular military technology, to socialist  countries, and was based on three lists: arms, nuclear equipment  and materials, and industry (i.e. dual-purpose technologies). In  1991 the industrial list was replaced by a "Core List"  containing nine sections: electronics, materials processing,  advanced materials, telecommunication and navigational  equipment, data security devices, sensors and lasers, marine  vessels and equipment, and engines. In July 1992 restrictions on  telecommunications equipment were eased, as were restrictions on  computer exports in October 1993. With the dissolution of COCOM  all restrictions should now be lifted.    As of yesterday COCOM may be considered officially defunct.  That means that more than 300 various restrictions have been  lifted with regard to Russia alone. Specifically, the White  House announced that as of Monday it will allow computers  capable of performing 1,000 million theoretical operations per  second (roughly 100 times less powerful than the most modern  supercomputers) to be exported to Russia. This kind of  "concession" holds out to Americans the promise of expansion of  their potential market by $1.3 billion in the field of computer  exports and another $15 billion in the telecommunications field.  But problems still remain for Russia.    Back in October of last year Secretary of State Warren  Christopher put it this way: "The greater portion of  export-import architecture rests on an outdated Cold War  foundation. It is clear that the time has come to rebuild it."  That rebuilding began with little delay. On 6 November 1993 the  NATO countries plus Australia and Japan conferred and agreed in  principle to remove the cornerstone of that foundation -- COCOM.  And by 17 November COCOM was already sentenced to die.    The money-conscious Americans long ago calculated that if  all  restrictions on exports to Russia and China were not lifted by  the end of the 1990's the losses to U.S. companies would be as  much as $250 million annually, with as many as 5,000 new  unemployed joining the soup lines each year. Bill Clinton first  referred to his intention of lifting COCOM restrictions at a  meeting with Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver last year. That comment  soon grew into the "New U.S. Export Doctrine," and specifically  to the call therein for an easing of export restrictions on  computer equipment, including exports to Russia. Exporters had  complained that under new geopolitical conditions the COCOM  restrictions were like a sieve anyway and did the most harm to  exporters. It was not surprising that probably the most active  proponent of eliminating this favorite child of the Cold War was  the National Association of U.S. Industrialists. Resilient COCOM  retreated but did not surrender, immediately agreeing to lift  restrictions on the exports of computers to Russia and China  with a capability of 67 million theoretical operations per  second (MTOS). It also allowed exports of more powerful  computers: up to 100 MTOS "on a discretionary basis" and up to  194 MTOS "by agreement with COCOM."    But for fairness' sake it should be noted that the COCOM  cause is alive and triumphant. Firstly, the former members of  COCOM intend to replace the defunct committee with a body of a  fundamentally different political orientation and composition.  It will deal with multilateral coordination of control over the  proliferation of high technology. They also intend to invite  Finland, Sweden, Austria, Ireland, New Zealand and Hong Kong, as  well as Russia and China, to join what was formerly virtually an  all-NATO structure. Countries that have been found to have used  or are suspected of using imported high-tech equipment for  military purposes -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- will  be left out for now. They are the ones that are going to be  monitored. Incidentally, this blacklist, along with the list of  members in the "new COCOM," remains open.    Secondly, it is still too soon to drink a toast to the  lifting of trade restrictions against Russia. Specifically,  during recent meetings in Moscow the attention of U.S. Secretary  of Trade Ron Brown was repeatedly directed to the existence of  the long-outdated and discriminatory Jackson-Vanik Amendment.  Nor is the situation any better with regard to trade with other  former COCOM members. Boris Yeltsin threatened Brown with  bringing up the issue of lifting restrictions against Russia at  this summer's G-7 summit in Naples. So even though the last  hatchet of the Cold War may have been buried, Russia still has  something to fight for.</p>

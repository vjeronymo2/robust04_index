			<p>BFN     [Text] Following efforts made in recent months, the  outlines of a Chinese-Russian mutual trade zone between the  residents of Manzhouli in China and Zabaykalsk in Russia are  taking shape. It is the only zone of its type being created  with the approval of the PRC State Council.    The zone is located on the outskirts of the neighboring  cities of Manzhouli and Zabaykalsk. Its overall area amounts to  11.8 square km. Areas in the zone have been set aside for free  trade, currency and banking facilities, tax free storage and  production facilities, and residential and entertainment  centers. After an identify check and payment of a fee, Chinese  and Russian border residents and businessmen can enter the zone  freely without a passport (?or) a visa for wholesale, retail,  barter, or other form of trade. Free circulation of Chinese  yuan, Russian ruble, or the currency of other CIS states, as  well as freely convertible currencies will be permitted in the  zone.</p>

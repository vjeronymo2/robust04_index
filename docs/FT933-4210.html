			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (14): Main players happy - Fiat, Volkswagen-Audi and GM are the main contenders / Central and Eastern Europe SUBSTANTIAL foreign investment in new or modernised car plants is becoming a powerful stimulus to economic growth in central and eastern Europe. It is helping economies adapt to meet the real needs of consumers rather than the priorities of planners. The build-up in production volumes from Fiat in Poland, Volkswagen-controlled Skoda Automobilova in the Czech republic and, on a lesser scale, General Motors and Suzuki in Hungary is helping to compensate for the decline in output from the steel, heavy engineering and arms industries which were the mainstays of the old economies. As in the UK, where heavy inward investment by the big Japanese car companies is helping to reverse decades of industrial decline, central Europe is gaining export-orientated plants whose demand for components has spawned rapid collateral growth in components manufacture. Central Europe is becoming both a significant player in the European car industry per se and a fast-growing source of car components as western components makers follow the leading car producers with low-cost, locally-produced components and trim. In some cases, companies such as Ford, which have decided against building assembly plants in the region, have opted instead to lower the overall cost of assembling vehicles in their existing west European plants by sourcing components in this low cost region. Ford, for example, is sourcing many of its electrical components from a new Dollars 100m plant south of Budapest. The rising production of components is steadily improving the local content ratio of the Fiat Cinquecento, Skoda Favorit and other models coming off the assembly lines - and so maximising the advantage of low wage rates and high skill levels. Over time, rapid economic growth will erode the wage-cost advantage which is currently the main attraction for the European and US multinationals. But higher incomes will raise purchasing power and unleash the potential of what is still a largely untapped market of 65m people in central Europe alone. Significantly, Poland, with 39m people, has become the first of the post-communist states to recover from the steep initial restructuring recession. One of the forces behind recovery was a 32 per cent rise in car output last year as production of the new Cinquecento, mainly for export to Italy and other EC markets, soared from 5,500 in 1991 to 82,400. This year, Cinquecento output is building up towards the 240,000 capacity planned for mid-decade, while a new Fiat family car will roll off the production lines within the next two or three years. Limited assembly of the the GM Astra model at the Warsaw FSO plant will further boost output. A 29 per cent rise in output from Skoda Automobilova over the first quarter of 1993 reflects a similar pattern in the Czech republic which is also poised to resume overall economic growth in the second half of this year. Skoda Automobilova plans to double output to about 440,000 vehicles as Volkswagen seeks to repeat its success in revamping Seat in Spain and create a new generation of low-cost but well-engineered cars from its Czech plants. In Hungary, output is also building up from the Magyar Suzuki plant at Esztergom, built on a former Soviet military base close to the Austrian border. But the first investment by Japanese industry in the region faces big problems. The recession and fierce competition in EC markets together with a stronger-than-expected Hungarian forint, cultural problems with a local labour force reluctant to adapt to a Japanese-style work regime, and the impact of a strong yen on its imported components have all conspired to make life difficult for the company. General Motors has also found that the unexpectedly rapid liberalisation of Hungary's foreign trade regime changed the assumptions upon which it based its original DM400m decision to build both a small Astra assembly plant and an engine factory at Szentgottard in western Hungary. The original plan was to earn hard currency from engine exports to other GM plants, to pay for the foreign exchange costs of the imported kits for Astra assembly in Hungary for the domestic market. Intense competition in the still depressed Hungarian domestic market means that General Motors is now having to export Astras from its Hungarian plant which contain expensive imported components and are built in uneconomically low volumes. Despite the problems faced by earlier entrants, however, Hungary remains popular among foreign investors. Fiat and Volkswagen-Audi have emerged as the main European players in central Europe, with the French industry reduced to small kit assembly operations in Poland and the traditional close links with the Romanian industry. General Motors leads the American pack, seeing its scaled-down Astra assembly operation in Poland as a toe-hold in what is expected to be the fastest growing market in the region. The main players seem happy with their strategic moves into central Europe and are cautiously reviewing prospects further east where the future of economic reform remains clouded by political factors and the enduring power of the old communist nomenklatura in the big state-owned plants. Significantly, however, car production has held up surprisingly well in the former Soviet states. Last year, while industrial output generally fell by more than 18 per cent in Russia, car production fell by only 6.6 per cent, according to a study by Planecon Europe and DRI-McGraw-Hill. Exports also performed well, even though the various Lada models now coming off the production lines for export have to compete head-on for hard currency sales both in the west and in the former Comecon states.</p>

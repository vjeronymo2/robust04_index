			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina proposed that  Cuba and Peru eliminate import taxes on some 200 products, which  would substantially increase trade between the two countries.    He also invited Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba  through mixed enterprises or joint ventures.    The proposal was made to Industry, Commerce, and Integration  Minister Liliana Canale during a working meeting in her office.    Robaina, who carried a list, proposed that some 200 products  be placed on the list of products that benefit from the partial  agreement that allows the importation of products with a zero  import tax.    Currently only about a dozen products do not pay import  taxes. This greatly restricts trade between Peru and Cuba.    Cuba thus would export medicine, rum, citrus fruit, and  sugar  cane, while Peru would export fish meal and minerals, among  other goods.    Robaina also proposed that a commercial mission visit Cuba  in  June. Peru has yet to answer the invitation.    The commercial mission would be headed by Minister Canale,  who would be accompanied by private businessmen who have  expressed interest in investing in Cuba, in the tourism field  especially.    After the meeting, Minister Canale said she is carefully  assessing the Cuban proposals in order to give an answer as soon  as possible.    She said contact will be made with the business sector to  reach a consensus regarding the products that could be imported.    She explained that the mechanism is similar to the one  upheld  by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], through which  the continent's countries have reached similar agreements in the  region.    Canale said the purpose of the commercial mission's trip  would be to identify trade prospects between the two countries,  although she added that the trip's date has not been established  yet.    She then added that the Cuban foreign minister's visit has  awakened interest in investing in that country and that there  are businessmen who want to step up the exchange of experiences.    Canale said her ministry is willing to support every effort  designed to step up commercial relations with that Caribbean  island and added that the Cuban authorities' proposal is being  studied.    Regarding her possible trip, Minister Canale said she is  reviewing her agenda to determine whether or not she will be  able to travel to Cuba in the near future because she is very  willing to visit Fidel Castro's country.    Contact between the two countries will be maintained through  the respective foreign ministries, which will be kept informed  of the decisions made in the coming months.    When asked about the Cuban proposal, Confiep [National  Confederation of Private Business] President Arturo Woodman  answered immediately, saying he is in favor of tax exemptions.    He said it is up to the government to make a decision in  this  regard, but said he was in favor of the immediate implementation  of tax exemptions in order to step up trade between the two  countries.    He said it would be a good thing to increase trade between  the two countries because it would allow Peru to export fish  meal, proteins, and other products to that island.    Woodman said the issue is now in the government's hands,  which has to see about the legal aspects of eliminating import  taxes for some 200 products.    Foreign Minister Robaina voiced his satisfaction with the  results of his meeting with Minister Canale and said the results  will be noticed soon.    He said the upcoming visit of a Peruvian commercial  delegation to his country will help strengthen commercial ties  between the two countries.    After the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a series  of meetings with Peruvian political and social figures.    In the evening he attended a cultural event at the National  Museum, during which beautiful Cuban music was played. The  event also was attended by political and cultural  representatives.    After the event Robaina left the country to continue his  tour  of the continent in an attempt to tighten cooperation ties.</p>

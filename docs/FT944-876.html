			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Hurd may have to retreat on dam aid The government could be forced to return some Pounds 24m already spent on Malaysia's Pergau dam to the Overseas Development Administration, in spite of a recent statement that 'the books for previous years are closed'. The World Development Movement, which recently secured a High Court ruling that payments for Pergau were illegal, said yesterday that it would take up the case again if money spent on the dam in previous years was not returned to the aid budget. In a recent statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told the Commons that funds which were due to be paid to the Malaysian government this year and next would come out of the Treasury reserves, and that the ODA could retain existing funds for other projects. But, according to WDM, Mr Hurd is also obliged by the court judgment to reimburse the aid budget with money spent on the Pergau project in previous years. As evidence for this, the organisation cites the High Court ruling that 'the secretary of state would take such steps as were necessary to give effect to the judgment of the court'.</p>

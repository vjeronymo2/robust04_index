			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--The Palestinian ambassador to  Egypt, Sa'id Kamal, has declared that the shooting of  worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn today  raises doubts about the usefulness of negotiating over the  transitional period, which involves settlements and settlers as  part of the agreement pertaining to it.    In a statement to MENA, Sa'id Kamal demanded that the  Israeli  Government immediately adopt a resolution removing the  settlements and withdrawing the settlers so that the peace  operation might follow its sound and natural course. He said he  doubts the efficacy of negotiating under the circumstances.    Kamal explained that the Palestinian proposal to place the  West Bank and Gaza under international protection has been  proven sound.    Hasan 'Usfur, deputy chairman of the Security Affairs  Committee in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on  implementing autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, condemned the  massacre. He stressed that the Israeli settlers' new crime  reveals the inherent brutality of those who reside illegally in  the occupied territories.    'Usfur added that their actions contradict the most obvious  legal principles and offer new proof that the peace process is  not an easy issue but is a complicated operation that requires  extreme efforts to maintain it.    The Palestinian official remarked that the new crime  illustrates to Rabin's government the danger that the continuing  presence of the settlers poses for the peace process. He said  that if Israel wants to preserve the peace process, it must  first end the new barbarism of these people, who are no longer a  danger to the Palestinians alone, but to the entire peace  operation. They are thus a danger to Rabin's government.    'Usfur concluded his remarks by noting that this new  criminal  act demonstrates the Palestinian negotiators' sound logic when  they considered the dangers represented by such people and told  the Israeli negotiators that security is a mutual concern, not a  demand made by one party.</p>

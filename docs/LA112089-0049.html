			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> 'HUMOR THERAPY' FAILS TO LIVE UP TO ITS BILLING IN TESTS  </P> <P> If you laugh, the whole world may laugh with you -- but it probably won't do  much for your health, a study released recently suggests.  </P> <P> Patients who laughed at an old Jack Benny routine felt no better than those who  listened to soothing ocean sounds during their operations, researchers  reported.  </P> <P> "Some anecdotal reports and laboratory studies with healthy populations suggest  humor may be of therapeutic benefit to hospitalized patients," wrote Joseph  Neumann, a psychologist at the Quillen-Dishner College of Medicine in Johnson  City, Tenn. "The present report suggests the helpful effects of humor in  hospitalized patients may be less than previously indicated."  </P> <P> The study, published as a letter in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.,  involved eight men who underwent prostate surgery and 16 men who underwent a  procedure to test arteries in their legs.  </P> <P> Half the patients listened to a one-hour tape of "an old Jack Benny radio  show," while the other half listened to a one-hour tape of ocean sounds while  undergoing their procedures.  </P> <P> Eighty-five per cent of those who listened to the Jack Benny tape "described  the tape as humorous," Neumann said.  </P> <P> Neumann compared the two groups of patients using a variety of variables,  including heart rates and anxiety and pain levels before, during and after the  surgery. He found "no statistically significant group differences."  </P> <P> "Caution is urged in advocating extensive resources for 'humor therapy.' While  the therapy probably does not hurt, this as well as other controlled studies  cast doubt on the efficacy of humor or music tape approaches," he said.  </P> <P> "Further controlled research is needed to find out if humor therapy works and,  if it does, with what patients and under what conditions," he added.  </P> <P> The letter was titled, "Humor Therapy: The Good News -- No One Died; The Bad  News -- Jack Benny Did."  </P> <P> In an accompanying letter, Beth and Philip Henneman of the UCLA Medical Center  described a study aimed at demonstrating that "a smile is contagious."  </P> <P> Of 300 hospital workers in the study, 87% of those who the researchers smiled  at, smiled back, the Hennemans said. Only 8% of those who received eye contact  without smiles smiled back, they said.  </P> <P> "Interestingly, 60% of the subjects in the experimental group (those who were  smiled at) offered a 'hi' or other salutation in addition to smiling," they  said.  </P> <P> "This research supports the theory that a smile begets a smile. Implementation  of this technique has the potential to increase socialization and decrease  stress in large, impersonal medical centers," they said.  </P> <P> "It is highly recommended that this study be replicated at other institutions,  not only with staff, but with patients and families as well," they said.  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Coal areas to gain EU aid The European Commission is to allocate Ecu400m (Pounds 304m) of aid to coal communities over the next four years under the European Union's Rechar programme, it was announced yesterday. A large part of the Rechar money, which was unveiled as part of the broader Ecu13.45bn, six-year programme of structural funding yesterday, is expected to go to British coal regions, which have been among the worst hit by the decline of the coal industry. The money will be provided between this year and 1997 to support community projects. There was no firm decision on the precise allocation of funds to the different member states. Mr Bruce Millan, regional policy commissioner, is expected to unveil further details of the European-wide programme in Brussels today. Although yesterday's decision did not earmark funds for particular regions, Britain's coalfield communities were confident that a large proportion - the equivalent of Pounds 150m - was coming their way. Councillor Hedley Salt, representing the coalfield local authorities, said: 'Our areas are in desperate need of new industries and new jobs. This marvellous support from Brussels highlights just how little has come from our own government.' Rechar funds have been delayed in the UK because of disagreements between Brussels and Whitehall over their allocation.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUTE TO THE NEW HOME: FOLLOW THE PAPER TRAIL;  </P> <P> DOCUMENTS: THE MAZE OF PAPER WORK THAT GREETS HOME BUYERS IN ESCROW IS MOSTLY  IN HANDS OF PEOPLE YOU NEVER MEET.  </P> <P> You have found a home to buy. Your offer has been accepted. You have managed to  read, understand and deal with the paper work involved in committing yourself  to a piece of real estate.  </P> <P> Don't breathe that sigh of relief yet. There's more.  </P> <P> Now you have to get the money to pay for your home, and you have to make it  through escrow. Financing requires organization and work on your part. Escrow  paper work, though very important to you, is mostly in the hands of people you  will never meet.  </P> <P> The paper work varies from lender to lender. But you will probably see some  version of these basics for a single owner-occupied property, as outlined by  George A. Matthews, vice president and area loan manager of Great Western Bank.  </P> <P> Residential Loan Application. This is the first form the borrower will see,  often accompanied by the Loan Disclosure (see below). The questions here are  straightforward inquiries about the type of loan you are applying for, the  property you want to buy and you. It asks about income, assets, debts and where  your down payment will come from.  </P> <P> Now suppose, as is often the case for first-time buyers, the down payment is  borrowed from parents, with the understanding that it will be repaid when the  house is eventually sold. Great Western requires that a "gift letter" be in the  borrower's file, a statement from the parents that the money is a gift. Each  lender handles the gift situation differently. Some lenders require that half  the down come from your own resources. How carefully all this information is  verified also varies. The lender will tell you about how much insurance  coverage you must have to get your loan.  </P> <P> Federal rules require that you be given a consumer handbook that explains in  plain language how mortgage loans work and translates often-bewildering  "lenderese" terms. An approval/denial decision must be made within 30 days of  the lender having the completed application in hand. But lenders have different  definitions of what constitutes a "completed application."  </P> <P> Statement of Assets and Liabilities. A supplement to the application, more  space to summarize what you own and what you owe.  </P> <P> Authorization to Disclose. A catchall permission for the lender to check into  your credit, employment, mortgages and deposits. This covers inquiries you have  not specifically authorized anywhere else.  </P> <P> Loan Disclosure. Required by the Office of Thrift Supervision (formerly the  Federal Home Loan Bank Board) for owner-occupied homes, whether the loan is  adjustable or fixed rate. It gives the specifics of loan terms without giving  actual numbers: It explains limits on adjustments to payments and the interest  rate, whether the loan is assumable, if it is due on sale, whether it involves  negative amortization, how the impound account, if any, is set up to pay taxes  and insurance.  </P> <P> Read this one carefully and be sure you understand it.  </P> <P> Flood Insurance Notice/Acknowledgement. Required by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency -- if the home you are buying is in a flood plain and you  want to be eligible for federal relief in case of a disastrous flood. This is  sent to you, at the latest, when notice of loan approval is sent.  </P> <P> Fire insurance, incidentally, is always required by a lender; earthquake  insurance is not. A lender may also insist on sinkhole, mudslide, demolition or  other types of insurance, depending on the type and location of the property.  </P> <P> Federal Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement. The Office of Thrift Supervision  requires that this be sent to you within three working days after you begin the  application process -- thus, it is sometimes referred to as a "three-day."  </P> <P> It tells you the relevant numbers: interest rate, how much you are borrowing,  how much you will have paid at the end of 30 years, your payment schedule,  late-payment charges, prepayment penalty, if any.  </P> <P> The three-day version is an estimate, for your information. Before the close of  escrow, you get a similar form with firm numbers (except for long-term costs,  which can't be predicted with certainty for an ARM); this latter one you sign.  </P> <P> Good Faith Estimate of Settlement Charges. Another "three-day," required by the  federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA). This lets you  know where the money you borrow is going: to you, the seller, the property  inspector, the appraiser, the escrow company, the notary, the title insurance  company, public agencies, the pest inspector, anyone holding claims against the  property.  </P> <P> This document itemizes your "prepaid finance charge," which includes the loan  origination fee, loan discount (or points), credit check fee, prepaid interest,  mortgage insurance fees. (These terms, by the way, are explained in the  Settlement Costs pamphlet; see below.)  </P> <P> And -- hang on -- you may yet have to pay more than is listed here.  </P> <P> Settlement Costs Booklet. One more "three-day," required under RESPA and  produced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This pamphlet  explains in plain language the home-buying process and many of the terms you  will see on your loan documents. Even with its tiny green type, it is well  worth careful reading. Worksheets are included to help you shop for services.  </P> <P> Itemization of Amount Financed. The final version of the Good Faith Estimate.  By signing it, you are acknowledging that you've read it and that everything is  as you understood it would be. Review it carefully before you sign.  </P> <P> Loan Commitment. The lender's notice to you that you got the money. Practice  varies among lenders; Great Western's letter reviews the numbers you have seen  on other documents and summarizes features such as negative amortization,  assumability, interest rate limits.  </P> <P> Promissory Note. This is your IOU for the loan. You've almost made it now: This  is one of the last loan documents you see. The lender returns it to you when  your loan is paid off. It may go by other names, usually involving the word  note.  </P> <P>  Once again, this document reviews your interest rate, payments, limits on  interest or payment adjustments, and how often adjustments are made. Make sure  all these numbers jibe with your understanding of what they should be. Once you  sign this, you are committed to the terms of the loan.  </P> <P> Deed of Trust. With this, you pledge your home as security for the money you  have borrowed. It means the lender could end up owning the property if you  default on your loan. You keep the Grant Deed, which is the actual proof of  ownership of your home. The lender holds onto the Deed of Trust. Signatures on  this must be notarized, since this is being recorded with the County Recorder.  By the time you see this one, you may already feel as if you have signed your  life away. There should be no surprises in this document.  </P> <P> Settlement Statement. An account of where everyone's money has gone, to the  penny. This serves as a checklist for the escrow officer, who completes the  two-page form, required under RESPA. Items covered include sales commissions,  loan fees, insurance fees, taxes, title charges, government recording and  transfer charges, and additional charges such as survey and pest inspection  fees. HUD's Settlement Costs booklet explains the terms here, which by this  point you can probably recite in your fitful sleep.  </P> <P> "Riders" to loan documents. A rider to the Promissory Note, for instance, might  predict your interest rate when the first adjustment occurs on an  adjustable-rate loan.  </P> <P> At the eye of the paper hurricane, with documents blowing in from all  directions, sits the escrow officer. This person must make sure all the money  and all the papers land in the right hands, that everything is signed and  recorded, and that it is all legit.  </P> <P> Here are the things the officer keeps track of during the often-mysterious  process of escrow, as explained by Billie Sandlin of Integrity Escrow,  president of the California Escrow Assn.  </P> <P> Preliminary title search, to determine the condition of title to the property.  The escrow officer tells the title company to open the search, which involves  checking County Recorder's records for any taxes, liens or judgments against  the property or easements; checking court records for judgments against the  owner; finding out how title is held, whether the owner has the right to sell  the property and who must sign away any claims on it.  </P> <P> All claims on the property usually have to be cleared before it can be legally  transferred to the buyer. The escrow company asks the seller's lender for a  Beneficiary's Demand for payment, that is, what the lender needs to clear its  claim on the property.  </P> <P> Beneficiary's statement. If the buyer is assuming the seller's loan, this tells  the condition of the loan, monthly payment, balance due, interest rate, charges  of any kind and conditions for assumption of loan. That is, everything about  the loan that a new buyer might want to know.  </P> <P> If payments are overdue, the seller usually has to make them before the sale  goes through.  </P> <P> Lender's requirements. Before a new loan can be made, the lender will have  checked the buyer's credit and appraised the property already. It may also  require a title company inspection of property, copies of the escrow  instructions, termite report and hazard insurance. The escrow company tells the  buyer's insurance agent how the policy must read to meet the lender's  requirements.  </P> <P> The Deed of Trust and Promissory Note will go to the escrow office, usually the  place they are signed. The money will go to the title company, which pays off  all loans of record and sends the rest of the money to the escrow company.  </P> <P> Funds received from the buyer. The purchase deposit goes into an escrow trust  account. When closing approaches, closing costs plus down payment are figured  out. If the buyer pays this by a cashier's check on a California bank, escrow  can close the next day.  </P> <P> Deed or other escrow-related documents. The Grant Deed, signed by seller and  transferring ownership to buyer, needs to be recorded before a new loan can be  recorded. The title company is responsible for getting these documents to the  County Recorder and recording them, but the escrow company must see that it  gets done.  </P> <P> Proration of taxes, interest, insurance and rents. The escrow officer does all  the math, so everything is fairly divided on the day escrow closes.  </P> <P> Releases of all contingencies or other conditions. A common example: A sale may  be subject to the buyer getting a new loan. If contingencies are not met,  escrow cannot be closed.  </P> <P> Recording of deeds and other documents. This takes place at close of escrow.  The title company almost always does this, then lets the escrow office know  it's been done so escrow can be closed.  </P> <P> Title insurance policy, which goes along with the title search. Title insurance  protects the buyer in case the title company fails to uncover some claim  against the property.  </P> <P> Closing escrow when everyone's instructions have been carried out. It can be  done when everything has been recorded and the money is in the hands of the  title company.  </P> <P> Disbursement of funds, including charges for title insurance, recording fees,  real estate commissions and loan payoffs. Buyer and seller get individual  statements.  </P> <P> Final statements for everyone involved.  </P> <P> If you've made it through all of this, congratulations! You've got yourself a  new home.  </P></p>

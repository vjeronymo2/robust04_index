			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: Poetry with perception - FT Children's Book of the Month APPLE FIRE, THE HALESWORTH MIDDLE SCHOOL ANTHOLOGY edited by Jill Pirrie Bloodaxe Books Pounds 7.95, 128 pages GENERALLY speaking, it has not been a good year for children's poetry. The only memorable collection of the spring was Philip Gross's The All-Nite Cafe (Faber, Pounds 3.99). At his best, Gross is an inventive and imaginatively far-reaching poet, but the book's format and general presentation were so mean and unappealing that few children are likely to have seen it. More's the pity. Matters have taken a turn for the better, however, with the publication of three new anthologies. Two are good: The Orchard Book of Poems for older children, chosen by Adrian Mitchell (Pounds 14.99); and First Poems (Orchard, Pounds 8.99), compiled by Julia Eccleshare, who has for many years been responsible for editing that excellent annual publication, Children's Books of the Year. Best of all, though, is Apple Fire, a selection from the many poems written by children between 11 and 13 at Halesworth middle school, on the Suffolk coast, under the tutelage of their English teacher, Jill Pirrie. Over the past decade, 54 of Pirrie's pupils have won individual awards in the annual WH Smith young writers' competitions, and the general quality of the poetry in this book is quite astonishing. It reveals an acute sensitivity to the hidden resources of language, an ear for its music and a sense, above all else, that these children have discovered something akin to what the Bronte sisters discovered at Haworth parsonage in the 1820s. In the words of Ursula Le Guin, they have 'learned the landscape of their own being and how to describe it.' Learning poetry by rote in UK schools is, effectively, dead - and few would wish anything else. But where do we go from here in teaching poetry? There are, of course, creative writing classes. But none can succeed without a teacher who both understands the value of poetry and can share that understanding with children. Pirrie has both these qualities, as is evident from her excellent introduction to this book: a wise, trenchant and entirely unsentimental defence of the value of poetry in a child's life. Every child is an oddity; and every child can be encouraged to put words and images to the sights, sounds and feelings particular to himself. The task demands wakefulness and an attention to detail - which children possess naturally in abundance. By discussion and example, the impetus to write can be released and the capacity to think, look and listen in words be nurtured. The positive consequences, when achieved, are three-fold: the universalising of particular experiences; the reconciliation of inner and outer worlds; and, most exciting of all, new perspectives on the ordinary. The child, guided properly and encouraged, is enabled to come into the inheritance of a living, shared language, quickened and refined by its literature. The promotion of literacy is a much larger and wider thing than helping a child to be a master of the language of cliches; and teaching poetry, with the close attention that it demands to the meanings of individual words, together with its economies of form and structure, is an ideal way of introducing children to the value of language itself. It all sounds heady and inspirational stuff, but the fact is that the results are there to be sampled in this excellent book. These children have been quickened into a radiant perceptiveness by their sympathetic teacher; and Pirrie must have felt from time to time what that other teacher, DH Lawrence, described once at the end of a poem entitled 'The Best of School': I feel them cling and cleave to me As vines going eagerly up; they twine My life with other leaves, my time Is hidden in theirs, their thrills are mine. But who taught the teacher? The most important presence in this book is that of Ted Hughes, Britain's finest living poet for children. Pirrie often uses his farmyard fable, What is the Truth?, to set the creative process in motion. Many of the children's own poems are written in a forceful, driving, Hughesian vers libre, and have that hot, sharp stink of fox about them, irrespective of whether they are dealing with animals, dead or alive, or the natural world in all its beautiful fragility. An earlier book by Hughes, Poetry in the Making, contains a useful piece of advice for teachers that Jill Pirrie quotes in her introduction: 'Their words should be not 'How to Write' but 'How to say what you really mean' - which is part of the search for self-knowledge and perhaps, in one form or another, grace.' These are important matters - too important to be left to the teachers alone.</p>

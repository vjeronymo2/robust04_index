			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR),  Viktor Gerashchenko, has called on the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to boost credits to purely  Russian enterprises rather than joint ventures with  participation of western companies. Speaking at the closing  ceremony of an annual meeting of the EBRD board in St.  Petersburg Tuesday, Gerashchenko pointed out that quite a number  of reliable companies capable of maintaining civilized relations  with the bank had appeared in Russia. He highly praised the  EBRD's efforts in assisting Russia's small businesses and  supposed that its dialog with Russian business would be even  more productive, if carried out through the CBR.    Commenting on the EBRD's activities last year, Gerashchenko  noted that the amount of credits actually used for Russian  projects had increased by more than 10 times and reached $120 Mn  [million]. In his opinion, the EBRD board of directors might  function as the coordinator of various states' efforts for the  support of Russian reforms.    EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere pointed out that this  body would use a more flexible approach to its relations with  East and Central European countries and pay more attention to  their small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

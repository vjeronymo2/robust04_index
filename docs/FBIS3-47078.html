Hiraiwa said at a press conference the yen's further drop  will help stimulate Japan's economy, pointing out that the  United States has hoped that Japan's economic recovery would  also benefit the U.S. economy.    His remark was made following a comment by U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen last week warning Tokyo against relying  on a weaker yen.    "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of  recession for Japan," Bentsen said.    The dollar closed in Tokyo on Monday at 111.73 yen, down  0.75  yen from last Friday.</p>

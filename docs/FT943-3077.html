			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India takes on wheat giants - Farmers can compete now price curbs have gone The Indian government's decision last week to abolish the minimum export price for durum wheat is expected to boost exports and allow Indian wheat farmers to compete with major producers like the US, Canada and Australia. The food ministry has also proposed to the commerce ministry that the minimum export price of Dollars 200 (Pounds 129) for non-basmati rice be lifted in an attempt to reverse the fall in rice sales and make this year's huge surpluses competitive on international markets. The moves reflect India's willingness to compete with the world's wheat giants in lucrative markets in north Africa and southern Europe, where durum wheat is used for making pasta. The relaxation of export curbs is also in keeping with the Gatt treaty, to which India is a signatory. Mr Sanjeeva Reddy, director-general of foreign trade, said the minimum export price of Dollars 160 a tonne for durum was no longer necessary because local production was rising and wheat supplies for India's domestic market were adequate. Exports of durum or superior quality wheat were permitted by the government last November, subject to a floor price of Dollars 160 a tonne and a ceiling of 300,000 tonnes a year. The price did not prove competitive on world markets, and durum exports fell to 59,000 tonnes in the year ended March 31, down from 3.7m tonnes in 1992-93. The government, which had rejected a proposal from the commerce ministry to scrap the floor price last year, is more confident of being self-sufficient this year. A bumper durum harvest is expected next April after good monsoon rains this summer. According to government estimates released in June, India produced 57.8m tonnes of wheat this year, up from 56.86m the previous year. No separate estimates for durum are available, but officials in the agriculture ministry say it accounts for a negligible amount of the total. In Punjab, farmers in Khanna, Ludhiana district, Asia's largest grain market, have begun to grow yellow-rust resistant varieties of durum. The farmers know that while India's low-value bread wheat - used for domestic consumption - can fetch a maximum price of Dollars 100 a tonne, durum would yield an additional Dollars 10 a tonne on the market. About 10 per cent of Punjab's total wheat area is under durum, with a total production of 0.8-1m tonnes. A small amount of durum is also grown in central and southern India. India, the world's fourth largest wheat growing country, has no tradition of consuming pasta, which remains an essentially western product, and availability is confined to the cities. The per capita consumption of pasta products in the country is 80 grams a year compared with 5kg in the US and 30kg in Italy, but government incentives to encourage the growth of durum for export may help the minuscule domestic pasta market to grow as well. The arrival of several food multinationals vying for India's vast untapped markets may further encourage durum wheat growers. Pizza Hut, the American food chain, will need durum wheat to make its pizza bases. The removal of the minimum export price does not necessarily guarantee increased exports. India faces stiff competition from developed countries like the US, which heavily subsidises its sales using funds available under its export enhancement programme. While India has difficulty realising a price of Dollars 100 a tonne, the price of US wheat for Asian markets varies from Dollars 122 a tonne for hard red winter wheat (HRW) to Dollars 218 a tonne for durum non-specified (DNS). Officials in the commerce ministry are even more pessimistic about the performance of non-basmati rice on the export market, even after the minimum floor price is lifted. While there was a sharp rise in basmati exports when the minimum export price was removed in January, Indian non-basmati varieties would find it hard to compete internationally, even without a floor price. Non-basmati exports slumped to 3,984 tonnes last June from 13,096 tonnes in April. Officials say that Indian foodgrains, especially rice, cannot compete internationally, mainly because of the high levels of farm subsidies in developed countries. Indian foodgrains become even less competitive once transport and loading costs have been added. 'Once the Uruguay Round agreement is implemented and farm subsidies in developed countries reduced gradually, India's competitiveness should increase dramatically,' says an official from the commerce ministry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin said here today that the great  potential in Sino-Russian relations is far from being fully  developed, and suggested that his forthcoming visit to China  would promote the relations.    In an interview with XINHUA in his office today before  leaving for Beijing on an official visit, Chernomyrdin said he  is expecting his visit to China to be successful.    He said Russia and China should maintain a normal  relationship of good neighborliness, and the governments of the  two countries should create better conditions for developing  cooperation in trade and science research.    He said the 1992 visit to China by President Boris Yeltsin  was a big push for the development of relations between the two  countries, and that they have been growing smoothly ever since.    "One of the fruits of President Yeltsin's visit to China,  was  the increase in trade volume between the two countries which  reached eight billion U.S. dollars in 1993," he said.    Chernomyrdin added that there are a lot of things which link  Russia and China and there is a good basis for maintaining a  relationship of good neighborliness between the two countries.    He suggested that the two countries increase personnel  exchanges.    "There were a lot of Chinese experts studying in Moscow, St.  Petersburg and other Russian cities once upon a time. Now quite  a number of them are in key positions in China. This tradition  should be carried on by us. We are glad to see more Chinese  delegations visiting and it is also possible that we would like  to send university students to China, which is very important,"  said Chernomyrdin.    He emphasized that the two countries should expand  cooperation and exchange in scientific research.    He said he also expected to sign a number of agreements of  cooperation with Chinese leaders on such matters during his stay  in Beijing.    On trade relations between the two countries, Chernomyrdin  said the governments of the two countries should create better  conditions for development and simplify the procedures of trade  and cooperation.</p>

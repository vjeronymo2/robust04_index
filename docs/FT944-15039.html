			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / People: Accounting Standards Board David Allvey, group finance director of BAT Industries, is to be the new tenth member of the Accounting Standards Board, which sets financial reporting standards. This appointment to the ASB increases the influence of industry and commerce on the board; other recent appointments to the ASB have given a voice to preparers, auditors and institutional users of accounts. Allvey, 49, joined BAT in 1980, and is one of a three-person team responsible for the day-to-day running of the company. Originally a civil engineer, he later became a chartered accountant and a member of the Institute of Taxation. He worked with Price Waterhouse as a tax specialist before joining BAT.</p>

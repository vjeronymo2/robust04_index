			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: John Wood edges ahead to Pounds 19.1m John Wood Group, the privately owned Aberdeen-based company which claims to be the UK's biggest indigenous oilfield services group, experienced slower profits growth in the year to December 31 but continued to expand turnover. Pre-tax profits were up 3 per cent at Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 18.5m), having jumped 10 per cent in 1992. Turnover was ahead 19 per cent at Pounds 242m (Pounds 203.6m). The company reorganised its North Sea oil and gas services operation in order to cut costs in the face of ever-weakening oil prices, Sir Ian Wood, chairman and managing director, said. It carried out sizeable contracts for Shell Expro and is involved in its Brent field long term programme. In overseas oil and gas markets, Wood concentrated resources in south-east Asia, in addition to its operations in the US and the Middle East. It acquired JP Kenny, the oil services group, which brought it an important presence in several oil producing countries, including Norway and Malaysia. Sir Ian said low oil prices would inevitably result in an overall reduction in North Sea activity, but the company's own market share had increased because of its ability to offer services throughout the life of the fields. He expected its work on North Sea projects to be strong for the next two to three years with some of the recommendations of the Cullen report still to be implemented and some large secondary recovery projects in prospect. Shareholders' funds rose 16 per cent to Pounds 57.7m.</p>

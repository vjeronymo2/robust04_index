Alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China Wen Jiabao and CAST  Chairman Zhu Guangya voiced the requirement at a national  conference of CAST, which began here today.    The tasks set for the non-governmental scientific  organization this year include: improving the production  technologies and management of large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, developing new products and new  technologies, enhancing agricultural technologies, and doing  research work on major regional and inter-regional development  projects.    According to an investigation conducted in 17 provinces,  autonomous regions and cities, 1.1 million scientists and  technical experts last year participated in 9,000 projects in  transforming scientific results into productivity.    "The economic turnover amounted to 3.23 billion yuan (about  660 million U.S. dollars then)," CAST's Zhu Guangya said.    Zhu said his association, a link between the government and  the nation's scientists and technicians, will also provide the  government with advice and opinions on national policies and  development plans.    He said that CAST will strengthen its efforts in running  scientific institutions and enterprises to better equip itself  to fulfill its social responsibilities.    Wen Jiabao asked CAST to promote the establishment of  China's  new scientific and technological framework.    The new system should be suited to the development of a  socialist market economy and the law on scientific and  technological development, and characterized by a close union  between the economy and science and technology, Wen said.    Wen said the Communist Party of China and the government  have  always been ready to listen to the opinions and requests of  intellectuals, to bring their initiative and creativity into  full play.    CAST, a national scientific association for the public good  established in 1958, now has 4 million members across the  country.</p>

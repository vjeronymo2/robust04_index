			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's tricky agenda IF ANY one expectation arose from Mr Bill Clinton's election last November it was that, as a Democrat, he could break the legislative 'gridlock' by working with the majority in both houses of Congress. Yet his main achievement since taking office has been to scrape together, after months of lobbying, the narrowest of congressional majorities for a distinctly unadventurous budget. Within a few months now the political horizon will be dominated by next year's congressional elections. If the president has not by then firmly established his authority and used it to impose his own agenda he will be in severe danger of becoming the third out of the last four presidents to leave office after only one term. The US political season opens today with a press conference at which the vice-president, Mr Al Gore, will announce his proposals for 'reinventing government'. In European terms this is partly about subsidiarity - letting lower-level civil servants get on with their jobs and take decisions without for ever referring to higher authority. In British terms it also contains a dash of 'citizen's charter' - giving taxpayers guarantees of quicker and better service for their bucks. In American terms there is something even more familiar about it: a promise to cut the deficit by eliminating waste. Such savings have generally proved illusory in the past. Perhaps Mr Gore will do better, but in any case his performance will only be the hors d'oeuvre. The substantial items on Mr Clinton's menu are healthcare and the North American free trade agreement. Fragmented consensus Health is the issue he has made peculiarly his own. He believes the uncontrolled escalation of healthcare costs is the single most urgent problem facing America, a view that is widely shared, not least in the business community. But, as the budget deficit issue shows, it is not enough to achieve consensus on the urgency or importance of a problem in general terms. Consensus quickly fragments when specific groups discover the problem is to be solved at their expense. The chances against Mr Clinton achieving a workable healthcare package on the first try do not seem promising. But at least he will try. There is no danger of that issue going by default. It would be agreeable to say the same, with the same confidence, about the issue of free trade, whether in the North American regional context or the broader one of Gatt. Deserves credit Certainly Mr Clinton is on record as favouring both ratification of Nafta and an early conclusion of the Uruguay Round. He deserves much of the credit for the breakthrough achieved in Tokyo in July, and he can hardly be blamed if it is sabotaged by French threats to veto the Blair House agreement on agriculture which the EC negotiated with his predecessor. But while it is primarily for Europeans to deal with that European problem, there are many other items in the round still to be agreed, and they are unlikely to be so by the December deadline without intensive political involvement at the highest level. Some US businessmen see Nafta as an alternative to the Uruguay Round, even a chance to punish Europe with a taste of its own regional protectionist medicine. That would be a good reason for opposing it, but there is little or nothing in the agreement to justify such an interpretation. Those who oppose Nafta in the US, from Mr Ross Perot to Mr Ralph Nader and the environmental movement, the trade unions, and an awkwardly large number of Democratic congressmen, do so for other reasons. Mr Clinton has not surrendered to these lobbies, but his handling of them has dismayed the treaty's supporters. That issue now cries out for real leadership, as do a number of foreign policy issues: not least the Bosnian imbroglio, where Mr Clinton's indecision cannot be excused by, even if it does not in turn excuse, the feebleness of his European allies. At home and abroad, he is now being compared with his last Democratic predecessor, Mr Jimmy Carter. If - as may be safely assumed - Mr Clinton strongly dislikes that comparison, he must realise he has only a short time left in which to prove it wrong.</p>

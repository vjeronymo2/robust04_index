			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / West of Shetland fields promoted The government yesterday put development of oil and gas fields in the deep Atlantic waters west of Shetland on the 'fast track'. More than 60 of the 164 blocks being offered for oil and gas exploration under the 16th offshore licensing round are in this region. Mr Charles Wardle, junior energy minister, said he hoped the fast-track process would see further development west of Shetland start as early as next summer. He also called for nominations from oil companies for the 17th licensing round which would 'stretch out to new horizons to the west of the UK'. Preliminary drilling results suggest that the west of Shetland region has the potential to produce up to a third of Britain's present North Sea output of 2.5m barrels a day. Earlier this month the government gave approval for Foinaven, the first oilfield in the region. British Petroleum and Shell will spend Pounds 550m to develop it.</p>

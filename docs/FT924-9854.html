			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Allied to dispose of Chateau Latour ALLIED-LYONS, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has put Chateau Latour, one of the four leading Bordeaux vineyards, up for sale. Preliminary talks are being held with prospective buyers, including Groupe Axa, the French insurance company, according to industry sources. The Medoc estate - once described by Allied's chairman, Mr Michael Jackaman, as 'the jewel in our crown' - was estimated a year ago to be worth about Pounds 160m. But in the depressed state of the French wine industry, Allied might struggle to find a buyer at that price. The Bordeaux wine industry has been hit by bumper crops, recession in the US, UK and other world markets, and increased competition from Australia, New Zealand, California and South Africa. Several chateaux have been put on the market and wine merchants have closed. Allied's decision, however, owes more to changes in the group's management strategy than market conditions. Since the Pounds 147m loss on currency trading early last year, the new team of Mr Jackaman and Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, has focused the group on international growth brands and improving the return on assets. Allied bought the vineyard in 1988 for Pounds 58m - more for Latour's prestige than its profitability - to add the 53 per cent shareholding of Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, to the 25 per cent it already owned. It has since bought out most of the remaining minority shareholders. A year ago, Mr Jackaman admitted that with profits of about Pounds 5m a year the investment was difficult to justify on the basis of return on capital. Allied last month announced the sale of its Kendermann and Langenbach wine businesses in Germany, with a combined turnover of DM70m (Pounds 29m) a year, to the Gunther Reh group. However, Allied continues to distribute Black Tower and Crown of Crowns wine brands. Allied is considered unlikely to dispose of its other wine businesses which include Callaway and Clos Du Bois in California, Calvet in France, Harveys and Grants of St James's, the shippers and wholesalers, and the Victoria Wine retail chain.

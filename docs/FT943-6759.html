			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Clinton faces weakening of healthcare plan A tired President Bill Clinton yesterday prepared to leave Washington for an abbreviated summer break, facing the prospect that he may have to accept a watered down bill on healthcare reform, the cornerstone of his domestic agenda. In spite of his victory in securing passage of the controversial crime bill on Thursday night, Mr Clinton's supporters seemed to be laying the ground for a less ambitious healthcare bill. Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leader in the Senate, indicated he was scrapping comprehensive healthcare reform and using a narrower blueprint as the basis of a compromise. Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, also indicated that the president's threat to veto any bill that did not guarantee universal coverage was being eroded. Once Congress returns next month, it will face a mountain of unfinished business apart from healthcare - including campaign finance and welfare reform, Uruguay Round trade pact approval, education, environment and ethics bills and telecoms regulation. The crowded agenda will make it harder than ever to achieve consensus over healthcare before Congress breaks before the November mid-term elections. After one of the ugliest political seasons in recent memory, Mr Clinton appeared deeply dispirited even as he welcomed the Senate's final approval of the crime bill on a 61-38 vote. 'With a little good faith and a lot of hard work, Republicans and Democrats overcame the partisan divisions and false choices that have blocked anti-crime efforts time and time again,' he said. Six Republicans left party ranks to break a Senate filibuster that had tied up the crime bill. They gave the president a much-needed victory, but one tarnished by Republican claims that the bill is filled with unnecessary social spending. The congressional debate has fed public scepticism about the government and uncertainty that anything will change as a result of the crime bill, which will provide Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) over six years for new prisons, extra police and social programmes. Mr Clinton, heading off to Martha's Vineyard, the play-ground of the eastern political establishment, could only hope for a repeat performance of his holiday last summer. Wined, dined and petted, he came roaring back to secure a tough victory for the North American Free Trade Agreement and a surge in his poll ratings. This time Cuba leads the list of his foreign policy problems, while at home, the Whitewater investigation continues. It may be too much even for the 'Comeback Kid' to manage.</p>

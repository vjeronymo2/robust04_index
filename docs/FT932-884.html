			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Yeltsin aides urged to resign RUSSIA'S special prosecutor for corruption yesterday stood by his demand that two of President Boris Yeltsin's closest aides should resign in order to facilitate an investigation into allegations by Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi. Deputy prosecutor general Nikolai Makarov denied that his call on Thursday for the resignation of Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, and Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the presidential aide who runs the state-owned media, was politically motivated. But he said the two men could use their high position to influence the course of the investigation. Vowing to sue Mr Makarov for slander, Mr Shumeiko said yesterday his accusations were a 'provocation' designed to help parliament resist Mr Yeltsin's attempts to push through a new constitution and new parliamentary elections. The prosecutor general's office has tended to side with parliament over political reform. Mr Shumeiko is one of the driving forces behind Mr Yeltsin's Constitutional Convention, which today reconvenes after a 10-day intermission to resolve differences in hammering out a draft constitution. Mr Yeltsin has promised top officials will be equal to ordinary citizens before the law, but has sometimes given conflicting signals on his determination to wage 'all-out war' on corruption.</p>

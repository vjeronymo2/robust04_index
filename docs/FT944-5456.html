			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Falcon declines A drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 175,000 to Pounds 72,000, was announced by Falcon, the pipeline distributor, for the half year to end-September. Turnover fell to Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 3.15m) partly because of the loss of some contracts to the water industry. The interim dividend is cut to 2.5p (3p), payable from earnings of 2.5p (5.3p) per share.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Clinton pressed to seek Nafta changes AN intense debate within the camp of Governor Bill Clinton is likely to delay the response of the Democratic presidential candidate to Republican taunts that he is 'waffling' in his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is reported that the candidate is being urged, by some of his political advisers, to adopt the line of Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. He has said the Nafta must be returned to the negotiating table, to strengthen environmental and labour provisions, or the pact will be rejected in Congress next year. These advisers are said to be nervously eyeing opinion poll data that show the governor's support soft among blue-collar workers in the key states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, who fear their jobs will go south to Mexicans. They could stay home on election day or cast a protest vote for Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who has withdrawn from the presidential race but is still on the ballot in some states as an independent candidate. Mr Clinton is already facing criticism for having endorsed fuel efficiency standards, which the US car industry claims will cost thousands of jobs. Many of the governor's liberal farm and labour supporters believe the pact must be renegotiated to produce stronger, enforceable job and environmental protection. His more moderate business backers have been assuring him that the weaknesses in the Nafta's relevant provisions can be rectified by 'implementing legislation' written in Congress, and that the pact need not be sent back for further work. One of the key issues is a US-Mexico cross-border tax on imports, which is opposed by the US administration. Various leading Democrats have suggested the tax would pay for environmental and worker-adjustment programmes. This would be likely to require additional talks with the Mexicans. There has been close co-ordination between the Clinton campaign and Congressional Democrats, who have strongly rebuked President George Bush for 'politicising' the Nafta, which was developed with bi-partisan support. The pact was sent to Congress on Wednesday so the governor has time to claim he is studying the details. Although one of his trade specialists said he need not take a position until driven to it by the first presidential campaign debate (if any), others in the campaign expect a decision by Mr Clinton by the end of the month.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Arts: As You Desire Me - New End Theatre, Hampstead Here is a genuine rarity that gave me a great deal of pleasure: an almost totally forgotten play by Pirandello that has the master's touch and at times fairly crackles with suspense about what is real and what is not. As You Desire Me was written in 1930 and last performed in London in 1948. It is set in a mixture of Berlin and northern Italy, 1928, when the scars of the first world war were still deep and it was still too early to predict with certainty that the Weimar republic contained the seeds of the second, though I must say that in his scenes of German decadence, Pirandello came remarkably close to seeing the way the country was going. Cia, or the 'unknown woman' as she is normally referred to, is a dancer in a sleazy German cabaret. She is the mistress of a German writer, whose crazed daughter is as infatuated with Cia as he is. She has forgotten her past because of the devastation of the war. Then an Italian friend of her husband turns up, asking her to go home. The German lover shoots himself, but not fatally. The rest of the play moves to the Italian family villa in Udine. I shall not go further into the plot because I do not want to give away the suspense. Suffice it to say that it revolves around whether Cia really is the missing wife. On one level, of course she is, but the point is that she has changed and is not the same person she was 10 years before, when dragged away by the troops and officers at the end of the war. Here we are on familiar Pirandello territory: what is real and what is an illusion? It may not be the best piece he wrote, but it is the real thing: no imitator could have done it. Some of the vignettes are superb: the performance of the crazed daughter (played by Janet Steel), for example. So are some of the physical details: a mark on Cia's leg that may or may not have been deliberately removed. The suspense is intellectual: note the sudden chill when the German lover, arriving in Italy, seems to have proved through female psychology that Cia is not Cia after all. The production in the tiny New End Theatre seemed to me slightly under-rehearsed. It began nearly 20 minutes late, had two intervals instead of the one that was billed, and there was some fluffing of lines. The acting is uneven, sometimes even by the same character. Ruth Kettlewell as the old aunt, for instance, frequently looks and speaks as if she was born to play Miss Marple; at other times she is curiously wooden. The women, on the whole, are better than the men. Cia is played by Sandra Fox. This is a magnificent part, including the cabaret dancing, and with a little more rehearsal it should be a magnificent performance. Even now it is thoroughly gripping. The direction is by Derek Wax and one can only salute the enterprise in unearthing the play and producing a new translation by Kate Nelson. It runs at Hampstead until March 29 and it deserves more.</p>

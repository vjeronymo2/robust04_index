			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs facing test over salary link EFFORTS BY the government to curb a politically embarrassing rise in top civil servants' salaries may provoke a row with MPs whose pay is linked to the rates paid in Whitehall. Ministers have belatedly discovered that plans to alter civil servants' scales would trigger a debate followed by a Commons vote that they could not guarantee to win. The difficulty arises from the automatic linkage between an MP's salary  - currently Pounds 30,854 - and a specified point on the salary scale for senior civil servants. Under new pay arrangements, which the government is still discussing with Whitehall unions, that scale disappears. While a broadly equivalent linkage point could be found under the new arrangements, the obstacle is that it would require a Commons vote. On previous such occasions, MPs have refused to accept government advice about the need for modest rises only. Mr John Major has been kept informed of progress on the issue because of its sensitivity at present. The cabinet is today set to reject the independent recommendations of the Top Salaries Review Body for pay rises of up to 30 per cent for senior public servants, and for a substantial increase in an MP's office costs allowance. Rises for senior civil servants, judges and generals will be confined instead to single figures. The need for a review of MPs' pay will turn on whether the current Commons motion is broad enough to apply when fixed salary scales are replaced by ranges. The Treasury admitted yesterday that 'there could be a need to change the resolution'. In the event of a Commons debate, MPs and not the government would decide the new salary arrangements. Party whips traditionally do not apply on the issue. The move to salary ranges for civil servants is intended to bring greater flexibility, so that pay within each grade can be tailored to individual performance.</p>

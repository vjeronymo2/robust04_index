			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CONFUSION OVER MEDICARE SURTAX REPEAL  </P> <P> QUESTION: Now that the Medicare catastrophic care surtax has been repealed, can  you tell me what I am supposed to do about surtax payments that I was supposed  to have made along with my estimated income tax payments throughout the year? I  had deferred making my surtax payments during the year until the final  estimated payment. But now, do I just ignore the whole thing, or do I make the  payment with the final estimate and get a refund? Do I have to file any report?  Neither the Social Security Administration nor the Internal Revenue Service are  much help on this. -- L.G.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Fortunately for you, the correct answer is also the easiest: Do  nothing. You delayed action long enough to see the quick demise of the 15%  surtax on income taxes that the federal government had originally begun  imposing this year on Medicare recipients for catastrophic care. However, the  tax was repealed before the first tax year was completed, and, technically, no  surtaxes are owed.  </P> <P> Also, our tax experts say that those who did make estimated income tax payments  that included a provision for the 15% surtax should reduce their final  estimated payments to reflect the surtax payments throughout the year.  Otherwise, you might be in line for a refund.  </P> <P> Procedure Clarified For Moving 401(k) to IRA  </P> <P> One additional note to last week's discussion of how to handle a 401(k) account  when switching employers. If you recall, a reader wanted to know whether he  should roll his 401(k) funds into an individual retirement account or into the  pension plan offered by his new employer.  </P> <P> We advised him that one of the special tax benefits available to pension plan  withdrawals -- five- or 10-year income averaging -- would be available if he  put his 401(k) funds into a separate IRA account, segregated from all other  retirements savings. This is true, but only if he later rolls those IRA funds  -- untouched -- into a qualified pension plan of some sort. This qualified plan  could be offered by a future employer or it could be a Keogh plan he later  establishes should he go into business for himself.  </P> <P> The point is that, if our reader wants to take advantage of the special income  averaging, the IRA must only be used as a temporary parking place for the  funds. You cannot take advantage of the income averaging, which can save you  thousands when you begin receiving distributions near retirement, when you  withdraw straight from an IRA. This advantage is available only for withdrawals  from a qualified pension plan.  </P> <P> New Retiree Will Still Pay Social Security Tax  </P> <P> Q: I am 65 years old and will be retiring as of Dec. 31 of this year. I expect  to receive a significant payment in 1990 for work I performed in 1989. I  realize that I will have to pay income taxes on this payment when I file my  return for 1990. But what about Social Security taxes? Will I have to make a  contribution to the Social Security fund based on these earnings in 1990 even  though I am technically unemployed? I have already paid the maximum Social  Security tax for 1989. -- M.L.  </P> <P> A: Yes, in addition to income taxes, you will be assessed Social Security taxes  on the income you receive in 1990, even though that payment is for work  performed in 1989. The way the system works, you are taxed based on when the  payment is received, not when the work is performed. So even though you paid  the maximum tax in 1989 and will be technically unemployed -- and may even be  receiving Social Security benefits in 1990 -- you will owe Social Security  taxes on the final employment payment you receive in 1990.  </P> <P> However, in case it matters, you should know that whatever income you receive  in 1990 based on your 1989 work will not in any way reduce the amount of Social  Security benefits you are allowed to receive during 1990.  </P></p>

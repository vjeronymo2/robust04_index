			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA AND THE CONTRAS  </P> <P> As I read your editorial "Gorbachev's Gesture" (May 17) about Soviet leader  Mikhail Gorbachev cutting off military aid to Nicaragua, my thoughts turned to  a Witness for Peace letter I received recently.  </P> <P> The letter states: "During the last year of 'non-lethal' aid, Witness for Peace  documented 147 civilians killed, 150 civilians wounded and 281 civilians  kidnaped by the Contras."  </P> <P> So much for "humanitarian assistance." So much for "gentler and kinder." You  have to wonder about a President who professes to hold the sanctity of life so  dear as in the case of an unborn fetus, yet holds the lives of Nicaraguan  civilians so cheaply.  </P> <P> LARRY SIEGEL  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

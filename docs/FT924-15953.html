			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: TPC rules out Santos bid AUSTRALIA'S Trade Practices Commission (TPC) yesterday ruled that a ADollars 560m (USDollars 400m) hostile bid for Sagasco Holdings by Santos, a rival oil and gas group, would contravene competition regulations and should not proceed. The TPC announcement, which reversed an earlier statement that it would not intervene in the takeover, could force the South Australian state government to find another buyer for its controlling 57 per cent stake in Sagasco. However, few other companies had expressed much interest in the shareholding in before Santos announced its bid last month.</p>

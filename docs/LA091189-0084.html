			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ADVANCED COMPUTER PLAN COULD BOOST STATE INDUSTRY  </P> <P> California's high-tech industries and researchers will get a big boost from a  Bush Administration plan to spend $1.9 billion over five years on advanced  computer technology, experts said.  </P> <P> White House science adviser D. Allan Bromley released a report Sunday by the  White House Office of Science and Technology proposing the program to promote  advanced computing capabilities, including the creation of a fiber-optic  network linking the nation's supercomputers.  </P> <P> The plan would not just fund more research, but would also try to better  coordinate government, educational and industry development of computers and  computer programs.  </P> <P> It envisions establishing a National Research and Education Network to transmit  data between supercomputers at speeds of up to 3 gigabits -- 3 billion bits --  per second, or 2,000 times faster than current computer networks. Ultimately,  the network would link homes and businesses throughout the nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Information Flow  </P> <P> That would make it easier for California's computer-chip designers to get  prototypes made, seismic scientists to analyze earthquake data, aerospace  manufacturers to manage the production of planes, and biotechnology companies  to map genes, experts said.  </P> <P> When the super-fast network becomes available to the home or business computer  user, it will be like putting regular cars on the Indianapolis race track, said  Henri Aebischer, Apple Computer's director of networking and communication  product marketing.  </P> <P> "They won't go as fast as an Indy car, but they'll go a lot faster than usual,"  he said.  </P> <P> For example, he said, current technology doesn't allow moving images generated  by a computer to be sent over telephone lines except very slowly.  </P> <P> But with the fiber-optic technology envisioned by the government plan, far-off  doctors will be able to review medical scanner pictures in real time, experts  will examine plane crash scenes via remote cameras, and advertising agencies  will let clients immediately review the latest ad, all on computer screens.  </P> <P> "Let's say you have a grandmother in Boston. Rather than flying there for her  birthday you make a little film. She will hear a little ring or a bell and she  will go to her computer and punch a button and see her grandchildren singing  happy birthday," Aebischer said.  </P> <P> That sort of possibility can mean big business for entrepreneurs, and for  companies like Apple that build business computers.  </P> <P> Charles L. Seitz, a professor of computer science at the California Institute  of Technology in Pasadena and a frequent technology adviser to the federal  government, welcomed the Bush strategy.  </P> <P> "So much of the modern scientific enterprise is already based . . . on these  cooperative efforts," he said, noting that the super-fast network would augment  an existing network, called Internet, which already has yielded great research  and commercial benefits.  </P> <P> The existing network sends information at about 1.5 million bits per second.  </P> <P> "A decade ago there were 40 or 50 computers on the national network," Seitz  said. "Then this just grew like Topsy. There are easily hundreds of thousands  now."  </P> <P> Seitz already uses the computer network when he designs advanced computer  chips. He sends his plans electronically to the University of Southern  California's Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, where a  computer-managed program gets them built.  </P> <P> Christopher Willard, a senior analyst at Dataquest Inc., a high-tech market  research firm in San Jose, said the proposal will have special impact in  California because there is so much high-tech industry in the state.  </P> <P> "I think the long-term effect for industry will be a technological trickle-down  where people learn how to use these highly sophisticated systems, design the  software, and that moves into industry, where it gets into the product  development department," he said.  </P> <P> The results, Willard said, could range from the National Security Agency  breaking codes faster to General Electric building a better light bulb.  </P></p>

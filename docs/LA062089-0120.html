			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UAW LEADERS HOLD CONTROL IN ANAHEIM DEBATE;  </P> <P> ATTEMPT BY DISSIDENTS TO ALTER CONSTITUTION OF UNION BEATEN BACK  </P> <P> The leadership of the United Auto Workers asserted its authority on the second  day of the union's convention in Anaheim on Monday and quashed the efforts of a  growing dissident faction to alter the union's constitution.  </P> <P> Top union officers said their hard-line approach toward the dissidents in the  first two days of the UAW convention at the Anaheim Convention Center shows  that they have no plans to compromise with the fledgling opposition group.  </P> <P> "They have done damage to this union, and that is an unforgivable sin," said  UAW Vice President Don Ephlin, director of the union's huge General Motors  Department. "Why should we throw a bone to them?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reflect Union's Leadership  </P> <P> A spokesman for the international union later said Ephlin's comments reflect  the position of UAW President Owen Bieber and the rest of the union leadership.  </P> <P> The group of internal dissidents, called New Directions, has sharp  philosophical differences with the union's leadership.  </P> <P> The dissidents oppose the UAW's new willingness to cooperate more closely with  management in the auto industry through Japanese-style "team-concept" labor  agreements and other joint programs. They argue that such programs have led to  speed-ups on assembly lines and heavier workloads, but have not provided the  job security originally promised by management. They charge that the UAW's  present leaders -- unlike the union's legendary architect, Walter Reuther --  have accepted the corporations' views on international competition, to the  detriment of the membership.  </P> <P> "Walter Reuther organized the membership of this union around its own agenda,  but today the union is being organized around the corporations' agenda," said  Jerry Tucker, a UAW regional director and leader of New Directions.  </P> <P> But Bieber and other union leaders argue that labor-management programs are  needed to remain competitive in the global marketplace, and they criticize the  dissidents for failing to understand the harsh new competitive realities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chance to Launch Opposition  </P> <P> The dissident movement had hoped to use the six-day convention as a launching  pad for a more organized opposition to the UAW leadership. The dissident  leaders planned to challenge election results in several recent races for top  union positions and to force a debate on a range of collective bargaining and  fundamental political issues facing the union.  </P> <P> But so far, the New Directions group has been soundly defeated at every turn.  On Sunday, most of their appeals of election results were rejected by the  convention, ensuring the defeat of Tucker and another dissident, both of whom  ran for top union positions this spring. In both cases, the dissident group is  likely to challenge the election results in court.  </P> <P> On Monday, the dissidents were defeated in their bid to change the UAW's  constitution to call for the direct election of top union officers by the  union's rank and file.  </P> <P> The rank and file now elects delegates to the convention, who then elect the  UAW's president and other officers.  </P> <P> The dissidents argue that a direct election would spur debate on the basic  issues facing the union. But the leadership responds that a direct election  would open up the process to outside interests and would lead to expensive  campaigns.  </P> <P> In the end, the direct election resolution was soundly defeated, and the  dissidents had to acknowledge that they did not have enough power to win any of  their convention-floor battles with the leadership.  </P> <P> "This is a one-party union, there is no doubt about that," complained Pete  Kelly, president of UAW Local 160 and a leader of New Directions. "But I don't  think we came here thinking we could win. We came here to organize our group,  to organize local union leaders into a group that can win in the future."  </P> <P> Kelly added that New Directions still expects to announce this week that it  will create a more formal opposition organization, with a staff, to carry on  the dissident movement's work after the convention.  </P></p>

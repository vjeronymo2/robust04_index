			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Employers and unions give welcome to apprentice plan - Training Employers and union leaders welcomed the announcement of the extension of the 'modern apprenticeship' to students leaving full-time education aged 18 and over. The initiative, called the 'accelerated modern apprenticeship', builds on the scheme announced last November. The original scheme is aimed at 16-year-olds who have left full-time education and it intends to offer high-quality training to technician and supervisory levels - areas where the UK has a severe shortage of workers. The government will provide an additional Pounds 107m for the accelerated scheme, if industry provides the training places. The Engineering Training Authority, one of 14 organisations which is piloting the original scheme, said yesterday: 'This new development is one we have been calling for. Because there are higher staying-on rates, the pool of young people we can draw from at 16 is becoming smaller. In addition, as far as engineering is concerned we welcome people who can draw upon a sound education up to the age of 18.' The modern apprenticeship, which is about to be piloted in 14 industrial sectors, will offer higher-quality training than is generally available to young people on Youth Training. The initiative announced yesterday will raise the number of people being trained to NVQ level 3, the vocational equivalent of two A-levels, from 150,000 to about 200,000. A number of organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry, were expecting the government to make a significant announcement on progress towards introducing training credits, or vouchers, to all people aged 16 to 19. - Criticisms over the content and structure of new vocational qualifications will be addressed in a review of all National Vocational Qualifications and General National Vocational Qualifications, to be completed by April 1996.</p>

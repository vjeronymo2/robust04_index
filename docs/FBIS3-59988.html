			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Decision To Act Against Smugglers''] </F>   [Text] Madam Benazir Bhutto has instructed that effective  steps be taken to control drug smugglers and their business. In  this context she asked for the list prepared by the caretaker  government. Drug smuggling has been going on in Pakistan for  many years, and it is a great hindrance to our economic  progress. It encourages crime and is also destructive for the  younger generation. About 15 years ago smuggling was limited to  hashish and opium; however, shortly after the Russian aggression  in Afghanistan, heroin was added to this trade. Business  increased because it is as expensive as gold, and people had  gonefrom rags to riches overnight. People who are crazy for  wealth, are not afraid of God, and are ready to risk their  country, will get into this business to achieve their goals.    Over the last 10-12 years, every ruling government has taken  steps to eradicate drug smuggling. However, because of the  involvement of some important people in the drug trade,  especially hashish and heroin, their efforts were not  successful. Smugglers managed to escape because of their  relations with some influential people, both at the national and  international level.    In any case, the present government, which was elected by a  large majority, has openly declared its intent to eradicat this  curse. It has instructed that effective steps be taken in this  context. It is expected that these efforts will be successful,  and that help will be available to stop the smuggling and the  ``crocodiles'' involved in this abominable business. The people  of this country will definitely help the government in this  important task.</p>

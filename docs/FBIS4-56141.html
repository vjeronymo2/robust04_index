			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Central European Initiative: Prague </F> Wants More Concrete Projects, Less Diplomacy"]    [Text] (ANSA) Prague, May 25 -- The Central European  Initiative (CEI) should focus more on concrete actions in the  areas of economic and technical cooperation and less on  aspirations to become a forum to resolve bilateral, security,  ethnic and border questions, Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel  Bratinka told ANSA on the eve of his visit to Italy.    Bratinka, who will be in Italy Thursday [26 May] and Friday,  argued that a sufficient number of institutions and forums  existed to tackle bilateral and other questions, while the CEI,  of which Italy is a founding member, should be used to  coordinate regional development potential through concrete  projects, for example, in the areas of transport and  telecommunications.    A positive example of this, the Czech diplomat said, was the  effort currently underway to create a Central European Free  Trade Association (CEFTA) and added how the CEI should be  expanded to include other countries in Central and Eastern  Europe but, at the same not, not become institutionalized.    The Czech deputy foreign minister went on to state how  Italy's presence in the CEI was an "utmost priority" and how,  for his country, there was great appreciation for the potential  for cooperation with Italy and for Rome's role as "our lawyer"  before the European Union [EU].    Evidence of this, Bratinka added, was last year's  Italo-British initiative in favor of initiating a cooperation  policy between the European Union and countries in Central and  Eastern Europe.    In this framework, the Czech diplomat urged a greater  presence of Italian investments in his country -- they currently  account for 3.4 percent of total foreign investment -- observing  "I expect Italy's share to rise to 10 percent", given the  "golden opportunities" which await Italian investors in the  Czech Republic.    During his two-day visit to Italy, Czech deputy foreign  minister will review, with his Italian talking partners, a whole  range of questions, including bilateral treaties, Italy's  ratification of the EU association agreement with the Czech  Republic, the situation in the former Yugoslavia, United Nations  questions, NATO's "Partnerships for Peace" initiative and the  nomination of a new Czech ambassador to Rome, a post left open  for some time now.    The CEI was born from the original "Quadrilateral  Initiative", formed in 1989 between Italy, Austria, Hungary and  the then Yugoslavia. It was then expanded to include  Czechoslovakia and later Poland, thus becoming the "Pentagonal"  and "Hexagonal" initiatives.    Between 1992 and 1993, following the division of Yugoslavia  and Czechoslovakia, the initiative's membership rose to ten --  with the admission of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia,  Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- and it  became the Central European Initiative.</p>

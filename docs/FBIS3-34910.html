They accused some central security elements attached to the  northern governorates and working at the Radfan Camp overlooking  Aden airport of preparing to carry out the mission of attacking  al-Bid's plane with "shoulder-fired RPG shells" when it takes  off from the airport.    They said that "Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli,  governor of Aden and member of the YSP Political Bureau, ordered  the expulsion of the northern members of central security from  Aden to the north and the arrest of those who were planning to  carry out the attack on al-Bid's aircraft."    Furthermore, military sources in Aden say that "the forces  deployed in al-'Anad camp (80 km north of Aden) arrested two  Iraqis in the evening of the day before yesterday as they tried  to infiltrate the camp, which has a military airfield and some  installations." They added that "The Iraqis, who came from the  northern governorates, confessed that their mission was to  damage a number of military aircraft belonging to the army in  the south and to hijack two planes to Iraq."    These developments coincided with the republic decree issued  by Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih revoking Prime Minister and YSP Political Bureau  Member Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas's decision the day  before yesterday appointing Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad governor of the  southern governorate of Abyan in succession to Colonel Yahya  al-Ra'i, who was elected member of the House of Representatives.  [passage omitted]    The General Committee (Political Bureau) of the General  People's Congress [GPC] issued a press statement yesterday  citing an official source as saying that "At a time when our  masses and all the sincere people who care about unity and  democracy were looking forward to 10 Ramadan [20 February] for  the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document to end the  country's plight resulting from the political crisis, our people  were surprised by the report carried on Yemeni television's  channel two about the divisive decision signed by Prime Minister  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas appointing Brother Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad  as governor of Abyan, ignoring the constitution and the local  administration law. That decision runs contrary to the  principle of the state of law and order and undermines the  homeland's higher interests." It appealed to all the political  forces to "condemn that attitude" which it described as being "a  violation of the Constitution and the law with negative and  dangerous consequences harmful to the homeland's stability and  democracy."

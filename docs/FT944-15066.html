			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Companies to sponsor 'vocational A-levels' About 120,000 students in schools and further education colleges will be able to take corporately sponsored vocational qualifications from January. Fifteen companies, including American Express, United Biscuits, McDonald's, and J. Sainsbury, are offering sponsorship for General National Vocational Qualifications, the government announced yesterday. The qualifications are intended as a vocational alternative to A-levels to be taken by 18-year-olds. A pilot scheme introducing GNVQs was completed earlier this year. The companies' contributions range from providing projects and work experience to job offers if students reach the right standard. Prizes and travel bursaries are also on offer for students with the best results. About 250,000 students are enrolled for the qualifications, and up to half of these should be eligible to benefit from the sponsorships in some form - although most will not qualify for direct financial aid. For example, students taking a GNVQ in leisure and tourism will be allowed to take up the American Express sponsorship, which offers work experience with local businesses. Laing, the construction company, is offering similar support for the construction and built environment GNVQ, with guarantees of work and project experience for all students taking the course across the UK. Announcing the scheme, Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, said the government wanted a quarter of 16-year-olds to be enrolling for the qualifications by autumn 1996. He said GNVQs could not succeed 'without the active support, encouragement and involvement of employers'. Mr Mike Heron, chairman of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, said the scheme would ensure that the qualifications would be relevant to business needs. The government believes its 'vocational A-levels' will be recognised as a passport to employment since in theory they provide a middle path between academic A-levels and narrower, more trade-related National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), which are designed to be taken in the workplace. Thus they should be good both for university entrance and for moving straight into employment. However, academics such as Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Manchester have questioned whether it is possible for one qualification to achieve both aims. Also, a report by government inspectors of schools and further education colleges earlier this week suggested that students were still being steered towards A-levels by careers counsellors, even if they had little chance of passing them. Other companies involved include Girobank, Hilton National, the NHS Training Directorate, Peugeot and the Post Office.</p>

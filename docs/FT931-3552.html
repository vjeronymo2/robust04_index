			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Names win stop-loss claims ruling MORE THAN 100 Names yesterday won a High Court ruling allowing them to recover directly claims on stop-loss insurance policies - personal reinsurance which covers heavy losses. Lloyd's unsuccessfully argued that the claims under the policies should first be paid into premium trust funds, which contain premium income earned by Lloyd's underwriters from insurance business. The ruling could ease the cashflow problems of some loss-making Lloyd's Names, who are among several thousand facing heavy losses at the insurance market. Mr Justice Tuckey in the Commercial Court ruled that Names - individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's market - are entitled to receive recoveries directly from brokers. Mr Tuckey held that recoveries were not payable directly to the premium trust funds unless specifically stated in the policy or unless the Name had signed an 'irrevocable' letter of authority assigning the money to their premium trust fund. A directive that all stop-loss recoveries must be paid to the trust fund issued last year by Mr David Coleridge, then chairman of Lloyd's, was ruled invalid. A two-week moratorium on the ruling was agreed so that Lloyd's could consider whether to appeal.</p>

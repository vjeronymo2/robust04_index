			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn achieves Pounds 5.59m Porter Chadburn, the leisure products, notepaper and labels producer, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.59m for the year to March 27. That compared with Pounds 5.32m last time, restated to reclassify extraordinary reorganisation costs as exceptional. Mr Raymond Dinkin, chairman, said that without the restatement profits would have been 20 per cent lower than last year. He said the results, which included Pounds 1m from the sale of part of the packaging division, had been severely affected by the UK recession and certain management and control weaknesses in the consumer leisure division where operating profits fell from Pounds 4.98m to Pounds 1.9m. Profits from packaging were Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 1.7m) and specialist distribution Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 1.93m). Group turnover increased to Pounds 132m (Pounds 112m). Earnings per share fell from 5.65p to 5.18p and a final dividend of 1.65p is recommended for a total of 2.5p (2.4p).</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (10): Lack of 'slots' hits the regionals  -Michael Donne reports on a sector growing faster than the trunk airlines OVER RECENT years, Europe has developed an exceptionally large and diverse regional aircraft manufacturing industry. But recently it has been suffering from a shortfall in new orders as the economic recession has bitten into airlines' balance sheets, resulting in severely curtailed aircraft re-equipment programmes. In turn, manufacturers have been obliged to reduce aircraft production rates and labour forces to survive. One consequence has been a renewed interest in the possibilities of new strategic alliances, if not outright mergers. Some have already occurred, and in the near future there may be further significant realignments in the industry's overall structure. The European regional aircraft industry supplies virtually every regional airline need, from small 10-seat twin turbo-prop airliners to 100-plus seat twin-jet aircraft. Despite the recession, there is no lack of innovation, and many of the companies involved are looking ahead with new ideas for product improvements or entirely new aircraft models. Few people doubt that better times will eventually emerge. Estimates for world traffic growth through to the early years of the next century are encouraging - the International Air Transport Association foresees European air passenger traffic rising from the 1990 level of 394m to 501m by 1995, 653m by the year 2000, 821m by 2005 and to just over 1bn by 2010. Though much of that traffic will continue to be handled by the trunk-line carriers, especially on direct inter-city routes, the prospects for regional operations are excellent. For underneath the trunk-line routes is a vast network of complementary 'commuter and feeder' operations linking hundreds of smaller towns and cities with each other as well as with the major 'hub' airports in capital cities. Such operations are essentially short-haul. The average sector distance in western Europe is close to 400 kilometres or about 250 miles, but many regional flights are for much shorter distances. They are performed mostly by small turbo-propeller powered airliners, which means that they are quieter, and therefore more environmentally and neighbour- hood friendly, capable of using smaller airfields as well as the big hub airports. The regionals thus provide a significant social as well as economic role in worldwide commercial aviation. As a result, regional airline traffic in western Europe has been rising faster than that of the main trunk airlines in recent months. The European Regional Airlines Association's members registered average growth in 1992 of 16 per cent over 1991, against about 5 to 6 per cent for the major trunks. This trend seems likely to continue, as recovery from the recession strengthens, and the effects of the EC's 'third aviation package' of liberalisation measures, including freedom of market entry and access to new routes, takes full effect (although unlimited 'cabotage' - the ability to operate unfettered services in other countries - will not become effective until April 1 1997). However, like the larger airlines, the regional sector has its problems. These include shortage of 'slots' (take-off times) at many big airports, which makes the introduction of new routes and services more difficult, and congestion in the air, which leads to delays for all operators. Such constraints prevent the regionals from fulfilling their ambitions of expanding faster in the past, and thus also serve to curb their requirements for new aircraft. Nevertheless, though worldwide orders for twin turbo-prop air- liners, still the backbone of the world's regional fleets, fell away sharply in 1992, it has been estimated that demand to the end of the decade will average 200 to 250 aircraft a year, with the small twin-jets, such as the Canadair 50-plus seat Regional Jet and the new Fokker 70 of up to 79 seats, averaging about 50 a year. Through to 2010, the world market is estimated at several thousand aircraft, worth around Dollars 60bn. Most deliveries seem likely to go to the US and western Europe, where regional airline development is already extensive, but demand for regional aircraft elsewhere is also likely to be strong, especially in south-east Asia where overall traffic growth is likely to be faster than anywhere else. In all, worldwide from north America and western and eastern Europe to Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Russia and Taiwan, there are more than 30 manufacturers of all sizes engaged in struggles for shares of this extraordinarily large and diverse market. Clearly, not all of these types are likely to make money in the years ahead, despite the big demand that is expected to emerge. Rationalisation of the industry is inevitable, to reduce industrial overcapacity, and achieve higher production rates and better financial results. This has already begun. In north America, de Havilland of Canada has been acquired by Bombardier Group (which also includes Learjet of the US, Canadair and Short Brothers of Belfast). In western Europe, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy led the way some time ago with their alliance through Avions de Transport Regional. This has now been followed with both the British Aerospace alliance with Taiwan on regional jet manufacture, and that between Fokker of the Netherlands and Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, whereby Dasa took a 5l per cent stake in Fokker. Many see the Fokker move as a major step towards the inevitable restructuring of Europe's regional aircraft manufacturing industry. Since Dasa already includes Dornier, the Fokker deal gives the new group a significant stake in the market with a wide range of typesand potential for further developments - a new Fokker/Dasa 130-seater jet airliner is under discussion. Over recent months, virtually everybody has been talking to everybody else about collaboration in some form or another. It has even been suggested that there is scope in western Europe for setting up a new international consortium of the Airbus type, devoted exclusively to meeting the world's regional aircraft requirements. It remains to be seen whether such a grandiose plan ever sees the light of day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elisabeth Noelle/Neumann report: "The CDU/CSU Is Leading </F> Before the European Election"]    [Text] After the depressive winter months, the Germans'  mood has given way to downright boisterousness in May. However,  not all are equally optimistic. Among Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] adherents, 54 percent  expect an economic improvement. In February, only 27 percent  had such hopes. Among Free Democratic Party [FDP] adherents,  the confidence increased from 14 to 45 percent. However, those  who are close to the Social Democratic Party [SPD] are  pessimistic: 14 percent in February and 23 percent at the end  of May expected an economic upswing.    The dissimilar mood in the political camps is influencing  the  upcoming European election. From the beginning to the end of  May, the share of CDU/CSU adherents who think that it its  "particularly important" increased from 35 to 53 percent. Among  FDP adherents, 44 percent (early May: 36 percent) are of this  opinion, as compared with 43 percent in the SPD (early May: 29  percent), and only 39 percent (early May: 31 percent) in the  Alliance 90/Greens. Among all voters, CDU/CSU adherents are  most firmly determined to participate in the election. From the  beginning to the end of May, the share of those who are  determined to participate increased. "I will certainly  participate in the election," said 61 percent of the CDU/CSU  adherents at the end of May, as compared with 48 percent in  early May. Among the FDP adherents, the "certain intention to  vote" increased from 44 percent to 60 percent. However, there  was stagnation among the SPD's friends. "I will certainly  participate in the election," said 46 percent of them both at  the beginning and the end of May.    This dissimilar intentions result in a turnout of about 60  percent, as in 1989. In western Germany, it will presumably be  five points higher than in the east.    After the poll concluded on 27 May, the presumable election  result in the European election would be as follows: 36.5  percent for the CDU/CSU, including the votes for the CSU of  about 6 percent, 35.5 percent for the SPD, 10.5 percent for the  Alliance 90/Greens, 6.0 percent for the FDP, 3.0 percent for the  PDS, and 2.5 percent for the Republikaner. The upward tendency  for the CDU/CSU is continuing. Regarding the second-vote  intention ("if the Bundestag election were held next Sunday"),  the SPD has a narrow lead before the CDU/CSU with 37.3 percent  and 36.0 percent respectively. The FDP gains about 8.6 percent  and the Alliance 90/Greens 10.6 percent; 3.3 percent want to  vote for the Republikaner and 3.1 percent for the PDS.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Drop in train orders risks 35,000 jobs, says Labour British-based companies building railway engines and carriages face extinction because of a lack of new orders in the approach to rail privatisation, Mr Brian Wilson MP, Labour transport spokesman, said yesterday. There was a danger that no orders would be placed with British manufacturers by UK companies this year, risking up to 35,000 jobs in the rolling stock and railway equipment supply industry, he said. Mr Wilson said there were only definite orders from customers in Taiwan and London Underground to carry the industry beyond the end of 1995. 'The government's much vaunted private public finance initiative is a fiasco as far as train building is concerned. The solitary potential order under the scheme, for the Northern Line trains, has only been acceded to under intense political pressure,' Mr Wilson said. ABB Transportation, the Swiss-Swedish company with manufacturing plants in Derby and York said: 'We are extremely concerned about our order book.' ABB finishes work on trains for the Underground's Central Line this year and on trains for BR's Network SouthEast division next October.</p>

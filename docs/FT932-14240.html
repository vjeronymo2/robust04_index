			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: Ivory tower view of German railways Sir, Prof Dore's plea (Letters, April 17) for the German way of 'microcorporatist' rail union involvement, by which he apparently means the sacrifice of short-term profits to attain flexibility and quality, was written in his ivory tower with all the windows firmly shut. As the Suddeutsche Zeitung reported on April 6, the truth about German Rail is very different. Its debts now amount to at least DM70bn (Pounds 28.6bn), and are rising at about 10 per cent a year. For 1992, the turnover of the West German Railways in goods traffic was less than in 1972. The current plan, therefore, is to set up a limited liability company called Deursche Bahn AG, which will have the effect of transferring DM70bn of debt to the German taxpayers (and to me). These are the real results of microcorporatism. What Prof Dore advocates is in fact a daily burden on the German taxpayer of DM27m (Pounds 11m), solely to offset the daily loss made by German Rail. If Prof Dore had said that microcorporatism means macrolosses, he would have been at least accurate in judging economic performance. R Gill, Daphnestrasse 21, 8000 Munchen 81, Germany</p>

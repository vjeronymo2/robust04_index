			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Letter: What's best for the Saudis? Sir, We have often been told that the last thing Saudi Arabia wants to see on its doorstep is a dictatorial regime in Baghdad. We have also often been told that the last thing Saudi Arabia wants is a fundamentalist regime in Tehran. Now, Eric Watkins ('Success of Yemeni elections prompts worries for Saudis', May 14) quotes, approvingly, a western diplomat who asserts 'the last thing Saudi royalty wants on its doorstep is a successful little democracy in Yemen'. Will somebody, please, tell us what is it exactly that we want on our doorstep? Ghazi Algosaibi, ambassador, Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, London</p>

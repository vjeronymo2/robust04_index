			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: An acquisition with eastern promise - BICC's purchase of KWO Kabel, Germany's third largest cable maker MR DAVID Hingston shrugged off the small demonstration outside the factory gates of KWO Kabel, the east German cable maker which BICC, the British-based cable and construction group, acquired in February. The demonstrators, led by IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, were demanding that employers honour a contract aimed at bringing eastern German wages up to western German levels by April 1994. As chairman of the management board of KWO, a factory located on the banks of the river Spree in Kopenick, east Berlin, Mr Hingston would prefer the timetable towards income parity to be postponed. That would mean that he would not be obliged to pay his employees a 26 per cent pay increase this year as outlined in the contract. But these, and other problems, are now in the hands of Mr Rainer Hemmann, who BICC poached from Siemens, and who took over KWO's day-to-day operations in March. Mr Hingston, in the meantime, will turn his mind to BICC's other international operations. Mr Hingston, who knew about KWO's operations before German unification, had no illusions about the effort it would take to turn the company round. Before 1989, the Soviet and eastern European market accounted for the bulk of KWO's turnover. Monetary union in June 1990, and exposure to competition soon put paid to that market. By February 1992, trading losses totalled DM9m. Despite the collapse of the Soviet market, and trading losses, BICC decided to buy KWO in late-1991 after a western German company lost interest. KWO had been taken over in 1990 by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of the eastern German economy, which reduced its workforce from 9,500 to 3,800. BICC took the plunge for two reasons: it believes that eastern Europe will eventually develop a vast market for telecommunications and cable power equipment, making KWO's traditional links in the region invaluable. More importantly, BICC wants a much bigger foothold in the German market. But the negotiations with the Treuhand were long. There were many property claims on the four sites which BICC eventually bought. Even though BICC, as an investor, had priority over claims registered by former owners, the Treuhand, and the city of Berlin, wanted watertight assurances that BICC was not buying for the 'quick buck'. 'Some people in the Treuhand were obsessed about property speculators. I think they had gotten their fingers burnt before. They needed a lot of convincing that we would not shell the site, and then sell it for a big profit. In the end, because we were going to rationalise our operations, which meant we only needed 105,000 square metres of the 230,000 square metres we bought, it was agreed that we would offer any excess land back to the city of Berlin at the price we paid for it, plus inflation,' explained Mr Hingston. BICC paid an estimated DM63m for KWO. Another lesson BICC learnt in the process of trying to complete the KWO deal was the importance of detail. 'No foreign company should apply for planning per-mission with vague outlines. Detail is a premium in this country,' said Mr Hingston. Patience with the bureaucracy is another necessary virtue, quipped a BICC senior official. BICC completed the acquisition of KWO in March, almost a year since it started negotiations, which at that time, gave it the right to manage the company. Under the terms of the contract, BICC is committed to investing DM80m (excluding grants) until 1994, and it is entitled to obtain grants from the Senate of Berlin of about 23 per cent of the capital costs. In addition, BICC will receive an 8 per cent investment premium from the government for fixed production costs. BICC is also committed to employing a total of 2,200 people until the end of 1994. Mr Hingston says there is still a small amount of unemployment. 'We have nearly reached our target of 2,200.' The Treuhand subsidised excess labour until last October. It will meet redundancy costs until the middle of this year. Rationalisation has been completed. Mr John Woodthorpe, director of strategic planning at Kopenick, says KWO has now been divided into three divisions - energy cables, telecommunications, and material. 'KWO, in principle, is like any other factory. The only thing is that you have to make an allowance for the past 40 years: the staff has to appreciate the value of profit, money, property, and above all, the importance of the consumer,' said Mr Hingston. Needless to say, the marketing department has been overhauled. 'Before 1989, there was a sales department of 30 people, who we still employ. They were instructed in one style of marketing: they had to visit the shops, check the stock, and then tell the retailers what they could and could not have. That was what was known as marketing . . .' explained Mr Hingston. As a result of training, and a smaller workforce, sales per person have doubled over the past year, and productivity has risen from about 35 per cent to 65 per cent. By the end of 1992, turnover amounted to DM320m, and could reach DM400m this year. Germany, and European Community countries, already account for 80 per cent of turnover. But there are signs that KWO's market in the former Soviet Union is reviving. And most important of all, there is even talk of a 'small profit' for 1993. 'Things are improving,' said Mr Hingston.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Funds management groups link HENDERSON Administration Group, the UK fund management group, has taken a 25 per cent interest in Sabre, the managed futures fund specialist, at a cost of Pounds 1m. Henderson has also taken a four-year option to acquire a further 26 per cent interest in the company. Henderson decided, in a strategic review 18 months ago, to invest in specialist fund management companies complementary to its own business, according to Mr Jeremy Edwards, managing director. Further such investments or acquisitions are planned. The choice of Sabre as its first investment, however, reflects a new awareness in the UK of the potential growth of the managed futures fund industry, which now has an estimated Dollars 20bn under management in the US, and is attracting more interest in Japan and the Middle East, but is still in its infancy in Europe. Managed futures funds use futures and options to invest in a broad range of markets using sophisticated techniques. 'Managed futures is an area we regard as offering significant international growth potential, and Sabre, with its long-standing record, investment experience and techniques is well positioned to benefit from that growth,' said Mr Edwards. Henderson has Pounds 8bn of funds under management. Mr Peter Swete, managing director of Sabre, said Henderson's international marketing and distribution muscle would prove a valuable asset for Sabre, which would like to expand its Japanese business, and will also focus more closely on the Middle East and parts of Europe. Sabre, which now manages close to Dollars 100m of funds, has produced average annual returns of 17 per cent since its inception. It was founded by Mr Swete and Mr Robin Edwards in 1982 and specialises in the discretionary management of funds using the currency, financial and commodity futures markets. Mr Robin Holland-Martin and Mr Rupert Carnegie, of Henderson, will join the Sabre board, but Sabre will continue to be run as a separate company.</p>

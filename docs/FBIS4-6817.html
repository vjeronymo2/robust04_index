			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has agreed to arrest Burmese "terrorists"  travelling on false passports and Burma has agreed to open a  border checkpoint to take back illegal Burmese immigrants,  sources said yesterday.    The agreement was reached during a meeting of the  Thai-Burmese Border Committee in Moulmein in Burma.    The sources said Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had been told  of the agreement which would be submitted to the Cabinet for  acknowledgement on Tuesday.    First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo and  commander of the Burmese Southeastern Regional Army Maj-Gen Ket  Sein worked out the agreements.    Burma said a number of "terrorists" had been using fake  passports to travel abroad through Bangkok and asked Thailand to  arrest them. The Burmese did not define the word "terrorists".    Thailand said it had a policy not to support Burmese  terrorists and the Interior and Foreign Ministries would arrest  them if they passed through Bangkok. Burma gave Thailand a  report on the false passports and travel documents. Thailand  told Burma the 300,000 Burmese illegal immigrants causing social  and economic problems in Thailand must be repatriated.    Burma said it would open a checkpoint to take them back if  it  could be proven they were Burmese citizens.    Representatives of the two countries agreed on developing  trade and tourism with local border committees of the two  countries finding ways to achieve this.    The Interior Minister, the Customs Department and the Joint  Operations Center of the Supreme Command had been given  responsibility for this, the source said.    The agreements will be forwarded to the Cabinet on Tuesday  and another meeting of the Thai-Burmese Border Committee will be  held in Bangkok at the end of this month, the source said.</p>

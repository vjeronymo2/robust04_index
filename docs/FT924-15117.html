			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (2): Pay TV reaches for the sky - Raymond Snoddy looks at the UK's satellite television venture THE UK's six-channel satellite television venture, British Sky Broadcasting, is one of the most remarkable media news stories of the past decade. It is remarkable for the number of subscribers it has signed up but equally so for the enormity of what it has cost and the degree of controversy it has aroused and the disputes over how well it is or is not doing. What is clear, however, is that since the forced merger in November 1990 of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television the combined consortium is the leading satellite pay television business in Europe with l5m subscribers. Canal Plus, the French pay television service, is far ahead with more than 3.5m subscribers but much of its enormous strength flows from controlling a conventional national television channel. Among broadcasters using satellite distribution BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, has more than twice as many subscribers as its nearest rival FilmNet which broadcasts to the Scandinavian countries and Belgium and The Netherlands. Earlier this year BSkyB, in co-operation with the BBC, turned up the heat when it outbid ITV with a Pounds 304m offer for five-year exclusive rights to live coverage of the new Premier football league. There were allegations of skulduggery in the negotiations, complaints to the Office of Fair Trading, and worries that the league would suffer from the lack of visibility involved in taking games off national television. It is not yet clear whether recorded highlights on the BBC would be an adequate substitute, in terms of generating interest, for live games available to the whole population. But if there is doubt about the long-term impact on the Premier league of moving to satellite television there is very little about the effects on BSkyB. The agreement has enabled the consortium to turn Sky Sports into a subscription channel at Pounds 5.99 a month although there were Pounds 2.99 special offers for the first year. BSkyB already has attracted 950,000 satellite subscribers to Sky Sports and an estimated 110,000 on cable. Because of the discounting, the financial model is complex but already Sky Sports is getting close to break-even. Scrambling Sky Sports so that it is only available to those who pay is a clear indication of the way the venture, and probably many of the other satellite channels, is moving. While satellite channels will, of course, try to raise as much advertising revenue as they can it is a business that will be based firmly on subscription revenues. It is now obvious, that at least in the UK, the charging structure of satellite television, will ape that of cable with a charges for a 'basic tier' of channels. Everything else will be a la carte with discounts for those who take most of the premium channels. Until September, the BSkyB channels have been 'free' apart from the subscription channels. Discussions are now at an advanced stage with United Artists programming to try to put together a basic tier of channels, including Sky One and Sky News, and channels such as Discovery, the documentary channel, Bravo, the classic films channel, and The Children's channel. Negotiations are still continuing on the precise financial terms but other channels may yet also decide to join the loose federation. The aim is to launch the new basic tier next October at a monthly charge of Pounds 2.99. If possible BSkyB would like to keep the cost of access to all the available channels to Pounds 19.99 a month which is seen as a significant threshold. If they go too far above that there could be consumer resistance. No-one knows what the effect will be of scrambling and charging for all the channels. At the moment the satellite dish universe is rising at monthly rates of 50,000 to 80,000 depending on the time of year. If that rate of increase can be maintained after the introduction of full subscription packages then satellite television will become a very profitable business in the UK. Since March, BSkyB has been profitable at the trading level and a Pounds 50m operational profit is expected for this year. This figure does not include the vast sums invested by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and other big investors such as Granada, Pearson and Chargeurs. It could be many years before they get their money back although some City analysts looking at the subscription revenue flows are saying the company could be worth between Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn. Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, says he is determined to keep the satellite company competitive and will offer however many channels it takes, in ventures with others, to try to ensure BSkyB is a 'must purchase'. On October 1, Sky launched a third film channel to replace the Comedy Channel which was not a success. The channel of films from the past 30 years will be available free to those who take both premium film channels. No precise numbers are available for the size of the satellite universe mainly because at the beginning all the channels were available free and therefore there were no subscriber bills to provide a check. BSkyB says it has 1.5m subscribers taking at least one premium film channel with 81 per cent taking both. The company believes it is available direct via satellite dishes to a total of 2.6m homes apart from cable television. These estimates are in line with independent market research by Continental Research based on monthly interviews. Official figures from the Broadcasting Audience Research Board are lower and a six-monthly study by another market research group gives figures that are even lower. In June, Continental put the dish universe at 2.423m, Barb at 2.208, and GFK 1.77m, which, if correct, would give an astonishingly high proportion of subscribers to non-subscribers. The new channels take about 30 per cent of viewing in satellite homes. Zenith Media Worldwide, the media buying group, believes that by 2003 cable television will rival dishes in the UK as a means of distributing new channels. Overall by then the total household penetration of the new channels in the UK will, Zenith forecasts, reach 73 per cent.</p>

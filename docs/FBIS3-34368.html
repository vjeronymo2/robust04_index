The ruling authorities in Israel still believe they can set  the clock back and that it is possible to perpetuate the  occupation while stepping up their talk about peace, as if it's  realization is imminent. [word indistinct] the uproar continues.    Through all this, it becomes evident that what the Israelis  want is to drag the peace process into mazes that, in case the  peace process continues, will only undermine and destroy its  very foundations.    From this premise, the enemy's procrastination and delaying  tactics on the one hand, and the escalation of its terrorist  operations against our steadfast people in the occupied homeland  on the other are signs as to how official Israel approaches the  peace process and its requirements. Official Israel's illusion  has reached the point of believing it is possible to bypass, or  distort the inalienable Palestinian rights under the slogan of  introducing amendments to the Declaration of Principles. Five  months after it was signed, Israel has not yet offered any  evidence that it abides by the implementation of its provisions.    While we view the Declaration of Principles as a first step  on the road to peace, we are aware, and emphasize that this  agreement is not the end of the road, given that it is an  agreement for a transitional stage and does not, as yet, respond  to all our national aspirations for liberation and complete  independence.    In spite of all the above, we stress to the enemy before  anyone else, that we have the necessary potential, will, and  confidence in victory that make us say with a resounding voice  that Israeli blackmail will be to no avail, and that occupation  will inevitably be eliminated. Let the enemy wallow as much as  it wants in its illusions. However, it must realize before it  is too late that its illusions will founder on the rock of our  people's steadfastness and their unflinching faith in the  inevitable victory and independence on the liberated land of  Palestine.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals push Ewart into losses EXCEPTIONAL costs involved in fighting off Monarch Properties put Ewart Pounds 260,000 into the red for the six months ended October 31; the interim dividend is passed. From turnover of Pounds 1.94m (Pounds 1.79m) this Northern Ireland-based property developer made an operating profit of Pounds 20,000 (Pounds 104,000). Exceptionals of Pounds 279,000 represented the cost of an extraordinary meeting. That was called by Mr Philip Monahan, chairman of Monarch, a private company based in the Republic, in an attempt to oust members of the board and replace them with two of his own nominees, 'with a view to radically re-defining the strategic direction of Ewart.' After its narrow defeat Monarch's 29.2 per cent holding was acquired by Patternbread Establishment, which 'is positively committed to the further growth of Ewart and supportive of the strategy pursued by the board', said Mr Derek Tughan, chairman of Ewart. He said the reduction in operating profit was entirely the result of increased interest charges, stemming from the financing of recent investment acquisitions and the inclusion of interest relating to the shopping centre development at Ross's Court, now completed. Prospects for the Laganbank development received a boost with confirmation of government backing for the project. Losses per share were 1.39p, against earnings of 0.44p from which an interim dividend of 0.25p was paid.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Litany of charges against Invesco detailed THE Pounds 750,000 fines levied yesterday on Invesco MIM by Imro, the self-regulating body for fund management organisations, with costs of Pounds 1.6m, are a record for an SRO disciplinary case. The more painful punishment for the group is the litany of charges Imro published yesterday. The first charge states that between July 1988 and December 1992, Invesco MIM Management (IMM) 'failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that its officers and employees acted in conformity with their own and their employer's relevant responsibilities under the regulatory system'. IMM also failed to 'ensure it had in place internal controls and systems adequate for the size, nature and complexity of its activities'. IMM also paid money which was not clients' money into a client money account, and breached regulations on the handling of clients' money. It provided 'inaccurate' information to Imro and issued a misleading advertisement. The second set of eight charges relates to Invesco MIM Unit Trust Managers (IMUTM). The first says 'in or about May 1990, Invesco notified Imro of a pricing error in respect of shares held by a unit trust scheme but did not reveal how the error had arisen or its scale.' Another charge is that between April 1988 and April 1990 IMUTM valued a fund incorrectly. Further charges said between January 1989 and November 1991, IMUTM failed to ensure that only client money was held in designated client bank accounts, and between September 1987 and September 1992, it made an investment on behalf of an authorised unit trust which was outside the trust's objective. The third set of 20 charges was brought against Invesco Ventures, covering issues such as carrying on business outside permitted areas, breaches of rules pertaining to customer title documents, defective record-keeping, provision of inaccurate regulatory information, financial resource deficiencies, failure to provide investors with accurate and timely information and undisclosed conflicts of interest made on behalf of customers. The penultimate set of charges was against Invesco Ventures and Invesco MIM Management. These say unsuitable investments were made by IMM and IVL on behalf of customers, who subsequently suffered losses. The fifth set of three charges covers IMM's conduct in relation to assets belonging to the Mirror Group Pension Scheme, plundered by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The charges state IMM failed to keep Imro properly informed of its concerns about how the pension fund's assets under IMM's management were being used. They say IMM failed to disclose to the pension fund trustees that it no longer had custody of investments it was managing on their behalf. The other charge says that on 19 October 1990, IMM, in custody of certificates on investments valued at Pounds 26.7m belonging to 'some of its customers', parted with their possession of those certificates to a third party other than on the instructions of the customers.</p>

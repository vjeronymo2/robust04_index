			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Mexicans trim new issues to match tough conditions Correction (published 29th July 1994) appended to this article. Four Mexican companies have overcome difficult market conditions and placed equity offerings worth USDollars 450m on international markets in the past two weeks, bringing to 20 the number of Mexican companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The companies were forced to lower the number of shares offered and the selling prices. Brokers involved in the offerings say that concern about Mexican political stability and falling capital flows to emerging markets in general made their job difficult. 'The new issue environment is difficult in general and quite difficult for Mexican companies right now. You have to be very selective about how you go at investors and try to sell to those who know particular industries,' says Mr Justin Mansen, co-ordinator of the offering of paper maker Grupo Industrial Durango for the US brokerage house Morgan Stanley. Durango was forced to lower its issue price by 14 per cent to raise Dollars 123m. An additional Dollars 150m was raised through a 7-year, 12 per cent Yankee bond issue, the first private Mexican company to use the market this year. The other companies with successful equity offerings, mid-sized bank Banpais, real estate developer Grupo Sidek, and industrial conglomerate Grupo DESC, suffered price reductions of 21 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. DESC also reduced the share offering by 44 per cent, while Sidek cut the number by 34 per cent. Banpais, which needed the new capital to pay off expensive short-term debt, related to its recent purchase of insurance company Asemex from the Mexican government, was hit particularly hard as it was forced to borrow again to meet payment obligations. Grupo Elektra, the home furnishings chain, which had substantial obligations related to its participation in the purchase of the privatised television network Television Azteca, was forced to cancel its planned equity offering when executives judged that potential investors were valuing the company too low. Mr Kenneth Pryor Jones, the Sidek finance director, shrugged off the price reduction, saying the new capital raised was not as important as the New York listing itself. 'When we securitise Dollars 200m in receivables this summer, just the fact that we are listed will enable us to offer those notes 50 basis points lower,' he said. CORRECTION The FT last week in the international edition reported that Banpais, the Mexican bank, took out a loan to pay back debt arising from the acquisition of Asemex, an insurance company, after an equity offering had not raised the amount planned. That loan was in fact taken out before the equity offering, and was not directly related to the Asemex purchase.</p>

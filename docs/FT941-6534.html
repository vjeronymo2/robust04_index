			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 30.8m housing buy for Taylor Woodrow Taylor Woodrow construction and property group is paying Pounds 30.8m to acquire the housebuilding assets of debt-laden Heron International, the property and trading company formerly controlled by Mr Gerald Ronson. The deal is the latest in a series of land purchases by UK housebuilders, anxious to increase output to take advantage of the recovery in the UK housing market. Heron last year concluded a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing, swapping some of its debt for equity. It has been raising cash from disposals to meet its revised repayment obligations. Heron Corporation, the group's trading arm, has already made early repayment of Pounds 150m which had been due at the end of next month. The parent company, however, needs to repay a further Pounds 32.9m, also by the end of next month. The former Heron land and homes is in southern and south west England and Cardiff. The Heron housebuilding assets include about 1,100 housing sites and almost 200 homes in various stages of completion. The purchase will allow Taylor Woodrow to increase its UK housebuilding. Taylor Woodrow is a southern-based builder which has recently expanded its operations to Yorkshire and Humberside. It has also been restructuring its Scottish operations. The company is thought to have sold approaching 1,000 homes last year and is looking to increase output further in the medium term. Its recent land purchases are thought to have been averaging between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 16,000 per plot. The land acquired from Heron is thought to have cost slightly more per plot, so the purchase should also help Taylor Woodrow meet its aim of building larger, more expensive, higher margin homes. The average price of a Heron home is about Pounds 85,000 compared with about Pounds 77,000 for a Taylor Woodrow home. Mr Gerald Ronson remained as chief executive of Heron following the refinancing but was replaced as chairman by Lord Boardman, former chairman of NatWest Bank.</p>

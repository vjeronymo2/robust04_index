			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- The National Police  Headquarters (ORFK) will initiate keeping far-right Hungarist  Movement leaders Albert Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos in custody  pending trial on Saturday [30 April] at the latest. The two  were arrested at dawn on Friday.    ORFK's Colonel Istvan Balatoni told reporters on Friday that  14-15 flats were searched, fascist publications and 500  swastika-emblems were confiscated, and 18-20 people were  questioned during the dawn sweep carried out in cooperation with  the Office for National Security.    According to Balatoni, the Hungarist Movement went public at  its April 27 news conference in order to recruit sympathizers,  because their founding document was signed only by 11 people,  some of whom told the police that they knew nothing of Szalasi's  ideology. (Ferenc Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led Hungary's fascist  Arrow-Cross Party and Hungarist Movement. He was executed as a  war-criminal in 1946.)    Balatoni stressed that charges of inciting ethnic hatred had  only been lodged against Szabo and Gyorkos, while the police  lacked sufficient evidence against the third Hungarist leader,  Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem. Last year for a similar crime Gyorkos was  sentenced to a year's imprisonment, suspended for three years.    The colonel denied any connection between the police action  and the Hungarian Democratic Forum presidium's Thursday morning  condemnation of the Hungarist Movement or Prime Minister Peter  Boross's Thursday afternoon statement to the same effect.  Balatoni said that preparing such a coordinated operation takes  a longer time, and it has to be carried out at a time when the  suspects are most probably at home.</p>

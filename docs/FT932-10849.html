			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (11): To hedge or not to hedge - Currencies / 1992 gains have been unusually strong, says Norma Cohen AFTER a year like the last one, pension fund managers may well ask themselves if there is any good reason to bother hedging currency exposures. Consider the facts. Last year, fund managers investing in US dollar-based assets earned an additional 23.6 percentage points once the currency had been converted into dollars, according to Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps). Against the yen, it was equally impressive at 23.7 per cent, 15.7 per cent against the D-Mark and 15.9 per cent against the French franc. 'We have found it is not worth it to hedge,' said Caroline Burton, investment director at Guardian Royal Exchange. 'We found last year, for instance, that the currency gains in the Japanese stock market wiped out our losses there,' she said. According to Caps, the Japanese equities market returned negative 4.7 per cent last year, even when currencies were taken into account. Mr Robert Baker, pensions consultant at William M. Mercer, said that hedging currency exposures remains the exception rather than the rule at most UK pension funds, in spite of the increasing percentage of assets invested abroad. That partly reflects the gains which funds have recorded in recent years from currencies. The Caps data show that within the past five years, 1992 currency gains have been unusually strong. But in the previous four, they have been negligible and any effort to hedge would have been overshadowed by the cost. In the four years to the end of 1991, the US dollar appreciated 0.1 per cent against sterling, while the yen sank 0.6 per cent. The French and German currencies recorded gains of 0.9 and 1.0 per cent respectively. Mr Alan Greenhorn, formerly head of quantitative active management at Hill Samuel Asset Management, said the group had made a study of the benefits of hedging for pension funds. 'In the long run, we found that the costs of passive hedging far outweigh the benefits,' he said. Mr Jeffery Davis, of State Street, the Boston-based bank and fund manager, said that the benefits of currency risk management rise with the degree of overseas exposure. 'It all really depends on what proportion of a pension plan is devoted to non-domestic assets. If it is five to 10 per cent, as is common in the US, then the benefits are insignificant in terms of reducing volatility,' he said. 'But if you have 20 per cent or more abroad and your interest is in reducing volatility, then there is some benefit to hedging.' But Mr Greenhorn, who now heads an active quant fund management team at State Street, said increasingly there are reasons to consider the use of some currency overlay product for portfolio management. In currency overlay theory, managers attempt to separate out currency from other investment decisions and then hedge the currency risk as appropriate. The process is gaining widespread use among American pension fund managers, who ironically have a lower percentage of non-domestic assets than do their UK counterparts. But the product is still far from mainstream in the UK and its appeal is greatest to those who are already sympathetic to mathematical applications of fund management theory. 'There are really two investment decisions,' Mr Greenhorn said. 'One is whether you like the currency and the other is whether you like the market. And it's unlikely that your preferred currency is also going to be your preferred market,' he said. Moreover, fund managers may not realise just how exposed they are to certain currencies. Many companies whose shares are held will themselves derive a significant portion of their revenues from, say, the US or Japan, and buying that share is furthering that exposure. Mr Robert Clarkson, general manager of investment at Scottish Mutual, said that he has been using a currency overlay system for that reason, among others. The strategy makes significant use of currency derivatives, he said. 'We regard the currency decision as different from the underlying market,' he said. For instance, while the Japanese stock market currently looks attractive, the yen is less so. 'We would have a lower yen exposure through the forward currency market,' he said. Scottish Mutual also uses derivatives to move quickly into a market where the stock selection process has not yet been completed. He purchases forward contracts and then as underlying stocks are purchased, unwinds the position. However, pension schemes have been chary of such techniques because of the dim view that the Inland Revenue takes of those activities. While investment is tax-free, trading is not and gains on those strategies could well attract capital gains tax.</p>

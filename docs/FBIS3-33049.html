It is estimated that as soon as the president enters office,  the administration will request an amendment to the Budget Law  for 1994 to reduce appropriations and allocations which it  considers superfluous and unnecessary.    Abdon Vivas Teran, economic adviser of the next  administration and member of the transition team, has pointed  out that one of the priorities is to deal with the problem of  the budget deficit. That will require carefully adjusting the  balance between government income and expenditure.    Public spending is one of the variables which have the most  decisive influence on the level of aggregate demand.  Consequently, he commented, it has a significant impact on the  maintenance of adequate rates of growth of Gross Domestic  Product. At the same time, by carefully managing that element it  will be possible to have a decisive impact which will lead to a  decline in the level of inflation and interest rates and the  small scale devaluations through which until the exchange rate  between the U. S. dollar and the bolivar has been set.    He stated that the traditional policy of expanding demand  tends to limit the scope for reconsidering public spending.  Reducing the level of spending to a reasonable extent and, at  the same time, reexamining the rest of the budget is another way  of saying that we have to reform the Budget Law of 1994.    Vivas Teran said that, "The study conducted by the technical  team of the new government indicates that a reduction on the  order of 150 billion bolivares of public spending is an  objective which can be achieved over the very short term. These  adjustments," which are rather limited, "will not be oriented  toward the investment area nor toward the socially productive  area (education, health, and public security)." He indicated  that cuts will be made in appropriations and allocations which  have continued to reflect exaggerated levels of spending, such  as for automobiles, travel, highways, aircraft, celebrations,  and publicity, among other things.    Vivas Teran stated that the president elect has announced a  30 percent reduction in spending on the security of the  Presidency and on the secret appropriation of the Ministry of  Internal Relations. He rejected the allocation of 60 million  bolivares for expenditures related to his inauguration.    Vivas Teran was asked, "Will the bureaucracy be pruned?" He  answered: "Yes. Within the goal of reducing the budget by 150  billion bolivares consideration is being given to the  elimination of some unnecessary services which probably are  duplicated elsewhere. Hence the urgent need for restructuring  existing institutions."    He added that action to reduce spending should be  accompanied  by a series of measures to increase public receipts. These  increases should complement the program of reforms aimed at  modernizing and placing income tax collection on a better  technical basis, as well as other, ordinary tax receipts,  including the collection of duties by the customs service of the  country. Specifically, these involve the following:     -  The adequate management of the whole income tax system  (without as yet introducing changes in the law which must be  approved by Congress), creating an autonomous income tax system  and strictly controlling tax collections. This would make it  possible for the Ministry of Finance to collect about 260  billion bolivares in 1994 in this category, as compared to the  131 billion bolivares collected up to the end of 1993.    -  The next  administration should, as a matter of preference, concern itself  with tariff collections made by customs offices. It will be  necessary to bring up to date a technical cooperation agreement  which Venezuela has already signed with the United Nations for  trade and development (UNTAC) to modernize the tariff system.  Unfortunately, the most intractable focus of corruption in the  whole system of government tax collection is in the customs  offices. It is essential to wipe out this system of corruption  and make changes in management personnel.    In his opinion the efforts which have been made in this  direction have been very limited. He stated that receipts by the  Treasury from tariffs amounted to 115 billion bolivares in 1993.  It is estimated that, with the changes to be made, customs  receipts could rise to 350 billion bolivares. In this way the  new government, through the application of ethical and  administrative principles, will be able to obtain from income  tax and customs receipts sufficient resources (about 610 billion  bolivares) to resolve the budget deficit to a large extent.     -  Urgent action should be taken on taxes which are owed but  not yet collected and on any tax measure which the government  may approve, including those tax cases which have already been  decided favorably in the appropriate courts. According to a  report from the Hacienda Publica Nacional [National Treasury]  for 1992, the cumulative total of all of the potential receipts  by the Treasury under this heading amounted to 400 billion  bolivares. The most worrisome aspect of this situation is that  there has been no will to collect these taxes. Corruption is of  such magnitude that frequently obligations to pay are allowed to  lapse.    The state can and should begin a healthy and sensible tax  collection policy, using law firms and entrusting them with  handling this task. Their services would be paid for by a  negotiable percentage of the tax collections which they make.     -  Presenting to Congress as soon as possible changes in  income tax legislation, including: (a) eliminating or  substantially reducing authorized legal exemptions, especially  those which protect the financial sector; (b) slightly  increasing the taxes due on corporations. The maximum now is 30  percent. It could be raised to 32.5 percent; (c) reducing the  impact of direct taxation by enacting income tax legislation  before providing for some other type of tax to replace the  burden of indirect taxes on the people. Vivas Teran warned that  the collection of income taxes in Venezuela amounts at most to  2.0 percent of Gross Domestic Product. In 1993 it did not amount  even to that much. In the United States, for example, income tax  collections amount to 10.8 percent of total government income;  (d) immediate substitution of the Value Added Tax by a tax on  the consumption of luxury articles which would exempt from  payment all products of common use by the people and which could  start from a given unit value and rise higher.    Abdon Vivas Teran, expected to replace Julian Villalba as  president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, considers that the  policy of privatization should be used more as an instrument  aimed at correcting structural deficiencies in the distribution  of income and property, in the provision of services, and in the  level of government efficiency by helping to relieve the  excessive burden of the external public debt, rather than as an  automatic instrument to compensate for the budget deficit.    Therefore, he added, these processes should guarantee access  to property, both by those who work for companies which will be  subject to these transactions as well as by persons turning out  production inputs, as in the case of the agricultural sector.    He was asked: "At present does the program for participation  by the workers provide for the sale of between 10 and 20 percent  of the shares in a company to the workers?"    He replied: "I am inclined to review and broaden this  program, without suggesting that what has been done so far is  not good. It could be better. Furthermore, privatization tends  to reduce the portfolio of shares owned by the state. The most  advisable action is for a substantial part of those assets to be  earmarked to pay debts owed by the nation over the long term. In  this way the balance sheet of the Treasury would be protected  under optimum conditions.    Vivas stated: "It is clear that our task cannot be to  privatize in part and to open another portfolio of unprofitable  assets in the hands of the nation. On the other hand everything  which adds significantly to the burdens of the state and which  could be better handled by the private sector, by mixed private  and state companies, or by associations, would be perfectly  viable. In the case of companies owned by the Venezuelan  Corporation of Guayana, not all of them, in my view, are  strategic. Initially, these companies could have a different  form of management through mixed private and state firms."    He recalled that the administration of Carlos Andres Perez  emphasized to the public the view that state-owned companies are  not viable and that they are a useless and costly burden.    Vivas Teran said: "That is a picture which may be true in  part, but it is not the whole truth. In some cases the condition  of state-owned companies has been deliberately worsened to make  the process of privatization easier, taking into account the  fact that public opinion was going to react angrily against  companies which were not providing the service expected. That is  totally correct and, of course, that cannot be the philosophy of  the new government."    Vivas Teran stated that, "We are not going to ruin state  companies just to sell them for bargain basement prices. We are  going to move them into the private sector at a good price,  because they are productive and efficient and not because they  have been deliberately bankrupted by state administrators."</p>

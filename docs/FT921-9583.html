			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: The victims - 'This resulted in quite a few attempted suicides' Mr John Bohn, London (who invested the proceeds from the sale of his company): 'The sad and scandalous thing is that this case involved so many people who were not sophisticated investors who were trying to get richer. They were mainly elderly people who had never invested outside a building society in their lives. They thought this was going to be the safest investment they could make. 'This resulted in quite a few attempted suicides, quite a few nervous breakdowns - some people are still on tranquilisers even now. 'Even though people got their money back, that is no compensation for the loss of their health.' Capt Don Beadle, Portsmouth (retired naval officer; wife and son also investors): 'I'm glad that justice has at long last been meted out. This was a gigantic fraud that caused agony and hardship for thousands. I don't think anyone will ever forget the 20 months, the time and effort we spent fighting to get our money back.' Mr Jim Hinton, Dorset (former oil company executive, Pounds 22,000 invested with Barlow Clowes): 'This affair must have been responsible for quite a lot of people passing on to the next world rather earlier than they would have done. 'A good 75 per cent of investors were elderly. They thought they were were making a safe investment.' Mr Harry Lawrence, Sheffield: 'I had to find extra sources of income, but I didn't let it upset me. I put all my energy into fighting for compensation.' Mr Antony Gold of Alexander Tatham (solicitors to the Barlow Clowes Investors Group): 'Investors went through 18 months of utter misery, feeling that they had lost most of their savings. But they did significantly better under the old system than they would have done under the new regime. The ombudsman is not empowered to investigate self-regulating bodies. Under the new legislation they would have been in a far worse position and would still have been waiting for compensation if it had occurred under the Financial Services Act.'</p>

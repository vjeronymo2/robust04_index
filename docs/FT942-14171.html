			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Buthelezi looks to poll slogan to achieve a miracle 'Go for the bottom.' With that catchy slogan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday launched an energetic, if belated, campaign for next week's South African elections. He meant the bottom of the ballot paper, the spot reserved for Inkatha as the tardiest entrant to the election campaign. Chief Buthelezi explained this to several thousand followers at his first campaign rally yesterday, delivering an impromptu lecture on voter education - as well as an extended eulogy of self-congratulation - to Zulu warriors brandishing spears and firearms in the Inkatha tradition. Carefully limiting all damage in advance, Chief Buthelezi told a patient crowd at Ulundi, the capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland' which he heads, that it would be 'a miracle' if Inkatha did well in the poll, given its late entry to the race. But as a man who believes in miracles  - he has portrayed the last-minute peace deal which brought Inkatha into the elections as a divine intervention - the chief believes Inkatha will still achieve a miraculous result. If it does not, his officials made clear, Inkatha will simply reject the result. 'The elections will not be free and fair if IFP does not win in Natal,' said Mr Albert Mncwango, an Inkatha central committee member, prompting nightmare visions of an Angolan-style violent rejection of the poll outcome. 'We are going to vote, even if they shoot at us and kill us, we go, we go, we go,' his supporters sang to the tune of a liberation song popularised by the African National Congress. Indeed, Inkatha appeared to be borrowing heavily from the rhetorical repertoire of the ANC: chants such as 'Amandla' (power) could almost be patented by the ANC. The war song, 'We are soldiers who never sleep', sung by the crowd, is almost the anthem of the ANC military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation). Mr Mncwango insists the ANC stole it from the IFP. The crowd was large and obedient, a reflection of the disciplined Inkatha party machine which is spewing out election posters by the thousands. One popular placard said: 'When the time is right, vote IFP.' Chief Buthelezi made clear yesterday the right time had come. As always, Chief Buthelezi's message was both traditional and modern: men wore robes of leopardskin with trainers; women dressed in bead skirts and covered the bare breasts of tradition with brassieres. But mostly, in the custom of leaders throughout Africa, Chief Buthelezi's aim was to celebrate his own person.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Labour clamours for minister's resignation Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, was under growing pressure to resign last night after he admitted misleading the Commons during a debate on rights for the disabled. Following angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called for Mr Scott's resignation after the minister admitted that his department had helped Tory backbenchers to wreck the passage of a private member's bill that would have required employers to provide facilities for disabled people. Mr Scott appeared determined to ride out the allegations that he misled the Commons last Friday when he stated that his department had played no part in drawing up the amendments. Downing Street officials also made clear that Mr Scott enjoyed the prime minister's full confidence, that he had cleared up any misunderstandings and was now in the clear. But Labour sees the row as a test of the accountability of members of Mr John Major's government. In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Smith said Mr Scott's statement was 'wholly unsatisfactory'. He had 'confirmed that his department, with his authority, had been involved in the preparation of the amendments'. The Labour leader quoted a letter from the prime minister to Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, in which Mr Major said ministers should 'relinquish their positions' if they knowingly failed to give truthful information to the House. Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker of the Commons, said that she would soon rule on whether Mr Scott had been in 'contempt' of the House. It would be almost unprecedented for a minister to be found in contempt. In last Friday's debate, Mr Scott told MPs his officials had played 'no part whatsoever' in the more than 80 amendments submitted to the bill, He withdrew that statement yesterday, admitting that his department had, with his knowledge, been involved in their preparation. He told a hushed Commons: 'I very much regret that by not giving a fuller explanation at the time, the effect of my reply was misleading, and I offer my unreserved apologies to the House.' Labour MPs were also threatening to question whether Lady Olga Maitland, the Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam who introduced some of the amendments, had also been in contempt. Lady Olga told the House on Monday that she 'sought consultation' on the amendments, but that it would be totally unfair to suggest that they came from any other source than the parliamentary council office.</p>

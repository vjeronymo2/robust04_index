			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS;  </P> <P> NO SURPRISES IN VOTING: INCUMBENTS WIN EASILY  </P> <P> A national push to "throw the rascals out" didn't materialize in Southeast-area  congressional races this year.  </P> <P> Seven incumbents, some of them fending off spirited attacks by challengers, won  reelection by solid margins in Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative Long Beach Republican, won handily  despite being stung in recent weeks by allegations that he used drugs as a  youth and by the defeat in Congress of his proposal to withhold federal funding  for art he considers obscene. Rohrabacher defeated political science instructor  Guy Kimbrough in District 42, which stretches from Huntington Beach to  Torrance. Rohrabacher also defeated Kimbrough two years ago.  </P> <P> "I've been a very outspoken congressman," Rohrabacher said. "If I can do that  and still have a solid victory, it's a signal from the voters to our elected  leaders that they should come out with strong stands."  </P> <P> Four Democratic incumbents and two other Republican lawmakers easily prevailed  in Southeast-area congressional races over an array of opponents.  </P> <P> The only non-incumbent elected was Maxine Waters, a veteran Democratic  assemblywoman who recorded a lopsided victory in District 29 to succeed the  retiring Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). Hawkins has occupied the  seat in the heavily Democratic district since 1962. The district covers  South-Central Los Angeles, South Gate, Huntington Park and part of Downey.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher's race against Democratic challenger Kimbrough heated up following  the allegations of drug use, which first appeared in an article in New Republic  magazine. But on Tuesday the congressman said the drug issue wasn't a factor  because "it was so long ago."  </P> <P> He called the controversial debate over funding for the National Endowment for  the Arts a "wash" in the election. "It alienated some wealthy Republicans who  go to the symphony," Rohrabacher said, "but it gave me support from some of the  blue-collar Democrats."  </P> <P> In his second term in Congress, he said, he plans to concentrate on expanding  the opportunities for employee ownership of companies in the United States and  developing a plane that will take off from a runway and fly into space.  </P> <P> "Whichever nation controls that technology will dominate the world," he said.  </P> <P> Veteran Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) also rolled up a solid victory,  despite being accused by his challenger of being a once-vigorous legislator who  no longer had the energy to do the job after serving 11 terms.  </P> <P> "This was a little tougher election, especially for incumbents," said Anderson,  77, whose victory margin was a bit smaller than two years ago. "Normally when  we have elections we don't have several hundred thousand troops someplace where  there might be a war. People are unhappy about that and there was lots of press  about throwing the rascals out."  </P> <P> Anderson, who defeated Republican Sanford Kahn, said he didn't believe voters  were swayed by the attack on the veteran lawmaker's ability to do the job. "I  feel I'm much better now than I was 10 years ago," Anderson said. "I know more  about the problems."  </P> <P> District 32 covers San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, Lakewood and parts of  Long Beach and Downey.  </P> <P> At a victory celebration at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Waters, 52, told  a crowd of about 300 cheering supporters that she was going to Congress to  continue fighting for the poor and disadvantaged as she had done during her 14  years in the state Assembly.  </P> <P> "I'm going to do what I've always done," she said. "I'm going to be a voice for  the people who sent me."  </P> <P> One of her first priorities, she said, will be passing a civil rights measure.  President Bush recently vetoed the Civil Rights Acts of 1990 and the move to  override his veto failed by one vote.  </P> <P> "I plan to talk with all of (the congressmen) and let them know that we're not  going away on this issue of civil rights," Waters said. "I'm going to fight and  fight and fight to ensure that we pass a civil rights bill."  </P> <P> Waters' Republican opponent, Bill DeWitt, a former South Gate councilman, said  he had no illusions about winning in a district where Democrats outnumber  Republicans 7 to 1. "I went into it with my eyes open," he said. "I knew the  demographics and statistics. I ran because there was an opening and no  Republican had filed. I had fun."  </P> <P> Other Democratic winners included Matthew G. Martinez of Monterey Park, who  defeated businessman Reuben D. Franco in District 30; Mervyn M. Dymally of  Compton, who won handily over former Long Beach councilwoman Eunice N. Sato in  District 31, and Esteban E. Torres of La Puente, who easily fended off a  challenge by John Eastman, an official with a Newport Beach land investment  company.  </P> <P> On the Republican side, David Dreier of La Verne defeated Georgia Houston Webb,  a college admissions official, in District 33, and in District 38, Republican  Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove outdistanced Barbara Jackson, public affairs  director for Planned Parenthood in Santa Ana. Though her name remained on the  ballot, Jackson had dropped out of the race early and did not campaign.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Eric Bailey, Howard Blume, George Hatch and Lee Harris  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

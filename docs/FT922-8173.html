			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury produces the goods SPARKLING results from J. Sainsbury had the company in the unusual position of trying to persuade analysts to be cautious about upgrading their forecasts. The shares were the best performers in the FT-SE Index, climbing 20 to 459p in brisk turnover of 7m. A combination of increased sales, tight cost control and productivity improvements gave the stores group a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, and the dividend payment was lifted from 7.27p to 8.25p. Mr Bill Currie at BZW said: 'These were really outstanding figures. Sales-led growth is the best quality type of results a company can deliver.' He is now forecasting Pounds 735m for 1992-93, a rise of Pounds 15m. Goldman Sachs has improved its forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 730m. Its food retailing analyst Mr Philip Dorgan was equally impressed. 'In this type of trading environment, who else can match a 20 per cent dividend increase,' he asked. Climbing in sympathy were Argyll Group, ahead 5 at 365p, and Tesco, up 6 1/2 at 290 1/2 p. GRE active The return of some very whiskery bid talk lifted Guardian Royal Exchange in early trading. The spark for the talk was speculation that a large line of stock had been bought at a premium to the market price early in the morning. The alleged buyer was Axa Midi, the French insurer, which is casting its eye around at the moment. Apart from a block of 1.4m shares dealt at 163p, however, there were no significant single trades in GRE and an analyst commented: 'As Axa is looking for a life business in the US, I do not see why it should be keen on a UK composite as well.' Sense prevailed and, in spite of a bullish annual statement, the shares, which had been 7 ahead at one stage, closed unchanged at 158p. BAe recommended British Aerospace was boosted by several broker recommendations. The stock strengthened 11 to 366p, with turnover reaching 5.3m, as County NatWest, Smith New Court and long-term bear Strauss Turnbull urged investors to buy the shares. The brokers cited the high 9.5 per cent yield of the shares, the company's improved financial position due to revenue from the Al-Yamamah Saudi defence contract on which BAe is the lead contractor, and the new management at the group. Both Strauss and County advised investors to switch into BAe from Rolls-Royce, which left the latter 3 1/2 lower at 165p on turnover of 5.7m. County reduced its 1993 forecast for Rolls-Royce by Pounds 25m to Pounds 175m and blamed the delay in the recovery of the spares business for the cut. A cash call from BICC was viewed positively by the market, as the electricals group said it would use the money to make acquisitions in the cable industry. BICC intends to raise Pounds 154m by a one-for-five rights issue at 285p per share. The group has underperformed the market in recent months, with many analysts critical of its property development business. Yesterday's response was seen as one of relief that the group was planning to return to its core business. The shares gained 9 to 356p in heavy turnover of 10m. Part of the money - believed to be about Pounds 50m - has been earmarked to buy a US cable business. The remainder is thought to be allocated between a further purchase, this time in Europe, and investment in plant in eastern Europe. A strong two-way pull in Vodafone kept the stock active, the shares firming 2 1/2 to 373 1/2 p. BT fully-paid gained 6 to 353p, Tuesday's buy note from SG Warburg raising sentiment. Hotel group Forte put on 7 to 253p after recent underperformance and also on reflection that the sector may at last have bottomed out after Vaux's figures on Tuesday. In spite of reports of discounting among the holiday groups, Owners Abroad rose 4 to 108 1/2 p, helped by a buy note from County NatWest. Analyst Ms Lisa Gordon reported Owners to be slightly ahead of competitors such as Airtours and Thompson in sales for this year. Airtours shed 5 to 308p. Composite insurers were strong, helped by comment at the Smith New Court morning meeting. Smith insurance analyst Mr Steven Bird argued that companies should only be trading at a discount to net asset value (nav) if their assets are not working for them. Smith particularly likes Sun Alliance, which rose 6 to 330p, and Commercial Union, up 7 before drifting to close just slightly ahead at 501p. A straightforward annual meeting from SmithKline Beecham was not enough to put any pep into the shares. They retreated 13 to 883p in spite of approval for a share split later in the summer. Fisons, languishing under the uncertainty surrounding reapproval for two of its products in the US, slipped 11 to 363p. Amber Day, the discount stores chain, improved 2 to 75p as the company said it had issued a libel writ against the Sunday Express, and explained points raised by the article. The shares, which have been vulnerable to bear raids, had weakened 10 in the first two days of this week. Three acquisitions financed by a Pounds 23.9m rights issue were announced by Transfer Technology Group. The shares put on 2 to 485p. Avon Rubber forged ahead 24 to 459p after reporting interim figures above expectations and an optimistic trading statement. Lucas Industries closed 2 lower at 146p. Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered the commercial paper rating of Lucas in both the UK and US from A1 to A2, citing a reduction in profits.

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK to share its summer with EC CONTINENTAL Europe will get an extra month of summertime under a plan agreed yesterday by the European Commission to ensure all 12 states adjust their clocks in unison. The commission said a large majority of those consulted in government and business wanted the convenience of EC-wide harmonisation of summertime. From 1997 clocks will be changed across the EC at the end of March, and at the end of October. At present continental Europe switches at the end of September, while the UK and Ireland change at the end of October. If the Twelve agree, the end of March start for summertime will come into effect from 1995, with a two-year transition then allowed for adjustments such as the updating of railway timetables. The Commission had been unenthusiastic about the proposal originally, fearing it would invite charges of meddling in national affairs. Brussels had considered ditching the idea as a sign it was bowing to 'subsidiarity', the doctrine that the EC should only act where national measures would be insufficient. A clear majority of member states appear to want the change, however, and are more concerned to rein in the Commission in other areas.</p>

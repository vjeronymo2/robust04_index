Fabbri said the latest charges, that Italian troops  refused to act as escorts for aid workers and stood by as local  gunmen raided a warehouse, were "absolutely unfounded."    Speaking at the inauguration of a Carabinieri investigative  science centre here, Fabbri explained that with the ongoing  withdrawal of Italian troops from Somalia, those left at the  town of Beledweyne were scarcely equipped to do more than defend  themselves and to intervene if aid convoys were attacked. In  any case, he revealed, most of the slim contingent was engaged  in convoy escort duty when the request to provide protection for  civilian personnel was received. As for their alleged inaction  when the warehouse was raided, he said they had only been  informed of the incident the day after it occurred.    The situation at Beledweyne was "promptly" reported to the  UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] command, which decided not to  move in to protect the personnel but to evacuate all members of  nongovernmental bodies from the town the following day, he  pointed out.    The protest from the Save the Children Fund was thus  "without  foundation" and "does not deserve the disproportionate amount of  attention it has received," he said.    As for the recent charges from the Fund (and from the  Norwegian humanitarian organisation Redd Barna) that Italian  troops of the Alpine regiment were using the services of child  prostitutes in Mozambique, Fabbri said the Italian commander  General Silvio Mazzaroli had been told by local police that "no  complaints have been made against our men"; the minister also  stressed that the alleged incidents that have prompted a probe  took place in parts of the country where Italian forces are not  operating. But he added that he had nonetheless requested the  general to make a report on the matter.    Fabbri said he could not find an explanation for "the  unjustified animosity shown by Save the Children towards our  soldiers and the insistence with which they are concentrating on  our Alpine troops, without any solid evidence, a probe that if  anything concerns all the contingents in Mozambique, and which  stems from rumours circulating about episodes that are alleged  to have taken place in the south of the country, where our units  are not operating."</p>

AFRICA BLACK PUPILS TEAR-GASSED  </P> <P> South African police tear-gassed hundreds of black pupils today after a protest  march against racially segregated schools, witnesses said.  </P> <P> They said pupils and teachers marched toward a prestigious whites-only school  in Queenstown, near the Indian Ocean city of East London, as part of a  nationwide defiance campaign against Pretoria's race laws. Police stopped the  march but allowed a small delegation into the school. Tear gas was fired as  marchers dispersed.  </P> <P> In Pretoria, blacks trying to board whites-only buses today were foiled when  drivers closed automatic doors or refused to stop. Organizers said only two  non-white passengers, both ethnic Indians, managed to board. Witnesses said  police arrested three blacks who attempted to board a whites-only bus in the  center of Pretoria.  </P></p>

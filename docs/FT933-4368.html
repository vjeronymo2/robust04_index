			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / People: Glaxo Lord Kingsdown, the former governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton, has picked up his first non-executive directorship. The job is a plum one, too. He is to join the board of Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group from the beginning of October. He joins an illustrious board which includes Lord Howe, the former cabinet minister, the ubiquitous Sir John Cuckney, and Professor Sir Richard Southwood, vice-chancellor of Oxford University.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Observer: Bugger Bognor A sure sign that the silly season has started. Two British seaside resorts are in a flap after discovering their money-spinning Birdman competitions clash next Sunday. To win, entrants must launch themselves off a ramp on the two towns' respective piers and 'fly' under their own power across the sea. Competitors can use wings, skateboards and mountain bikes to assist their take-off. Bognor Regis has hosted the event for the past 21 years and was the site of last year's record flight of 86.4 metres. However, a predator has appeared on Bognor's horizon. Eastbourne, a bigger rival, threatens to swoop off with many of the 160,000 visitors who attend the high point of Bognor's tourist season. Eastbourne's excuse is that its Birdman competition is just one of nearly 50 events taking place in a five-day air festival. 'I think Bognor is quackers to get upset,' says Eastbourne marketing chief Tony Clarke - which is a rather more polite version of the alleged last remarks of King George V, the man who gave Bognor its Regis, on being told that he would soon be well enough to visit his favourite seaside resort again.</p>

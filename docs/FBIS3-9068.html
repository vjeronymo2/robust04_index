The Higher Appeal Court [Gjykata e Kasacionit], the  Albanian judiciary final resort, has had its final say: The 10  former functionaries of the Albanian Workers Party must pay a  total of more than 2 million leks. But this is not all. The  presiding judge, although confirming the charge made by the  Tirana District Court of "creating social inequality by  colluding to create privileges," has softened the sentence of  the Appeal Court by reducing the number of years that those  convicted will spend languishing in prison cells.    Thus the trial of the blockmen has concluded in Tirana, and  with it one of the chapters in the history of communism in  Albania. Judge Zef Nika issued his final verdict in one of the  Higher Appeal Court's halls at 1400 on Thursday [17 March], by  announcing: "A conclusion to the civil case obliging all those  convicted to pay the following sums in compensation to the  Government Services Directorate: Qirjako Mihali, 227,944 leks;  Pali Miska, 213,086 leks; Besnik Bekteshi, 257,733 leks;  Vangjel Cerrava, 128,834 leks; Prokop Murra, 269,439 leks;  Llambi Gegprifti, 195,023 leks; Muho Asllani, 168,357 leks;  Hajredin Celiku, 142,787 leks; Foto Cami, 202,154 leks; and  Lenka Cuko, 283,220 leks." The Higher Appeal Court has also  reduced by a total of 13 years the sentences given by the Appeal  Court to the blockmen. Qirjako Mihali, Foto Cami, and Lenka  Cuko profit most from this, with reductions of two years each.  The others' sentences are reduced by one year each.    The final stage of the blockmen's trial began at 1230 in the  Higher Appeal Court. As the law demands, this time the accused  were not present in court, and only their lawyers faced the  bench of three. The blockmen's defense was heard for the last  time for almost 40 minutes, as their lawyers asked for a  reduction in their sentences, considering them to be  "excessively severe". Prokop Murra's lawyer asked for a review  of the verdicts of the Tirana District Court and of the Appeals  Court that had among other things stripped him of the  decorations and medals he had received. "At least let the  decorations awarded for the period of the National Liberation  War be recognized."    Only a few minutes sufficed to read the accusations and to  come to the end of this vitally important trial. Now the  accusations have also been finally defined. The Higher Appeal  Court has left intact the charge leveled by Tirana District  Court of "creating social inequality by colluding to create  privileges," and has overthrown the Appeal Court's "collusion  for the abuse of office." Judge Nika also left in force the  decision to remove titles and decorations, refusing to make an  exception, as Prokop Murra's defense counsel had requested, for  those awarded for the period of the war.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Confidence vote buoys lira THE LIRA recouped some of its losses yesterday after the government won a vote of confidence in the Italian senate, and the Bank of Italy intervened to support the currency, writes Emma Tucker. A sense of relief on foreign exchange markets that Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, was not going to resign helped push the lira back up to around L961.8 to the D-Mark from a previous close of L964.5. It now appears that Mr Amato will continue to head his government until an election later this year, following April's referendum on changes to the electoral system. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said one of the biggest hurdles facing Italy between now and the election is a possible downgrading of the country's credit ratings. 'This would lead to a flood of selling by US investment houses,' added Mr Jessop. Moody's Investor Services, the US international credit rating agency, has already placed Italy's debt under review. Italy is currently rated by Moody's as Aa3. According to Mr Jessop, a downgrading would prompt heavy selling of Italian debt as many investment houses, particularly in the US, are not allowed to hold debt below the Aa3 rating. Further monetary easing in Germany would help Italy to avoid this situation, he said. If the central bank were able to lower lending rates it would be easier for the government to tighten fiscal policy and improve its standing among international investors. European exchange rate mechanism currencies were relatively stable yesterday, even after three members took advantage of the opportunity offered by the Bundesbank last week to cut interest rates. The Dutch, Belgian and Danish central banks followed suit by reducing their lending rates. The Danish krone stood at DKr3.8360 per D-Mark in late European trade from 3.8335. The Belgian and Dutch currencies were barely changed from the previous close. The peseta suffered a setback in early trading. Some analysts said this reflected growing expectations of a rate cut in Spain. Interest rates in Spain are still at extremely high levels. Yesterday the one-month interbank rate stood at 16 1/2 per cent. With the unemployment rate above 20 per cent, the Spanish authorities are keen to ease monetary conditions, and recent good inflation figures, together with the Bundesbank easing, may have provided the ideal opportunity. However, other factors militate against a rate cut. In particular the Spanish government is nervous that some recent speculation against the escudo could spread to the peseta. The dollar was calm in the absence of any significant economic news, while the pound drifted modestly lower ahead of next week's UK Budget. It closed 3/4 pfennig easier at DM2.3850.</p>

The reason for dismissal was gross  violation of legislation and regulations governing expenditure  of the budget funds, exposed by a special investigation.    In particular, due to lack of control, the ministry has sold  off 17 vehicles to various commercial organizations. The damage  from unauthorized business trips made by the ex-minister and a  number of his subordinates abroad and within Russia is estimated  as very serious. At a modest estimate, financial "slips" made  by Tarmayev cost the taxpayers more that 20 million rubles.    The government of Buryatia has forwarded the evidence of the  investigation to the republic's procuracy.</p>

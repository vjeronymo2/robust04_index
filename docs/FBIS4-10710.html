			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem today admitted that, in his administration, "there  still are officials who commit acts of corruption" and people  who, "through bribes, instigate the corruption of government  officials."    In remarks to Radio La Red of Buenos Aires, Menem added: "We  have done away with a system in which corruption had been  established for many years, that is, the oversized state that we  had. There were state-owned enterprises that had truly become  centers of corruption."    Menem emphasized that his government "had dismantled this  system" and asked entrepreneurs to cooperate and "help in  eliminating these small centers."    The reports on alleged acts of corruption within the  retirees  social services organization (PAMI) [Comprehensive Medical  Assistance Plan] has been described by political observers as  one of the reasons why the ruling Justicialist Party (PJ,  Peronist) lost in the country's capital the Constituent Assembly  elections held on 10 April.    PAMI President Matilde Menendez, the No. 2 candidate on the  PJ ticket for these elections, resigned as a Constituent  Assembly member 48 hours after the elections, but denied that  she was involved in acts of corruption and asked the General  Directorate of Taxation (DGI) to investigate her assets.</p>

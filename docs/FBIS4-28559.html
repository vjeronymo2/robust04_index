			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan voiced regret Friday  over China's underground nuclear test conducted earlier in the  day.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a  statement it is "extremely regrettable" that China went on with  the nuclear experiment despite other nuclear states' moratorium  and when negotiations on a comprehensive test ban treaty is  under way in Geneva.    Japan strongly urges China to never repeat nuclear tests,  the  statement said, and also called on other nuclear countries to  continue refraining from conducting such tests.    The latest nuclear test was the first since last October and  is believed to have been detonated at China's Lop Nor nuclear  testing site in western China.</p>

Khamidov: ``Infection Gathers a </F> Generous Harvest'']    [Text] The incidence of brucellosis among people nearly  tripled in recent years in Osh Oblast. Three hundred sixty-four  cases of infection by this extremely serious ailment, which  often leads to disability, were registered last year. The  especially dangerous infection is gathering its terrible harvest  in Alayskiy, Chon-Alayskiy, Uzgenskiy, Kara-Kuldzhinskiy and  Kara-Suyskiy rayons. The economic damages from brucellosis have  exceeded 2 million rubles. Over 10,000 man-days have been lost.    The main cause of the misfortune is poor sheepherding  practices. Attention to public health and veterinary measures  recently dropped abruptly. Moreover the veterinary service is  experiencing the most acute shortage of everything. According to  data from specialists of the oblast epidemiological station, the  availability of individual equipment protecting against  brucellosis infection and of detergents and disinfectants to  livestock breeders barely covers 30 percent of the need.    Ten annual salaries (one-time assistance) plus the monthly  salary--such is the amount of the pension paid to a shepherd  deemed to be group 1 disabled. But wouldn't it be better to  spend this money to eliminate the cause of the misfortune--to  improve the condition of the herd and upgrade the quality of the  sector's management?</p>

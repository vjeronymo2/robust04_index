REALLY WORKS OVERTIME TO DEFEAT WAKE FOREST  </P> <P> Rodney Monroe scored 26 points, including shots that put North Carolina State  into two of the four overtime periods, as the 20th-ranked Wolfpack outlasted  Wake Forest, 110-103, Saturday in the longest Atlantic Coast Conference game in  history.  </P> <P> North Carolina State, 20-7 overall, 10-4 in the ACC, is assured of at least a  tie for the regular-season championship.

State's Brian Howard tipped in a missed  shot at the 1:02 mark to make it 96-96. The Wolfpack overpowered a tiring Wake  Forest team in the final period as Monroe made the first basket and the final  two free throws. The game lasted 2 hours 39 minutes.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Turbulent conditions keep new issue business on hold TURBULENT conditions following yesterday's cut in US interest rates kept most potential issuers away from the international bond market yesterday. However, syndicate officials predicted a flurry of Eurodollar bond issues next week as borrowers moved to lock into lower dollar interest rates. The next major issuer is likely to be the World Bank, which is preparing to launch its seventh global bond issue. The bank's financial year ended this week, enabling the supra-national lending agency to start a fresh borrowing programme. It has raised Dollars 9.5bn from global bond issues - which can be traded in both domestic and international markets - since the first deal was launched in September 1989. An issue of at least Dollars 1.5bn is expected, although the maturity and pricing of the deal have yet to be decided. Most firms were expecting a five-year issue, priced to yield 5 to 7 basis points over US treasury bonds. However, if the US bond market continues to rally the World Bank may opt for a 10-year issue. One negative factor is the persistent weakness of the US currency on the foreign exchange markets. Yesterday, the dollar stabilised at around DM1.52, from DM1.68 in March, but remains vulnerable to further decline. Some currency analysts are predicting the dollar will fall towards DM1.45 and its lowest ever levels. Elsewhere, Volkswagen launched a DM400m five-year issue wholly underwritten by Commerzbank. The issue continues the recent heavy supply in the Euro D-Mark sector. In the first six months of the year, borrowers raised Dollars 14.8bn equivalent by issuing D-Mark Eurobonds, up from Dollars 9bn in the first half of 1991. Yesterday's issue was considered fair value by other banks but likely to appeal mainly to domestic investors. From an issue price of 100.05, the bonds traded down to 99.50 bid, comfortably inside fees. At this level the bonds yield 42 basis points more than German government paper of the same maturity. Overseas demand for D-Mark bonds remains buoyant, but it is unclear whether Eurobonds will be affected by the introduction of withholding tax in Germany. Yesterday, a cross-party committee met to draw up new proposals for the re-introduction of the tax. Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, had yesterday received 71.8 per cent take-up of its offer to buy back three sterling bond issues, according to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, purchase agent for the transaction. On Wednesday, the company offered to buy back three bond issues: Pounds 75m 12 1/2 per cent bonds maturing 2008; Pounds 75m 11 3/4 per cent bonds maturing 2009/2012; and Pounds 100m 10 1/2 per cent bonds maturing 2009. Each of the issues is trading significantly above par redemption value. The 2008 paper was trading earlier this week at 125 per cent of face value. Investors are offered higher prices under the buy-back offer, since EDF is buying back bonds at a yield spread of 15 basis points over UK government paper. In the secondary market the bonds were trading at a yield spread of 30 to 40 basis points. Banca Commerciale Italiana yesterday launched a Dollars 200m 15-year subordinated issue in the US bond market. The deal, lead-managed by Lehman Brothers, was priced to yield 116 basis points more than US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. The funds count as Tier II, or non-core, capital for the bank under international bank capital adequacy guidelines. BCI is the first Italian institution to tap the Yankee bond market</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Stue": "Guarantees for Vietnam Deals </F> Demanded"]    [Text] Bonn, 7 Feb -- The Federation of German Industry  (BDI) has called on the Federal Government to grant Hermes  guarantees for business with Vietnam. West and east German  companies are currently making intensive efforts for the  Vietnamese market. They are pursuing "remarkable projects"  there, a letter by BDI Main Manager Ludolf von Wartenberg to FRG  Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) of 3  February says. However, the decisive handicap is the lack of  Hermes guarantees. "A loss of the deals would be a considerable  problem for German companies, because in particular decisions  about a specific system are made in infrastructure projects with  the first deal," the letter adds. At the end of 1990 Hermes  guarantees for Vietnam were resumed. However, guarantees are  possible only for short-term individual coverage with loan terms  of not more than 360 days. The BDI sees the lifting of the U.S.  trade embargo against Vietnam as a signal that should make Bonn  guarantee medium- and long-term deals.    However, neither in the Finance Ministry nor in the  Economics  Ministry are there signs that the government might make  concessions to industry. As long as the bilateral rescheduling  agreement with Vietnam is being worked out, a decision is not to  be expected, it was said. The multilateral agreement of the  "Paris Club," which ensures favorable conditions for Vietnam (a  remission of 50 percent of its debts), must still be implemented  by the German Government. There are no reasons to be seen why in  the case of Vietnam one should deviate from the tested rule of  granting new guarantees only after old debts have been settled.  Furthermore, Vietnam is able to pay its debts, it is noted,  referring to the country's high trade surpluses in the past  years.    German imports of 364 million German marks [DM] were set off  by exports to Vietnam of DM78.4 billion in 1992. During the  first three quarters of 1993 German exports amounted to DM145  million, but Vietnam's export surplus still came up to DM215  million. With a view to these figures, government officials  come to the conclusion: "They do not want to pay."</p>

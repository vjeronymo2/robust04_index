			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Observer: Error rate The Treasury has been accused of a few errors of judgment in recent days. Yesterday brought another. At 11.39am, the Treasury used its special page on the Stock Exchange's Topic information service to issue the January official reserves figures. Because of a technical hitch, a sentence from a very old Treasury announcement accidentally crept on to the screen - Minimum Lending Rate will be revised to 7 per cent tomorrow. The announcement was spotted by the Extel news service, and displayed for five minutes before the Bank of England requested the Treasury to remove the offending page.</p>

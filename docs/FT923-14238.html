			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Hurd pledges pragmatism at helm THE European Community must 'attempt less, and accomplish better what it does attempt,' it was told yesterday by its new British presidency. In a speech to the European parliament outlining a low-key and pragmatic UK programme for the next six months, Mr Douglas Hurd, British Foreign Secretarypledged 'energy and determination' in consolidating the EC's nearly finished single market programme and its unfinished negotiations on future financing and in opening up the EC more to the world with agreements on Gatt and Community enlargement. But his rather dour message that Britain would not be in 'the business of ignoring what is difficult, or of chalking up easy agreements' did not go down very well with most MEPs. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the 180-strong Socialist group, the biggest in the Strasbourg assembly, warned that the UK had no right to impose its minimalist view of Europe on others, or to use enlargement as a pretext to weaken integration. The idea of legislative self-restraint is perhaps least appealing to the European Parliament, which feels that even the controversial Maastricht union treaty has failed to give it adequate say in EC law-making. But Mr Hurd said that even where the EC has unquestioned competence, it should think twice before legislating because 'excessive intrusion is one of the accusations most often brought against it'. Britain would work to give subsidiarity, or the principle of minimum interference, concrete shape. Mr Hurd spelt out several priority areas: Britain intended to complete the last - and by definition hardest - 10 per cent of legislation needed to create the EC single market plan. The eventual compromise on future EC financing would have to cater for the needs of - and Maastricht pledges to - poorer states .. 'But the final agreement will need to .. recognise the budgetary pressures faced by all member states.' The UK presidency would persevere with the Gatt talks, because failure 'would confound our hopes for a more prosperous world and run counter to Europe's interests'.</p>

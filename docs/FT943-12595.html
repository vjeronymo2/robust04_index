			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: In praise of a joyful return to the basics - A controversial artist with the exceptional talent of wit Helen Chadwick is exceptional. Her uniqueness does not come from 'Piss Sculptures', the ice artefacts that she moulded by urinating in the Canadian snow, nor from 'Cacao', a monumental fountain of heaving, shimmering, bubbling chocolate, a work as stridently sexual as it is coprophiliac as it is disturbing, which confronts the ears and noses of visitors to Effluvia, her new exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery. Helen Chadwick is exceptional because she is witty. Most contemporary artists have a miserable vision. Their creations either dwell on the seamy underbelly of life or assume a detached, geometrical, aversion to reality. Chadwick rejoices in the basics, using her bodily fluids to give a very personal application to her work and getting great pleasure from the commonplace. One of her compositions at the Serpentine consists of a brilliantly decorative balancing of green marmalade circling lustrous pink Windolene - it has been bought by the Prudential to hang in its staff canteen. The 'Piss Flowers', an army of 12 etched snow scenes, somehow become more exciting when you realise that Chadwick and her male partner strained hard in their creation from start to finish. By happy chance these crepuscular forms also project a sexual image, for, as the catalogue to the show points out, the cavities formed by the urine, 'strong and hot from the woman, diffuse and cooler from the man' create shapes that are inversions of human genitalia, penile from the woman, labial from the man. These are the incidental happenings that, to its supporters, suggest that God smiles on contemporary art. Another serendipic pleasure from Effluvia is the catalogue, which wallows in ponderous, philosophical, gobbledegook to describe what are just wildly imaginative ideas, cleanly and prettily crafted, and immediately accessible. If the results are unfashionably decorative, even uplifting in their primary brightness, Chadwick retains the knack of the avant-garde to shock: Cadbury was quite happy to supply the chocolate for the volcanic heavings of 'Cacao' but shied away from a promotional credit. Chadwick is a serious artist but she does not take her creations too seriously. You can buy 'Cacao', but she has not yet priced it. Make her an offer - she would settle for a smart BMW. The Chadwick show will pack them in at the Serpentine, with attendances that will rival those in the spring of Damien Hirst, who brought in 50,000 ('half the annual attendance at the Courtauld', points out Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine and passionate advocate of the new). It should certainly secure Chadwick a nomination for the 1995 Turner Prize, an honour which strangely eluded Hirst when the 1994 short list was annouced this week. One selector suggested that Hirst's work had failed to progress - seen one mutilated animal, seen them all. Perhaps a mere ability to shock is finally rumbled as a precarious base on which to build a career as an international artist. Whatever the reason the four 1994 finalists - sculptor Antony Gormley, painter Peter Doig (the first worker in paint to be nominated for five years), photographer Willie Doherty, and sculptor-installationist Shirazeh Houshiary - are unexceptional to the point of tedium. It seems the jury wanted to promote artists who had not yet made the critical breakthrough, who needed a helping hand. But there is no glimmer of a 21st-century Master among this quartet. * There might just be at the Business Design Centre in Islington, where graduates from many of the nation's art schools are showing, and selling, their creations. This London showcase is an excellent idea, now firmly established. There are still some London postgraduate schools that hold aloof, but more fool them. Anyone wanting to see where their taxes go, or who wants to buy the next Hockney for Pounds 50, should rush along. Of course these days the brightest art students are in love with the market. There is well-produced promotional literature, with high prices. I enjoyed the show immensely. It takes hours to work the room. Virtually every object - and there are hundreds more objects than paintings - needs deciphering, apart from those that are blatantly sexual or provocatively daring, like the circle of kneeling white figures in which heads are totally lost inside bottoms. In many cases the visitor will miss the point - the large installation piece of vast metre-long knives, cauldrons, and a soundtrack of orgasmic heavy breathing suggested a human about to be turned into dinner, but who knows? Well, perhaps the artist, Lottie Radford, does. Students still seem to be hooked on the ideas of Duchamp, now about a century old, and assorted objects are trailed all over the stands. Art in the traditional sense of drawing, even painting, seems to have been left far behind. But at least the ideas - however banal, repetitive and doleful they may be - seem to be better crafted than in the past. Sam Crook's contemplation on hair, climaxing with a beautiful, suspended entombed plait; Karl Vickers papier-mache cow; and of course, the delights of confectionery, the new art medium. Helen Chadwick has a lot to answer for, but, really, the kids are all right. Anyone seeking the middle ground between the banal and the elitist, who wants to discover where contemporary art for the private collector stands, should pop into Angela Flowers, Silver Place, Soho, gallery during the next week. She has just completed an imaginative fortnight at which daily one established artist - Eileen Cooper, Glynn Williams - has chosen another artist whose work they admire and who they feel deserves a wider airing. Angela Flowers has no control - husbands choose wives, teachers their professors, but the results, comprising one piece by each selected artist and priced between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,500, give an insider's view of art now.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): From battlefields to theme parks TURNING its expertise in military simulation systems into products for the consumer market, Rediffusion Simulation, of Crawley, Sussex, has developed the ultimate in entertainment systems for children and adults alike. The Commander, priced between Pounds 40,000-Pounds 45,000, is intended for the theme park rather than the back garden. It has enough space for two players to sit inside the sleek red machine. Using buttons and joysticks the two players interact with the scene being played out on the graphics screen. By changing the software, under development by LucasArts Entertainment, in California, the Commander can become a spaceship, fighter plane or submarine. Compact disc quality sound intensifies the experience. Rediffusion: UK, 0293 561156.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH MAY PROPOSE DRUG WAR 'RADAR NET'  </P> <P> President Bush is likely to propose at the upcoming drug summit that U.S. ships  be used to provide an offshore "radar net" to help Colombia interdict drug  traffickers, a top aide said today.  </P> <P> National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said the proposal has been "on the  shelf" since Colombian officials balked at news reports that the United States  was considering a naval "blockade" of their ports.  </P> <P> U.S. officials have denied they ever planned a blockade, calling use of the  term unfortunate.  </P> <P> Bush, meanwhile, signed a new U.N. compact to help curb international drug  traffic and urged other nations to do the same, "to join us in working together  to rid the world of this menace, the menace of drugs."  </P> <P> The U.N. Convention Against Illegal Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, adopted in  Vienna in December, 1988, calls upon all nations to make illegal the  production, cultivation and transportation of narcotic and other dangerous  drugs. It also calls for tighter controls of chemicals used in drug production  and sets up guidelines for extraditing drug offenders, seizing drug-tainted  assets and curbing money-laundering.  </P> <P> The Senate ratified the agreement last November. The United States is the fifth  of 76 signatories to the convention to ratify it.  </P> <P> Meantime, Scowcroft told a White House briefing on Thursday's four-nation drug  summit in Cartagena, Colombia, that the United States never planned a naval  blockade but wanted "to provide a radar net and give the Colombians a better  indication" of air traffic that might be involved in drug trading.  </P> <P> "It's an idea we think has merit," Scowcroft said. "I expect it might be  discussed" at the Cartagena meeting among Bush and the presidents of Colombia,  Peru and Bolivia.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to push the use of U.S. military forces where they're not  needed or wanted," Scowcroft said.  </P> <P> He said the radar screen would be confined to equipment on U.S. naval ships  cruising off the coasts of Colombia, and would not entail any land-based  U.S.-manned radar installations.  </P> <P> In a related development, sources said today that the United States has sent  the amphibious assault ship Nassau and its 1,900 Marines off the coast of  Colombia in preparation for Bush's trip to the Andean drug summit.  </P> <P> The Tarawa-class assault ship, accompanied by a destroyer, left its home port  of Norfolk, Va., Feb. 5 "for routine training operations in the South  Atlantic," the U.S. Atlantic Command said. However, defense sources speaking on  condition they not be identified said the Nassau and the destroyer were sent to  waters off Colombia as part of U.S. preparations for Bush's trip Thursday to  Cartagena.  </P> <P> "They're there mainly for logistics purposes. But, of course, if anything  happens, they would be prepared," one defense official said of the Nassau.  </P></p>

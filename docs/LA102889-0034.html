			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PERJURY ON THE WITNESS STAND  </P> <P> It is comforting to see a respected attorney publicly admit what so many have  privately acknowledged. The police do tell lies. Lies of zealousness, lies of  omission, lies of cover-up and lies of commission. Worse, these lies are  condoned, tacitly at least by their supervisors.  </P> <P> An Orange County judge in a traffic court confided that he was aware of the  lies but that was how the game was played. If an officer had reason enough to  lie, there was a reason to presume guilt. So much for justice.  </P> <P> Pause, however, to think of the number of times witnesses are influenced,  coerced and suborned off the stand. Make false identifications, give tainted  testimony and perjure to please power figures, all in the faith and trust we  place in police. By the time they reach the stand they believe what they are  saying well enough to pass any cross-examination. Time indeed for a new look at  the system.  </P> <P> MAX KRIEGER  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

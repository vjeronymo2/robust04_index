			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Rover launches 200 coupe range ROVER GROUP, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is entering the market for sports coupes typified by the Opel/Vauxhall Calibra and Volkswagen Corrado. Its 200 coupe range will be unveiled at the Paris motor show today as the 12 millionth car to be built at Rover's Longbridge plant near Birmingham is coming off the assembly line. This is scheduled to be one of the coupe models, of which the 150mph 'flagship' 220 Turbo version is the fastest production Rover ever built. The coupes, which Rover is building at an initial rate of 360 a week, are being launched into a depressed UK market. Statistics to be released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will confirm that, after a slight recovery in August, new car sales in the UK last month slipped back below the level of a year before. They are expected to show sales for the month of just over 120,000, some 3 per cent to 4 per cent below those of September last year. The Rover coupes, with UK prices of between Pounds 14,495 and Pounds 18,315 including taxes, represent the latest of a string of new model or model derivative launches by Rover under an investment programme currently running at Pounds 200m a year. Next month sees the unveiling at the UK motor show of the RV8, the first MG two-seater sports model since the factory in Abingdon, Oxfordshire that produced the MGB closed a decade ago.</p>

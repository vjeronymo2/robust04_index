			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> SAFE-RIDES HELPS TEENS WHO DRINK  </P> <P> South County Safe-Rides, a student-run program sponsored by Capistrano by the  Sea Hospital in Dana Point, was recently acknowledged by the Orange County  Board of Supervisors for its efforts to reduce teen-age drinking and driving.  </P> <P> Launched two years ago, the program provides safe and confidential rides home  to fellow students in the Dana Point, Laguna Beach and San Clemente areas who  have been drinking or riding with someone who has.  </P> <P> Capistrano by the Sea is the base of operations every Friday and Saturday from  10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Trained adult volunteers oversee the activities of the  students. Students who work on the program also participate in the four-hour  training program directed by the Boy Scouts. It includes CPR training,  emergency procedures, alcohol awareness and communication skills.  </P> <P> Part of the Safe-Rides program includes discouraging drinking. Students on each  high school campus form a club to inform other students and pledge never to  drink and drive.  </P> <P> Students at San Clemente, Dana Hills and St. Margaret's high schools have  distributed wallet cards and key chains with the Safe-Rides slogan, "Don't  Drink &amp; Drive, Call 83-ALIVE."  </P> <P> When school resumes in the fall, South County Safe-Rides will expand to include  all high schools south of Irvine.  </P> <P> "Some editors are failed writers, but so are most writers."  </P> <P>  -- T.S. Eliot (1888-1965)  </P></p>

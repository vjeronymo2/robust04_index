Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to send Turkish troops within the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] forces.    During his meeting with the new commander of the 32,500  UNPROFOR troops in former Yugoslavia, French General Bernard de  Lapresle, Kontic brought up the question of Butrus-Ghali's  readiness to deploy troops from neighbouring Turkey, a former  occupation force in Yugoslavia.    Kontic also underlined the good cooperation between the  Yugoslav Government and UNPROFOR and said that Yugoslavia highly  estimated UNPROFOR's role and its contribution to the prevention  of further destructions, conflicts and suffering in the former  federation, it is a statement of the Federal Information  Ministry notes [sentence as received].    Nevertheless Kontic also pointed to the errors made by some  parts of UNPROFOR, particularly in the republic of Serb Krajina  (RSK) which had also been mentioned by U.N. Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali in his latest report to the U.N. Security Council.    The RSK was declared a U.N. Protected Area in March 1992  according to the plan of the special U.N. envoy for former  Yugoslavia Cyrus Vance, following clashes between the local  Serbs and the Croatian authorities set off by Croatia's forcible  secession from the Yugoslav Federation in mid 1991.    Butrus-Ghali said that in Croatia and the RSK the  conflicting  sides are accusing UNPROFOR of partiality. He exemplified this  by four Croatian incursions into the RSK when the peacekeepers  were unable to protect the Serb civilian population.    Kontic emphasized that the Yugoslav Government urges the  extension of the UNPROFOR mandate in accordance with the Vance  plan until a political settlement is found for the U.N.  Protected Areas.    During the talks he also stressed Yugoslavia's firm  orientation towards a peaceful and political solution to the  crisis in former Yugoslavia.    The meeting between Kontic and De Lapresle was attended by  the new UNPROFOR Director for Civil Affairs, Brazilian Diplomat  Sergio de Mello.</p>

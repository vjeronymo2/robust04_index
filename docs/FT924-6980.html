			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Pakistani troops seal off capital PAKISTANI troops and police moved last night to seal off the capital, Islamabad, to try to stop anti-government protesters from defying a ban on a protest march to parliament today. Barbed wire barricades were erected on main roads into the capital. Cars and buses were stopped and their occupants quizzed. Security was also tightened around foreign diplomatic missions. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, said police had arrested thousands of members of her opposition Pakistan People's party throughout the country. 'The entire country has been converted into a jail,' she said. Ms Bhutto has vowed to lead thousands of supporters on a 18km 'long march' to parliament today to force the government out of office. Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, described this as 'a call for open rebellion'. His government has clamped a two-month ban on public assembly in the capital and Rawalpindi. Ms Bhutto claims Mr Sharif's conservative Islamic government is corrupt and repressive and that it came to power through rigged elections in 1990.</p>

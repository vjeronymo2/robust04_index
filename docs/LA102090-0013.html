			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROS AND CONS ON NOVEMBER BALLOT MEASURES  </P> <P> Your paper is recommending a no vote on Prop. 134, the Nickel-a-Drink  Initiative, because of what you consider flaws in the initiative. After waiting  53 years for the perfect language to increase the tax on wine, how much longer  do you recommend voters wait?  </P> <P> If we wait, the defeat of Prop. 134 will mean that the Los Angeles County Board  of Supervisors will be forced to cut another $22 million from a mental health  system already near collapse. The county trauma system, itself in hemorrhage,  will be denied $54 million in critical funding and local law enforcement will  lose $30 million. Obviously your quest for perfect legislation carries a high  price.  </P> <P> Your concern about a pending recession and the impact of new taxes does not  support your opposition to Prop. 134. The Nickel-a-Drink Initiative will create  over 26,000 new jobs in law enforcement and health services, stimulate $1.66  billion in economic activity and generate $554 million in new personal income.  </P> <P> ROBERT I. REYNOLDS, Campaign Director, Yes on 134 Campaign  </P></p>

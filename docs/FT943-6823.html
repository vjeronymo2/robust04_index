			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hollinger ahead at half-time Hollinger, the holding company of publisher Mr Conrad Black, reported second-quarter profits of CDollars 96.6m (USDollars 70m), or CDollars 1.67 a share, including a CDollars 82m special gain, up from CDollars 10.9m, or 16 cents, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The special gain came from the sale of shares in the Daily Telegraph newspaper in the UK. Excluding this, Hollinger's per share earnings were 25 cents in the latest period. Revenues rose to CDollars 350m from CDollars 228m reflecting acquisition of the Chicago Sun-Times. Hollinger said a 'major contribution' from the Chicago paper more than offset the Telegraph's decline. Half-year net profit was CDollars 109.2m, or CDollars 1.88 a share, up from CDollars 24.7m, or 36 cents, on revenues of CDollars 584m against CDollars 426m. The latest period includes the special gain.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't take risks on UK's good luck There is one criticism that the UK chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, does not deserve: that is for having done and said little since he became chancellor. Considering the sluggish world economy and severe European recession, the British economy is doing remarkably well. In these circumstances, the adage 'Leave well alone' applies. UK output is growing faster than most forecasters expected, but not so fast as to constitute an inflationary threat. And prices and costs are performing almost miraculously. Total demand in money terms is growing very much in line with expectations, but the division between real growth and inflation has turned out better. The base rate cut being pressed by the industrial lobbies would be putting this good fortune gratuitously at risk. It should be saved for possible use later against any excessive sterling appreciation. Of course, the UK recovery is patchy and the sectors that have not benefited have successfully communicated their pessimism to the Bank of England. That is the nature of the early stages of recovery. Not only is the UK economy expanding more quickly than expected. But growth has been export led to a surprising extent, which is not bad in current circumstances. The deterioration in export prospects alleged in the July CBI survey is derived more from fallible business predictions - such as those which lay behind premature talk of 'green shoots' - than from hard questions about orders and deliveries. Gavyn Davies, one of the members of the chancellor's forecasting panel hitherto most worried about the balance of payments, now admits that the export figures are better than he had expected. He says a trade deficit will not be a problem while GDP growth remains strong and inflation is subdued. For, with a high-growth, low-inflation economy, the returns on inward investment in the UK remain high. The rise in manufacturing productivity in 1993 looks like being at least as high as in the best year of the 1980s. Earnings increases in manufacturing, on the other hand, have fallen to 5 per cent per annum - 3 3/4 per cent for the whole economy - a rate which would previously have been unbelievable. As a result, unit labour costs in manufacturing are now actually falling by over 3 per cent per annum, something not seen since the present series began. Yet this has been achieved without anything like as hard a squeeze on profit margins as in the early 1980s. There is now both a less inflationary culture and a more flexible labour market, which may explain why unemployment started to fall much earlier than expected, in contrast to the Continent. The foundations for this success were laid by two highly unpopular policies. First there were Nigel Lawson's interest rate increases in the last 17 months of his chancellorship, which took base rates up to 15 per cent and led a howling media-mob to his country residence. Second there was the Major-Lamont insistence on sticking to ERM membership for two years to September 1992 which led to yet more media hostility. The cumulative effect of both policies was more severe than intended. But they made possible the remarkably successful onslaught on inflation and the present highly competitive cost position, a platform for future growth. As regards supporting these policies in these columns: Je ne regrette rien. The obvious danger to continued success is the European currency turmoil on Britain's doorstep. It is in no one's interest that the remainder of the ERM should break up. The UK was able to get away with a successful devaluation, partly because it was so obviously unplanned and unintended, and partly because the market consensus was that sterling was overvalued. Even so, all it did was to put the seal on cost improvements achieved by years of squeeze and slog. There is no future in each European country trying to steel a march on its neighbours by competitive devaluation. The key to European recovery is a monetary policy in the interests of the whole continent and not one defined by a mechanistic monetarist view of Germany's interest. German monetary policy will undoubtedly be relaxed much more under the pressure of recession. The question is whether the Bundesbank moves fast enough to meet current needs. In the longer run, the removal of obstacles to employing workers, in the shape of hiring, firing and overhead costs - and to the movements of goods across the former Iron Curtain - will be more important for European growth. But decades of perverse policy, which the Christian Democrat parties have been too 'politically correct' to oppose, cannot be reversed in a few weeks. And in any case a single market will require some basis of currency stability, whatever happens to the ERM in the immediate future. Meanwhile, the task is to put the British economy in the best possible shape to weather any European storms and to exploit the European recovery which will one day come. If there is one economic number that a large proportion of the British public knows, it is the Pounds 50bn the government expects to borrow this financial year. City gloomsters have conveniently forgotten that perhaps Pounds 20bn of the deficit goes to capital spending. If they would then subtract another part due to recession, they would be left with something that could be readily financed, even disregarding privatisation receipts. Fiscal puritans, moreover, overlook what Norman Lamont left behind: a cumulative Pounds 10bn per annum of additional tax increases due to come into effect over the next two financial years. Vague knowledge of these is already restraining consumer spending. The UK needs tax increases in the November Budget on top of that as much as it does a hole in the head. The national Budget is not quite the same as a family budget. One of its jobs is to offset or make up for deficiencies or excesses in private spending. On this aspect, the Keynesians were right. They were just over-optimistic about how much demand could be stimulated without running to waste in inflation. The most likely circumstance in which a UK policy change would be required would be an excessive appreciation of sterling. This could come about even without a break-up of the ERM from a fall in the D-Mark which left sterling at a relatively high level. Because of the UK's domestic inflation success there is room for modest further appreciation of sterling, while preserving competitiveness and reinforcing sound money credibility. But, at a sterling rate of somewhere between DM2.60 and DM3, enough would be enough, as there could be a real danger of overseas-led deflation. Exactly where this would come is a judgment depending in part on where the pound is in relation to non-EC currencies. A sterling index approaching anywhere near 90 (compared with 81 recently) would be a danger signal. Faced with a massive sterling appreciation, UK interest rates would have to be cut; and the number of Conservative MPs who believe in ignoring the exchange rate would melt like Alpine snow in spring. A very low interest rate, introduced for external reasons, might have to be offset by a fiscal tightening. But taxes should not be deliberately raised because of a hypothetical combination of circumstances. The best approach to fiscal policy is still the long-term one, focusing on the control of public spending.</p>

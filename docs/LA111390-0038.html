			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> PAT VALENZUELA IS HOSPITALIZED, ATTORNEYS SAY  </P> <P> Jockey Patrick Valenzuela, 28, is hospitalized at an undisclosed location in  San Diego County, according to his attorneys, Sam Silverstein and Nicholas  Micelli.  </P> <P> The attorneys told Hollywood Park stewards that they will offer "clear and  convincing proof" Wednesday that the troubled jockey's problems aren't  drug-related.  </P> <P> However, Hollywood Park steward Thomas Ward said: "They don't even know really  what the proof is going to be. They hope to have the reports Tuesday or early  Wednesday. Our next meeting is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Wednesday."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, who was suspended for 60 days last year after testing positive for  cocaine, called in sick Nov. 3 at Santa Anita, then later that day refused to  take a drug test when asked to by Dr. Neal Fisher.  </P> <P> Why did Valenzuela refuse to take a drug test 10 days ago?  </P> <P> "(Silverstein and Micelli) indicated the reports that they will have will  indicate that (Valenzuela) was free of drugs on the Saturday in question," Ward  said.  </P> <P> All Summer Sale needed to end his six-race losing streak was a return trip to  Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Unsuccessful since winning the Hollywood Turf Express nearly a year ago, the  4-year-old Summer Time Guy gelding led wire-to-wire Monday in the $61,150 Rich  Cream Handicap.  </P> <P> Able to get away with a relatively easy first quarter-mile (22 1/5), the 2-1  favorite had enough left to hold off 25-1 shot One Drink and won by a nose.  Ridden by Alex Solis, who won twice Monday to give him 12 victories in the  first six days of the meeting, Summer Sale covered the six furlongs in 1:07  3/5, a fifth of a second off Zany Tactics' course record.  </P> <P> Navajo Storm, the 3-1 second choice, was third, then came Roman Avie, Sulaymi,  Astro, Splurger, Cove Way and Mister Modesty. Gallant Sailor, Due To The King  and Frost Free were scratched.  </P> <P> Live The Dream, who won the 1989 Hollywood Derby, is the 121-pound highweight  for Sunday's $100,000 Citation Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf.  </P> <P> Scratched from the closing-day Carleton F. Burke Handicap at Oak Tree in favor  of the Citation, Live The Dream has run some of his best races on the Hollywood  Park turf. He was also second in last summer's Sunset Handicap behind Petite  Ile.  </P> <P> Next on the list at 120 pounds are Fly Till Dawn, the upset winner of the  Budweiser International at Laurel last month, and Notorious Pleasure, who won  Oak Tree's Col. F.W. Koester Oct. 7.  </P> <P> Little Brianne, who went wire-to-wire in the Las Palmas Handicap, and  multiple-stakes winner Stylish Star are the 119-pound highweights for  Saturday's feature, the $100,000 Dahlia Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the turf.  </P> <P> Cien Fuegos, a $450,000 yearling purchase, broke his maiden in Monday's sixth  race at Hollywood Park and probably earned himself a spot in the Hollywood  Prevue Breeders' Cup Stakes Nov. 23.  </P> <P> The prep for the $1-million Hollywood Futurity Dec. 9, the Prevue is also  expected to attract General Meeting and Olympio, two other 2-year-olds who were  impressive in their maiden victories.  </P> <P> Trained by Wayne Lukas, Cien Fuegos won by 6 1/2 lengths Monday under Gary  Stevens as the 2-5 favorite. A son of Seattle Slew out of Miss Oceana, he  covered the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:16 3/5. Miss Oceana, who won 11 of her 19  starts, died of complications while giving birth to Cien Fuegos.  </P> <P> Cien Fuegos will be nominated to the Prevue, according to Jeff Lukas, who said,  "We've always thought he's had a lot of potential."  </P></p>

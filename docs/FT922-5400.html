			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Collapse may depress Docklands rents THE PLACING in admini-stration of Canary Wharf may lead to rents in London's Docklands being slashed from an already low level. The task of rival developers in finding tenants will become even more daunting if Canary Wharf, which offers some of the best-quality offices in the UK, is placed on the market at rock-bottom prices. The downward spiral of office rents has particularly dismayed developers who sold buildings to investors with a guaranteed rental income. The deals allowed developers to exploit the Enterprise Zone's 100 per cent capital allowances, but it has left them with heavy liabilities. Rents of about Pounds 20 a sq ft which seemed realistic two years ago are now more than double the going rate. Merely cutting rents is unlikely to generate demand. Few places in the UK offer new, high-quality air-conditioned buildings at such cheap rents - although some fringe City buildings are heading the same way. Developers have been leapfrogging each other in an attempt to set the lowest prices. A shock wave went through the Docklands market last year when Wyn-Ro Investments set the rent at South Quay Plaza, a big building opposite Canary Wharf, at just Pounds 10 a sq ft. Even that has since been undercut: a building at Thames Quay on the Isle of Dogs is being offered for a two-year trial period for no rent. Docklands' reputation as a developers' graveyard should be safe for several years. Pressure is intensifying on the owners of empty property, which accounts for half the 10m sq ft of offices in Docklands. Their costs rose steeply a month ago when the Enterprise Zone's tax breaks ended, forcing developers to pay 'empty rates' of about Pounds 3.50 a sq ft as well as maintenance costs on their empty buildings. Such developers have little hope of finding buyers because unlet property has little value in such an oversupplied market. The receivers to the Euro Trade Centre, a project close to Canary Wharf that failed two weeks ago, said they were considering mothballing the building for up to 10 years. It might take decades to fill the empty property if lettings continue at their present rate. Last year, which was admittedly the lowest point of the recession, 350,000 sq ft of offices were let, according to Savills, the chartered surveyors. Outside Canary Wharf, only 100,000 sq ft was let. Developers cannot take such strain indefinitely. Last month Charter Group had to defer its quarterly payment to investors in PET 8, a trust based on Exchange Tower in the Isle of Dogs, which is less than half let. Desperation has led developers to ever more creative ways to market their projects. For example, the Euro Trade Centre attempted to arrange an office swap with the Estonian government. Meanwhile, the inducements demanded by tenants, such as rent-free periods, have become increasingly onerous for all but the strongest developers. The developers with the most serious difficulties are those which built grandiose buildings in the last few years of the Docklands property boom. The difficulty in persuading large tenants to move to the area will become even more daunting if the Jubilee Line extension is not built. If that happens, the market will have to rely on the small businesses that are providing what little demand there is. The troubles in the office sector are shared by other parts of the property market. The recession and poor infrastructure undermined the prospects of the London Arena, the conference, sporting and concert venue, and of Tobacco Dock, a stylish but isolated shopping centre in Wapping. Poor transport and an over-emphasis on expensive property have also afflicted the housing market, which has seen a 30 per cent fall in prices since its peak in 1987. The depressed state of the market prompted one developer to fill its empty flats by housing the local authority's teaching staff. The housing market, too, has claimed corporate casualties. The most striking example is Sir Terence Conran's Butlers Wharf scheme, which eventually failed as a result of high interest rates and the evaporation of demand after the stock market crash of 1987. The bleakness of Docklands' prospects are offset by the occasional chink of light. Even if the Jubilee Line extension does not go ahead, Docklands will benefit from big transport improvements over the coming year. Lower interest rates and economic recovery should increase demand from tenants. For all that, Canary Wharf was the engine of much of the area's development and its failure has cast a long shadow over the market as a whole. The developers who pioneered the area over the past 10 years are bogged down in the most treacherous property market this century.</p>

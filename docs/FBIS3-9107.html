			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 17 March publish  reports indicating that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] is considering launching a referendum on the expression  of no-confidence in President Kovac.    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 March on page 1, under the  headline "Meciar in Favor of a Fourth Referendum Question,"  carries a 150-word unattributed report on HZDS Chairman Vladimir  Meciar's reaction to the announcement by the Presidential Office  that the HZDS-initiated petition for a referendum failed to  collect the required number of 350,000 "valid" signatures. The  report states: "Vladimir Meciar said yesterday, `I know from  reliable sources that 368,000 valid citizens [as published] had  expressed themselves in favor of the referendum. However,  because they [officials from the legislative department of the  Presidential Office] said that giving the place of residence is  not enough and that the term place of residence must be  understood to include the street and the exact address, they  managed to pull down the number to under 300,000, to only  slightly over 200,000. Such an explanation of the shortage [of  signatures] and termination of the operation amounts to contempt  for the law and the citizen.' Asked what the further course of  action by the HZDS would be, Vladimir Meciar replied, `There  will be another petition, this time with a fourth question.'"    Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 17 March on page 2,  under the headline "Another Referendum in Slovakia?," carries  the following TA SR report: "A referendum in which citizens  ought to express their confidence in President Michal Kovac is  demanded by some HZDS district organizations, a TA SR  correspondent learned from reliable sources. Even though the  HZDS leadership has not yet decided whether and when a  referendum with such contents should be held, petition  committees have already been set up in some districts."</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Markets: So many charges and so little time - Serious Money Disclosure of life insurance commissions next January will give fresh impetus to the investment revolution. Most people reckon that the guys in the tumbrils are the traditional life insurance companies. But that is where the consensus stops. Talk to a unit trust salesman, and he argues that all insurance companies will lose large chunks of their investment-related business. Talk to an insurance man, and the losers will be the other insurance companies, particularly the smaller mutuals. Talk to a mutual, and you get a spiel about their fine traditions. But every marketing department is working overtime to bring out new product blueprints. The challenge for the life companies is to present unacceptably high costs in a palatable way. Initial costs on a typical life policy are around Pounds 600, while running costs nibble away at the investment proceeds thereafter. And most companies reward customers who stay the full term at the expense of early leavers. A recent report from the Office of Fair Trading (Weekend FT, June 18) showed even the best companies do little more than give you your money back if you drop out after five years; the worst knock off up to 50 per cent. Many give you nothing if you leave after year one. Spreading costs and investment returns more evenly - both over the duration of individual policies and between different policyholders - would look fairer. But dividing the cake differently cannot increase its size. Thus, those appetising payments to policyholders who hang on to maturity look set to fall. So do total life insurance sales. And since the big banks are grabbing a larger market share, sales of several of the 101 different life insurance companies are likely to drop sharply. The question is - which ones? And the answer is of more than academic interest to customers. Say, for example, that you have a policy with one of the smaller mutual life companies which are finding new business increasingly elusive. In a sensible world, the life fund would be closed to new business and the money paid out, gradually, to policyholders. In practice, unless the directors all fall on their swords, the company is likely to stagger on for several years with its overheads eating steadily into the profits available for policyholders. Yet, even if you suspect your company might be among the walking wounded, there is little you can do. Cashing in your policy prematurely to avoid a possible future reduction in pay-out merely ensures that you incur the certain penalties of early surrender. Potential customers are in an altogether happier situation. If your choice of investments is getting wider by the day, it seems foolish to make major commitments now. Bide your time: there is little immediate cause to worry that stock markets will race away from you. There are two sides to every revolution. Bank shares tumbled last week as analysts concluded that a lending rate war would hurt the lenders. Life insurance shares had fallen already. But the upheavals in the market may actually benefit customers. Aux armes, citoyens] Should you try to pick your own unit trusts? The problem, as so often, is that you do not have access to the same information as the professional. One interesting point about Fund Research's approach to analysing funds (see page III) is that, although it is based on a quantitative initial screen, more than half the total score comes from qualitative appraisal. True, the analysts collect large numbers of statistics: the basic portfolio spread, number of stocks, portfolio turnover, stock concentration, volatility, standard deviation. And most of these are available in the firm's Unit Trust Analysis Guide. But the analysts themselves are more interested in the explanations for the numbers than the numbers themselves. They are like examiners who prefer essays to multiple choice tests: what matters is not the answer, but how you got there. Armed with the guide, you should have a fair idea of which trusts to avoid. A couple of hours comparing trusts in the same sector will give you some useful yardsticks. If you then send off for the past few years' reports from interesting trusts, you will understand far more than most unitholders. But what you cannot do is quiz the managers. One reason many private investors remain uninformed is that quality information is costly. The guide has an annual sub of Pounds 162 while John Cuthbert, another analyst whose research has been reported in the Weekend FT, is charging Pounds 175 for his study of Japan trusts (tel: 0742-339 618). Yet, neither is expensive if it helps you make better investments. We call them home income plans. The Americans call them reverse mortgages. Both schemes allow elderly home-owners to mortgage their homes to supplement their income. Now, though, Barron's reports from California that some retirees have found their home equity wiped out in five years; others are paying effective annual interest rates of 40 per cent.

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers  on 15 June regarding North Korea's withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "We Can No Longer Let North Korea Take the  Initiative." The editorial stresses that North Korea is not a  rational society and that it has been obstinate in its  unreasonable demands for almost half a century. The editorial  holds the South partially responsible for "spoiling" the North  by accepting their unreasonable demands.    Analyzing the withdrawal from the IAEA as "a strategy to  earn  some more time to develop nuclear weapons and gain better  conditions for negotiations," the editorial warns that it is not  significant that North Korea is holding back its withdrawal from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT, and the government  should stop accepting unreasonable demands.    The editorial concludes that the government should review  how  the United States and Russia ended their nuclear competition  after the cold war and should develop the most practical  strategy to deter war.    CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 4 a 1,200-word article by  reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's stance regarding the  withdrawal. The article reports that the government believes  North Korea's withdrawal is a strong political and psychological  attack aimed at restraining further resolutions and leaving the  U.S.-North Korean talks as the only communications channel.    The article reports that the government plans "to include a  measure in the UN Security Council's sanction resolution that  could cause North Korea substantial damage," while continuing to  persuade China to agree to the UN resolution.    The article continues that the government's policy is that  there is no alternative to sanctions and that the existing  strategy of inducing North Korea to reform and opening up may  change to a strategy of isolating North Korea.    CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,600-word article by the  deputy editor-in-chief entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue and  the Economy." Noting that the ROK people have finally become  aware of the emergency situation and have begun to purchase  emergency materials, the column reports that it is very  fortunate, however, there are no signs of an economic crisis.  The column says that "the ROK people have been well trained for  emergencies for the past 40 years of confrontation between the  North and the South" and even developed an economy amid such a  tense situation. The column recalls that the ROK people were  able to create a "compressed growth" in a short period with an  aim to outdo the North during the Pak Chong-hui regime. The  column stresses that the government should strengthen internal  cohesion and concludes that the best way for the people to repel  a North Korean threat is to concentrate on their daily life  dauntlessly and not show signs of social chaos.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  1,100-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon on the ROK  Government's reaction to North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA.  The article reports that the government does not view the  withdrawal as a new trick, but a part of the existing card,  however, the withdrawal can be interpreted as "North Korea's  determination that a UN Security Council sanction resolution  will be followed by North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT." The  article reports that a government official analyzes that the  withdrawal only makes China and Russia less inclined to oppose  sanctions.    The article says that the government may expedite the  adoption of a UN sanction resolution early next week if North  Korea does not change its attitude after former U.S. President  Carter's visit to the North. The article reports that the  government is also considering economic consequences and doing  its utmost to maintain stability through impeccable security  measures against North Korea's armed provocation. The article  concludes by quoting a government official: "Our side, as well  as North Korea and the international community, are all in a  tense confrontation fearing that one step back will make one  lose the initiative forever."    The independent moderate MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN, specializing  in economic topics, publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial  entitled "Tension of the North Korean Nuclear Issue and  Preparedness." The editorial analyzes that North Korea withdrew  from the IAEA merely to avoid losing face caused by the IAEA  resolution and urges readers not to be affected by North Korea's  nuclear game. The editorial stresses that the ROK people should  not respond to North Korea's threats, such as their remarks  about regarding sanctions as a declaration of war, and maintain  economic activities unswervingly.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a  1,000-word article by Yi Sung-chul on the government's reaction  to North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from the IAEA.  The article reports the government "will continuously push  ahead with its original policy for sanctions against North Korea  by the UN Security Council" because it believes North Korea's  declaration on withdrawal from the IAEA "does not have any  practical meaning, but has political and symbolic meaning." The  article continues: "The government believes the nuclear issue  has not changed at all in essence since North Korea is still  obligated to accept inspections as a signatory of the NPT  despite its declaration of withdrawal from the IAEA."    The article quotes a ranking government official as saying  that the declaration by North Korea is "at an expected level  [yejongdoen sujun] following the adoption of the UN Security  Council resolution" and is regarded as "a bluff to counter the  UN Security Council's moves toward sanctions" rather than "a new  card."    The article also reports that the government's adherence to  its original position on sanctions shows its will to take the  lead in South-North relations in the adverse situation following  North Korea's replacement of fuel rods.    Quoting a government official's remarks, the article notes:  "The declaration by North Korea gave us an advantage in  persuading countries like China, which have declined to agree to  sanctions against North Korea."    The article reports that the government considers adding  "stronger terms" [kanggyong naeyong] in the UN Security Council  draft resolution in response to North Korea's follow-up measure  and that the government will convey "the international  community's mood" and the fact that "there is a limit to the  flexibility of the United States and the ROK" through former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 in its "Today  and Tomorrow" column a 1,000-word article by senior reporter  Choe Maeng- ho entitled "The `Level of Crisis' on the Korean  Peninsula." The article remarks on the lack of attention to  security on the part of the people because they think "North  Korea cannot afford to carry out a war" and believe "it will not  provoke a war unless the United States attacks first." Noting  that the purchase of emergency food supplies does not seem to be  motivated by serious anxiety, the article ascribes the people's  "lack of security sense" to the feeling "there would be no  particular way out even if a war takes place."    After touching on the government's "inconsistent policy on  North Korea" and stressing that "the situation regarding the  nuclear issue is certainly developing into a crisis," the  article concludes by urging the government and people to make  every effort to "avoid the possible demise of both South and  North Korea."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "North Korea's Reckless Run to Withdrawal  From the IAEA." The editorial denounces North Korea's withdrawal  from the agency as "a serious challenge and an illicit act that  has devastated the international order," and warned against  North Korea's aim to "bargain over the nuclear inspection issue  only with the United States, excluding the IAEA." The editorial  stresses the need to "sternly proceed with imposing pressure and  UN Security Council gradual sanctions on North Korea in close  cooperation among the ROK, the United States, and Japan until  North Korea retreats from its withdrawal from the IAEA and  allows an overall nuclear inspection" [chonmyon haek sachal].  The editorial also emphasizes that "exclusive negotiations  between the United States and North Korea should be held after  North Korea returns to the IAEA and allows the inspection."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a  900-word  editorial entitled "North Korea's Adventurous Choice" analyzing  the reason for North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA. The  editorial analyzes this action by North Korea as "a reaction  against the agency's repeated acts, unfavorable to North Korea,  following the United States" and as an expression of its  "determination to be separated from the IAEA, which has  ceaselessly raised new issues even after North Korea allowed  nuclear inspections." Pointing out the possibility that "the  keen confrontation between North Korea's strong strategy and the  U.S. intent to show its stern resolution to punish the North  will further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula,"  the editorial stresses the need to make efforts to find a way  "from confrontation to dialogue." The editorial also comments  on the "need to review closely the reason for North Korea  remaining in the NPT, after withdrawing from the IAEA."</p>

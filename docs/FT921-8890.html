			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Observer: Tale of two sisters The contrast between the management styles of BP and Royal Dutch Shell can rarely have been sharper than now. Yesterday saw Royal Dutch Shell quietly reshuffle its top management team, with Sir Peter Holmes being annointed to take over from Lo van Wachem as top dog. Meanwhile over at BP a terrible set of figures underlines the questions already being asked about the performance of chairman Bob Horton. Horton gave a slick presentation, and if there are political machinations going on, they can only be guessed at. Since he has only been in the job a couple of years there is no need for there to be a clear successor yet. On the other hand, his apparent unpopularity with segments of his own staff and with a swatch of the investment community, does raise the doubt. The problem is that unlike Shell, where Cornelius Herkstroter is already being groomed to take over from Sir Peter, BP has no obvious successor to Horton. But while Royal Dutch Shell's conservative and bureaucratic management style has its attractions, it also has its disadvantages. Sadly for Holmes, who hasn't much time to make his mark on what is one of the fatter of the old seven sisters, even the strongest punches can be smothered by red tape.</p>

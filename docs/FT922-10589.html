			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (6): The scientific approach  -The Japanese manufacturer, Pioneer, applied rigorous economic criteria in its search for a European production location THE DECISION by Pioneer Electronic, the hi-fi manufacturer, to invest Pounds 20m in a new factory at Wakefield, West Yorkshire, provides an insight into the scientific approach to international industrial location. A recent Institute of Directors survey in the UK found some companies choosing a relocation site on the basis of golf club waiting lists and the number of swans on a river: the Japanese approach is slightly different. The story of Pioneer's move to Wakefield is one of careful strategic planning providing the corporation's main board with a series of viable options. But refreshingly the final choice may well have hinged on human and cultural factors. Pioneer wanted to be in Europe ahead of the 1992 Single European Market. In many ways their investment in factories like Wakefield was risk capital against the possibility that the EC would construct trade barriers around 'Fortress Europe.' Pioneer also wanted to expand in the midst of their market. For five years from the mid-1980s, Pioneer sent out an international study team to look at European options. Enquiries to the UK for potential sites would have been fielded by the Investment in Britain Bureau and the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Agency. A second study team followed in 1989 to look at options in Yorkshire and Humberside and the UK's only other continental rival: Barcelona. Mr Zenkichi Igarashi, managing director of Pioneer Electronics Technology (UK), explains the final choice: 'We chose Wakefield because of its location, communications and workforce. If you draw a circle of a 300 km radius around Wakefield, all our component suppliers in Scotland, Wales, and the Midlands fall within that circle. 'Our Wakefield site is on the M62, half way between the interchanges with the M1 and the A1, and so our suppliers can reach us in short time periods and we can export our products through the Humber ports easily. 'The site is also adjacent to Port Wakefield and we hope to use the rail freight terminal to export our finished goods through the Channel tunnel. We also have good air links to Europe through Leeds/Bradford Airport and can reach London in two hours by train.' Wakefield's accessibility to suppliers appears to have been decisive as Pioneer's goods must be 40 per cent value-added within the EC to count as 'Made in Europe.' The labour market factor also meant that Pioneer was looking for a location away from competing Japanese inward investors: Wakefield's hinterland has few competitors for Pioneer's light engineering skills. No financial inducements were offered to Pioneer to come to Wakefield, but the role played by the metropolitan district council certainly helped force Barcelona into second place. They provided an information answer-service for Pioneer which always beat a 24-hour deadline. Ms Amanda Spalding, acting deputy chief economic development officer, says that on one occasion she rushed to Leeds with information on prevailing winds at the Wakefield site and 'gatecrashed' a meeting of the Pioneer study team. Interestingly, Japanese companies often require extensive written submissions which are thoroughly double-checked - while US companies often ask for condensed options. Once inside the meeting, she had a unique glimpse of 'consensus' decision-making as the team discussed, in Japanese, the various Yorkshire and Humberside sites and then voted on various aspects of them: location, workforce and so on. They then flew to Barcelona. Having discovered that the group was staying in the Hotel Sofia (by faxing all hotels of that name in the region]), Wakefield's team persisted in providing prompt information faxed to Spain. Once the final decision was made by the main board in Tokyo, it was swiftly converted into a major investment with room for expansion. The Five Towns Resource and Teaching Centre was made available for the project group. A company was formed in May 1990, the building occupied (on a Green Belt site) on June 3, 1991, and production began on August 12 1991. In retrospect, the company admits that purely economic locational factors were bolstered by cultural ones: English is Japan's second language and clearly this factor also helped edge Barcelona from the field. An Anglo-Japanese Saturday School has been set up in Leeds for the children of relocated executives and managers and an Anglo-Japanese Society is being set up with the help of the YHDA. Of the 240 people working at the Wakefield site, only seven are from Japan: two directors and five managers. All were offered relocation packages and most brought their families with them to West Yorkshire. Next month the workforce should jump a further 60 and the final target is 700. Production thresholds have been met and the workforce has proved a success with the new Japanese managers. Senior staff recruited in Yorkshire were taken to Japan for two training courses. Communications have proved excellent although the current public inquiry into the opening of Port Wakefield, close to the Pioneer site, has thrown a shadow over links with the Channel tunnel. The only problem appears to be the factories' image of growth and profitability which has focussed interest locally on the first round of wage negotiations at the Wakefield plant where a single-union deal was struck with the EETPU electricians union after a 'beauty contest,' including four other unions. The company would point out that if low wages had been a crucial location factor, they would have chosen Barcelona. The recession has obviously tempered Wakefield's short-term potential for expansion, but the site offers radical growth opportunities with just 100,000 square feet of production area on 30 acres. Production now includes tuners, CD players, and mini-systems. Stereo radio tuners production was relocated to Wakefield from Belgium. Pioneer applied rigorous economic criteria to their search for a European site tempered, when the choice was narrowed to two, by cultural and human factors. The economist Losch said: 'The question of the best location is far more dignified than determination of the actual one.' In Pioneer's case the two were nearly identitcal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Balyutskiy: "`Return Salvo' </F> for Setback in NATO"]    [Text] Vilnius -- Addressing a press conference devoted to  the Vilnius meeting of leaders of delegations from Estonia,  Lithuania, and Latvia to the Council of Europe (the first two  states are members, Latvia has guest status), Lithuanian  representative A. Gritsyus stated that Lithuania will vote  against Russia's admission to that international organization.  According to its leader Ye. Kelam, the Estonian delegation will  adhere to the same position.    As we know, some time ago Russia was refused admission to  the  Council of Europe [CE] because at the time it lacked a  Constitution and democratically elected parliament.    "Yes, today Russia has a Constitution and a parliament. But  they are only part of the requirements which that state must  fulfill," A. Gritsyus believes. In his opinion, before being  admitted to the Council of Europe Russia must also resolve its  national and ethnic problems. In addition one of the new  conditions set by the Baltic states is the demand that it  publish a statement officially denouncing the USSR's aggression  against Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in 1940.    The unacceptability of this latter demand for Russia -- as  indeed, for any other state -- is obvious. Poland, for  instance, categorically refused to include a point denouncing  its seizure of Vilnius and the Vilnius district in 1920 in the  treaty on friendship and cooperation between Poland and  Lithuania, which was thus not adopted for that reason. Polish  politicians believe that this point could be interpreted too  freely. Does the repetition of a similar demand but this time  against Russia not signify a kind of "return salvo" in response  to Lithuania's unsuccessful attempt to join NATO, which Moscow  categorically opposed?    The aim of these demarches is clear. It is to isolate Russia  from the all-European peace process and to prevent it from  taking its lawful place in the Council of Europe and other  European structures. In the opinion of the Baltic politicians,  the opposite course of events would, albeit obliquely,  legitimize Russia's right to the role of guarantor of stability  in East Europe.</p>

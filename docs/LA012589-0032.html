			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BURKE HOT, DEVILS TIE ISLANDERS  </P> <P> The New York Islanders, who won the tough Patrick Division last season, have  been the worst team in the National Hockey League this season, but they had won  3 games in a row after winning just 12 of their first 43.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for them, there's nothing like good goaltending to slow a team on  a roll.  </P> <P> Goalie Sean Burke, who still qualifies as a rookie, kept the New Jersey Devils  from falling apart Tuesday night at Uniondale, N.Y., and when Brendan Shanahan  scored in the third period, the Devils earned a 2-2 tie with the Islanders.  </P> <P> Burke, not yet 22, played brilliantly in the stretch last season to put the  Devils into the playoffs. After a slow start this season, he is playing well  once again.  </P> <P> The youngster stopped 38 shots, many of them spectacular saves. The Islanders  built a 2-0 lead, but in the last 38 minutes, including overtime, they could  not beat Burke.  </P> <P> Kelly Hrudey played well in the nets for the Islanders, but it was Burke's  performance that had everyone talking.  </P> <P> "The way Burke was playing tonight," Hrudey said, "I knew I had to be on my  toes just to keep us from losing. We had more chances to score, but Burke  really stood his ground, especially in the second and third periods."  </P> <P> Burke was at his best when the Islanders were working on the power play. Seven  times they had the manpower advantage, but not once did they score.  </P> <P> The tie continued the Devils' frustration at the Nassau Coliseum. Since the  team's inception as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974, the franchise is only  1-36-4 at Uniondale.  </P> <P> Their only victory in the Coliseum was on Dec. 11, 1984. Since then, they are  0-12-2.  </P> <P> The Devils made good on 1 of 6 power-play opportunities.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Vancouver 2 -- Troy Murray broke a 1-1 tie by scoring on a breakaway  late in the second period, and newly acquired goaltender Alain Chevrier played  a strong game in the Blackhawks' win at Vancouver, Canada.  </P> <P> The victory was only the sixth for Chicago in 27 road games this season, but it  was the second road win since the acquisition of Chevrier from the Winnipeg  Jets last week.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Development of the Tumen River Must Be </F> Reconsidered"]    [Text] According to a recent foreign report, the North  Korean authorities have formulated specific plans to establish a  free trade zone in the northeastern area of their territory by  inviting the Chinese enterprises, and ROK enterprises in China,  to participate in the Tumen River development project, around  the areas of Chongjin and Najin.    North Korea has reportedly planned to invite a Chinese  delegation from Jilin Province, and businessmen of the ROK  enterprises in China, to Pyongyang to discuss the Tumen River  development project under the auspices of the Chongjin city  development committee. It will hold another meeting with them in  Beijing around the end of this month to discuss specific plans  for joint cooperation regarding the project.    It has not been learned if participants in the meeting would  form an international cooperative system to promote their joint  cooperation. According to some reports, however, North Korea  and China have already exchanged a protocol regarding the Tumen  River project.    This project will likely be carried out in the following  way:  North Korea and China will be a key factor in carrying out the  project, while welcoming ROK capital to it. This is the way  North Korea has so far planned to implement the project.    As we have mentioned over and over again, ROK enterprises  should consult with the government about economic cooperation  with North Korea, whether it is carried out in the form of the  Tumen development project or the construction of a plant in the  Nampo area. We stress once again that no civilian-level economic  cooperation without the government's participation should be  conducted.    Also, our government and enterprises should not forget, even  for a moment, that the North Korean system is an unreasonable  and extreme communist regime, not found anywhere else in modern  history. For over half a century, there have been no changes in  the Kim Il- song dictatorial system. At the same time, the  so-called chuche idea--which indicates that "Korea is one," and  that "Korea is under the bosom and grace of Kim Il-song and Kim  Chong-il"--is an absolute idea presently worshiped by all North  Korea people throughout the country. In other words, if a South  Korean businessman builds a plant in North Korea, this can be  theoretically done under the guidance and grace of Kim Il-song  and Kim Chong-il.    There are, however, some important points in carrying out  the  Tumen River development project. That is, by participating in  it, we can lead North Korea to go from a closed society to an  open one; we can form our business connections [yongogwon] on  the area of the Tumen River in the initial stage of its  development; and seek the balanced development of our land by  promoting development in the most backward area of the country  in preparation for the days after national reunification. Also,  it is internationally very significant to build the free trade  zone in the northeastern area because there is no multilateral  cooperative system there.    This project must not be, however, carried out as intended  by  North Korea. North Korea's hidden intention is to make foreign  currency quickly, while trying to become the master of the  northeast by inviting a considerable amount of the foreign  capital, including from ROK enterprises, to the project. This  is why the North Korean authorities are so interested. By  properly meeting China's persistent desire to advance into Korea  through the East Sea [Sea of Japan], North Korea has  appropriately formulated plans to lead the ROK enterprises to  participate in the Tumen project.    When the Tumen River development project was first  discussed,  the six countries surrounding the area showed interest and tried  to participate in it. They are South Korea, North Korea, China,  Russia, Mongolia, and Japan. However, only North Korea and  China are now interested in the project because North Korea  refuses to open its doors.    We hope that the government and our enterprises should not  be  entangled in North Korea's plot. They must not invest even a  penny unless North Korea earnestly asks for it and make efforts  for negotiations with South Korea. In particular, I would like  to call on our businessmen to keep this in mind and be prudent  in dealing with North Korea.</p>

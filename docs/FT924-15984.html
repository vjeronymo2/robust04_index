			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Scheme to speed debt payments contains flaws Sir, The suggestions of Mr Martin Simons ('Far reaching consequences of paying promptly', Letters, September 26) for speeding debtor payments are fine in theory but are unworkable in practice. Mr Simons refers to 'agreed terms' but in practice terms are rarely agreed. An invoice endorsement of '21 days nett' is not binding on the purchaser unless specifically agreed to. Parties have opposing interests: the seller to receive payment as early as possible; the buyer to pay as late as possible. Mr Simons' suggestion of a rolling 35-day settlement cycle is impractical. Most businesses of any size use calendar monthly accounting, and make a purchase ledger payments run at the following month-end. Some businesses are dilatory at sending their invoices in, yet expect prompt payment. Charging interest on overdue accounts is fraught. Many large companies would resist paying it, and the danger of soured relations is one which many small suppliers may not care to chance.

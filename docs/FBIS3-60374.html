Indeed, the Council approved conclusions by which it:    -- recalls the conclusions of the Brussels Summit which  admits the possibility of "fiscal measures which could, inter  alia, relate to the environment" (to compensate for the drop in  social contributions);    -- recalls that the Ecofin Council of 13 December invited  the  ad hoc group to continue examining the project of a CO2/Energy  tax;    -- declares that, in this context and in the light of the  Community's commitment to stabilize CO2 emissions in the terms  agreed by the joint Energy/Environment Council of 29 October  1990, it is necessary to create the mix of additional various  instruments at EC level and to conclude ongoing work taking  account of the Commission's proposal on energy/CO2 taxation as  soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of 1994;    -- requests the Commission to take, as soon as possible, the  necessary decisions on the methodologies to be used for the  national reports in the framework of the Council Decision of 24  June 1993 establishing a monitoring mechanism in order to have a  good basis for analyzing national efforts. At the same time, the  Commission is requested to present an evaluation on the progress  made towards reaching the Community's CO2 stabilization target;    -- requests the Commission to report on the national  instruments, in particular economic and fiscal instruments,  which have been implemented or which will be implemented shortly  by the Member States to attain the aim of stabilization;    -- requests the Commission to prepare and submit to the next  Council meeting a plan showing how the Community and its Member  States will be able to attain the goal of stabilizing CO2  emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000; In this context, the  Council agrees to adopt the decision relating to the Community's  concluding the Convention on climate change, recognizing the  importance of the Community (and its Member States) ratifying  this Convention before it comes into force so as to the  fulfilment of the commitment relating to the limitation of CO2  emissions through action by the Community and its Member States,  within their respective competencies.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Letter: Monarchy - political dimensions of a show that will run and run Sir, David Cannadine's article about the Royal dilemma rightly stressed constitutional implications, but was incomplete. Every country, including Britain, needs a head of state. Does anyone seriously expect a Conservative prime minister to recommend the replacement of the monarchy by a president? Or can anyone imagine John Smith as prime minister putting such a proposal to the Commons? Notwithstanding all the family problems, this show will run and run.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 4 June Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] On 4 June, Defense Agency [DA] sources commented on  reports that the DPRK (North Korea) plans to conduct a ballistic  missile-launching test, and said according to analysis conducted  by the DA and the Self-Defense Forces, the possibility of the  DPRK conducting the test is less than 50 percent. It was also  learned that, since May 1993, the DPRK has conducted two or  three preparations for ballistic missile test launches, but did  not actually conduct the tests.    According to DA officials, the ballistic missile the DPRK  wants to test-fire is thought to be the Nodong-1, which has a  firing range of about 1,000 km. The official said it is highly  likely that the missile is the same type as the one fired at the  end of May last year.    The officials noted: 1) it has been confirmed that the DPRK  has been prepared to test-fire Nodong missiles two to three  times since the time of the test in May of last year, but did  not actually perform the tests; and 2) though, no doubt, the  DPRK is getting ready for another test launching, it will  probably not go so far as to carry it out now, when tensions are  high over the issue of that country going ahead with changing  nuclear reactor fuel rods.</p>

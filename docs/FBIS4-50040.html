			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Pu (5135 3877)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Air Force has  scored marked achievements in training capable pilots. A few  hundred pilots who are capable of meeting the challenge of air  combat, who understand foreign languages, and who know how to  operate computers are gradually becoming the Air Force's  backbone force for striding from this to the next century.    According to a briefing by an Air Force department, the  development of modern aviation technology and the improvement in  the performance of weapons and equipment demand that pilots be  very capable. For this reason, the people's Air Force added  mathematics in pilot colleges. In addition, it organized  English classes for pilots in 1983 and later added computer  science and high-technology subjects, and all pilots are  required to attend these classes on a rotational basis. At  present, a few hundred pilots are able to understand, speak,  read, write, and translate English; they have also mastered  computer principles, computer programming, and computer  operation and utilization. Through self-study, a number of  pilots have mastered Russian and other languages, and a marked  change in their level of knowledge has taken place.    Their advantages are clearly demonstrated in their flight  training and contacts with foreign countries. According to a  briefing, these pilots are more able to adapt to and accept new  ways of flight training, and they especially do better in  test-flying new-model aircraft and undergoing difficult training  programs. Some pilots have even raised their training  efficiency by 100 percent. In carrying out their flying mission  to protect foreign guests, their outstanding performance has won  many praises from foreign pilots and experts. An Air Force  source said the increase in the number of capable pilots has  great significance for raising the combat capability of the Air  Force and for expanding contacts with foreign countries.</p>

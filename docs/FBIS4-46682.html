			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Smirnova, candidate of economic sciences </F> and chief researcher at the Central Economic Scientific Research  Institute of the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics: "The  Government Is Preparing Pension Reform: An Increase in the  Minimum Pension Is for the Present Decreasing the Maximum  Pension"]    [Text]  <H5>  Protection </H5>   Pension reform has already been talked about for a long time  in circles that have a direct bearing on its implementation.  Pensioners have turned out to be one of the most socially  unprotected categories of the population. Even though people who  have worked honestly all their lives have a right to count on  the support of the state and a fitting old age.    Pension reform is still at the revision stage, but it  appears  that its main outlines have already been drawn. In particular,  it is most likely that the procedure for recalculation of the  size of pensions in connection with the increase in prices for  consumer goods and services that has been worked out to the  present time will be retained. Periodically (for example, once a  quarter), the old age pensions computed by the social insurance  organs will be increased either by a specific sum (called  "compensation"), or by a specific percentage ("indexation").    But two questions arise: Which variant is better? And will  the increased pension cover the increase in prices? Let us try  to analyze this. Until November 1993 the recalculation of  pensions was conducted by means of indexation of its previously  computed quantity in accordance with the price increase index.  If in the quarter prices grew by a factor of 1.9, the pension  was correspondingly increased by a factor of 1.9; its purchasing  power did not change, i.e., the quantity of goods and services a  pensioner could pay for remained unchanged.    In November, instead of the regular indexation of pensions  the government introduced "compensation" for price increases.  All pensions were increased by one and the same figure--11,700  rubles [R]. This procedure was repeated in February 1994. Every  pensioner received a pension addition of R8,000. The thesis of  social justice was advanced as the main argument for the  transition to this form, inasmuch as it guaranteed a greater  degree of social support of pensioners who receive the minimum  pension and who are in the most difficult material situation.    As a matter of fact, the change in the compensation method  of  recalculating pensions was obviously made for the purpose of  saving the monetary resources of the state budget and the  Pension Fund (which turned out to be practically empty at the  end of October), and had little to do with the principle of  social justice.    The introduction of additions to pensions did not ensure  compensation for price increases even at its minimum size,  although theoretically they were supposed to be calculated in a  percentage term precisely from the minimum pension. The first  compensation sum was determined precisely this way: For the  August-October period prices increased by a factor of 1.8, or  180 percent. The compensation amount was R11,700 (80 percent of  the minimum pension of R14,620), and accordingly the minimum sum  of payments totaled R26,320 (more than the minimum pension by a  factor of 1.8). However, over November-January, with a price  increase of a factor of 1.6, the minimum pension was increased  by a factor of 1.3. This occurred because the February  compensation (R8,000) was established not on the actual minimum  pension (R26,320) but based on its official value, which  remained unchanged. It was this figure that was indexed in  accordance with the increase in prices. But the purchasing power  of the remaining part of the pension was correspondingly  decreased by a factor of 1.6.    The change in the procedure for revising pensions was  reflected in a substantially more negative way on pensioners who  had a pension that was higher than the minimum, since an even  lesser part of the pension was indexed for them. Thus, for  example, the purchasing power of a maximum old age pension (the  size of which in August 1993 was R52,632, given a length of  service of 40 years and more, and in February 1994--R72,332) was  reduced by more than a factor of two (with an increase in prices  for this period of a factor of 2.9, the pension increased by a  factor of 1.37).    If the indexation procedure for revising pensions had been  maintained, in February 1994 the minimum pension would have  totaled R42,100 instead of R34,320 (14,620 + 11,700 + 8,000),  and the maximum--R153,000, which is comparable to the average  wage in February. However, a 1:2 ratio of maximum old age  pension to average wage cannot be considered satisfactory,  taking into account the fact that the question concerns  specifically the maximum value of a pension, whose reference  point should be the 75 percent level of the wage that a worker  receives. As a result of the use of the compensation method, a  substantial reduction occurred in the ratio between the maximum  and minimum old age pension from 3.6:1 to 2.1:1, which reduced  the importance of work length of service and professional  qualifications and appropriately aroused the indignation of  pensioners who had worked all their lives.    In May the government once again returned to the indexation  method of recalculating pensions, increasing previously  calculated pensions by a factor of 1.3 (according to the  statistics of the State Committee for Statistics of the Russian  Federation, prices increased this much in the February-May  period). Thus, the minimum pension was R19,000 (14,620 x 1.3),  which was also fixed as the official minimum. Added to this is  the previously introduced compensation of R19,700, giving a  total of R38,700. It would seem that this time the increase in  computed pensions covered the increase in prices, but it turns  out that by far not all pensioners can be happy.    In accordance with pension legislation in effect, old age  pensions cannot exceed three of its minimum values. And  although the minimum pension in May amounts to R38,700, the  official minimum of R19,000 is used for calculating the  "ceiling." But the "ceiling" itself in May is being determined  in the following way: Three minimum pensions (R19,000 x 3 =  R57,000) plus compensation (R19,700)--for a total of R76,700.  Additional percentages for length of service can increase the  first constituted maximum pension up to R68,400 (given a length  of service of 40 years and more). If, in addition, a person was  born before 1931, it is considered that he worked during the  war, and he can count on another 50 percent of the minimum  pension; i.e., R9,500. Totaling the enumerated figures, we get  R97,600.    Thus, those whose pensions, calculated before May 1994, were  more than R75,077 (taking all additions into account) will not  be able to use the results of the May indexation of pensions in  full measure, and the purchasing power of their pensions will be  reduced once more. Naturally there is no question of any kind of  compensation for previous debts to pensioners.    In April 1994 a revision was started of the base for  calculating pensions for those formulated before 1993, with an  increase of a factor of 1.8. This measure is directed at  correcting errors committed in establishing the coefficients for  "updating" past earnings. Undoubtedly, it will make it possible  to improve the material situation of a rather numerous category  of pensioners; however, in this case as well, those whose  pension was less (did not exceed R27,000) will end up winning  most. For the others, the limiter on increasing the scale of  pensions will be the very same old age pension "ceiling," and  the increase in the base of the calculation by a factor of 1.8  will not lead to a corresponding increase in pensions.    Everything that has been said makes it possible to come to  the conclusion that the measures being undertaken by the  government for regulating pensions, while ensuring a certain  protection of the incomes of pensioners from inflation, do not  fully compensate for price increases. The more pension a person  receives, the less compensation, consequently a leveling of  pensions is occurring regardless of preceding work contribution.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK INDEX futures traded in a very tight range of about 10 points, with the withdrawal of the big institutions to the sidelines leading to poor volume, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,848, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 briefly declined to 2,846 but soon recovered on renewed hopes of a reduction in UK interest rates, a firm gilts market and the strength of sterling. For most of the session, September was traded in a narrow range of 5 or 6 points, with the day's high of 2,858 recorded at around 11am. However, volume was poor, reaching only 3,862 contracts by the close, well below recent levels. Only yesterday, Liffe announced a 47 per cent increase in total volume since June 1992. September finished at 2,851, up 14 from its previous close but around 3 points below its fair value premium to cash of 7 points. In traded options, turnover remained buoyant and came to 30,625. Some 6,404 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,302 in the Euro FT-SE option. In the stock options, BT led the way with a total of 6,302 lots transacted, with most of the trade done in the November 460 calls, which saw volume of 2,000 lots. It was followed by Barclays at 2,030 contracts, with the December 460 puts the busiest series, and by National Westminster at 2,010 contracts. British Steel and Glaxo were also active.</p>

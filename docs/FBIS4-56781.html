			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 5 May (NOTIMEX) -- An Andean Group  presidential meeting scheduled for late May in the Ecuadoran  city of Cuenca has been postponed until next year, official  sources reported today.    Jose Vicente Maldonado, the Ecuadoran minister of industry,  commerce, and integration, said that the foreign ministers of  the Andean Group (Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and  Venezuela), will study a new date for the summit. Maldonado  ruled out that possible differences among group members,  especially on trade issues, were the reason for postponing the  presidential meeting.    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Diego Paredes confirmed the  suspension of the Cuenca summit and added that it will take  place in "the first half of 1995." He said that the Andean  Group presidents are interested in directly promoting  subregional integration, but the meeting in Cuenca was postponed  due to various commitments they have in the coming weeks.    The presidential meeting in Cuenca, third most important  city  in Ecuador, would have been held on 26 May, on occasion of the  25th anniversary of the signing of the Cartagena Agreement that  gave birth to the Andean Group.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pacific Enterprises sells energy assets for Dollars 371m PACIFIC Enterprises, the US energy group, is to sell a large part of its domestic oil and natural gas assets to Hunt Oil of Dallas for Dollars 371m, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt. Pacific Enterprises said it took a Dollars 156m, or Dollars 2.09 per common share, after-tax charge against earnings to reflect an expected loss on the sale. The agreement is for the bulk of the company's oil and gas exploration and production operations, which in 1991 were 5 per cent, or Dollars 324m, of its operating revenues and 10 per cent, or Dollars 689m, of total assets. Mr Willis Wood, chairman and president, said the sale was part of a restructuring plan under which the company will divest from its non-utility businesses to focus on its core business, the Southern California Gas Co. He added that, by the end of 1992, he expected to complete negotiations to sell the company's Canadian oil and gas exploration and production unit, Pacific Enterprise Oil.</p>

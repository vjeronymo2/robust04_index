			<p>BFN     [Text] In a bid to prevent former Soviet scientists and  engineers involved in the development of nuclear weapons from  emigrating to other nations, Japan, the United States, Europe,  and Russia have established the International Science and  Technology Center [ISTC] in Moscow. It has been learned that a  Japan-proposed plutonium research project to be undertaken at  the ISTC remains shelved after the United States opposed it.  The United States is believed to have opposed the project with  the aim of keeping both Japan and Russia from engaging in  plutonium research; the U.S. opposition is likely to cause a  problem for Japan which has promoted the plutonium research  project under an international framework.    The Japan-proposed project is composed of two research  areas:  the development of a new-type fast breeder reactor which uses  lead instead of sodium as a coolant, and research on group  separation of radioactive waste. Japan has proposed promoting  the plutonium research project in response to Russian hopes; the  Japan Atomic Power Research Institute and other Japanese  research institutes are to cooperate with the project.    The ISTC held its first session of the board of governors  from 17 to 18 March in Moscow. The U.S. Government notified the  Japanese Government just prior to the session that "it objects  to any project to promote Russia's use of plutonium."    As reasons for objecting to the project, the U.S. Government  is said to have cited: 1) its concern over Russia's lax  management of nuclear materials; and 2) the inconsistency of the  Japan-proposed plutonium research project with the U.S. policy  of pursuing nuclear nonproliferation.    In response, the Japanese Government has notified the U.S.  Government: "Given the objective of establishing the ISTC to  prevent Russian scientists and engineers in charge of handling  plutonium from emigrating, it is inappropriate not to undertake  plutonium-related research projects."    The first session of the board of governors held in March  did  not take up the Japan-proposed plutonium research project for  discussion, and withheld adopting other research projects in  question. However, the first session decided to undertake 23  research projects unrelated to plutonium. The cost of those  research projects is estimated at approximately $12 million.    The next session of the board of governors scheduled for  June  is set to adopt additional research projects; the Japanese  Government plans to consult with the U.S. Government about the  bilateral dispute over the Japan-proposed plutonium research  project. Some government officials take the view that Japan  will have to conduct a partial review of the plutonium research  project to ensure its smooth undertaking.</p>

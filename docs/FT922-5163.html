			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: New trust from Kleinwort stable Kleinwort Benson Investment Management is to launch an investment trust aimed at raising about Pounds 30m. A formal launch is expected within the next two weeks once various technical details have been decided. The trust would be the first to invest solely in secondhand unmatured endowment policies. It will have a fixed life and will probably not pay any dividends. A large supply of endowments is available at present, as most are sold as a repayment mechanism for a mortgage. Many homeowners in arrears on their loan have opted to sell their endowments to marketmakers.</p>

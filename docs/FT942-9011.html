			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Football club receiver under investigation The receiver to Chelsea Football &amp; Athletic Club, which is in liquidation, is under investigation by his professional body, it emerged yesterday. The work of Mr John Papi, a practitioner based in London, is being reviewed by the membership and authorisation committee of the Insolvency Practitioners' Association, the leading trade body. A report filed by Mr Papi, who was appointed receiver to CFAC last August by Chelsea Village, shows that he paid Pounds 622,000 - all the remaining assets of CFAC - to Chelsea Village on a charge it had over the assets worth Pounds 1.04m. Chelsea Village is the parent company of Chelsea Football Club, a separate company which now holds the players and assets of the club. The Official Receiver's office has appointed Mr Christopher Morris, a partner with accountants Touche Ross, to liquidate CFAC. Touche Ross confirmed yesterday that it was examining the transfer of assets  -including the club's football players - possibly at below their value from CFAC in 1992. It said that it was considering attempting to recover the value of the Chelsea players on behalf of CFAC's creditors. Mr Papi confirmed yesterday he was under investigation, but denied he had done anything wrong. He said that the transfer of players had been done with the blessing of the Football Association and 'no one raised any objections at the time'. Touche Ross said it had been told that Chelsea Village paid Pounds 1.7m in cash to CFAC in September 1992, and registered a debenture on the company at that point to secure the money. The last accounts filed for CFAC in the year to June 30 1991 show that the ultimate holding company is Mayflower Securities, based in the British Virgin Islands. Mr Papi's report filed at Companies House in October last year shows that HM Customs &amp; Excise and the Inland Revenue were owed between them Pounds 93,000 at May 14 1993. Other creditors were owed a total of Pounds 1.9m, of which the largest at Pounds 1.25m was Chelsea Football Club. There was also a contingent creditor  -Dr Ashraf Marwan - who claimed Pounds 2.5m in respect of a guarantee provided by the company in March 1992. None of these creditors was paid because the debenture holder is the first to receive any assets in a receivership, and was not paid in full. Neither the Insolvency Practitioners' Association nor the directors of Chelsea would comment yesterday.</p>

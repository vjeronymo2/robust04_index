			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said President  Glavkos Kliridhis' proposals for disarmament, dissolution of the  military forces, and withdrawal of the occupation troops have  received favorable comment. No one has suggested they should  not be promoted.    Asked about his statement [broadcast] by CyBC [the Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation], Mikhailidhis said the proposals do  not aim to substitute the confidence-building measures or  represent a way out of the measures the philosophy of which the  government has accepted. He said the proposals for disarmament  will not be submitted at the negotiating table but will be  promoted in international organizations, since the military  situation is the main reason for the Cyprus issue remaining  unresolved.    Mikhailidhis noted that in May, the Greek Presidency [of the  EC] is expected to submit the proposal for setting a date to  begin negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European Union.  He said the proposal does not clash with the reexamination of  Cyprus' accession to the Community in January 1995, since,  according to the interpretation by the Cypriot Government,  reexamination will concern the result of the accession talks,  not the opening of the talks.</p>

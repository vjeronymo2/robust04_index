			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by Raghidah </F> Dirgham in New York; date not given]    [Text] [Dirgham] Why have the Islamic states failed to  provide tangible aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Cetin] The Islamic states should do more than they have  done so far. We criticize other organizations which only issue  resolutions but we in the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO]  are also giving the impression that we are only issuing  resolutions. We should do more than that. We should take  tangible measures.    [Dirgham] What kind of measures, in your view?    [Cetin] More financial aid, for instance, to enable  Bosnia-Herzegovina to move toward solving some problems. We  have frequently decided to provide such aid but we never came  close to producing important tangible results. We repeatedly  made pledges but no satisfactory results or measures have come  of it. Another example of what I mean by tangible measures is  that we should pay much attention to the current proposals for a  permanent peace. There is talk about a four-month cease-fire to  push the Serbs toward a peaceful settlement. In that context,  we should draw up a plan for having the military embargo  practically lifted if that attempt fails.    [Dirgham] You mean arming the Bosnian Muslims despite the  embargo?    [Cetin] If the four-month cease-fire idea does not produce  the desired results we should make an active and effective  initiative and declare that Article 51 of the UN Charter gives  us the right of joint defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Dirgham] What does Turkey want from Iraq? You call for an  end to the oil embargo against Iraq on the one hand and you  violate Iraqi air space to hit the Kurds in the north on the  other, despite the fact that you are partners with the United  States, Britain, and France in the air exclusion zone operations  in northern Iraq.    [Cetin] I do not believe that there is a contradiction  there. We have fully explained that we care about the  territorial integrity, sovereignty, and safety of Iraq. We  attach great importance to their continuity. Turkey has  explained to everyone, and to whomever it may concern, that Iraq  must remain united and that the present borders will never  change. At the same time we believe that the Kurdish groups in  northern Iraq should hold a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities  to find solutions to their problems. We want that dialogue but  the situation in northern Iraq is not stable.    The Iraqis have promised us that they will not take any  measures against the Kurds but the problem is that we do not  know and will never know which party is going to take measures  nor do we know the nature of such measures. We do not want to  be faced again with the problems we faced in northern Iraq.  That is why we are a part of the operation to "provide comfort"  for the Kurds in northern Iraq. As regards the question of  lifting the oil embargo, our view is that the Iraqi people are  suffering as a result of the continuation of the embargo and  that Iraq has complied with Resolution 715 (continuous  inspection and verification of the Iraqi war machine) but it has  to comply with the other resolutions, particularly the one on  the border with Kuwait, and it should clearly declare its  acceptance of Kuwait as an independent sovereign state in order  to leave no pretext for preventing the lifting of the oil  embargo.    [Dirgham] There is a disagreement or difference between  the position of Turkey and that of the Gulf states regarding the  question of lifting the embargo. Turkey is trying to convince  Washington of the need to lift the embargo in implementation of  Article 22 of Resolution 687 and for reasons connected with Iraq  and Turkey, but the Gulf states oppose the lifting of the  embargo.    [Cetin] We have explained that there is no connection  between the Security Council resolutions and the authority in  Iraq. It is not up to the United Nations or any state to decide  who should run and rule Iraq. Only the Iraqis can make that  decision. That is why we do not approve of the inclusion of  personal aspects in the issue. We believe that there is  commitment to the principle which is that the oil embargo on  Iraq should be lifted. That is what we say most clearly to the  Americans and others. There is no resolution stipulating Saddam  Husayn (should stay or go). Furthermore, Turkey is suffering  economically as a result of the oil embargo. We and the Iraqi  people are being continuously punished through the embargo.    [Dirgham] How do American officials react to your views?  How do you read their position?    [Cetin] If Iraq complies with the Security Council  resolutions, they (the Americans) would not be able to stand in  the way of the consequences of such a move.    [Dirgham] Do you mean implementation of Article 22 which  lifts the embargo?    [Cetin] Yes. A number of Security Council member states,  such as Russia and France, are more inclined toward that idea.  Our view is basically that the oil embargo should be lifted  when Iraq complies with the relevant resolutions.    [Dirgham] The general impression is that Turkey is  committing massacres against the Kurds in northern Iraq and that  you are exploiting the political situation to serve your own  objectives.    [Cetin] That is not true. Our relations with (Mas'ud)  Barzani and (Jalal) Talabani are very good, and we cooperate  with them. What is happening has nothing to do with massacres.  Some terrorist groups cross our borders, terrorize and kill  people, and then withdraw.    [Dirgham] But you are burning villages and killing innocent  people. Is that a result of the failure of the policies of the  Kurdish leadership represented by Talabani and Barzani?    [Cetin] They need our cooperation and we need their  cooperation. It is not true that we are burning villages. We  are facing terrorist organizations. Every state has a right to  deter terrorist practices.    [Dirgham] Is Syria cooperating with you to your  satisfaction? Your relations with Syria had undergone some  tension....    [Cetin] Relations are now better than before.    [Dirgham] And with Iran?    [Cetin] We have good relations of cooperation and dialogue  in the context of combating terrorism. We cooperate closely and  there is an effective mechanism between officials in charge of  security. We have very good cooperation. With Syria we have a  general agreement and the situation is now improving.    [Dirgham] Do you mean that relations with Syria have  improved but not to a satisfactory level of cooperation? What  are the difficult problems between you?    [Cetin] I think we have to wait and see what tangible  results emerge. There is information that the leader (of the  Kurdish Workers Party) is still in the area (of al-Biqa' in  Lebanon), but the Syrians are willing to cooperate with us. The  Turkish interior minister visited Syria in the middle of this  month and returned with very satisfactory results. We continue  to tackle this problem in cooperation with our neighbors.    [Dirgham] What do you discuss with the Israelis, as far as  the roles of Turkey and Israel in the region are concerned?  Will your relations with Israel be relations of rivalry, or  complementary?    [Cetin] It is not a question of rivalry. We believe that we  have a special role to play by virtue of our close friendship  and fraternity with the Arab states, and our relations with  Israel are good at the same time. We seek to play an important  part in the context of the peace process for a better future for  the Middle East.    [Dirgham] Do you discuss with Israel a relationship that  would make you share control of the region?    [Cetin] Not at all. We intend to cooperate with the other  states in the region. When I met in Romania with (Palestinian  President) Yasir 'Arafat and (Israeli Foreign Minister) Shim'on  Peres, we agreed that it is necessary to cooperate and to ensure  wider cooperation among all parties in the Middle East.    [Dirgham] It seems that Turkey has failed to have the  influence it had hoped to have on international affairs, and you  seem to have internal problems preventing you from achieving  your objectives. You are weaker than Greece in the European  context and much weaker than the Russians as far as influence in  Caucasia is concerned. Where is Turkey's power today?    [Cetin] Turkey is a big state which emerged after the  Ottoman Empire. We have historical links with the states and  peoples of the territories which once belonged to the Ottoman  Empire. That is why we seek to play a constructive and peaceful  role in connection with these states.    [Dirgham] It has been claimed that Tansu Ciller's government  is not strong and that there are attempts to change it. Are  there such attempts?    [Cetin] No, we are a democratic state and everything is done  on a democratic basis.</p>

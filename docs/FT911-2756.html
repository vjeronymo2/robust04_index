			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Manchester goes for gold: The costs of launching a bid for the games MANCHESTER has joined the billionaire bidding game that will preface the millennial Olympics. The British Olympic Association in London this week unanimously backed the city's bid to stage the games in the year 2000. Should Manchester win, the rewards could be substantial. An independent study last year put the economic benefit of the north-west of England holding the Olympics at Pounds 2bn of direct and indirect investment; 50,000 jobs; a Pounds 500m boost to the UK balance of payments; and an increase in government tax receipts of about Pounds 160m. The host city will be chosen by the International Olympic Committee in September 1993. Manchester's rivals are expected to include Berlin, Peking, Sydney, Milan, Brasilia and Belgrade. National Westminster Bank was quick to pledge Pounds 100,000 to back Manchester's efforts. Now Mr Bob Scott, chairman of the bid committee, is drawing up a list of leading businesses in the north-west that he hopes will give a total of Pounds 3m to back the games campaign. Capital costs of up to Pounds 500m for stadia and facilities will not be involved at this stage. Mr Scott, a former theatrical impresario who conceived and ran Manchester's unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Olympics, said yesterday: 'I am quite puritanical about this. We do not need to spend a lot of money and if Pounds 3m is not enough, I would even question whether it would be worth it.' Atlanta, which last year beat Manchester and four other cities for the 1996 prize, spent Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.7m) on its bid, most of it provided by business in the state of Georgia. Manchester started off last time by raising Pounds 2m and then had to go back to sponsors for another Pounds 1m to keep going. The mood among north-west business leaders this time is bullish. 'Everyone is going to take things much more seriously. We have had our rehearsal and now we know better what to do,' said Mr Mel Harding, of the Manchester Financial and Professional Forum, which represents the city's financial industry. The bid, with the Duke of Westminster acting as president, is in Manchester's name because the Olympics are always awarded to a particular city, but it will cover the north-west region, with someevents staged in Cheshire, Lancashire and Merseyside. The last attempt did more to unite the region than anything anyone can remember. Rivalry is more normal, especially between Liverpool and Manchester. 'It was a hell of a good thing for all of us,' Mr Jeremy Weston, managing director of Barlows, a Chester-based investment group, said yesterday. He added: 'Everyone knows that a nine-year economic benefit will flow if we can succeed. Since this would have a wider impact than on just the region alone, we must also ensure that this becomes seen nationally as the British bid, with full backing from everywhere.' Mr Michael Potts, a partner of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte accountancy firm in Liverpool, was more cautious. 'This is not a good climate in which to start raising money. Times are hard and we may need to see the recession further behind us before some companies will commit themselves.' However, Mr Scott has drawn up a list of businesses he hopes will take the longer view already shown by NatWest. On the list will be large companies with head offices or substantial interests in the north-west. It will almost certainly include ICI, Shell, Coats Viyella, Manchester Ship Canal, Littlewoods, Royal Insurance, Granada TV, Norweb, Manweb, North West Water, Manchester airport, Barclays, British Nuclear Fuels, Greenall Whitley, Patterson Zochonis, GEC, Ford, General Motors, the Co-operative Bank, Co-operative Insurance, Refuge Assurance, Amec and Royal Bank of Scotland. The bulk of those supported the bid last time and most accepted that it was in itself good for business, so success was not too important. A much clearer determination to win the right to host the games is now evident. Mr Scott said Manchester City Council, led by Mr Graham Stringer, a Labour moderate, had agreed to underwrite the games on the strength of an assessment by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, that they would be financially sound if the bid succeeded. The two crucial factors were transport and the long-term viability of any facilities that had to be built. 'We already have Britain's best regional network of motorways, major roads and other transport, as well as the fastest growing international airport in Europe,' Mr Scott said. 'Most of the stadia and other facilities are already planned and will be built whether we get the games or not, so the financial questions have already been answered for most of the capital costs. As for the games themselves, they would certainly make a profit.'</p>

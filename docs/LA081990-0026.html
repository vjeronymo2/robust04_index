			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFINING CORRECTNESS  </P> <P> Letter writer David Moss (Aug. 12) ought to know that indeed "(Sam) Kinison and  Andrew Dice Clay -- as well as rock or rap groups such as Guns N' Roses and  Public Enemy and their record company backers -- all feel they have the  God-given right to say any damned thing they want to about anyone" because, in  this country, they do.  </P> <P> Too many times in America's history, this right was abrogated because whoever  was speaking wasn't politically correct enough for whoever was defining  political correctness at the time.  </P> <P> Moss denounces censorship and hides his call for political correctness behind  the megaterm "sensitivity/self-restraint/responsi-bility." Again, meanings vary  with whoever's doing the defining. In the '60s, I called peaceful anti-war  marches sensitive and responsible; Richard Nixon called them barbarous and  treasonous.  </P> <P> I'm not as good with quotes as Moss, so I don't recall who said "censorship is  an opinion backed by an organization," but it's one quote we should all  remember.  </P> <P> STEVEN GRANT  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

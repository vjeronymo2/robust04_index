			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFFS: MORE FORCE THAN NEEDED?  </P> <P> Years ago, comedian Richard Pryor performed a routine about what it was like to  be pulled over by the police. His character made loud announcements of every  planned movement -- such as "I am about to reach for my wallet" -- so that no  officer could misread a movement as threatening. It was funny but sad, because  the fear of being shot or beaten by the police was real to many minority  citizens.  </P> <P> In those days, the Los Angeles Police Department bore the brunt of such jokes  locally. But the LAPD has a better standing now with various segments of the  community. That didn't happen by accident. The department, under tremendous  political pressure, instituted better management controls on the use of  unnecessary force. Most important, LAPD brass began to set a tone in word and  deed -- still not perfect, but much improved -- that said that use of  unnecessary force was not only unacceptable, but would be a hindrance to  officers' careers.  </P> <P> Has that message gotten through in the county's other major law enforcement  agency? Sheriff Sherman Block says his department policies are adequate to  prevent the use of excessive force. Maybe not. Excessive-force lawsuits against  the department have almost doubled in the past five years. The names of some  accused deputies show up with regularity; some even get promotions. What should  have been a routine parking violation turns into a $150,000 taxpayer-financed  lawsuit after deputies beat up a trucker. Stops for traffic violations turn  into fatal shootings.  </P> <P> The increase in such incidents cannot be attributed simply to chronic  complainers and overzealous attorneys -- or even to the increased violence of  our time. Something else may be going on. The county should start tracking  excessive-force lawsuits against deputies and coordinate that information with  public misconduct complaints so that deputies with a pattern of complaints  could be red-flagged. The Board of Supervisors, exercising budget-strings  pressure if need be, must demand greater accountability from this often  excellent but increasingly worrisome Sheriff's Department. The problem can, and  must, be solved.  </P> <P> EXCESSIVE FORCE  </P> <P> Number of cases/lawsuits against the Sheriff's Department that resulted in  large payments in response to citizens' claims of excessive force.  </P> <P> 1988: 17  </P> <P> 1987: 5  </P> <P> 1986: 5  </P> <P> 1985: 1  </P> <P> Source: Los Angeles County Counsel  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'VAMPIRE LESBIANS' SOARS BEYOND THE RIDICULOUS  </P> <P> "Try throwing a dinner party for two pinheads and a Cyclops," wails someone in  Charles Busch's "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" at the Coronet Theatre.  </P> <P> Try inventing ridiculous names (Enid Wetwhistle? La Condesa de Scrofula de --  well, never mind). Try wearing the most soigne fright wigs this side of  Halloween (creator is Elizabeth Katherine Carr). Try constructing the most  ridiculous costumes (John Glaser) this side of "Beach Blanket Babylon." Try  besting the late Charles Ludlam at his own Ridiculous Theatre game.  </P> <P> Busch has. And then some. Can a show called "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom"  (preceded by a curtain-raiser titled "Sleeping Beauty or Coma") be anything but  camp transvestism punctuated by blatantly, ostentatiously vulgar jokes? Of  course not. The title tells you so. But Busch's and director Kenneth Elliott's  Theatre-in-Limbo company (which is anything but) delivers on its promise. This  is a theater of knobby knees, winks, tongues in cheeks, eye-liners and  one-liners.  </P> <P> Theater to gross out by.  </P> <P> No cow is sacred, especially not Hollywood or Las Vegas. (No joke is sacred  either. "This isn't hair on my head, these are nerve-endings," used here, first  came out of Phyllis Diller's mouth on a verrrry early appearance on the Jack  Paar show!) But then the plots are as outlandish as the play titles and mere  devices for spoofing anything within shooting range. In the case of "Sleeping  Beauty," it's haute couture; in "Vampire" it's Dracula and silent screen stars.  </P> <P> Mostly, though, these are characters in search of excuses for great get-ups and  off-color jokes. "Sleeping Beauty" is a more limited effort than "Vampire  Lesbians," but both are live-wire examples of the Ludlam/Ridiculous tradition,  which explains "Vampire's" ongoing success Off-Broadway (it's been packing them  in at the Provincetown Playhouse since 1985).  </P> <P> Busch is the fulcrum. Prettier than Ludlam, he plays several female parts --  roles -- to confectionary perfection. He revels in Sarah Bernhardt-style  asides, batting eyelashes and topping himself from one wig to the next. His  Madeleine Astarte, silent-screen vamp, looks and acts like a case of genetic  tampering between Lucille Ball and Marlene Dietrich.  </P> <P> Tom Aulino protests too much as frantic designer Sebastian Lore in "Sleeping  Beauty." But Andy Halliday (the prim Miss Thick in "Sleeping Beauty" and  Etienne the butler in "Vampire") has a face made for caricature. His mouth  looks like something that happened when the slasher missed his throat.  </P> <P> It's not all up to the men, however. The real women in this cast make some of  the strongest contributions. Monica Horan is memorable as Anthea Arlo in the  curtain-raiser and as starlet Renee Vain in "Vampire." But it is blonde Julie  Halston who really takes it away as "Sleeping Beauty's" flaky Enid and  "Vampire's" slinkily-attired Succubus and growling Condesa -- an imperious  movie queen in perpetual high dudgeon. ("I have reason to believe La Condesa is  one of the undead" -- "No, darling, she just looks that way." Yes, it's that  kind of humor. Low.)  </P> <P> Sets and lights (B.T. Whitehill and Vivien Leone, respectively) are incidental  to this show, which is fundamentally (accent on the first syllable) and  deliberately all about costume, camp and coarseness.  </P> <P> Not for all markets, but certainly for certain markets. Rarely has a show been  better suited to the dingy, dark, mildly decadent ambience of the Coronet. A  few months ago, one might have added the word decrepit too, but the management  has spruced up the place some.  </P> <P> All the more reason to expect that "Vampire Lesbians," with its guaranteed cult  status, might run on and on, ad infinitum.  </P> <P> At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., Tuesdays through Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 7 and  10 p.m.; Sundays, 3 and 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. Tickets: $18-$22; (213)  659-2400.  </P> <P> </P></p>

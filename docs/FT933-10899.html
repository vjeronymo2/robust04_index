			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Bank may fuel inflation's flames THE Bundesbank's decision to leave its discount rate unchanged last week was justified on the grounds that domestic inflation needed to be kept under control. But by refusing to ease monetary policy, the German central bank may have created a new inflationary problem for itself. The unprecedented levels of intervention by the bank to prop up the franc - which slipped to its floor in the exchange rate mechanism after the decision  -mean that the German authorities now face a sharp jump in the money supply, which could lead to higher inflation in the long term. An estimated DM50bn (Pounds 19.4bn) was spent by the bank on Friday alone, money that was not previously in circulation. The expectation that the extra D-Marks in the economy will further expand Germany's already fast-growing money supply is more acute now than it was last autumn. The estimated DM65bn of intervention over two days during this crisis compares with DM90bn used over two months at the end of last summer. As a result German M3 growth will creep upwards, as it did then, although the Bundesbank will try to 'sterilise' the impact of extra liquidity. Sterilisation occurs when monetary authorities offset extra domestic liquidity created through foreign exchange operations by withdrawing liquidity from the system, usually by issuing government debt. According to Mr Thomas Mayer of Goldman Sachs, no lasting impact on the domestic economy results from intervention, provided it is sterilised at some stage. The Bundesbank sterilised the impact of its intervention on the foreign exchanges in August and September, although M3 growth was boosted for several months. So far the bank has been slow to mop up the excess liquidity, worried that to do so too promptly would send the wrong signal to foreign exchange markets. According to Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, swift sterilisation may have been interpreted by foreign exchange dealers as a sign that the Bundesbank was anticipating further intervention. Ms Cottrell believes the Bundesbank will act to tighten liquidity some time in the near future. In the meantime, the domestic German economy is so depressed that while the Bundesbank can wave goodbye to its M3 targets, it does not have to worry about the inflationary pressures of the vast amounts of D-Marks flooding the system.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Upjohn wins Texas ruling UPJOHN, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday received a favourable verdict in a court case related to the safety of its Halcion sleeping pill, writes Karen Zagor in New York. A jury in Texas found no liability on the part of Upjohn or its co-defendant, a physician who prescribed the product. In the case Mr William Harley alleged he had been stabbed by an assailant acting under the influence of the drug. Halcion was banned in the UK last year. Sales have fallen sharply, although it still has approval for US marketing.</p>

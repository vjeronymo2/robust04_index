			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Bilibino AES collective followed by </F> unattributed report: "Halting AES Is Not Like Closing a Barn"]    [Text] An extremely grave situation has taken shape at the  Bilibino AES [nuclear electric power station] -- the only source  of electricity supplies on Chukotka -- because of consumers'  nonpayments for electricity and heating. The deterioration of  the financial situation has obliged the station's specialists as  of May 1993 to halt all safety work. There were only sufficient  funds for current operation. Today the acquisition of equipment  which is extremely necessary for the AES' safe operation has  stopped completely. Nuclear fuel was last delivered in  September. Planned repair is threatened with disruption.    Wages are paid with interruptions of two to three months. We  are not able even to travel to the funerals of our relations  because of the high cost of air tickets. Under northern  conditions the inevitable increase in prices for food has  brought many specialists to the poverty line.    The survival of the entire region depends on us. We are  doing everything necessary for the safe operation of the AES.  But with every passing day it is becoming harder to do this.  Our repeated appeals to the sectorial government organs have  brought no tangible results.    [Signed] The Bilibino AES collective    The editorial office was told at the "Rosenergoatom" state  concern that unfortunately the situation is typical of the  majority of AES's. Taxpayers' total debts as of today are 351  billion rubles. Because of this other AES's are threatened with  stoppage. Matters are no better with regard to the social  situation at enterprises. The payment for thermal and  electrical energy is through the Russian "Integrated Energy  System of Russia" joint stock company, which has managed to  collect only 17 percent of the necessary funds. Electric power  lines and electrical power stations are under the company's  jurisdiction but the function it has assumed as a connecting  link between electricity producers and consumer has prove beyond  it. Hundreds of nuclear electric power stations are unable to  acquire fuel or carry out current repairs.</p>

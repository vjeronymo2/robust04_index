			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Economics Notebook: Spain prepares for an end to innocence SPAIN'S chronic attachment to high real interest rates is beginning to eat away at the country's equanimity. It is under fire from France, which wants to cut its rates but cannot without breaking out of its European Monetary System limits against the peseta. Meanwhile, the Spanish Treasury is trying to cut the cost of medium and long-term debt, but cannot lower yields as much as it wants to. Finally, in a supposed bid to inject more competition into the inefficient Spanish banking system, the Government last week agreed to the merger of all state-owned financial institutions. By becoming the country's biggest banker the Government hopes to be able to jawbone domestic interest rates lower. A few weeks ago Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French Finance Minister, called the strength of the Spanish currency - which has been trading at the upper limit of its 6 per cent EMS band against the franc for more than five weeks - 'unnatural'. He said so again at the Group of Seven meeting in Washington last month. In private the Spanish authorities, frustrated by their inability to make the economy behave, might even agree. Two years ago, frightened by rising inflation and apparently unquenchable consumer demand, Madrid flung its economic levers sharply into reverse. Import tariffs were lifted early to cheapen consumer goods. Anyone borrowing cheaply abroad was forced to deposit up to 30 per cent of the loan, interest free, with the Bank of Spain. Growth in bank lending was limited, by decree, to 10 per cent after private credit had grown almost 25 per cent the year before. Amazingly, these ferocious measures have had little effect, although by the beginning of 1990 industrial production was falling. The invasion of Kuwait also helped because it panicked Spaniards into shelving investment decisions. But the Gulf crisis, perhaps, ended too early. The government had promised to begin lifting its credit controls by the beginning of this year and it has done so. As a result private credit is growing close to 20 per cent again and the ALP, the broad money supply measure, is growing almost twice as fast as its target. Madrid, desperate to demonstrate its ability to control its economy, cut the official intervention rate by one point at the Bank of Spain's regular CD auctions in March, to 13.5 per cent. The Central Bank governor was wheeled out to give a lame explanation. The forecasts looked good, he said. But the Bank of Spain does not really matter in this debate. It does what it is told by the Finance Ministry. The Finance Minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, has been promising more interest rate cuts this year but it is easy to misread that message. How does he make borrowing cheaper without cutting official rates? One of Mr Solchaga's gripes has been that, although the intervention rate has been cut, the commercial banks have not been passing the benefits on to borrowers. What the banks have been doing is cutting rates on interest-bearing current accounts launched 18 months ago and which threaten the high retail margins that have made them some of the most profitable banks in the world. Hence the creation last Friday of the Corporacion Bancaria Espanola (BCE) - the aglomeration of the State-controlled Banco Exterior, the big public lending group, the Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO), which includes the biggest mortgage and agricultural lenders in the land, and the Caja Postal, the post office savings bank. With combined assets of about Dollars 80bn, it is not only much bigger than the biggest private bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), but its 19,000 employees and 1,200 branches are far fewer than BBV is saddled with, making it a potentially powerful competitor. Announcing the merger, Mr Solchaga repeated old arguments about only big banks being able to compete in the Europe of 1993 and exhorted the remaining private banks to think again about merging. The point, though, was that the BCE would 'be belligerent in the financial markets, which will oblige the other (private) banks to cheapen their loans and give normal reward to deposits.' In other words, having failed to convince Spaniards not to overspend, the authorities are back to attacking the banks for lending so much so expensively. This is an adventurous way of trying to cure inflation and cutting the cost of borrowing. Banco Exterior apart, the official lending bodies are famously inefficient. In a recent interview the Prime Minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, warned that 'you can make a bureaucracy efficient, but it can never be creative'. And the BCE will not solve the more immediate problem of French complaints about Madrid's inability to cut rates further. Spain is not used to international criticism. The reaction in Madrid has consisted mainly of a hurt and whispered attempt to pass the buck. Spain argues that the peseta is not the franc's real problem. The real problem is the D-mark. Put aside the fact that the peseta and the franc are at the top and bottom of their limits against each other in the EMS and it is clear, they say, that if the Germans raise interest rates the franc would also find itself on the floor against the D-mark. The fact that the franc is not already there is that interventions by the Bank of Spain and the bank of France are keeping it artificially strong. The Spanish Government is keen to blame everybody but itself. Its banks are distorting the money supply by lending expensively to eager consumers, and the French are blind to their real problems. The only hole in this otherwise impressive defence is the Treasury. Here, the young Treasury chief, Mr Manuel Conthe, is a little more candid. 'Obviously there are some contradictions,' he says. The Treasury has been scrambling to cut yields on all its paper for most of this year. Last Friday it cut the interest rate on its 10-year bond 1.65 points to 11.83 per cent. Five-year yields have fallen to 12.26 per cent. Foreign investors, astonished that a country with annualised inflation of 5.9 per cent still sells paper at almost 13 per cent, are being turned away from Treasury auctions in droves. The volume of medium-term and long-term paper held by foreigners tripled in the first quarter to Dollars 16bn. Mr Conthe's problem is that he wants to build a credible market in medium-term Spanish bonds (until now foreigners have bought mainly treasury bills) but definitely does not want to become locked in to expensive long-term borrowing. The chickens are home and roosting.</p>

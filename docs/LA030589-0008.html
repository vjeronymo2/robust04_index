			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. IN THE MIND OF AMERICA  </P> <P> Brownstein's article suggests incorrectly that America has something to learn  from Los Angeles as a city. The truth is that America has nothing new to learn  from L.A. except how not to create a city. The best things about it -- the  climate and natural surroundings -- have only been damaged by our additions to  them, through smog, and, now, the pollution of Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> I believe our civic leaders should adopt an official mascot. I propose the  capybara, a large rodent about the size of a cocker spaniel. It barks and is  cheerful and cute. I saw one at the L.A. Zoo, drinking from its water dish, in  which it was also standing. It also was urinating into the same water. I  thought of this while parked in traffic on the 405 Freeway near Santa Monica  Boulevard staring at a soon-to-be completed office complex with 7,000 new  parking spaces.  </P> <P> ROBERT A.

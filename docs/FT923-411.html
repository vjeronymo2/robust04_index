			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate and economic news depresses bourses BOURSES fell as a weakening dollar, bearish comment on major companies and profit-taking combined to undermine share prices, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw a weekend report predicting operating losses at Volkswagen and pessimistic forecasts for the west German economy from the Ifo economic research institute. The DAX index ended 38.32, or 2.5 per cent lower at 1,475.04, and just 6.13 points above its 1992 closing low. Turnover fell from DM4.6bn to DM3.8bn. Ifo said on Sunday that the business climate in west Germany had clearly deteriorated in August, and saw no improvement over the next six months. Falling export orders and order backlogs were causing widening production cutbacks and occasional price reductions, it added. VW fell another DM17.30, or 5.9 per cent to a four-year low of DM276. The weekend stories underlined questions about the pricing of its new Golf model for which, according to outside estimates, production is now running at some 50,000 to 60,000 a month and still building up compared with 75,000 a month at peak for the old Golf. One downgrade yesterday took VW's 1993 EPS down from DM30 to DM20 a share. MILAN saw Olivetti drop 3.4 per cent after the computer company released worse than expected interim results. Elsewhere, share prices closed mixed but slipped in after-hours trading. The Comit index fell 1.15 to 360.45 in turnover estimated at between L70bn-L80bn after Friday's L80.9bn. Olivetti fell L57 to L1,625 on news that its losses had widened in the first six months to L93bn from L74bn in the year-ago period. Dealers said that the results prompted selling by speculators. Fiat gained L2 to L3,450 at its official settlement but then fell back to L3,380 in the after market, in the wake of last Thursday's 54 per cent drop in first half pre-tax profit. There were reports in the afternoon that several analysts who attended a briefing with Fiat were cutting their forecasts for 1992 results. Forecasts for 1992 net profit now range from L400bn to L600bn, mainly generated by asset sales, sharply down from L1.11 trillion in 1991. PARIS dropped 4 per cent, reflecting the weaker dollar and frustration that the central bank had not yet lowered domestic interest rates. The CAC-40 index fell 73.27 to 1,770.26 in turnover of FFr2bn. Most of the fall was to be seen in the big blue chips, with Total falling FFr9.30 to FFr210.10 after remarks to analysts by the chairman Mr Serge Tchuruk. Elf dropped FFr19.80 to FFr350.20 while Peugeot lost FFr34 to FFr541 and Michelin lost FFr10 to FFr196.50. Bucking the trend was Primagaz which rose FFr27 or 3.6 per cent to FFr787, the best performance of the day, in the wake of its pleasing interim figures. STOCKHOLM fell 3.7 per cent in thin trading to its second consecutive low for the year, as sentiment remained depressed by high domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 25.5 to 672.4 in turnover of SKr407m after SKr456m. Astra A free shares, the day's most actively traded stock with turnover of SKr100m, fell SKr17 to SKr526 while Ericsson's B frees lost SKr6 to SKr109 on domestic selling. Electrolux fell further amid rumours that the company will lower, or cancel its dividend for 1992. The B frees closed SKr12 lower at SKr166. The company had no comment. OSLO fell almost 2 per cent, hit by a weaker dollar and by declines on foreign share markets. The all-share index closed 6.37 lower at 323.62 in extremely thin turnover of NKr97m. Norsk Hydro rose SKr1 to SKr141 on the suspension of shares in the chocolate and confectionery maker, Freia Marabou, 44 per cent owned by Norsk. Kraft General Foods later said that it was offering to buy Freia Marabou for NKr450 per share, valuing the company at NKr8.8bn. AMSTERDAM was upset by further falls in Pirelli NV following the release of disappointing interim results after Friday's close. The tyre group, in which its Italian parent holds an 80 per cent stake, lost 13.7 per cent as its shares fell Fl 3.30 to Fl 20.70, its lowest close since March. The company also forecast further losses in the second half and warned of further restructuring. The CBS Tendency index fell 1.4 or 1.25 per cent to 110.8. ZURICH sold on the good news, following yesterday's referendum votes in favour of sharp cuts in stamp duties on securities transactions, and on expensive plans for modernising trans-Alpine transport. The SMI index fell 31.6, or 1.7 per cent to 1,879.2. MADRID remained stuck in negative mood as the general index built on last week's fall with another fall of 4.75 to 195.02 while the Ibex was 2.6 per cent weaker. Telefonica shed Pta29 to Pta996. BRUSSELS was weaker as Clabecq, the steel group, was suspended after announcing bigger-than-expected losses for 1991/92. The Bel-20 index closed down 8.96 at 1,109.10. Clabecq, suspended at Friday's close of BFr558, cited lower productivity in the first half combined with weakness in global steel prices for the fall in earnings. DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index dropped 31.19 or 2.6 per cent to 1,189.50 on fears that the central bank's three-point rise in its key interest rate to 13.75 per cent as well as the punt's appreciation against sterling would harm Irish company profits. VIENNA followed senior bourses lower as the ATX index lost 11.01 or 1.3 per cent to 817.12. Bundeslander, the insurer, went against the trend, putting on Sch2 to Sch502.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 28                             Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open    11.30am   12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm      4 pm    close  1021.32  1018.69  1019.40  1020.55  1018.49  1015.94  1015.51  1016.40                  Day's High  1021.32    Day's Low  1014.92           Sep 25      Sep 24     Sep 23      Sep 22      Sep 21          1035.63     1041.31     1043.77     1044.34    1050.43  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

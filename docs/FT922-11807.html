			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Improvement in service sector heralds recovery EARLY SIGNS of recovery heralded by the British Chambers of Commerce yesterday were confined mainly to service industries. For the manufacturing sector the outlook remained gloomy. Companies saw orders in the first quarter of this year fall for the eighth consecutive quarter, albeit at a slower rate. Yet the chambers were confident that manufacturing industries would soon follow the service sector out of recession. 'As manufacturing accounts for around a quarter of GDP it is clear that recession, as measured by orders in the UK, is almost over,' says the report. 'If these trends continue a return to growing sales deliveries in both manufacturing and services is expected during the second quarter of 1992.' The service sector, which went into recession later than the manufacturing sector and suffered a more shallow decline in output, resumed growth for the first time since mid 1990 in the first quarter of the year. According to the survey of 8,810 companies, slightly more than half of which were service providers, domestic demand for services was beginning to improve after more than a year of contraction. The report says the growth was almost entirely due to a remarkably strong performance by small companies, while bigger service providers - those with more than 20 employees - were still suffering a decline in orders. Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the chambers, said: 'This suggests that the more nimble small companies are better able to take the initiative and make the most of the increase in demand.' While exports in both the manufacturing and service sector continued to grow, a worrying trend was a slowing in the rate of growth in service-sector exports. Mr Brown said the slowdown could be ascribed to difficult global trading conditions. 'You can't keep up the rate of growth if all your markets are slowing down. There are still very strong markets in the Far East and Middle East, but Europe seems to be slowing down,' he said. Low investment remained a problem for both sectors. The report notes that investment plans in both sectors continued to be revised downwards. While many investment decisions were probably delayed because of electoral uncertainties, the chambers said falling investment in the manufacturing sector raised the question of whether British industry would be able to sustain growth at this point in the recovery without the foundations of solid investment. Lower interest rates remained the factor most likely to improve company prospects in both sectors, with a balance of 80 per cent of manufacturers and more than a third of service providers saying interest rates were their main concern. The number of manufacturing companies working at full capacity fell to its lowest level with just 19 per cent of those surveyed operating at full capacity. In the service sector there was a small fall in the number of companies working at full capacity. Employment continued to fall. Nationally, a balance of more than a quarter of large manufacturers and more than a fifth of service-sector employers expected to reduce their workforces. Job prospects were most buoyant in Northern Ireland and north-east England. In manufacturing, only Merseyside employers recorded growth in jobs - almost entirely due to a few large companies - but this was outweighed by a big reduction in service-sector employment in the region. Recruitment across the country remained low, but skilled manual, professional and managerial staff remained the hardest to recruit. The easiest region for skilled manual workers to find jobs in manufacturing was south-west England followed by the north-east where recruitment difficulties were the highest. After a sharp fall in business confidence at the end of last year, expectations remained broadly unchanged in the first three months of the year, the report concludes. 'Continuing high levels of insolvency and unemployment, coupled with a sustained decline in the housing market, will have done little to boost consumer confidence or demand.'

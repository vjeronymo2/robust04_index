			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MEDICAL MICE SUPPLY RESUMED  </P> <P> The nation's No. 1 supplier of laboratory mice is up to 70% capacity after a  fire one year ago today that dealt a blow to medical research projects around  the world.  </P> <P> The blaze at Jackson Laboratory killed 400,000 mice and destroyed much of the  29-year-old breeding complex.  </P> <P> Now it is counting on at least $10 million from the National Institutes of  Health for a full recovery.  </P> <P> "We'll be at 85% by the end of this summer. And we'll be at 100% by the end of  1991 if we get the $10 million from NIH," said Director Kenneth Paigen, who was  about to assume the post when the fire broke out.  </P> <P> JAX mice, as they are known in the scientific community, are used in research  on cancer, AIDS, diabetes, arthritis and thousands of hereditary diseases.  </P> <P> The research center, using frozen embryos, can breed mice of 1,700 strains to  give scientists the genetic makeup they need for their experiments.  </P></p>

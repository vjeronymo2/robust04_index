			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt ponders the prospects of recovery - But German equities are in a transitional phase, writes David Waller, as they wait for the Bundesbank It has been a grim third quarter for the German stock market. The DAX index of the top thirty shares fell by 16 per cent; and while in sterling terms, that represented a real gain, the devaluation effect only served to increase the temptation for London institutions to take profits, encouraging prices to sink further. The market was driven down by a host of factors: among others, by turmoil in the currency markets, by fears about the direction of interest rates, and by a reassessment of the prospects for corporate earnings in general next year. The worst performers were automotive, engineering and steel companies such as MAN, the truck group, which lost 35 per cent in the three months, and Thyssen, Mannesmann, Volkswagen and Daimler Benz, all of which lost 27 per cent. The best were the banks, especially Dresdner Bank (the best performer in the DAX with a mere 1 per cent drop over the quarter) and the two big Bavarian banks, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypobank. These three outperformed the market by 16 to 18 per cent. There is talk now of consolidation and potential recovery. The relationship between yields on shares and government bonds has begun to make shares look cheap, optimists argue. And after the Bundesbank's quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate last month, they are hopeful that the direction of interest rates will from now on be decisively downwards. The trouble is that the market is still in a transitional phase. If it were clear that the Bundesbank was about to embark on a cycle of interest rate cuts to rival the halving of rates in previous recessionary phases (1974-1976 and 1981-1983) then the market would recover robustly, driven by the financials which account for a third of the DAX and could be expected to do particularly well when interest rates were coming down. But the Bundesbank's signals are conflicting. Money market rates are down below 9 per cent - standing at 8.9 per cent yesterday, nearly a full percentage point down from their level at the beginning of September. Yet the Bundesbank appears to be taking pains to explain that M3 money supply growth can be distorted. This could possibly be a preparation for the time when they cut rates, without having achieved their target of keeping monetary growth down to 3.5-5.5 per cent. Alternatively, it could merely be that the Bundesbank is hinting that it will not increase rates after what is likely to be a dreadful figure for September M3 growth, due later this month. The figure, bloated by the impact of intervention, could be as bad as 10 per cent. Negative, from the market's point of view, is that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and his colleagues on the central council have not ceased to emphasise that the main target of policy is to squeeze inflation out of the system. The current structure of interest rates leaves scope for another quarter-point cut in the Lombard rate; but there is no indication that Mr Schlesinger will present the markets, and the German economy, with a full half-point cut by the end of the year. This combination of factors leads to uncertainty, and encourages investors to focus on the rapidly deteriorating fundamentals for the German economy. It has long been taken for granted that the economy would benefit from a surge of exports to the US and west European countries as they came out of recession. But in recent weeks there has been a shift in perceptions. Recovery in the US and elsewhere looks as far away as ever, and forecasts of growth in Germany have had to be slashed in consequence. The relative strengthening of the D-Mark in recent weeks has encouraged the gloom, and Goldman Sachs, for example, has just cut its growth forecasts for western German GDP growth for next year from 2-2.5 per cent to just 0.5 per cent. The corollary of this is sharply reduced earnings expectations. Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Frankfurt now expects earnings to grow by only 3 per cent next year, compared to a forecast of 11 per cent growth until the Bundesbank raised rates in July. So, argues Mr Jurgen Rothig of BZW, the market is going to move down further, before it reaches a plateau at which it may start to look cheap again. He expects the DAX index to go as low as 1,300, down from yesterday's 1,439.66, 11.46 lower on the day. Only then will investors be tempted back into equities by what will be a 5 per cent gap between yields on equities and on bunds, he says. Mr Robert Willis at Hoare Govett in London is more optimistic - mainly because he believes that the Bundesbank will not allow Germany to sink into a fully-fledged recession and may, therefore, embark on 'possibly dramatic' interest rate cuts in the course of next year. He acknowledges, though, that investor confidence will recover only slowly, and predicts a drift in prices before an significant recovery towards the turn of the year. Hoare expects the banking sector to continue to outperform, both because the sector's earnings should remain more resilient than in other sectors, and because of the sector's high gearing to a fall in interest rates. Other recommendations include BASF, the chemicals company whose share price, Mr Willis argues, will be underpinned by a yield equating to the 7.5 per cent on long Bunds, even if the 1992 dividend is cut to DM10 per share.</p>

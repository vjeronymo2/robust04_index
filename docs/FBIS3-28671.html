			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Keiko Tatsuta: "Japanese Firms Cautiously Seeking </F> Business With Israel"]    [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japanese companies are  seemingly cautious but steady in seeking business with Israel  following its historic accord with the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) last September.    One group of Japanese firms and individuals is preparing to  set up the Japan-Israel Business Club on February 16 to exchange  information about the climate for investment and trade in the  Jewish nation, industry sources said. However, a major trading  firm, which is said to have initiated the club's formation, was  nervous about being identified and refused to comment.    Other trading houses seem to be unaware about the  organization or undecided about joining.    The club will serve as a "saloon" for individual members,  who  effectively represent their respective firms, the sources said.    Many Japanese companies have avoided taking conspicuous  action to boost trade with Israel, apparently still fearful of  the Arab League's boycott, which means the loss of Arab markets  and oil supplies.    "The peace agreement would not have substantial impact on  our  business because there remains the Arab boycott, though it is  somewhat becoming a mere shell," said a spokesman for Itochu  Corp. Itochu has never been involved with setting up the club,  another spokesman said.    Arab states have boycotted the Jewish society in three  stages  -- primarily by cutting economic relations with Israel,  rejecting business with companies that have economic relations  with Israel, and boycotting firms connected with those that do  business with the nation.    Although Kuwait announced last June that it was ready to  stop  blacklisting companies doing business with Israel, the effective  date is uncertain since the Arab League's previously planned  plenary session on the issue was indefinitely postponed, said an  official of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).    "We are in a stage of watching developments there," Hiroshi  Nozu, Middle East and Africa section general manager of the  international corporate planning department of Marubeni Corp.,  said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Nezu said Marubeni will seek business with Israel at a "slow  and steady" pace because political uncertainty in the region  remains despite the accord, which he called an "agreement for  agreement."    Because Israel has advanced technology in such areas as  agriculture, biology, telecommunications and aviation, Marubeni  believes future ties are promising, Nozu said.    Nozu denied having heard of the Japan-Israel Business Club.    The Itochu spokesman said that in terms of population, only  Egypt and Turkey are the region's large markets. Itochu  business with the two, mainly in crude oil, vehicles and plant  equipment, will continue as before, he said.    Currently, Itochu does not plan to open a representative  office in Israel, and no immediate impact on Itochu is expected  as a result of the Israel-PLO agreement, the spokesman said.    "We cannot help being cautious about business with Israel  because of psychological factors," said Masami Naruse, assistant  manager of corporate communications division of Mitsui and Co.    "It all depends on what will become of the Arab boycott,"  Naruse said, "because we have close relations with Arab nations  such as the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Kuwait." He said his  company has yet to decide whether to participate in the  Japan-Israel Business Club.    According to government statistics, Japan's trade with  Middle  East nations has gradually expanded, from 29.04 billion dollars  in 1988 to 44.46 billion dollars in 1992. The figures include  trade with North African states and exclude Turkey.    For the January-November period in 1993, however, trade with  these countries decreased by 7.8 percent from the same period in  1992.    Meanwhile, bilateral trade between Japan and Israel  increased  by 3.2 percent for the first 11 months last year over the same  period in 1992. It expanded from 1.1 billion dollars in 1988 to  1.7 billion dollars in 1992.    Japan's exports to Israel, mainly automobiles, amounted to  about 1 billion dollars in 1992, while imports from Israel,  primarily diamonds, came to around 700 million dollars.    Japan's vehicle exports to Israel totaled 66,792 units last  year, following 82,249 in 1992 and 58,593 in 1991, according to  the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.    Among nine exporting automakers, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  ranked first with about 24,000 units for the January-November  period of 1993, industry sources said.    While Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. have a long  history in exporting autos to Israel, others were relative  newcomers, the sources said.    "The general business environment there is headed in a  favorable direction," a Nissan Motor Co. spokeswoman said.  However, because Israel's population of five million is not  big, Nissan does not expect the peace accord to lead to a rapid  increase in export volume, she said. "We'll just steadily  market our products there" at the current pace of some 3,000  vehicles per year, she said.    Despite uncertainty over the boycott, Japan and Israel will  deepen bilateral ties from a long-term viewpoint, said Yoshihiro  Otsuji, director of the Middle East-Africa office of the  International Trade Policy Bureau at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI).    Inquiries concerning the boycott and other information on  Israel have been increasing since last November and exchanges  between MITI officials and Israeli counterparts have expanded,  Otsuji said.    The Japanese Government has officially called for an end to  the trade refusal.</p>

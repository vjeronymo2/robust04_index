			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Fire in Humberston B nuclear power station A FIRE broke out yesterday in the pressure vessel of the Hunterston B nuclear power station in Ayrshire. Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned company that operates the advanced gas-cooled reactor station, said the fire involved no nuclear material and there was no hazard to personnel or the public, James Buxton writes. The fire broke out in a temporary rubber skirt installed at the top of one of the boilers in the pressure vessel of the reactor, which was shut down for maintenance. Scottish Nuclear believes the fire was caused by sparks from cutting equipment. The fire was put out by the station's fire team.</p>

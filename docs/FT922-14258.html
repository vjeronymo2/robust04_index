			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Nordic markets begin to settle NORDIC government bond markets regained a semblance of calm yesterday after Friday's panic-selling, as the Finnish government averted fears of a devaluation in the Finnish markka and stemmed the heavy outflows of currency from the region. Finland and Sweden saw sharp increases in short- and long-term interest rates on Friday, and a massive outflow of currency, following the resignation of the governor of the Bank of Finland. However, Finland announced big cuts in government spending at the weekend in an attempt to calm the financial markets and stem fears of a devaluation of the markka. The Nordic central banks also pledged to help stabilise the markka at the weekend, while the Bundesbank added its promise of support. Finland's government bond market witnessed further rises in yields yesterday, although dealers said the increase was held in check by the announcement that the Bank of Finland had reached a swap agreement with the Bundesbank in addition to those reached with the other Nordic central banks at the weekend. The bank was forced to intervene in order to support the currency during trading, and the markka firmed slightly against the Ecu compared with Friday's level. The yield on the government bond due 2001, which carries a coupon of 11 per cent, rose to 11.70 per cent, against Friday's midday fixing level of 11.65 per cent. Short-term interest rates soared as the market opened, with the one-month Helibor rate jumping from Friday's close of 16.76 per cent to a high of 25 per cent on Monday, before falling back to between 18 and 19 per cent by the afternoon. SWEDEN'S government bond market ended the day higher, as investors gained confidence from Finland's economic package and from the Swedish central bank's resolute defence of the Swedish krona. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, raised the overnight call rate - the rate applicable to bank loans to the Riksbank - to 13 per cent from 11 per cent in an effort to turn the tide of currency flows. On Friday, SKr22bn swept out of Sweden because of the Finnish crisis, but traders reported a strong inflow of currency yesterday. 'The increase in the interest rate demonstrates the Riksbank's determination to defend the krona's fixed exchange rate' said Mr Bengt Dennis, the governor. The move prompted strong buying of securities, pushing down yields across the maturity range. The yield on the 10.75 per cent bond due 1997 fell from Friday's close of 10.12 per cent to 9.93 per cent, below the level of 9.99 per cent that it traded at on Thursday, before the crisis. Likewise, the yield on the 13 per cent issue due June 2001 fell back to 9.53 per cent, against Friday's close of 9.64 per cent and Thursday's level of 9.61 per cent. However, at the short end of the market, three-month Treasury bills failed to regain their pre-crisis levels, with the yield reaching 12.20 per cent, against 12.45 per cent at Friday's close and 11.75 per cent on Thursday. ITALIAN government bond prices were driven down 0.40 point by political uncertainty, in active trading. Early results showed a swing away from the ruling four-party coalition, prompting speculation that a new coalition government will have to be formed. Uncertainty about the political situation also knocked the lira back, prompting the Bank of Italy to support the lira against the D-Mark through intervention. The BTP Italian government bond future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) was quoted at 97.89 in late trading, down from Friday's 98.31. Trading of the contract starts 35 minutes early today at 7.35am, to allow for further election-generated activity, after record volume of around 30,000 contracts yesterday. GERMAN government bonds rallied about  1/2 point on news of a wage settlement in the German banking sector. Bund futures on Liffe ended up 0.47 point, at 87.81. Dealers said the market had been oversold, and support had materialised around the 8 per cent yield level. The poor performance of the Christian Democrats in some regional elections had no apparent impact. FRENCH government bonds tracked the German market, as the French market maintained the positive tone created by the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregevoy, former finance minister, as prime minister. The continuation of a firm monetary policy was underlined yesterday, further confidence after last week's poor regional election results for the ruling socialists. The OAT future on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, close at 107.96, up 0.40 point. US TREASURIES were narrowly lower yesterday in thin, featureless trading. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  3/16 lower at 101 7/32 , yielding 7.89 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities were firmer in morning trading, but gave up most of their gains in the afternoon, when the three-year note was quoted unchanged on the day to yield 5.85 per cent. The Federal Reserve abstained from operating in the open market. Fed Funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent during the Fed's usual intervention period. In the absence of any significant economic news, the bond market continued to take heart from Friday's employment report. The market interpreted Friday's release of a slim, 19,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for March as evidence of a slight recovery. The initial strength at the short end of the yield curve was inspired by hopes that a weak economic recovery will prevent the Fed from tightening monetary policy in the short term. UK GOVERNMENT bonds traded lower as the weakness of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism raised fears of a post-election devaluation of the UK currency. The Portuguese central bank bought sterling against the escudo on the first day of trading for the Portuguese currency within the ERM. This increased fears that the arrival of the strong Portuguese currency in the system will increase pressure on sterling, which remains pinned at the bottom of the ERM grid. The gilt futures contract on Liffe fell to 93.04 during the morning session, having opened at 93.15. However, during the afternoon the nerve of the market steadied and the contract recovered to close at 93.14. Volume was a healthy 27,000 contracts. In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed down just  1/32 of a point on the day at 94.00, for a yield of 9.68 per cent. AFTER last week's collapse in Japanese government bond prices, heavy official intervention to buy bonds helped to prop up the market. In the early afternoon in Tokyo, the Ministry of Finance offered to buy Y100bn worth of 10-year bonds, using its National Consolidation Fund - a 'sinking' fund set up to repay government debt when it falls due. It was the first time the fund had been used since the summer of 1990, when the yield on 10-year bonds stood at over 8.5 per cent.</p>

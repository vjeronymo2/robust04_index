			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ASIAN AMERICAN ACTORS BODY HITS CASTING OF GERE AS A JAPANESE  </P> <P> The casting of Richard Gere as a Japanese-American in Akira Kurosawa's  "Rhapsody in August" has been described as "far-fetched" by an Asian American  actors group that has been sharply critical of the similar casting of a  Caucasian in a Eurasian role in the Broadway musical "Miss Saigon."  </P> <P> The Assn. of Asian Pacific American Artists, in a statement today acknowledged  that in the context of Japanese cinema, the casting of Gere constitutes  'non-traditional casting' " -- a Caucasian actor playing a Japanese role."  </P> <P> But, added spokeswoman Beulah Ku, "unfortunately, it (that type of casting) is  not being reciprocated in America."  </P> <P> Ku said that AAPAA believes that Kurosawa, widely heralded as one of the  world's leading film directors, "is giving a white actor an opportunity in  Japan and he's doing something different. . . . Obviously (Gere got the part)  because he is a star. He's a box-office hit."  </P> <P> Reached at Kirosawa Prods. in Yokohama today, the director's son, Hisao  Kurasawa, explained the choice of Gere matter-of-factly: "We don't need someone  who looks Japanese. The situation of the story calls for an American . . . so  we chose Mr. Richard Gere."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the film's co-producer, Shochiku Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, said he  believes that such choices "are all up to the director." He said Kirosawa  tailored the script for Gere.  </P></p>

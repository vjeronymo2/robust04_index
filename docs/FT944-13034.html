			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker warning Shares of Cornwell Parker, the Buckinghamshire-based furniture group best known for its Parker Knoll range, dipped 5p to 124p yesterday following a downbeat statement to the annual meeting by Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman. 'Trading conditions, particularly in our sector of the furniture market, remain very difficult.' He warned that the trading outcome for the first half was likely to be 'well below' that of the previous year, although he expected some improvement in the second six months. 'We are continuing to review every aspect of our business in order to reduce operating costs in the medium term,' Mr Jourdan said. The likely trading pattern mirrors that of 1993-94 when pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 4.61m), a decline ameliorated by a partial recovery in the second half.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: A capital way to make money - But those who venture can risk losing out in a volatile market This year's highly-publicised flotation of 3i, the venture capital investment trust, attracted many private investors to venture capital for the first time. But 3i is only the latest - and largest - addition to a long-established investment trust sector. Micropal lists 25 funds in the venture and development capital sector which invest in small businesses in their start-up phase, or provide extra capital to more established (but generally still unquoted) companies which need money to expand or to fund a management buy-out or buy-in. Many funds are tiny - 10 have less than Pounds 15m under management. Until 3i came to market, Electra was the largest venture capital investment trust, with assets of Pounds 574m, compared with 3i's Pounds 1.9bn. The characters of the funds differ as much as their sizes. There are geographic specialists like Abtrust Scotland which, as its name suggests, invests mainly north of the border; and the East German investment trust, which buys privatised East German enterprises. Several of the general funds - Electra, Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise, Foreign &amp; Colonial Enterprise - have substantial holdings in the US as well as the UK. Pantheon International Participations is unique in the sector as it prefers to invest through other venture capital funds. Risk levels also vary widely. A fund with a concentrated portfolio of a few dozen investments will be more risky than one like Pantheon, which has indirect stakes in several hundred companies, or 3i, with more than 3,400. Funds specialising in start-up capital are riskier than those providing development capital to more established businesses. Likewise, performances can be poles apart: Micropal's 10-year performance figures for Pounds 100 invested in venture capital trusts range from Pounds 430 to Pounds 61. So, the choice is broad. But it can be difficult for private investors to know what they are buying, not only for what each trust aims to do but also in terms of value for money. The usual measure of whether an investment trust is cheap or expensive is whether its share price is at a discount or premium to net asset value. The problem is that the accuracy of the discount/premium rating depends on how accurate the calculation of asset value is. Asset values of investment trusts with portfolios of quoted shares can easily be re-calculated every day, but unquoted investments are another matter - their market value is difficult to determine and highly subjective. Venture capital investment trusts tend to value their unquoted assets two or four times a year. In between valuations, it is impossible to tell if the asset value is rising or falling - companies in the portfolio may have been awarded lucrative contracts or be experiencing financial difficulties, but this will not be reflected in the fund's quoted asset value. Periodic re-ratings can be quite dramatic, particularly in trusts nearing their winding-up dates which are selling off stakes and realising large profits. 3i, for example, values its portfolio twice a year. The last valuation was at the end of March; the valuation from the end of September is due to be released next month. So, although 3i shares were, until recently, trading at a premium to what analysts estimated was asset value, no one knew for sure whether that was the case. Recently, 3i's presumed premium rating has been eroded, as investors have taken profits - up to 20 per cent for those selling at the 336p peak. Indeed, some brokers have been recommending that clients sell 3i and buy other venture capital trusts. Peter Walls, investment trust analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, says: 'My belief is that, in asset value terms, one would see better growth and better performance from the likes of Murray Ventures or Electra for the next two or three years than one will from 3i - they are trading on relatively generous discounts.' But Iain Scouller, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, points out: 'Some people have been talking about switching out of 3i into Electra but, looking at the underlying assets of those trusts, they are very different.' 3i's portfolio is much more diverse, and more UK-orientated, than Electra or the other large, general venture capital trusts. Still, if 3i's profile is what you want over the long term, you should stick with it; you will not get the same from another trust. But if you want to put new money into venture capital, or are prepared to go for a riskier fund, you will probably find better value elsewhere. Venture capital is not for everyone. It is a highly volatile and potentially very profitable area - but it can lose investors' money all too easily. Most advisers recommend treating venture capital funds with caution, and only investing if you have a broad portfolio of more mainstream investments already.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New light on outdoor displays Brightly lit advertising displays come into their own at night but can look washed out in bright light. A new display screen that adapts to different lighting conditions has been designed to overcome this. Black Box Vision, a start-up company, has developed a liquid crystal display screen that will show high-resolution, animated graphics throughout the day using relatively low power. The system is designed to consume less power and give a higher-quality picture than traditional systems which use bulbs or neon light. The system works by combining back-lighting with a reflective display, which reinforces the picture in the daytime. Black Box Vision: UK, 0273 693622.</p>

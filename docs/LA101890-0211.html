			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN LITERATURE ORDINANCE REJECTED  </P> <P> The City Council this week rejected an ordinance proposed by Councilman Orville  Amburgey that would have required council candidates to file their campaign  literature with the city clerk.  </P> <P> The emergency ordinance -- so named because it would have taken effect  immediately if approved by four of the five council members -- received only  the support of its sponsor. Councilman Ed Glasgow was absent.  </P> <P> "We basically discussed it and the council majority didn't feel it would  accomplish what it was set out to do and that is to try to reduce negative  campaign literature," said Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis.  </P> <P> However, Amburgey, who is seeking his second four-year term on the council,  said the ordinance would have given candidates an opportunity to respond to  negative statements.  </P> <P> "What was behind it was that I received information from reliable sources that  some of the opposition will be passing out 'hit pieces' before the election and  I feel that Costa Mesa doesn't need that," Amburgey said.  </P> <P> "Hit pieces" contain negative information about opponents and are distributed  shortly before an election.  </P> <P> Amburgey has accused candidate Jay Humphrey of distributing negative campaign  information, including copies of newspaper stories concerning Amburgey's  conflict-of-interest battles over the last few months. Amburgey has been  criticized for refusing to abstain from votes involving his son's construction  company and others who have donated to his campaign.  </P> <P> Humphrey could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> The failed ordinance, modeled after similar measures passed in Newport Beach  and Stanton, would have required candidates to provide the city clerk with 10  copies of any literature distributed within 14 days of an election. Mayor Peter  F. Buffa, who is also seeking his second term on the council this year, said  the ordinance is unnecessary because candidates find out immediately if someone  is distributing information about them.  </P> <P> He also questioned whether the city would be interfering with the First  Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech -- an argument that has been raised  in the cities that approved the campaign document ordinance.

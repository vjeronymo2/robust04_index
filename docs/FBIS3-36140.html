The heads of the two states -- Boris Yeltsin and Eduard  Shevardnadze -- are now having tete-a-tete talks.    Members of the two official delegations are meeting at the  same time behind closed doors in order to make the negotiations  more comprehensive and constructive.    ITAR-TASS has learned that bilateral, primarily economic  relations between the two countries are now being discussed by  First Vice-Chairman of the Russian council of Ministers Oleg  Soskovets and Chairman of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Otar  Patsatsia.    Political aspects of inter-state cooperation are being  discussed by Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr  Chikvaydze. Taking part in the talks from the Georgian side is  Chairman of the Provisional Committee for the Emergency  Situation in the Republic Jaba Ioseliani and Head of the Human  Rights and Inter-Ethnic Relations Committee Aleksandr Kavsadze.    Judging by the participants of this part of the  negotiations,  they are dealing not only with Russo-Georgian relations as a  whole, but also with some aspects of the Abkhazian and South  Ossetian problems, as well as with the rights of non-indigenous  nationalities, particularly the Russian-speaking population.    Heads of the defence establishments of the two countries are  discussing a package of draft documents on cooperation in the  military sphere. Future military-political cooperation between  Russia and Georgia depends on the stabilisation of the  socio-political situation in the republic. This was stated by  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on the eve of President  Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. In his opinion, this also depends  on the settlement of problems linked with the political statuses  of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as on Georgia's readiness  to act in keeping with the Collective Security Treaty.    Then the talks were continued on a broader scale with the  participation of the official delegations of the two countries.  A package of bilateral Russo-Georgian documents are expected to  be signed after them. The most important document, of course,  is the Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations, and  Cooperation.    ITAR-TASS has learned from circles close to the Georgian  delegation that the republic's leadership believes that "the  signing of this treaty will restore the disrupted ancient ties,  will add new substance to bilateral relations, fully meeting the  interests of the two nations".    A joint press conference will be held by President Yeltsin  and Eduard Shevardnadze after the signing ceremony. President  Yeltsin will meet Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Iliya II  in the second half of the day. Then the Russian president and  Eduard Shevardnadze will meet Georgian intellectuals.    An official dinner will be given in honour of the Russian  president in the evening of the same day on behalf of head of  the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze.    President Yeltsin will return to Moscow late on Thursday  evening.</p>

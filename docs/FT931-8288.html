			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey uf Personal and Portable Computers (14): Quality reaches all parts - Peripherals are being updated in line with personal computers MOST OF the personal computer industry's attention in recent years appears to have focused on making PCs smaller, faster, cheaper and more powerful. Equally aggressive efforts, however, have gone into doing the same for the devices which users attach to their PCs - including printers, back-up systems, scanners, network systems, external displays, modems, high-capacity external storage systems and just about anything else you can imagine. The most noticeable difference for most users has been in the quality and variety of printers available for their PCs. While impact technology - such as dot matrix and daisywheel - characterised printer designs in the first half of the 1980s, higher-quality, non-impact systems using laser and inkjet print engines now dominate the market. These have been married with sophisticated 'page description languages' such as Adobe PostScript and Hewlett-Packard's PCL5 to provide unprecedented printing flexibility and quality. This has given a large number of users the chance to produce almost-typeset quality from their printers - as well as graphs, charts and diagrams that would previously have to be produced by a commercial artist (or not at all). Two other printer innovations which have had great impact in recent years are the proliferation of colour printers and, more recently, portable printers. The former have made personal computers credible pre-production tools for professional colour publishing work, while portable printers have made life a little easier for the growing army of those who carry their computers around. While printers have been improving the images that come out of a PC, scanners have increased the range and quality of information that go into them. Scanners allow users to 'photocopy' images onto the computer's hard disk - so that they may be stored, edited and printed at any time. They are vital to anyone involved in PC publishing work and, when combined with optical character recognition software, allow users to have large amounts of text on paper turned into editable word-processor files on the computer's screen. Colour and portability are also the two major areas of innovation in the scanning world. Lower-cost colour scanners are coming into their own at the moment - as are inexpensive ways of obtaining colour pictures in a form that can be used by PCs. One of the best examples of this is Kodak's new Photo CD process - which allows standard 35mm films to be 'developed' onto a personal computer's add-on CD-ROM optical disc. The images from that disc can then be treated as any other scanned images - except they are of a far higher quality than most users would be able to get from an affordable hand scanner. That situation is not likely to exist for long, however, as the quality of hand scanners is improving fast and the price is dropping just as quickly. A number of good colour hand scanners - such as Logitech's ScanMan 256 - offer the ability to scan images into a PC with support for up to 256 colours. The great limitation to such devices, however, is that they can scan only a certain portion of a standard A4 page at once. This means that you must often do several scans and 'stitch' them together to get a complete page into your computer. Scanners and printers largely concern themselves with the business of getting images or text in and out of your computer. A new range of computer add-ons stretches the horizon of what you can get a PC to do for you. These add-ons are called 'multimedia' peripherals - and generally include sound cards, a CD-ROM, a microphone and external speakers. If used in an operating environment that supports them properly, these extras enable you to incorporate speech in on-screen presentations, use educational applications that can play music and animated sequences on the computer - and even standard audio CD music. The real key to the success of multimedia, however, lies in the CD-ROM. This variation on standard CD audio technology allows specially-encoded compact discs to hold up to 600 Megabytes of data each - giving them six to eight times the capacity of the average personal computer hard disk. That is why increasing numbers of encyclopedia products are being offered on CD-ROM. CD-ROM versions of encyclopedias can incorporate the voices of famous people, digitised images of places, animated sequences explaining how different technologies work - and lots of text that can easily be searched by the computer and then printed out as needed. And, of course, they do not weigh as much or require the death of many trees in their production process. Finally, there is the rebirth of the parallel port. For years, the parallel (sometimes called Centronics) connector on the personal computer was used only for hooking up printers - sending information from the computer to the printer. Recently, however, the parallel port has become the conduit for two-way data traffic - and many developers have designed converters that turn parallel printers into SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) connectors. SCSI is a popular connection standard, supported by most manufacturers, allowing users to hook up external hard disks, CD-ROMs, tape back-up systems and other devices. By using the parallel port as a SCSI connector, even the most humble portable computer users will now have another way to hook up some very powerful add-ons to their machines.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Vladimir May 25 -- "Russia has not lost its leading  positions in the production of firearms and hand guns. We have  something to show and of what to be proud," Major-General  Nikolay Zlenko, representative of the general staff of the armed  forces of the Russian Federation, who arrived today in Vladimir  at the military exhibition as a member of a government  delegation, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday.    According to the general, the high rating of Russian  firearms  is confirmed by a keen interest to them shown by buyers from 17  countries of the world including the United States, Britain,  Germany and Israel.    Despite the difficulties in financing the Russian military-  industrial complex, the defense ministry of the Russian  Federation is still interested in advertising its products and  the permanent participation in exhibitions of armaments and  materiel, the major- general pointed out.    In reply to a question by ITAR-TASS about participation of  the defense ministry in the conversion of defense industry to  peace-time production, Nikolay Zlenko said that this  participation was reflected in dozens of displayed exhibits.    According to the general, the defense ministry has become a  sponsor of a series of developments of hunting rifles on the  basis of a Kalashnikov submachine gun, in particular a "saiga"  carbine.    The defense ministry, Nikolay Zlenko said, also financed the  designing of a rifle for a farmer "of-93", various kinds of  ammunition including for a gas pistol.    This work, the general noted, will be continued with due  account for maintaining of the military potential and mobilizing  possibilities of defense enterprises in Russia.</p>

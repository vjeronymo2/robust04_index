			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Research says aggression possible result of games addiction Many young people become aggressive as a result of being addicted to computer games, with some spending more than four hours a day in simulated armed combat, research presented yesterday at the London conference of the British Psychological Society shows. A survey by psychologist Dr Mark Griffiths and Mr Nigel Hunt, from Plymouth University, suggested that one-in-five teenagers was addicted to such games. They said: 'Approximately one-in-five players admitted to aggressive behaviour as a direct result of their playing.' Only five out of the 387 children aged 12 to 16 surveyed had never played computer games. Almost one in three played every day, and almost half played most days. One in three believed games were addictive, while 20 per cent said they were expensive. Some 3 per cent admitted playing truant to play games, while just over 7 per cent admitted obtaining bad school marks because of their playing.</p>

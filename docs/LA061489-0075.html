			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;  </P> <P> SEASON COMES DOWN TO UNSAVORY FINISH;  </P> <P> LAKERS ASKING WHAT IF AFTER DETOUR  </P> <P> They came, they saw, and they saw some more, mostly the other team winning. But  celebrate the Lakers did not, not for a third consecutive season.  </P> <P> Destiny came calling Tuesday night on the Lakers in resounding fashion, a  four-game sweep by the Detroit Pistons in the NBA finals. The response, while  not noted in the history books, was, "Yeah, but what if . . . "  </P> <P> What if Byron Scott had not missed the series because of a partially torn left  hamstring, suffered in practice the day before Game 1 a week ago Tuesday?  </P> <P> What if Magic Johnson, the league's regular-season most valuable player and the  other Laker starting guard, had not missed practically all of the last two  games, playing only 4 minutes 46 seconds Sunday, thanks to a strained left  hamstring?  </P> <P> What if the Lakers did not lose Game 2 on the road by three points, 108-105,  while giving up five in technical fouls?  </P> <P> "I think if they had won by 15 or 16, we still would have wondered what if,"  Scott said after the Pistons' 105-97 victory at the Forum wrapped up the title.  </P> <P> "We had a car with two wheels off," Coach Pat Riley said. "But the Pistons took  control of that, and that's why we are where we are."  </P> <P> Just where that is, beyond a fast arrival into the off-season, has yet to be  determined.  </P> <P> "What could have been is something that will go down in the record books,"  Riley said. "There's no asterisk next to their (the Pistons') championship;  they deserve it. But the historical significance, that will always bother me  because we had all those lost opportunities.  </P> <P> "That's what gnaws at me the most. Not diminishing what the Pistons did, but  the hole in my stomach will always be there from not knowing.  </P> <P> "We were primed. We were ready. We blew through the playoffs. Then, at the 11th  hour, fate struck, and we never had a chance to gather ourselves."  </P> <P> Scott said: "It's an empty feeling because we never got a real chance. It's an  empty feeling. That's pretty much all you can say."  </P> <P> Orlando Woolridge: "It's very frustrating. We went out and played as hard as we  could with what we had. But we're always going to wonder what might have  happened. What might have happened with Byron and Magic."  </P> <P> Scott: "It's always going to be hard not to think about Earvin and myself not  being in there. There's going to be questions in a lot of people's minds, and  ours.  </P> <P> "It can't compare to any other (series loss), not participating. It was  devastating. I thought possibly it (the injury) was feeling better. I was  hoping the series would go a couple more games and I could get back into shape  to play. It's something I will have to live with. There will always be  questions, buts and ifs, but they are champions now."  </P> <P> What remains are memories, some worth saving, but most to be thrown away. As  soon as possible.  </P> <P> "I grabbed his (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's) jersey when he left it," Riley said of  his souvenir, part of the last Laker uniform Abdul-Jabbar will ever wear. "It  was sweaty, but I grabbed it anyway. . . . It will hang in my closet, with all  those Armani threads of mine."  </P> <P> That was one of the few keepers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Popular Party Free Russia, formally  led by Vasily Lipitsky and informally by Alexander Rutskoy, who  left the party after the October events of 1993 in Moscow, will  enter the Russia's Choice Party organized by Yegor Gaydar, the  former co- chairman of the Popular Party Free Russia Aleksandr  Sharavin told Interfax.    He said that in ten districts of Moscow members of the party  joined the organizing committees of the Russia's Choice Party,  which set the date of its constituent congress for the end of  May - beginning of June.    According to Sharavin, the regional organization of the  Popular Party Free Russia in Astrakhan, Izhevsk, Severodvinsk,  Ulan-Ude, Nizhny Novgorod, Omsk, Tver, Yekaterinburg and other  cities supported the idea of their structures' entry into the  Gaydar party.    Press secretary of the Russia's Choice faction in the State  Duma Anna Tyagunenko told Interfax that Yegor Gaydar has no  objections to the shift of former supporters of Aleksandr  Rutskoy to the Russia's Choice Party, although, in her words,  Gaydar notes a certain awkwardness in the situation.</p>

To preserve a significant economic opportunity that otherwise might be foregone, NMFS is reopening the sablefish hook-and-line fishery in certain areas of the GOA during the September 12&hyph;14, 1994, opening of the Pacific halibut fishery. NMFS is also increasing the directed fishing standard for sablefish in the Southeast Outside District of the GOA during this same time period and is establishing the framework authority to allow an increase in the directed fishing standard for sablefish during any subsequent opening of a Pacific halibut fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 12, 1994 through December 10, 1994.

The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (Magnuson Act), and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR part 672. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At times, amendments to the FMP or its implementing regulations are necessary to respond to fishery conservation and management problems that cannot be addressed within the time frame of the normal procedures provided for by the Magnuson Act. Section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act authorizes the Secretary to implement emergency regulations necessary to address these situations. These emergency regulations may remain in effect for 90 days, with a possible 90-day extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 directed sablefish hook-and-line fishery was open for 10 days in May. During this opening the halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit was reached, but the full sablefish hook-and-line total allowable catch (TAC) amount in the GOA was not harvested. Regulations at &sect;672.20(f)(3)(ii) prohibit directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using hook-and-line gear once the halibut PSC limit, annually specified for vessels using this gear type, is reached.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the GOA was closed to directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using hook-and-line gear (other than demersal shelf rockfish in the Southeast Outside District) under &sect;672.20(f)(3)(ii) from May 28 to December 31, 1994 (59 FR 17737, April 14, 1994; 59 FR 43296, August 23, 1994). However, 6,479 metric tons (mt), or 30 percent, of the 1994 sablefish hook-and-line quota share remains unharvested. Regulations implementing directed fishing standards for sablefish (&sect;672.20(g)(4)(i)) limit retention of this species on a vessel in the hook-and-line fisheries to less than 4 percent of the total amount of all other fish species retained at the same time on the vessel during a fishing trip. The remaining amount of sablefish TAC specified for vessels using hook-and-line gear exceeds potential bycatch needs in the hook-and-line fisheries for nongroundfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) has announced a 48-hour opening of the Pacific halibut fishery from 12 noon Alaska local time (A.l.t.) September 12, 1994 to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994. The halibut opening provides the opportunity for NMFS to reopen the sablefish fishery to allow some of the remaining sablefish TAC to be harvested and revenue to be generated that would otherwise be foregone had the halibut fishery not been opened in September. The IPHC supports a concurrent halibut/sablefish opening in September.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This emergency rule: (1) Opens the GOA sablefish hook-and-line fishery in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas and the West Yakutat district of the Eastern Regulatory Area for the duration of the September Pacific halibut fishery opening, (2) increases the directed fishing standard for sablefish in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA for the duration of the September Pacific halibut fishery opening, and (3) establishes authority for the Regional Director to increase the directed fishing standard for sablefish during any subsequent opening of the halibut fishery. Details of this emergency rule follow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Sablefish Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This emergency rule: (1) Opens the sablefish hook-and-line fishery to directed fishing in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas and in the West Yakutat District of the Eastern Regulatory Area from 12 noon A.l.t. September 12, 1994, to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994; and (2) increases the retainable bycatch amounts of sablefish to 30 percent in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area from 12 noon A.l.t. September 12, 1994, to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The unanticipated circumstances of the May 1994 sablefish fishery left a significant amount (6,479 mt) of sablefish TAC unharvested. A concurrent halibut/sablefish opening would allow optimum utilization of both species. The legal-sized halibut that might be caught in the directed sablefish fishery would be attributed to the IPHC halibut quota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sablefish will remain closed to directed fishing with hook-and-line gear in the Southeast Outside District of the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA during the September 12&hyph;14 halibut opening. Not enough sablefish TAC remains in the Southeast Outside District to support a directed fishery. However, because 455 mt of sablefish remain unharvested in the Southeast Outside District, NMFS will increase the directed fishing standard for sablefish from the current 4 percent to 30 percent from 12 noon A.l.t. September 12 to 12 noon A.l.t. September 14, 1994. The current 4 percent retainable bycatch amount would only allow approximately 109 mt of sablefish to be harvested. Based on NMFS' calculations, an increase in the bycatch retention limit to 30 percent would allow harvest of most of the remaining sablefish in the Southeast Outside District. This would provide increased revenue for that sector of the sablefish industry that fishes in the Southeast Outside District.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

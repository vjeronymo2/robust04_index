He told correspondents that the reports by the National  Statistics and Economic Studies Institute "confirm the  government's scenario of a gradual improvement of economic  activity in France. Hence it would be inappropriate to change  course."    But he added that "There is still one worrisome point: the  irregular trends in consumption." He said that household  consumption of manufactured products would have been up in  December, except that the problems of the auto sector pulled the  increase down to zero.    "The rebound continued in January, and the partial  indicators  are rather promising," he said.    As to French unemployment, now at 12 percent and expected to  rise further, the minister said that "The uptrend has not been  halted, but things on the job front are gradually coming to look  less dark."    Turning to interest rates, Alphandery said he would be  "greatly surprised if we do not observe, in Europe and in  France, a gradual return to the normal yield curve" (long-term  rates higher than short-term rates).    As to possible recapitalization of major bank Credit  Lyonnais, he said he was waiting for release of 1993 financial  reports before making a decision.</p>

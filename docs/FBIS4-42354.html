			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jacques Wallage, state secretary </F> for social affairs, by Bettina Hubo in The Hague; date not  given: "Netherlands Welfare State Heading for Reevaluation"]    [Excerpts] For three weeks now, the PvdA [Labor Party], the  VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and the D66  [Democrats 66] have been assessing the feasibility of a "purple"  government, a mixture of the red of the social democrats and the  blue of the liberals. It would be an action of historic  significance, a Netherlands Government without the Christian  Democrats. Jacques Wallage, the 48-year-old secretary of state  for social affairs and employment in the outgoing government,  and the man generally regarded as the successor of PvdA leader  Wim Kok, believes that the possibility of a "purple" coalition  merits thorough investigation. He does not consider it to be a  drawback that the formation of such a government would mean his  party having to take the plunge with the VVD, his party's  opposite number on financial, social, and economic policy. "A  coalition is a marriage of convenience, not of love," he said.  [passage omitted].    According to Wallage, the credibility of his party need not  necessarily come into play if the PvdA does business with the  VVD. "In the years to come, both workers and employers from  small- and medium-sized companies [SME's] must look to merge  their interests. Together, they will have to agree on a package  of difficult measures. If we expect a social pact to be  possible in the economy, why should a political pact between the  PvdA and the VVD be impossible?" he wondered.    Before it comes to this, the two parties will have to agree  on how to approach the issue of social security. [passage  omitted]    Wallage concedes that the number of people claiming social  security benefits is far too high. Nonetheless, his party does  not want to alter the size of benefits, unlike the VVD, which  favors reducing most benefit payments to 60 percent of the  minimum wage, with individual insurance on top of this. "By  implementing the system better and showing greater  responsibility, the main structure of the social security system  can be kept intact," Wallage claims.  <H5>  Bad Behaviour </H5>   However, the precondition for this is the implementation of  a  good policy on job opportunities, combined with wage restraint  and easing of debts. Moreover, Wallage believes that the social  security system must be reorganized in such a way that people  are given more responsibility of their own. "The present system  does not always provoke good behaviour. Here in the Netherlands  people can still receive a benefit, refuse work, and barely  incur any punishment as a result. We have tolerated the abuse  of social security provisions for too long. The existing system  must be cleansed of those people fiddling it. Otherwise we will  be running the risk of people who are now helping to pay for  this solidarity no longer being prepared to do so in the  future." According to Wallage, the difference between the VVD  and the PvdA consists of the VVD acting as if it still has to  launch the whole reorientation process, while the PvdA is of the  opinion that the "cleansing process" is already under way.  Wallage says: "We have come up with stricter criteria  regarding work disability. The criterion of suitable work has  been replaced by passable work. In the past, a teacher who  became handicapped was declared unfit for work and was  immediately paid a full work disability allowance. Now we are  assuming that the same teacher can still probably perform  another function, using his brains and hands. So he will  receive a much lower benefit and otherwise classified as being  out of work. It will then be his own responsibility to do  everything he can to find a job in line with the options still  open to him."  <H5>  Employers </H5>   [passage omitted] Wallage is interested by the proposal to  help people find work via tax credits. "However, it is an  expensive proposal, because the tax advantage does not go to all  workers. That is why I am wondering whether it might not be  better to let the benefit filter through to employers, who would  then receive tax credits the more workers they took on at the  minimum wage." The state secretary expects that the final  government agreement will include a mixture of both  possibilities.    Since a large group of long-term unemployed will still be  left over despite all the plans regarding jobs and stimulating  measures, Wallage favors creating subsidized jobs, with either  the government or individuals. "The main problem regarding the  long-term unemployed is that people forget how to work.  Consequently, subsidized work, on a voluntary basis, is  something not to be shunned."    Nevertheless, he does see a few pitfalls. "There are two  things to watch out for: The falsification of competition, and  the risk of the person involved earning so much that he is no  longer motivated to move on to nonsubsidized work."    As a result, Wallage believes that the Netherlands welfare  state must be reevaluated, and his party, which is celebrating  its centenary this year, has an important role to play in this.  The state secretary is also opposing the voices in the PvdA  that are clamoring to join forces with other progressive  parties, the D66 and the Green Left, and form a Progressive  People's Party together. Those in favor of such a Progressive  People's Party believe that after a century-long struggle for  emancipation there is no longer any need for a separate social  democracy.    Wallage's response is this: "I would always call myself a  traditional social democrat in the sense that I find the basic  ideas of social democracy to be totally pertinent to the present  day. The party has to adapt its policies but the basic thoughts  are sufficiently `alive' for us to look ahead to the next  century with some degree of self-confidence."    According to Wallage, the emancipation of workers, the  source  of social democracy, has still not been completely achieved.  "There is better access to training, and generally speaking  those people with jobs have a reasonable income. However, the  process of forming an elite is still under way. Consequently,  there are still sharp distinctions culturally speaking.  Moreover, the fact that a consumer society has arisen points to  incomplete development. Emancipation does not consist of  consumption, but rather production, making a contribution. That  form of emancipation has only just begun."</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Fedesarrollo [Higher Education and Development  Foundation] has recommended that the government immediately cut  public spending, keep interest rates at least at their current  level, and place effective controls on the entry of foreign  currency.    These suggestions were made in an editorial of COYUNTURA  ECONOMICA, which will be in circulation within the next few days.    According to Fedesarrollo's director, Eduardo Lora, only if  those three steps are taken will the government and the Bank of  the Republic's board of directors be able to control inflation  and avoid revaluation.    According to Fedesarrollo's analysis, even though the  Colombian economy is behaving very positively, it is essential  to introduce corrections in order to slow down the accelerated  growth of demand and the entry of foreign currency.    Domestic demand for goods and services is growing at 11  percent, while it should not exceed 5 percent. That is, it  should grow at the annual rate of the GDP [gross domestic  product].    The foundation called Minister of Finance Rudolf Hommes'  idea  for lowering domestic interest rates in order to reduce the  differential with international rates unworkable. "If that is  done, it will trigger an acceleration of domestic demand, making  inflation even harder to control," said Lora.    About a year ago Fedesarrollo had proposed reducing domestic  interest rates, but Lora said the circumstances at that time  were different, for then there was no excessive demand or much  business activity.    "A decline in interest rates would accelerate demand and  generate higher inflation. Actually, to reduce the amount of  foreign currency entering Colombia by equalizing domestic and  foreign interest rates, we would need to lower domestic rates by  about 10 points, and that would be catastrophic in terms of  controlling inflation," said Lora.    He added: "If anything should be done to interest rates,  they  should be raised, or at least kept at their current levels, but  not lowered."    Even though Fedesarrollo recognizes the success of the  government's handling of the economy, he cited the need to  introduce tax controls on foreign credit to deter money  laundering and slow down the massive influx of foreign currency.    The foundation did not propose specific controls, but  suggested introducing a 48 percent cash reserves requirement for  all foreign credit, not just for loans made for an 18-month  term, as in the current procedure.  <H5>  Credit Soaring </H5>   Fedesarrollo said private sector loans are now at levels of  $200 million a month; until October 1993 the average was only  $40 million a month.    Fedesarrollo also asked the government to make a new cut in  public spending by at least the amount announced at the start of  this year, equivalent to 360 billion pesos.    Fedesarrollo's director, Eduardo Lora, said that one cause  of  the inflation reported during February is that the government  did not cut spending by the amount it had announced.    According to Fedesarrollo, the February acceleration of the  cost of living was caused primarily by excess demand, not high  food prices or educational costs.    "Putting price controls on foods is not a sound way to  control inflation, for even though people may reduce their  spending on food, it is quite certain that they will increase  their purchases of other goods," said Lora.</p>

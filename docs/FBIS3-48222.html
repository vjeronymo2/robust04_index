The Bank of Korea has revised foreign currency loan-related  regulations in such a way as to expand foreign currency loans to  enterprises in a bid to promote corporate facility investment  and to lessen companies' financial burden, it said yesterday.    Under the revised regulations, the ratio of foreign currency  loans extended to businesses has been raised. The foreign  currency ratio for large-sized manufacturers which import  facility equipment will be raised from 80 percent of import  prices to 90 percent and for small-sized companies, from 90 to  100 percent.    The comparable ratio for enterprises which seek direct  investment abroad will also be raised by 10 percentage points to  70 percent of the invested fund for large companies and by 10  percentage points to 80 percent for small companies.    Along with this, a maximum maturity for foreign currency  loans will be extended from the current eight years to 10 years,  considering long-term fund demands such as importers of plants  or airplanes, the central bank said.    The central bank also abolished regulation requiring  domestic  businesses to acquire prior recommendation from the Ministry of  Industry, Trade and Energy when they import facility equipment  from Japan.    In the past, the recommendation system was introduced to  curb  excessive imports of various facility equipment, including  machinery.    The central bank also allowed foreign currency-dealing banks  to have a free hand in determining grace periods and repayment  methods of foreign currency loans raised by themselves.    Meanwhile, the central bank plans to provide $3 billion out  of its foreign reserve holdings to foreign currency banks in the  first half of the year.    Now, the central bank is offering foreign currency funds at  Libor (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) to foreign currency banks  which in turn loan the funds to enterprises at an annual rate of  0.5-1.0 percent above Libor.</p>

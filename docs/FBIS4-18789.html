			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Theodhoros Rousopoulos] </F>   [Text] UN mediator Cyrus Vance, who will meet Foreign  Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis in New York  tomorrow, has prepared a draft agreement for Athens and Skopje  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM].    Vance will suggest to the Greek ambassador and the Skopjean  foreign minister that they follow a step-by-step approach to the  issue. He will try to bring the two different views closer.  Greece believes that [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov must stop  provocative acts and then discuss the name issue while Skopje  wants comprehensive negotiations after the embargo is lifted.    Vance is expected to suggest the following steps:    A. That both sides assure that they will sit at the  negotiating table and discuss every issue. (Both Gligorov and  Papandreou have said that they intend to discuss the name issue.  Each one stressed that he would try to persuade the other, not  change his own position.)    B. That the discussion be separated into time periods. This  means that a discussion on the symbols and the Constitution may  be held before any other issue is discussed. That a solution  will be found on these issues and after a certain time period  (months or even years) the name issue, which is the most  difficult one, will be discussed.    C. That a discussion first be held at the diplomatic level  and then at the political level. This removes part of the  significance that the political parties of both countries would  attribute to the procedure. The procedure suggested is  essentially the same that was followed during the New Democracy  term, when a dialogue was held between the United Nations and  ambassadors.    The greatest problem so far is the Greek measures against  Skopje. As long as the embargo is maintained, Skopje does not  intend to negotiate. This is why the solution that Cyrus Vance  will suggest looks like Columbus' egg [as published]. Both  sides should mutually retreat, each one mentioning in their  declaration that Greece will lift the embargo and Skopje will  cancel its flag and reexamine its positions on the constitution  and the borders. Therefore, tomorrow's meeting at the United  Nations is considered critical because Vance will try to  persuade the two sides. The truth is that not much effort is  needed to achieve this. The problem is clearly a procedural one  so that neither side is politically exposed in its country.  <H5>  The Appeal </H5>   At the same time, the international community will increase  pressure on Skopje and Athens. The United States is trying to  show Gligorov that a lot depends on his stance if it is to help  him during the elections in November. With the presence of U.S.  troops, the United States will provide Gligorov with security.  The United States is also asking him to retreat from  intransigent positions.    The European Union [EU] is still pressuring Greece, and for  the first time in its history it appealed against the presiding  country at the European Court. The European Commission will  wait until Wednesday (the outcome at the United Nations) before  deciding whether to finally refer our country to court.    In court--which will confer behind closed doors because  political, public order, and international tension issue will be  discussed--our country will have to deal with great  difficulties. Despite assurances by government spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos that there are no penalties and fines are  not imposed easily, some European politicians have already given  the go ahead to the EU to impose economic sanctions against  Greece.    We are now in a strange situation: Our country, one of the  12, is facing sanctions within the EU and its only hope for a  solution to the problem is through the United Nations, or to be  exact, the United States.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Elf expects takeover clearance THE Department of Trade and Industry is expected soon to give Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil group, clearance to take over the UK petrol-station and refinery business of Amoco, the US oil group. Elf's lawyers are understood to be confident that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which has been asked to investigate the deal, has no serious objections to the French company's politically sensitive Pounds 300m purchase. British officials in Paris would not comment on the MMC inquiry, which has provoked intense irritation in French government circles. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, referred the deal to the MMC in December, even though the Office of Fair Trading advised him there was no need to do so. It is one of four acquisitions by French state-owned companies referred by the DTI to the MMC since the department hardened its stance on acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies last July, because of fears that they might represent covert nationalisations. The MMC has cleared the other three French deals - two acquisitions by the bank, Credit Lyonnais, and the proposed merger of the missiles businesses of Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics company, and British Aerospace. The MMC sent its report on Elf to the DTI at the end of March. Publication of the decision is expected soon. Mr Loik Le Floch Prigent, Elf's chairman, has strongly denied the suggestion that the French state, rather than his management, makes the main decisions at the oil group. Elf is 55.6 per cent owned by the state, but the French government generally restricts its involvement in the company to choosing the chairman. 'I can assure you that I am the patron. Nobody is looking over my shoulder,' he said before defending the bid at an MMC hearing. As a mark of Elf's confidence that the MMC will not overturn the deal, it last month announced plans to spend Pounds 36m on increasing the unleaded-petrol capacity of Amoco's refinery at Milford Haven. The investment is to be made in partnership with Murphy Oil Corporation of the US. The Amoco acquisition also includes 250 petrol stations, which would lift Elf's share of UK petrol distribution to about 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Mining equipment factory to close ANDERSON, the mining equipment subsidiary of Charter, the industrial holding company, is to make 157 people redundant and close its plant at Bridgeton in Glasgow. It will concentrate production at Motherwell, Lanarkshire, James Buxton writes. The Bridgeton plant, which employs 239 people, makes coalmine tunnelling equipment. Some 97 people will lose their jobs there and the remaining 142 will be transferred to Motherwell, where 60 employees will also be made redundant. Mr Alasdair MacLaughlan, chief executive, blamed the further restructuring on the halving of the number of coalfaces operated by British Coal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Jacques Jacquet-Francillon: "The Time for </F> Decisions"]    [Text] It is certainly unusual to find a French foreign  minister seeking a way out of the quagmire in Bosnia to hold a  meeting at the highest level in Washington on the very eve of  the meeting in Geneva of the U.S., Russian, German, British, and  French foreign ministers.    But to what end? And with what cards in his hand?    Did Alain Juppe have any chance of persuading his  interlocutors on the other side of the Atlantic to abandon their  cautious reserve simply by threatening to withraw our blue  helmets?    Of course, France is entitled to speak loud and clear,  because it can legitimately invoke the argument that we have  done more than others: We break the record for the number of  men in UN uniform in the former Yugoslavia, and also that of the  number of men killed and wounded.    But who asked us to do this?    We wanted to set a good example. We were not really followed  by our allies, aside from the British, to a very relative  degree. We are now pretending to be determined to "pull out,"  as our military say, if they continue to "abandon us."    But are we credible?    At a time when [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur is telling  the National Assembly that "the time for decisions is  approaching," Alain Juppe merely says in Washington that "the  withdrawal of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops may be  inevitable," and that, in any case, "it is not possible to spend  another winter in Bosnia."    The time for decisions is therefore not as close as all  that.  And this is understandable. Why, after having invested so much  -- rightly or wrongly -- withdraw at the very time when a  settlement seems conceivable, however dreadful it might seem?    The Serbs have virtually achieved all their objectives. The  Russians, French, British, and other so-called "Europeans" are  thoroughly humiliated and are prepared to accept the fait  accompli, to turn a blind eye to everything they have condemned,  provided there is a piece of paper, carrying God knows whose  signatures, which makes it possible to forget the nightmare for  a moment.    The problem is that Bill Clinton and his advisers, who have  taken care not to venture into the Balkan hornet's nest, do not  agree with this kind of arrangement. The Americans are  portraying themselves, at little cost for the time being, as the  defenders of the Bosnian Muslims. They want the arms embargo to  be lifted in their favor and they will not consider easing the  sanctions imposed on Belgrade in any way.    The United States did not fight the Gulf War for nothing. It  is the new defender of the Arab world; and it is in this role  that the U.S. secretary of state will take his seat in Geneva  today.    Mr. Juppe was right to sound the alarm in Washington.  America certainly hears it ringing but usually with earplugs in  its ears.</p>

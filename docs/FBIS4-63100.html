			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 15, RIA -- We have come to the  conclusion that the word "partnership" in the phrase partnership  for peace should be given a deeper meaning, said Russia's  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. It will not be difficult to  sign the existing Partnership for Peace document, and Russia has  nothing against the framework agreement.    But since Russia believes that this document should be  amended to take into account Russia's specific features and its  relations with NATO, it will need time to draft the said  document. It will not take long and the document is expected to  be signed and formalised as a protocol, as President Yeltsin  said in Bonn. Anyway, our intentions are serious and we are  working hard to draft the document as soon as possible, Kozyrev  said.</p>

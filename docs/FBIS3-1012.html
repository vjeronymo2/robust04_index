Doonan] </F>   [Text] Ulundi March 17 SAPA -- Friday's meeting between  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African National Congress  [ANC] President Nelson Mandela appears to be off.    Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] National Chairman Frank Mdlalose  told the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA] on Thursday that the  ANC had objected to the Ulundi venue and had requested it be  changed to Durban. Dr Mdlalose however said King Zwelithini  wanted to meet in the kwaZulu capital. He said the ANC's Natal  premier Jacob Zuma had expressed fear for Mr Mandela's safety in  Ulundi.    Dr Mdlalose said the ANC had expressed fears of an  assassination attempt on Mr Mandela in Ulundi. He relayed  details of telephonic contacts between himself and Mr Zuma on  Wednesday night and Thursday morning in which Mr Zuma said his  headquarters had received reports of "disturbances of the  meeting and the assassination of Mr Mandela".    Dr Mdlalose said he had assured Mr Zuma of the ANC  president's safety, and had invited security personnel to the  kwaZulu capital before and during Friday's planned meeting.    He added that Mr Zuma had also expressed reservations about  a  planned gathering of Zulus outside the meeting venue and had  suggested it be moved to Durban. "I indicated I did not know  where in Durban a spot would be where Zulus couldn't get to," he  said. Dr Mdlalose said Mr Zuma had told him that unless the  meeting could take place in Durban it should be postponed.    Meanwhile, addressing the KLA later, Inkatha Freedom Party  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had arranged for extra  South African Police in Ulundi on Friday, saying "only an insane  person" would try to assassinate the ANC leader.    He said Friday's meeting would go ahead with or without the  ANC president, adding that the king would address his subjects  on elections and the constitution at a mass gathering in Ulundi.</p>

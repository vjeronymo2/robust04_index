			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Inquiry starts after six die in ferry walkway collapse Workmen at Ramsgate port in Kent look down on the section of ferry walkway which collapsed in the early hours of yesterday morning, catapulting six people to their deaths and injuring seven others. The walkway - the highest in use at an English Channel ferry port - crashed down from its mounting on the central pillar on to a vehicle ramp about 50 feet below. The accident happened as the last foot passengers were boarding a Belgian ferry, the Prins Filip, for an overnight crossing to Ostend. Accident investigators will today step up their inquiries into the reason for the collapse. The walkway was installed in March by a Swedish company, Feab. Designers from the company arrived yesterday to examine the structure. Report, Page 9</p>

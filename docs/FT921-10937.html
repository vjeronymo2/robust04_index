			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BT considers selling Aeradio in refocusing BRITISH Telecommunications is considering selling International Aeradio, its airport and hospital management subsidiary, as part of its strategy of refocusing on telecommunication services. IAL, with annual turnover of some Pounds 100m, is one of the larger acquisitions made by BT after its privatisation which no longer fits into the core activity of running telecommunication networks. Recently, BT said it was trying to sell the much smaller Telecom Security, its alarm business. BT said yesterday that there was nothing active happening with IAL, which was bought from STC, the electronics group, in 1986. IAL runs hospitals in overseas territories, particularly in the Middle East. It also manages airline security systems. These activities were no longer considered core to BT. But other parts of IAL may still be considered by BT to fit in with its strategy, including its airport communications businesses and overseas offices.</p>

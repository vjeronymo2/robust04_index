He said that his territory experienced a dire energy crisis.  Meanwhile, the federal debt to Khabarovsk territory for the  manufactured products and for the seasonal transportation of  loads to the northern districts of the Amur region amounts to  billions of rubles, said Ishayev.    The situation is aggravated by the forced stoppage of local  industrial enterprises which cannot make planned payments to the  federal budget.</p>

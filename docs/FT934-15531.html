			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (13): Apply the birch gently - Christopher Brown-Humes on saunas THE foreign businessman on a trip to Finland should prepare himself for a visit to the sauna. The chances are that your host will invite you - all the big companies have their own saunas, but the venue could equally well be a hotel or public sauna. It could even be that that vital deal is clinched over a relaxing post-sauna drink. The first thing the visitor should understand is that natural modesty needs to be cast aside. The Finnish custom is to take the sauna naked and any attempt to conceal business lunch flab or other physical attributes will only attract strange looks. In principle, the routine is simple. You shower, you sweat in a wooden-planked hot-room for a few minutes, you cool down with a swim, and then you retire to drink, feeling the day's tension palpably ebbing from your system as you do so. The cycle is usually repeated at least twice. However, the uninitiated should be on the alert. For a start, there is the question of how long you can stick the heat. Watch out for the sadist in your group who delights in throwing water onto the heated sauna stones to intensify the humidity. The paranoid will conclude he is doing it deliberately to test your resistance level. Then you need to know how to handle the bundle of birch leaves which will almost certainly be thrust into your hand as you enter the hot room of a country sauna. It is not to be used to thrash your fellow bathers (despite the temptation to take revenge on the sadist) but gently applied to your own torso to stimulate circulation of the blood and aid perspiration. Finally, there is the cold swim routine. In the countryside, that almost certainly means a plunge into a freezing lake, rather than a swimming pool. Your hosts will graciously tell you this bit is optional, but in practice it is as difficult to avoid as an invitation to sing in a Japanese karaoke bar. Two notions need to be disabused. One is that you will be plied with liberal quantities of alcohol to assist the perspiration process. At public saunas, only soft drinks and alcohol-free beers are on sale. In a private sauna, it is more likely that you will be offered something stronger. Secondly, you must forget the idea that you will be nudging up to a member of the opposite sex in the hot room. In all public saunas, men and women are strictly segregated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan 21 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Malaysian  International Industry and Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz has  ensured the presence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed at the  next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum to be held in Indonesia in November this year. After a  meeting with Indonesian Trade Minister S.B. Judono here Friday,  Minister Rafidah Aziz said Prime Minister Mahathir will surely  attend the next informal meeting of the leaders of the APEC  member countries.    Like the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), both APEC and the  East  Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) are expected to boost cooperation  among nations, including those in the ASEAN region, she said.    Economic ministers of the ASEAN member countries will also  hold a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in April 1995 to discuss a long  term program of the organization which groups Malaysia,  Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei  Darussalam, she said. The Kuala Lumpur meeting, according to  Minister Rafidah Aziz, is expected to also discuss the Uruguay  Round of GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs). ASEAN  has a common interest in the results of the agreement, she said.    The Malaysian minister said that during the meeting with her  counterpart, Trade Minister S.B. Judono, both sides agreed to  sign an agreement on investment guarantee on Saturday (January  22) and to amend the previous trade accord between the two  countries. Trade relations between the two countries have been  running smoothly so far, she said.    Meanwhile, Minister Judono said there is always a  possibility  of accelerating the implementation of the Common Effective  Preferential Tariff (CEPT) from 15 years to 10 years as Malaysia  has suggested. However, he said "We should first implement what  was agreed upon by the ASEAN member countries last year and see  how the progress is."    Indonesia's exports to the neighbouring country include  tobacco, paper, vegetable oil, coal and textiles, while its  imports among other things are steel, chemical substance and  machinery.    The total value of the bilateral trade in 1992 reached about  one billion dollars, with a deficit of 37 million US dollars for  Indonesia.    During the first semester of last year, Indonesia recorded a  trade surplus from its exports worth 326.3 million dollars to  Malaysia, while its imports worth only 198.8 million dollars.</p>

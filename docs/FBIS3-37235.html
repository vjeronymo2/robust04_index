			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Nadein: "United States Wants Showcase </F> Cooperation With Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Washington -- Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of  Kazkahstan, currently in Washington, is better known here than  his country, although this is not surprising for the United  States, where geography is not a separate subject in schools.    The Russian bias, of which the present U.S. administration  has long been accused, recently found yet another critic --  serious and unexpected -- in the shape of Nazarbayev.    In contrast to the Ukrainians, for example, the Kazakhstan  leader has invariably been courteous toward Moscow. That is now  a thing of the past. Last week, on the eve of his second U.S.  visit, Nazarbayev added his voice to the chorus of those for  whom assistance for Moscow has long since ceased to be a symbol  of the general rush to democracy.    Two years ago Nazarbayev's position contrasted sharply with  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's pronouncements. At that  time the Kazakhstan leader did not follow the Ukrainian guest's  example and refused to criticize Russia, which made a very  favorable impression on the former administration.    This time Kravchuk will be coming to Washington a few weeks  after Nazarbayev. Specialists believe that on this occasion  their views of Moscow, while not coinciding, will not be too  different.    Following the dramatic changes in Russian domestic and  foreign policy, Kazakhstan has acquired special importance for  the West. It is the only one of the major post-Soviet nuclear  states to move toward nuclear-free status, somewhat more slowly  than Washington probably would have liked, but not by fits and  starts. Small and large enterprises are being privatized here  consistently and more quickly than anywhere else in the former  USSR. The enormous oil deposits, surpassed only by the reserves  in the Persian Gulf, give hope of an influx of hard currency and  financial stabilization.    Of course, hard currency for Baykonur -- that is, joint  missile launches, participation in international  telecommunications programs, and admittance to the high  technology club -- remains a dream. That was the motivation  behind Nazarbayev's agreement to join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation treaty. For its 104 heavy ICBM's, each with 10  nuclear warheads, Kazakhstan will get $311 million next year --  three times as much as expected. When Secretary of State  Christopher visited the Kazkahstan capital last fall he insisted  that Nazarbayev sign the nonproliferation treaty. Nazarbayev  refused. Well aware that the possession of nuclear weapons  makes his country the object of international attention, the  president of Kazakhstan would only agree to a ceremony in the  White House -- with President Clinton. The Clinton  administration would be happy to arrange some kind of showcase  cooperation, in particular in the economic sphere. But this  depends only to a limited extent on the administration. More  than 50 major U.S. corporations are already operating in  Kazakhstan, but they are cautious and in no rush, and their  participation falls far short of what the country needs.</p>

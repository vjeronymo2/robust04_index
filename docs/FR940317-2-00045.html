The Council recognizes a need to accelerate the development, commercialization, and use of innovative environmental technologies to maintain and improve environmental quality at home and abroad into the 21st century. Environmental quality would deteriorate, given foreseeable population growth and industrialization, unless technology is developed and more broadly applied, that is more effective in preventing and reducing pollution levels, less costly than existing technology and supportive of sustainable development. EPA, state and local agencies are in a unique position to influence the rate and focus of environmental technology innovation and use because of their legislative and programmatic mandates and regulatory responsibilities (which often influence the demand for environmental technologies, goods and services).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ADDRESS> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

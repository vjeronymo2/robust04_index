			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Clinton offers gain through pain: Democratic party's economic plans are attacked by Bush AS THE Rep-ublican party prepares for its convention in Houston next week, a top priority is to find a way to regain the initiative on economic policy. Republicans, like British Conservatives, have traditionally seen economic management as one of their electoral strong suits. This year nothing is going according to plan. Instead of recovering strongly, the economy is wallowing in its third successive year of quasi-recession. To add to this frustration, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has seized the initiative with a detailed economic plan emphasising the need for more investment in education, training and infrastructure. After a few weeks of disarray the Bush administration is beginning to formulate a response. The main line of attack - reminiscent of that used by the Tories against Labour in the British election - is to depict Mr Clinton as an irresponsible proponent of higher taxes, spending and government regulation. The strategy is to cast doubt both on Mr Clinton's record as governor of Arkansas and his plans for the nation. Vice-President Dan Quayle has accused Mr Clinton of raising taxes and fees in Arkansas 128 times in 11 years. The Clinton campaign argues the true figure is about 55, and points out that Mr Quayle has overlooked the 48 tax cuts passed by Mr Clinton. There is perhaps more mileage in attacking Mr Clinton's economic plan. Mr Dick Armey, the top Republican on Congress's joint economic committee, this week bitterly attacked his proposals, claiming that higher taxes and a sweeping array of new regulations would lead to 1.8m job losses next year and more than 3m over a Clinton presidency. Mr Clayton Yeutter, a top White House aide, said the Democratic package would result in a Dollars 300bn (Pounds 157bn) budget deficit in 1996, about 50 per cent higher than projected on current Republican plans. Democrats immediately claimed the charges misrepresented Mr Clinton's proposals. The Democrats, however, are vulnerable in one respect. Like Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader of the UK Labour party, Mr Clinton has committed himself to raising taxes on the wealthy. He hopes to raise Dollars 92bn over four years by increasing taxes on the top 2 per cent of earners and by imposing a special millionaire's surtax. This is to be balanced by minor tax cuts for many middle-income families. Republicans argue that higher taxes on the wealthy will depress growth next year and directly cost about 440,000 jobs. They are also trying to undermine confidence in Mr Clinton's health care, training and environmental proposals. On health care, for example, Mr Clinton supports a version of the 'play or pay' reform advocated by congressional Democrats under which companies would be required to insure all employees or to contribute towards the cost of an expanded federal scheme for the low paid. To improve workforce skills, Mr Clinton argues that all employers should be required to spend 1.5 per cent of payroll on training. The Republicans say both policies amount to the imposition of new taxes on employers and thus will lead to more unemployment. This is not necessarily true: given the flexibility of US labour markets, the burden could be borne in lower wages. But it is hard for Democrats to deny that policies intended to improve long-term competitiveness could impose extra short-run costs on some businesses. How the Republican critique will play with voters remains uncertain. At present President George Bush is labouring under two big disadvantages. His record is poor. He has presided over the slowest economic growth and the biggest federal deficits of any administration since the second world war. Federal domestic spending has grown at an annual rate of more than 8 per cent in real terms, the fastest since the Kennedy administration of the early 1960s. Mr Bush can hardly attack Democrats as big spenders. Even worse, he still has no clear economic strategy. Conservatives are urging him to promise swingeing cuts in income and capital taxes in a second term. But a revival of the 1980s supply-side nostrums would make a nonsense of Mr Bush's recent support for a controversial constitutional amendment to balance the budget. After 12 years in which the federal debt has quadrupled to Dollars 4,000bn, nobody would believe he could both slash taxes and eliminate the deficit. Against this backdrop Mr Clinton has the advantage of offering something genuinely new. The heart of his cure for a debilitating slowdown in US productivity growth is a shift of spending from consumption to investment, with special attention to workforce skills and infrastructure. Given the economic disillusionment of recent years, Democrats hope that voters may find such a strategy more plausible than the quick fixes of the last decade, even if it involves some sacrifices.</p>

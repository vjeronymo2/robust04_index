			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sao Paulo -- Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio  Fleury will boycott today's meeting of the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] state Executive Board, at which  former Governor Orestes Quercia intends to request the party's  support for his candidacy for the presidency. Fleury is not a  member of the Executive Board and therefore his presence at the  meeting is not mandatory. Executive Board Chairman Roberto  Rollemberg wanted to take advantage of this meeting to ask  Quercia and Fleury to make up their minds about their  candidacies.    Fleury's strategy is to stall for time so as to avoid giving  an answer to Quercia's request to endorse his candidacy. Fleury  still dreams about the possibility of being chosen by the PMDB  to run for the presidency. He feels his name could be an  alternative for the party in light of the rejection of Quercia's  candidacy by national leaders and [Deputy] Antonio Britto's  [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul] refusal to stand as a PMDB candidate.  [passage omitted]    Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos [PMDB-Sao Paulo] -- government  leader in the Chamber of Deputies and anti-Quercia -- is a  member of the PMDB state Executive Board, but on 20 February did  not know whether he would attend the meeting. Santos is  scheduled to go to Bandeirantes Palace [Sao Paulo Government  House], but he argues that prior commitments in Brasilia will  prevent him from participating in both meetings. From the PMDB  bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, Luiz Carlos Santos, Jorge Tadeu  Mudalen, Ari Kara, Roberto Rollemberg, Wagner Rossi, Walter  Nory, and Maurici Mariano are considered faithful to Fleury,  whereas Alberto Goldman, Marcelo Barbieri, Paulo Novaes, Carlos  Nelson, and Manoel Moreira are considered pro-Quercia. Quercia  has a large majority on the executive boards of the interior and  in nearly 300 municipalities.</p>

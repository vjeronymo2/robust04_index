			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAR ON FOREIGN SALES OF BANNED PESTICIDES URGED;  </P> <P> IMPORTED FOODS FOUND TO CONTAIN CHEMICALS THAT ARE ILLEGAL IN U.S.  </P> <P> Traces of two pesticides banned in the United States have been found in  imported coffee, carrots, pineapples, meat and other food products, showing  that U.S. consumers are endangered by chemical companies' sales of such  products overseas, the environmental group Greenpeace charged in a report  released Tuesday.  </P> <P> "If these products are too toxic to be used here, they are too toxic to be used  anywhere," Sandra Marquardt, a Greenpeace activist, said at a news conference.  </P> <P> The group criticized what it called a "circle of poison" that infects the food  chain, from polar bears to dolphins, and asked Congress to prohibit the  production for sale abroad of chemicals suspected of causing cancer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Imports Tested  </P> <P> Because only 1% to 2% of all produce entering the United States is tested, the  extent of contamination is unknown, Marquardt said. But last year, the report  said, two shipments of Honduran beef totaling 40,000 pounds were found to  contain eight times the allowable levels of chlordane and heptachlor, which are  banned in the United States.  </P> <P> Contamination has also been found in some fruits, cheese and garbanzo beans.  </P> <P> In some countries that import large quantities of food from nations in which  U.S.-banned chemicals are commonly used, mother's milk has been found to  contain 15 to 150 times the level of the pesticides allowed in cow's milk in  the United States, the report said.  </P> <P> Greenpeace singled out Velsicol Chemical Corp., the sole producer of chlordane  and heptachlor, for criticism of its overseas marketing. The report said that  the Chicago-based company has exported 5 million pounds of the pesticides to  two dozen countries over the last two years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm Defends Products  </P> <P> Velsicol spokeswoman Donna Jennings responded that, although the chemicals have  been banned in the United States because of health concerns, they are safe and  pose no threat to consumers.  </P> <P> "Greenpeace is not basing their charges on science," she said. "It's garbage."  </P> <P> But the environmental organization said that Congress will not be providing  effective protection until it expands the chemical ban.  </P> <P> "Congress must stop the production and sale of pesticides that cannot be sold  in the U.S.," Marquardt said. "These products are showing up in our food."  </P> <P> About 50 countries have banned or restricted the use of the pesticides, the  report said.  </P> <P> They are used commonly in Third World countries that do not monitor chemicals  extensively and need economical pesticides to maximize their agricultural  production, the report said.  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency barred most agricultural uses of the  chemicals in 1978 after studies of their potentially carcinogenic effects. In  1988, the company halted all domestic sales under an agreement with the  government.  </P></p>

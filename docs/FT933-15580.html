			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Tec chiefs vote today on central body HUNDREDS of directors of Training and Enterprise Councils will today decide whether they want a strong central representative body, on the lines of the Confederation of British Industry. The vote, which is at the heart of how the 82 Tecs in England and Wales see themselves, will be held at their third annual conference, at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. Tecs, which are employer-led, administer more than Pounds 2bn of public funds on government-funded training programmes. They also seek to improve the training of people in work and stimulate economic development. Agreement in principle is likely to be given at the conference to a new national body, called the National Tec Council, which will replace the much criticised G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen that represents common concerns to the government. Directors will then debate how powerful the new council should be. Some Tec directors, most of whom are senior business leaders, believe that Tecs have insufficient say with the government and want an authoritative lobbying body. Others believe that if such a body was created they would lose their local autonomy - the key ingredient to which some Tecs attribute their growing success. A small but vociferous group of directors is against any diminution of their direct contact with the government. They are likely to support the appointment of a part-time chairman and annual budget of around Pounds 500,000. Others want a full-time director-general backed by a strong secretariat. After the vote there will be keynote speeches by three secretaries of state  -whose attendance, along with several junior ministers, indicates the important the government gives to Tecs. An important and controversial theme at the conference will be the priority that most Tecs place on economic development - rather than running the publicly-funded training schemes for the unemployed and Youth Training, the scheme for young people. Tecs argue that unless they are able to help create enterprises there will be fewer jobs. They are likely to be pleased by the new employment secretary, Mr David Hunt, who is expected to tell them that he sees them as prime movers in economic development.</p>

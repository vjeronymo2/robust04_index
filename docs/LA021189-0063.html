			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC WOMEN TURN IT AROUND ON UCLA  </P> <P> Billie Moore, in her 12th season coaching the UCLA women's basketball team, can  always be counted on to deliver the brutal truth.  </P> <P> "I believe that this game probably set basketball back 10 years," she said in  summing up USC's 90-75 victory over UCLA Friday night at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> Indeed, UCLA played poorly and USC, while executing only slightly better,  nevertheless blew away the Bruins.  </P> <P> The revenge motive seemed to work for the Trojans, who well-remembered the  Bruins' 76-62 victory at the Sports Arena last month. No one for USC wanted to  see that happen again.  </P> <P> "I think everyone knew it," Karon Howell, USC's senior forward said.  </P> <P> The Bruins' guards -- young and skittish -- were the focus of the Trojan  attack.  </P> <P> "That was their game plan," Moore said. "Attack our guards and see how they  would handle it. They didn't handle it."  </P> <P> The Bruins committed 20 turnovers and were outrebounded, 49-38.  </P> <P> The Trojans led at the half, 48-33.  </P> <P> USC Coach Linda Sharp was pleased with her team's defensive play, especially in  contrast to the previous game against UCLA.  </P> <P> "It was a factor," she said. "We have two seniors here, playing their last time  at UCLA. They have been on their younger teammates all week."  </P> <P> One of those seniors, Cherie Nelson, was particularly effective. Nelson led all  scorers with 33 points and had 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> USC led by as many as 28 points. Although the Bruins made several small runs at  the Trojans, they never brought the deficit into single digits.  </P> <P> "We really didn't start playing our tempo until about 5 minutes to go," Moore  said. "That's easy to do when you're 24 points down. There's no pressure."  </P> <P> Althea Ford had 16 points for UCLA and DeDe Mosman had 14 points, including two  3-pointers.  </P> <P> USC is 8-12 overall and 4-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference. UCLA is 9-11 and 5-5.  </P></p>

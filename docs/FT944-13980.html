			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Best third-term result in five years for Maytag Maytag, the US home-appliance company that makes Hoover products, reported a surge in net income, to Dollars 61m from Dollars 23m, for the three months to September, on revenues up 10 per cent at Dollars 848.9m, writes Richard Tomkins in New York. It said it was the company's best third-quarter performance in five years. Part of the increase was attributable to a one-time tax benefit of Dollars 20m resulting from prior operating losses and reorganisation costs in Europe, but Maytag said that even setting this aside, net profits were up 78 per cent. In North America, the home appliance operations were having an 'outstanding' year, and in floor care, Hoover was having its best year since joining the company in 1989.</p>

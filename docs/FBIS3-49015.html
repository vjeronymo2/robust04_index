			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina </F> Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo by an unidentified  correspondent on 2 January; Silajdzic speaks in English fading  into German translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer Wolfgang Labuhn] Yesterday we asked Haris  Silajdzic, prime minister of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  since last October, about the prospects for his country in 1994.  Via a satellite telephone link to his official residence in the  Bosnian capital, we asked him first of all how the people of  Sarajevo experienced the New Year.    [Silajdzic] Here in Sarajevo it was the same as it has been  over the last year. Five people died and 35 were injured on New  Year's Eve. [passage indistinct] First, we have to come to a  negotiated settlement, something that is unlikely because of the  Serb position. The second possibility is that the international  community should finally do its duty and intervene to end the  aggression and the genocide directed against Bosnia-  Herzegovina. The third possibility also involves the  intervention of the international community, but for the victim,  whose state and people are a member of the United Nations. In  imposing an embargo against us, the international community has  intervened for the first time in favor of the aggressor. Our  hands are now tied and we have been suffering this aggression  for two years now. There is no doubt that genocide is being  committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the international community  will not let us defend ourselves. We have taken part in  negotiations, we have tried our best. Because the international  community is not prepared to use force, the Serb negotiators are  practically ignoring it.    [Correspondent] Mr. Silajdzic, you are demanding that the  international community intervene. What should be the aim of  foreign intervention -- merely a military victory over the  Serbs, or the complete reestablishment of the former territory  of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian  Government?    [Silajdzic] The aim is clearly defined in the UN Charter as  well as in the resolutions of the UN Security Council, the CSCE,  the World Human Rights Conference, etc. The aim would be to end  the genocide and to restore order in this region on the basis of  the UN Charter of international law. This is to stop the  aggression directed against Bosnia-Herzegovina if the aggressor  does not want to conclude a real peace. Unfortunately, we  cannot make peace -- we have not made war. Neither do we have  the means to (?conclude) peace. One thing is important --  lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is  argued, would only add fuel to the fire in Bosnia. But we all  know that our postwar peace rested on a balance of power and  that principle worked for 50 years. Precisely this principle,  alongside many others, has been abandoned in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  You have said that we will not give you weapons, but we cannot  help you either.    The outcome is very clear and it is that the Serb aggressors  have conquered Bosnian territory and are naturally refusing to  withdraw because no force is used against them. They are  dealing with a defenseless population with very few arms. This  imbalance is leading to yet more war. If there is a balance of  forces there is no war. That is the problem we have. We hope  the time has come to take action, either by restoring this  balance so that we can make peace ourselves through the balance  of forces, or by the international community either putting  pressure on the Serbs or intervening itself.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that you will not return to  the Geneva negotiating table to discuss the Owen-Stoltenberg  plan, which foresees the division of your country into three  parts, a Muslim, a Croatian and a Serb part?    [Silajdzic] I think it was very explicit from the statement  that I gave you that we are looking for a negotiated solution.  We have taken part in all negotiating processes and are still  prepared to do so. But our people are dying every day while we  travel from one meeting to the next. Civilians are dying every  day in our towns, in Sarajevo, in Mostar, in Tuzla, in Zenica,  and in other towns. It is like a medieval siege of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, an aggression and, without any doubt,  genocide. The international community therefore has an  obligation, and if negotiations fail, then other measures have  to be taken.    Otherwise, the Bosnians must assume that they have been  condemned to death by the international community. Many people  in Bosnia already believe that by its attitude, by its wish not  to get involved, the international community has intervened on  the part of the aggressor, has facilitated the position of the  aggressor by disarming us and has thus condemned us to death.</p>

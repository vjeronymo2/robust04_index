			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] DERA BABA NANAK (Gurdaspur), 27 Dec -- Director  General of Punjab Police [DGP], Mr. Kanwarpal Singh Gill, today  said that the Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan was  trying to allure the Sikh youths residing in the European  countries to come forward to give a new thrust to the Khalistan  movement.    Mr. Gill was talking to newsmen at the Border Security Force  outpost of Rossay where he said that the Pakistan agency had  also promised arms training and financial help to these youth  for achieving their goal.    Mr. Gill said that for this purpose a few training camps had  been started by the ISI alongside the Afghanistan border. He  also disclosed that all those Punjabi youths who had gone abroad  on fake papers had been contacted by the Pakistani agency and  these people were being motivated in the name of Khalistan.    Mr. Gill disclosed that nearly five hundred youth living in  Europe have fallen prey to this trap of the ISI and the agency  was now trying to bring them to Pak for training purposes.    Replying to a question the DGP said that about ten group  leaders of the militants, including Pritam Singh Sekhon, Lakhbir  Singh Rode and Wassan Singh Zaffarwal were still living in  Pakistan.    The DGP also announced that special recruitment drive would  be launched in the border districts from next month to recruit  youth to the Punjab police.    He assured that the youth fulfilling the required  qualification and physical fitness test would be recruited. The  DGP also expressed happiness over holding of the rural sports in  the area, which was once known as hotbed of militantcy. The DGP,  while commenting on the operation clean up in the department,  said that more than six deputy superintendent of police and over  thirty lower ranking policemen had been sacked for their  involvement in various cases of corruption.    When asked to comment that banning of dharnas [sit-in  strike]  and demonstrations of the Akalis amounted to infringement of  their democratic rights as they were the recognised political  parties, the DGP said that dharnas, demonstrations would be  allowed in the State, provided militancy is completely wiped out.    Responding to another question, he said that though all the  companies of CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force], which were  sent to other States on the eve of recent Assembly elections had  returned to the State "but they have not been pressed into  service."    Speaking on the occasion, the IGP [Inspector General of  Police] (border range), Mr. D.R. Bhatti, dwelt on the new role  that the State police had undertaken in the service of humanity,  including promotion of sports and cultural activities.    The SSP [Senior Superintendent of Police] of Batala police  district, Mr. Rohit Chaudhary, said that a number of steps had  been taken to improve police interaction with the people and  thus in the process shoulder a greater social responsibility of  shaping a cleaner and stronger society.    A youth cell headed by the SP [Superintendent of Police]  (Operations), he said, has been formed for implementing schemes  for guiding the youths in matters calling for specific  attention. The members of this cell are leading industrialists,  college teachers and social workers. Camps at border towns to  guide the youths on physical efficiency tests in the  para-military forces and the police forces would be organised.  The first camp will be held at Dera Baba Nanak on 7 Jan. to be  followed by at Fatehgarh Churian on 16 Jan. and at Kalanaur on  25 Jan.</p>

As reported today by Galina Sidorova,  political aide to the Russian foreign minister at the end of the  first round of Russian-Chinese talks today, the second  Russian-Chinese summit will be preceded by a trip by Viktor  Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, to Beijing, as  well as by a trip to Moscow by PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin made an official visit to  Beijing in December 1992. His visit ended the process of  complete normalization of relations between the two countries,  having opened up extensive possibilities for the establishment  of new, good-neighborly and friendly contacts.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Quiligotti shares suspended DEALINGS IN shares of Quiligotti, which makes and installs terrazzo and other specialised industrial flooring, were suspended at 2 1/4 p at the company's request pending the announcement of results for the year to March 30, expected today. However the results will be postponed because the company is 'at an advanced stage of discussions with a group of investors'. This, the directors said, might lead to an injection of capital into the company, which in turn would lead to a change of control and a restructuring.</p>

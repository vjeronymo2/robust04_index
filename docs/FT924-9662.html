			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Alert in property sector LEADING property shares moved forward as recent talk of German money moving into the London office market produced firmer hints of the imminent signing of three major contracts in the City. Sterling's devaluation has brought German and other overseas investors back into the UK property sector, reported to have around Pounds 400m of funds available for equity and real capital requirements. Yesterday, both forms of investment opportunity appeared to attract attention as MEPC and Hammerson were subject to big disposal rumours, and dealers reported overseas buying in selected property shares. MEPC was said to be close to selling its Finsbury Circus development to Difa, a German investment trust, for close on Pounds 80m. The Bank of Tokyo is a long term tenant of the office block. MEPC refused to comment on the rumour, which surfaced in the trade press last week. Hammerson also declined to comment on strong hints that it had received a Pounds 30m offer from a private German investor for its Sceptre Court development in the City of London, and a further Pounds 20m for its Lonsdale Chambers block, in the West End. Finally, Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French banking group, was said to be negotiating to buy the freehold of its Broadgate base from developer Rosehaugh. The renewed interest in the London office market, while bringing relief to debt-ridden owners, was dismissed by analysts as speculative and not the harbinger of good times for a property sector still under a recessionary cloud. 'What we are seeing is some buying from the Continent which sees the market as cheap following devaluation,' said Mr Ray Jones at Paribas. Others said the rises would not be sustained and the recent gain had been overdone. Yesterday, Hammerson Ordinary rose 8 to 229p, the 'A' shares 9 to 220p, Land Securities 9 to 415p and MEPC 11 to 341p. Burmah wanted A series of positive presentations to investment institutions in Scotland led to a sharp rally in Burmah Castrol shares. The lubricants company addressed the Scottish fund managers under the auspices of County NatWest at a dinner in Glasgow and a breakfast meeting in Edinburgh. Burmah, a notable beneficiary from the recent devaluation of sterling, earns around 25 per cent of its profits in Germany, via its Castrol and Foseco businesses, and is believed to have been largely unaffected by the apparent slowdown of economic activity in that country. Burmah shares raced up to 658p during early trading but eased back to close a net 13 higher at 651p. Today's seminar on the group's Indonesian gas operation and a story that SG Warburg Securities had increased its net asset value by 20 per cent to 210p a share because of the recent fall in sterling against the dollar, gave a big push to Lasmo shares. The stock ended a busy session a net 8 1/2 firmer at 183p after exceptionally heavy turnover of 5.5m shares. Enterprise saw good support, edging up 3 to 456p on 1.7m. Bottled gas company Calor closed 10 to the good at 239p on relatively high turnover of 1m, with buyers chasing the stock for the dividend, payable at the end of the month. Oil sector specialists pointed out that worries about increasing production by Opec countries were again affecting the oil market. BP slipped 2 1/2 to 232p but Shell, still boosted by a recent BZW buy recommendation, added 2 at 540p. BZW said: 'We believe that a number of fears that investors have about the stock are unfounded and continue to believe that fair value is a market yield; that equates to 610p in the current market.' Dollar influenced stocks were generally stronger despite the uninspiring performance from the US currency. The stocks responded more to the impending continuity of the next presidential term security. Glaxo, helped by a Wertheim Schroder recommendation, was up 23 before easing with the market to close 15 firmer at 835p. Wellcome rose 12 to 993p. Nikko Europe was reiterating both of them in its latest quarterly sector review. SmithKline Beecham 'A' gained 12 to 540p and ICI improved 24 to 1060p. The long-awaited but widely expected downgrade of Barclays by BZW duly arrived and produced a bout of heavy trading and - much to the surprise of marketmakers - a near 3 per cent decline in Barclays shares. The stock settled 10 lower at 340p, having fallen to 333p early in the day. BZW forecast a Pounds 65m loss for Barclays in the current year, against a previous prediction of Pounds 305m, and expects the bank to cut the dividend to 14.15p. For 1993 BZW has pencilled in a profit figure of Pounds 375m. Lloyds Bank benefited from switching out of Barclays and settled with a 13 gain at 493p on good turnover of 4m. Cable and Wireless continued to reflect the recent Kleinwort Benson recommendation and added 14 at 632p. Several engineering and motor stocks came under pressure after Kleinwort Benson downgraded profit expectations. GKN gave up 8 to 394p on high volume of 5.6m. The broker is believed to be expecting GKN to report current year profits of Pounds 125m, and Pounds 115 for the following year. Also downgraded was BBA, 2 lighter at 132p, and Laird Group, up 6 to 278p with the strong market. Shares in TI Group also discounted the cut in profit expectations from Kleinwort Benson and instead moved 6 ahead to 308p, boosted by the strengthening dollar. British Aerospace shares were wanted and gained 6 1/2 to 149 1/2 p. The stock is favoured by agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite and Mr Brian Newman at Henderson believes the shares to be a buy because 'the share price discounts the current uncertainties and the recent decline of sterling will help recovery prospects'. Volume reached 6.1m. Speculation that APV would soon be on the receiving end of a bid from Siebe continued. The former added 4 at 90p and the latter firmed 5 to 349p. A squeeze was behind the advance in Smiths Industries, which closed 8 up at 323p. Shares in William Cook, which reports interim results next week, eased a penny to 88p. A squeeze was seen in a number of transport stocks. These included BAA, up 5 at 754p, and P&amp;O which jumped 12 to 464p. In a firm drinks sector, Bass jumped 15 to 571p, helped by a buy recommnedation from James Capel. Early talk that Kingfisher was considering a money-raising excercise to build a war chest reignited old bid stories about Lloyds Chemist. While the rumour found little substance among analysts, few expressed surprise, Kingfisher being cash-rich and known to be casting its eye not only over the domestic situation but also Europe. After early strength, the shares fell back 4 to 526p. Lloyds advanced 2 to 216p. Weakness in Tate and Lyle saw the shares off 1 at 349p. The company announced it was stopping production of its Sucralose sweetener pending US approval. Food retailers were weak on vague hints of a price war after Tesco, off 7 at 225p, started a new promotion. Kwik Save fell 11 to 719p and Argyll 9 to 350p. Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson lost recent gains after its broker and one other securities house cut back profit forecasts. Broker Cazenove, which never comments on its actions, was said to have cut its 1992 forecast to Pounds 135m after seeing the company on Monday. The figure is well below last week's revised consensus of around Pounds 144m. Smith New Court, which also visited the company, reduced to Pounds 134m for this year and Pounds 157m for 1993. Pearson shares fell 13 to 350p. Small television group TVS jumped 4 1/2 to 26 after announcing that it had received a bid approach. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (150).

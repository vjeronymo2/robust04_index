			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR RECEIVES LEGISLATION ON COUNTY TAXES FOR TRANSIT, JAILS  </P> <P> Calling it a "Solomon-like" solution, lawmakers passed and sent to the governor  Friday a measure that would allow Los Angeles County voters to approve local  sales tax increases for transit and jails without violating state law.  </P> <P> The legislation corrects a conflict on the November ballot where Los Angeles  County voters will be asked to endorse two local sales tax increases, each  calling for a half-cent tax on each dollar of sales. If both pass, the sales  tax rate charged in the county would reach 7 1/2% -- exceeding the 7% maximum  set by state law .  </P> <P> But the legislation approved by the Legislature allows the county to avoid the  violation by providing that if both measures pass, the tax amount of each would  be reduced from 0.5% to 0.25%.  </P> <P> The bill glided through the Senate without opposition but in the Assembly  objections were raised by Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz  (D-Sylmar) and it won approval 43 to 16.  </P> <P> Katz said it would be misleading to ask voters to back a half-cent sales tax  hike that may end up being a quarter of a cent.  </P> <P> "This is the result of the fact that local elected officials in Los Angeles  couldn't figure out what they wanted to do so they put both (measures) on the  ballot," Katz said. "I wish local officials had solved this problem  (themselves)." Revenue from the two measures would be used for transportation  and jail improvements.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) responded by suggesting that if lawmakers  passed the bill, they would keep the issue out of the courts where "the only  winners are the lawyers who file lawsuits."  </P> <P> "This is a Solomon-like way to deal with the question of what to do if two  measures pass that cause you to exceed the sales tax limit," he said. "It's  fair. It's good."  </P></p>

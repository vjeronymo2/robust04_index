The  leader of the military department [Defense Ministry of Ukraine]  informed the guests about the development of the Ukrainian Armed  Forces, about the problems emerging from this, and he replied to  numerous questions from the foreign diplomats. The general  underlined that Ukraine, as a peace-loving state, would  gradually reduce its own Armed Forces and take an active part in  tackling the problems of European and regional security. As far  as the solution of the Yugoslav issue is concerned, the defense  minister remarked that this could only be done in the course of  a peaceful negotiation process with all the interested parties  involved.    The diplomats also took an interest in the issue of the  Black  Sea Fleet's division. In the opinion of the military department  leader, it is necessary, first and foremost, to draw up an  inventory at state level of all the Black Sea Fleet's property  as of December 1991, and subsequently reduce its numerical  strength, and only then to decide on which share of the Black  Sea Fleet belongs to whom.</p>

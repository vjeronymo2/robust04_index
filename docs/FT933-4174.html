			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Rest of Europe holds tight to Bundesbank coat-tails The Bundesbank's interest rate cut yesterday allowed several European central banks to follow suit, and may trigger a further easing in monetary policy in the coming days. But each country in the exchange rate mechanism still faces the dilemma of whether to decouple its monetary policy from that of the Bundesbank, pushing short-term interest rates below Germany's. The Bundesbank's cut in its Discount and Lombard rates was widely interpreted as a move determined by stronger economic data in Germany, in particular a lower level of German money growth than had been expected. It had little to do with the pressing need to ease the cost of money in Europe as a whole. 'This was a move determined by domestic factors, and subsequent moves will also be determined by those factors,' said Mr Brian Hilliard, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. The other ERM members must decide whether to remain tied to Germany on monetary policy, or to use the freedom provided by last month's ERM relaxation to to cut borrowing rates more sharply. The ERM's operating rules were drastically altered on August 2 when finance ministers agreed to widen the fluctuation limits against the D-Mark from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. But the remaining ERM countries - France, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal - have hardly capitalised on the changes by letting their currencies drop against the D-Mark through sharp interest rate reductions. Instead, they are keen to maintain their currencies' values against the D-Mark to preserve a semblance of the semi-fixed exchange rate system which produced large inflows into their asset markets in recent years. The caution was underlined yesterday when the Bank of France left its important intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent, even though, in a more technical move, it cut its five to 10 day money-market lending rate. Belgium and Spain both shadowed the German move more directly, and Denmark cut its 14-day Certificate of Deposit rate by  1/2 a percentage point earlier this week. But there was no suggestion that any of these countries would ease policy more drastically than Germany does. However, France, Denmark and Belgium cannot hope to preserve the values of their currencies simply by shadowing every cut in German rates. Their currencies could come under heavy pressure against the D-Mark if foreign exchange dealers believe that damage is being inflicted to their economies by a failure to cut interest rates. Nor can they count on the Bundesbank to ease pressure quickly enough to remove that threat. 'The Bundesbank is clearly not in a mood to accelerate its gradual programme of cuts in interest rates,' says Mr David Morrison, international economist at the London office of US investment bank Goldman Sachs. It all adds up to what Mr Ian Gunner, an economist at Chemical Bank, calls a no-win situation. 'Either they keep their interest rates on hold, and their currencies die a slow death,' he said. 'Or they take the more sensible course of cutting interest rates sharply. Their currencies would fall in the short term, but they will appreciate on signs of higher economic growth.' France would be in a strong position to adopt the latter policy. Its economy is fundamentally strong, with a strong trade and current account surplus and low inflation. But a decoupling of policy would be more traumatic for the Danish and Belgian authorities, who have seen their respective currencies depreciate in the wake of this week's cuts in interest rates. The Danish krone may be vulnerable because - following the relaxation of the ERM bands - dealers have tended to place the currency alongside its fellow Scandinavians, the Finnish markka and Swedish krona. Both of these had substantial devaluations last year. The Belgian franc could be even more vulnerable. Until recently, the move to European monetary union diverted attention away from some of Belgium's serious economic problems, including a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 130 per cent. Following the recent crisis in the ERM, the Belgian franc has fallen more sharply than any other currency in the system.</p>

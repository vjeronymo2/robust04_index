			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Rebuilding the Labour party IN A healthy democracy a principal opposition party has two functions. Its day-to-day duty is to harry the government, challenge its proposals, expose its shortcomings, make parliamentary life difficult; in short, to oppose. Its longer-term reason for existence is to stand ready as an alternative government, thus providing the electorate with a choice when the term of the administration currently in office expires. Less than six months after its shattering defeat in the April election the British Labour party is beginning to look as if, a summer of disappointment behind it, it is ready to fulfil the first of these purposes. It is well prepared to make a thumping nuisance of itself. Its new leader, Mr John Smith, displayed his reknowned forensic skills in a blistering attack on the prime minister in the House of Commons last week. Where Mrs Margaret Thatcher towered over Mr Neil Kinnock, and the latter was at best evenly matched with Mr John Major, it is the Labour leader who now commands the House and the prime minister who must strive for its full attention. It is Mr Smith who can proclaim, without qualification, that it has always been his firm conviction that Britain's future lies in Europe; and Mr Major who must twist and turn. Open stage A parliament in which the government's majority is slender and the governing party divided presents a strongly led opposition with an open stage. It is Labour's good fortune that in Mr Smith it has a leader whose ability to perform upon such a platform is unquestioned. The degree to which victories in the cut and thrust of Commons debate impinge upon the consciousness of the general public is unpredictable, but it is reasonable to assume that a long period in which the leader of the opposition shows up well in the House will have a beneficial effect upon the standing of his party. Mr Smith is also in a position to demonstrate that he leads a united force, again in contrast to the hapless Mr Major. At the Labour conference this week Mr Smith's closest colleagues won positions on the executive committee, while his strongest opponents lost out. Unlike many previous Labour leaders, he and his allies dominate both the party machine and the shadow cabinet. Labour is Mr Smith's to take in a direction of his choice. In his first conference speech as leader yesterday he proclaimed that the route he favours is towards electoral victory. Creditable passion There is much for Labour to do if it is to have a hope of reaching that destination. It must cut its formal links with the trade unions; Mr Smith was equivocal about that. It must find a way of expressing itself that allays the fears of those who believe that Labour will impoverish them. Then a set of policies to improve people's lives must be selected and this must look better than the government's. Mr Smith has hardly had time to commence this large task so it is not surprising that yesterday's speech amounted to an interim repackaging of the manifesto upon which the last election was lost. Its central feature was an affirmation of the party's belief in 'active government', a phrase which, if it means anything different from old-fashioned interventionism, was not explained. 'Active government', it appears, would provide better housing, training, education and environmental protection, an 'efficient and caring' health service, a fairer system of industrial relations, a minimum wage, constitutional reform, positive discrimination, help for working mothers and the rescue of the coal industry. It would also, no doubt, implement such recommendations as emerge from Mr Smith's 'special commission on social justice'. The latter reflects his creditable passion for meeting the needs of the worse-off section of society. This not unfamiliar menu certainly presents voters with a choice. The Conservative aim is to decrease the remit of government; Labour's unashamedly to extend it. No one could pretend that the Tory endeavour has been wholly successful, but that is not in itself an argument for the 'active' alternative. What Mr Smith needs to explain is why officials can do better than private individuals - and, indeed, what guarantee there is that more government will not merely make matters worse. It certainly did in the 1970s.</p>

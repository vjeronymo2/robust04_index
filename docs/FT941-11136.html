			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: How to build order, and profit, from chaos - Bernice Cohen's share portfolio benefits from gauging the disorderly mix that makes up market behaviour The experiments of market operators who apply complex, mathematics-based computer techniques to their trading were described in the Weekend FT recently* by Clive Cookson. As a do-it-myself investor, I cannot hope to apply these concepts with similar rigour. Nevertheless, in my own efforts to research and manage the family share portfolio, I have been trying to incorporate an amateur equivalent of their approach for some time. My system is not infallible, and the relationship between mathematical chaos theories and a private investor's use of charts of historic data to predict stock market performance may often be be more illustrative than scientific. But it helps me to gauge the disorderly mix that makes up market behaviour. Mathematical chaos theory is the science of irregularity in nature. It explores unpredictable behaviour that is governed by simple rules. This sounds contradictory, but the weather offers numerous illustrations. The physical mechanisms producing hurricanes follow recognisable patterns because of the physics of convection currents, but it is still difficult to predict detailed timing in any specific occurrence. Accordingly, weather forecasters use charts showing areas of high and low pressure. While I always use fundamental analysis when making investment decisions, I also study charts of stock market indices and individual share prices to detect the repeating patterns that I believe depict chaos in the markets. These patterns reflect the recurring mass behaviour of investors, just as a temperature chart monitors fever in a patient. Computers map nature's irregularities including coastlines, mountain ranges or lightning. These maps, or 'fractals', reveal the geometry of irregularity. They expose the pattern and order within apparent disorder. By following millions of separate routes repeatedly, the computer reveals in graphics the geometrical nature of chaotic systems. This applies equally to financial markets. Charts record a time series of numerous individual prices which share many features with computer-generated fractals. I use a range of moving averages  -such as those over 20, 50 and 200 days to help me decide when to buy or sell. This is because moving averages smooth the randomness of the share price series and distil out the underlying trend. Following the trend helps me to profit from market movements. Strong trends develop because share prices, like other chaotic systems, are prone to lengthy positive feedback loops. Share price rises encourage more buying and further price rises, in a positive loop. As the loop repeats itself, a trend becomes established, propelled by its own momentum. Prices are pushed ever higher, but the trend grows increasingly unstable until profit-taking changes the direction of the feedback loop abruptly. Heavy selling brings out more sellers and falling prices stimulate further selling, going around the positive loop again but, this time, in reverse. Big profits can be made by staying with a prolonged rising trend, but it is equally important to anticipate the turning point. Some patterns give clues to the timing of major turning points because they indicate a change of sentiment by a large group of investors. If, as I think, the charts give a portrait of chaos operating in the markets, then it is not surprising that recognisable patterns occur repeatedly, as chaos theory shows that pattern and irregularity are intermixed in chaotic systems. We cannot expect to understand the cryptic messages in a Picasso painting unless we study it in depth. Similarly, we must study the jargon of chaos and technical analysis to profit from an understanding of chaos in the markets. One of the most fascinating aspects of chaos science is the concept of strange attractors. These are pathways that describe the long-run behaviour of an ever-evolving chaotic system as it changes over time. They are called 'strange' because they emerge only with chaotic systems, and they are 'attractors' because they attract stray points back towards them so that, although the actual route of any one point can never be forecast accurately, the strange attractor marks out the limits within which all the unpredictability is contained. Ironically, therefore, the strange attractor reveals the order within the disorder. I think certain chart patterns with strange-sounding names, such as head-and-shoulders or double tops, are examples of strange attractors in the stock market and that is why they offer guidance on future price movements. It cannot be a coincidence that most examples of 'bubbles' - from the famous South Sea Bubble of 1720 to the recent Tokyo Nikkei Bubble of 1986-1993 - have chart patterns that are either head-and-shoulders or double tops. As American investors rushed into the Pacific Rim's smaller markets last autumn, the strength of the resulting positive feedback loop was clear to see. Now the charts, especially for Hong Kong and Malaysia, show the left-hand side of the bubble pattern in formation. Courageous investors probably will hang on until a complete head and shoulder or double-top pattern emerges and then bail out swiftly. Since I was in those markets before they began rising strongly in October, I am almost completely out now; I get squeamish about excessive heights. I believe these repeating chart patterns are the nearest thing we have to chaotic strange attractors. Unfortunately, there is the usual cautionary warning when making important investment decisions. Sometimes, the patterns fail to follow through to the expected conclusions. But that should be no surprise, as they are examples of chaos - and knowing when the odd random event will render the forecasts invalid is the essence of dealing with a chaotic system. *'Maths-based trading brings Eldorado closer' - January 16 1994. There are several non-mathematical books for interested readers giving a brief history and description of the science of chaos. These include James Gleick's 'Chaos' (Penguin, 1988); Ian Stewart's 'Does God Play Dice?' (Penguin, 1990); and 'The New Scientist Guide to Chaos,' edited by Nina Hall.</p>

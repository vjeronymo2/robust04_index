The FS-X development project began the development in FY88  of  a new fighter on the premise that it will be based on the F-16C  and a combination of Japanese and U.S. technologies. The  development period was set for 11 years, ending in FY98. The  basic design was completed and a full-scale mockup built in  FY92. During FY93, the project worked on detail designs and  started the production of four prototypes, including two ground  test prototypes for checking controllability and the structural  strength and fatigue strength of the airframe and two more  prototypes for inflight testing of the performance of the  airframe.    In FY94, the developers will continue the work to complete  the prototypes and will begin the technical tests, including the  performance check; they hope to conduct the test flight in July  1995.    Since the development has been moving quite well to date and  on schedule, it was decided to set up the preparation office  now, to prepare the ground technical support facilities and  other necessary systems required for the application tests. Two  FS-X test pilots are being dispatched to the United States this  month for five months to attend the test pilot course of the  U.S. Department of Defense. More pilots will be trained later as  they are selected.    At the same time, the test facilities are being built near  Gifu Base; in addition to the completion of an engine stand, the  flight-test control system, which will be used for the test  flight of FS-X and others, has been completed, and its test  operation began at Gifu Base in September. The system will help  to accelerate the flight tests and improve safety, as it will  process and display the test data in real time as it  communicates with the test airplane during a test flight. In  addition, test plane hangars and engine hangars are being  constructed and are expected to be delivered soon, and the  simulator, as well as its enclosing facilities, will be  completed by the end of the year, which indicates that  everything will be ready when it is needed.</p>

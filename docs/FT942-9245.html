			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Venture capital provides lifeline to Czechs Sir, I share Christopher Parkes's opinion ('Old ways hamper new prosperity', May 9) that there is a dearth of finance capital available for new enterprises in the Czech Republic. But I would like to add that there is an alternative source - venture capital, which is beginning to, and should increasingly, play a meaningful role in financing growth for small businesses. In the US and Europe equity capital is an important source of financing and nurturing new enterprises. According to the European Venture Capital Association Ecu4.2bn (Pounds 3.2bn) were raised and Ecu4.7bn were invested by European venture capital firms in 1992. Statistics about the impact of venture capital on economic growth are similarly impressive. While foreign direct investment in the Czech Republic has slowed, private equity investment is taking off. Besides officially-sponsored programmes such as PHARE and the Czech American Enterprise Fund, at least half a dozen venture capital firms have sprouted up within the past year to provide financing and technical assistance to entrepreneurs. It is estimated that Ecu40m has been raised for investment by venture firms. For the entrepreneur, venture investment has advantages over debt financing. Besides providing much-needed equity capital, it provides know-how. Venture capitalists work actively with the management of their portfolio companies, contributing their knowledge and experience to help the new businesses grow. They may also bring strategic partners or other links to foreign markets. As your article pointed out, many Czechs are reluctant to give up control of their companies, especially to foreigners. But according to recent surveys ('The emergence of private sector manufacturing in the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic', World Bank Technical Paper 230, November 1993), most entrepreneurs want management and other training as much as they need capital. The primary problem is one of education. Most entrepreneurs do not know about or understand venture capital. In the three years Catalyst has been placing private equity, we have spent as much time educating Czech companies about the capital and helping them develop management skills and systems as we have in arranging finance. Once entrepreneurs understand that equity participation brings training and technical assistance, they are more willing to surrender a stake in their enterprise. The Czech Republic's rapid progress to a market economy stems from a dynamic private sector. Venture capital is ideally suited to provide the critical lifeline of capital needed by small and medium-sized companies that have jump-started the economy.

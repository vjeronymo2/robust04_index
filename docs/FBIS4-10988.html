			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with (Isidro Zardales), Havana Radio </F> Havana Cuba editor in chief, in Havana by an unidentified  reporter at the Circuito RPC Radio studios in Panama City --  live]    [Text] [Reporter] Good morning, Mr. (Zardales). Right now  in Panama City we are hearing rumors that there has been an  attack on Cuban President Fidel Castro. What is being said in  Cuba at this very moment?    [(Zardales)] We are surprised by this information. We have  no knowledge of such an attack. We have not even heard that  President Castro is sick, which is another rumor I hear is going  around.    The president of Cuba has not appeared in public in these  past few days because there has been no need for it. No  activity has been held in which he has had to participate. His  brother has been seen in public at events to mark the  anniversary of the Bay of Pigs victory. That is why rumors  started that he was victim of an attack or a stroke. The truth  is that we have no official or unofficial information on this.  To be honest with you, we have not even heard street rumors  about this.    [Reporter] In other words, Mr. (Zardales), nothing is being  said about this in Cuba.    [(Zardales)] No, not really. I have just come in from the  street. I was reporting from the city, and I have no  information on this. Before receiving your call, I talked with  comrades here at the radio station and no one has information on  this.    [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), what do you think prompted the  international version on what might be happening to Fidel Castro?    [(Zardales)] I think it is wishful thinking on the part of  some people. Many people would like to see something happen to  him. I believe these people are trying to create a bizarre  perception of our country in advance of the upcoming emigre  meeting in Havana. The meeting will be attended by Cubans who  live in several countries -- in the United States, Europe, Latin  America, and even Australia.    [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you have said Fidel Castro has  not  been seen in public for the past few days. When was the last  time he was seen in public?    [(Zardales)] The truth is that I cannot remember. I cannot  remember. I know it was a few days ago, however; there are no  indications that he is sick. Similar rumors were spread in the  past when he was not seen in public. I imagine he has a lot of  work to do. I believe he is involved with the upcoming meeting  in Havana, and this must be keeping him pretty busy. We are  hoping it will be a successful meeting -- a meeting of  rapprochement with the Cuban community living abroad. We are  all Cubans and have the right to discuss the political and  social future of our country.    [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you are a reporter. Are there any  rumors that Castro is sick? Has an official announcement been  made about some kind of illness he may have, perhaps heart  disease?    [(Zardales)] All he is suffering from is having excellent  health. If we are going to talk of illness, we can talk about  old age. Old age is something natural for all of us. However,  I do not think he is ill. He enjoys good health.    We saw him recently. He is a man who keeps himself  physically strong. He enjoys sports. He will jump into the  water and take a swim at any time of the day, even in the early  morning hours. He also plays basketball. He keeps himself  physically strong. We honestly have not heard that he is ill.    [Reporter] In conclusion Mr. (Zardales), has an official  announcement been released regarding the international rumors  that Castro is ill? Do you know of this?    [(Zardales)] No, no, no. I have heard nothing of this. I am  just arriving. I have not read today's news releases, but I  have seen nothing about this. As I said earlier, I believe such  rumors begin every time he is not seen in public for two or  three days. I also believe that these rumors are being spread  in light of the upcoming meeting with Cubans living abroad, or  with representatives of the Cubans living abroad.    [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. (Isidro Zardales), Radio Havana  Cuba editor in chief.</p>

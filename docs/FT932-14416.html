			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Italian PM to quit as voters signal support for reform MR Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, said last night he intended to resign amid the country's widening corruption scandals, as voters appeared to signal strong support for electoral reform. Mr Amato, whose shaky four-party coalition has led Italy through almost 10 months of unprecedented political upheaval, will consult President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today. But he indicated he was ready to lead a new short-lived government. Asked in a television interview whether he would head the next cabinet, Mr Amato said: 'It would be completely wrong for me to speak about it when my government is about to resign. I know my name is being mentioned and I would be ready to do it for a short while, if necessary.' Mr Amato, who said earlier that he believed his government had reached its end, will see the president immediately after polls close in the two-day series of referendums on Italy's electoral practices. With a strong turnout, voters appeared to be showing their backing for electoral reforms and the ending of state funding for political parties. The referendums on those issues were the first national test of public reaction to the wave of corruption scandals which has seen the arrest of some of Italy's leading politicians and businessmen. Italians have been voting in eight separate referendums, which are also about abolition of three ministries and reform of the laws on drugs, the environment and state bank appointments. Although exit polls will not be available until later today, it is expected that there will be support for the two main referendums, which concern changing the electoral system for the senate, the upper house of parliament, and abolishing state funding for parties. At 5pm yesterday, 30.7 per cent of the electorate had voted, 8 percentage points more than at the same stage in the last referendum two years ago. In an address to Confindustria, the employers' federation, Mr Amato emphasised that the mandate of the next government would be to push through electoral reform. Political observers are divided as to whether Mr Scalfaro will ask Mr Amato to stay on, leading a government that might be bolstered by the small Radical party and a few independents, or seek a wider coalition under an 'institutional' figure such as the leader of the chamber of deputies or the senate.

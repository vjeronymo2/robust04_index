			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Tourist authority chief quits MR William Davis, chairman of the British Tourist Authority and the English Tourist Board, said yesterday he was leaving both jobs and attacked the government for not doing enough to assist the tourist industry. Mr Davis said he had told Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, that he did not want to continue in the two posts when his three-year term of office ended on March 31. Mr Davis said he had not been offered another three-year term and Mr Brooke did not try to dissuade him from leaving. Mr Davis criticised the government for cutting the ETB's grant from Pounds 15.6m last year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995. 'The cuts in the ETB budget herald the demise of the ETB,' he said. Mr Davis, a former journalist, said he would devote more time to his magazine publishing company. The Department of National Heritage said yesterday Mr Davis's term was due to end on March 31 and 'it is not normal practice to automatically extend appointments. An announcement will be made soon about his successor.' Mr Michael Medlicott, BTA chief executive, is also leaving the authority to become European vice president of Delta Air Lines, the US carrier. He said his departure was unrelated to that of Mr Davis. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, will also leave the BTA board at the end of this month when his term ends. He said yesterday that after seven years on the board it was time for fresh blood.</p>

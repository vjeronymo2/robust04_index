			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Xun Hong (5424 1347): "Need For </F> Pervasive Development of Border Trade"]    [Text] Heilongjiang Province's border trade declined during  the last half of 1993 after three consecutive years of  tremendous increase, a grim situation occurring as the result of  a sharp decline in trade volume and returns.    Agencies and businesses throughout the province that are  engaged in the border trade are facing the same question today,  which is whether to languish in the present trough or to go in  for pervasive development.    The answer to this question lies, first of all, in how one  regards border trade prospects.    The drop off in border trade stems from many reasons. The  province's main border trade partner, Russia, is accelerating  privatization and undergoing political turmoil. Its laws are  changing greatly, and the legal representatives of its business  concerns are changing frequently. Consequently, trade contracts  signed in the morning may change by nightfall, making the  honoring of agreements difficult. Only 400 million of an 8  billion Swiss francs trade agreement signed at talks in Harbin  during 1993 had been honored as of the end of September.    Channels for settling payments do not work well, thereby  increasing trade risks. During recent years, Sino-Russian border  trade has gradually changed from mostly barter trade to cash  settlements, but since there are no banks in Russia that are  able directly to accept spot cash settlements, Chinese concerns  have to turn to a third country bank. Procedures are cumbersome,  so frequently opportunities to honor contracts are lost.    Prices and Customs duties vary, making it difficult to  predict trade profits and losses. During April and August 1993,  Russia twice increased tariffs by more than 10 percentage points  each time. Prices of some commodities such as chemical  fertilizers and trucks increased several fold. When they signed  contracts for the importation of sources of supply, the Chinese  anticipated a substantial profit, but after the goods were  delivered, they showed virtually no profit.    Foreign trade problems are also directly related to the  imperfect Russian infrastructure and lack of coordinated  control. Poor transportation means low ability to move goods  through entry and exit points, which results in serious cargo  pile-ups. Every year approximately 300 million Swiss francs  worth of materials cannot be transferred into or out of Russia.  The damage done to the operating order is serious, and  macroeconomic regulation and control lacks teeth. Currently the  province has 8,000 border trading companies, but fewer than  1,000 of them can move cargoes across the border. Furthermore,  statistics show a more than 1.3 billion yuan shortage of border  trade funds provincewide. Some companies are operating at a  loss, are unable to repay loans, and are unlikely to carry on.    However, one cannot be pessimistic because of the above  difficulties. Those who are well informed point out that the  current predicament in border trade is an inevitable reflection  of accumulated problems in going from a preliminary stage that  was not normalized to pervasive normalized development. The  problems are a temporary phenomenon that can be overcome through  active efforts. Some units are already making genuine efforts in  this regard, and some conditions are gradually changing.  Reportedly, the provincial border trade bureau is taking a hard  look at companies commissioned to act as border trade agents to  reduce their number from 8,000 to around 4,000. It has also  decided on a one-year and a three-month training program for the  rotational training within three years of all the trading  company cadres in the province. By way of eliminating  bottlenecks in Sino-Russian trade deliveries, the provincial  border trade bureau may work with the railroad system in  exercising uniform control over import and export shipments, and  in coordinating planning to reduce pile-ups. Some companies are  also preparing to set up joint transportation companies with the  Russians. For example, the province's external investment group  is discussing arrangements for a marine transportation company  with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Trade's Cooperation Bureau.  The investment group has submitted a ministerial level  conference agenda for a Sino-Russian mixed commission, which has  gained the serious attention and support of both the Chinese and  Russian governments. It is being actively pursued. The banking  and finance system is also considering the opening of settlement  avenues, the Bank of China permitting use of the renminbi in  making Sino-Russian border trade settlements. This would help  narrow the Sino-Russian trade balance to the benefit of both  parties. Some business are considering opening cooperative  venture banks in Russia that use the currencies of both  countries in settlements. Russia is also putting border  procedures in order, normalizing the administration of licenses  and procedures for examining and approving travel from Russia in  an effort to expand areas of cooperation. Russian officials in  China have proposed starting with Chinese and Russian products  that complement each other, opening up unique areas of trade,  and making an effort to win confidence in technical cooperation  and improvement of merchandise quality.    Some experts warn that Sino-Russian trade is a long range  matter in which it is necessary to proceed from realities,  understand both parties' national circumstances and individual  people's circumstances, economic development, and market needs.  We must engage in trade in a steadfast and focused way, going  from pure trade to economic and technical cooperation,  resolutely overcoming deceptive and short-term behavior. Now is  the time for all border trade enterprises to adjust to  circumstances, readjust their orientation, and concentrate their  entries on pervasive development.</p>

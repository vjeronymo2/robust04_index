			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu </F> Hata by Jacques Jacquet-Francillon in Paris on 5 May: "Japan  Wants Global Partnership With European Union" -- first paragraph  is LE FIGARO introduction]    [Excerpts] Tsutomu Hata, the new Japanese prime minister,  is touring Europe. After Rome, he made a stopover in Paris and  then Bonn. He will be in Brussels today. This shows the  importance of this visit which is aimed at preparing for the G-7  summit due to be held in Naples 8-10 July. Mr. Hata wants to  defend Tokyo's diplomatic position in discussing the trade  disputes which Japan has with the European Union [EU] and the  United States. In Paris, he had lunch on Wednesday [4 May] with  President Mitterrand and he had talks with Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. He also met  with Jacques Chirac. During his brief visit, Mr. Hata granted  an exclusive interview to LE FIGARO. [passage omitted]    [Jacquet-Francillon] Your first official overseas visit as  the head of the Japanese Government is to Europe. Why this  interest?    [Hata] In January of this year, my predecessor as prime  minister was due to visit Europe. But, because of his  parliamentary obligations, he was not able to carry out that  visit at the time which had been stipulated.    But allow me also to tell you this, from a personal  viewpoint: Around 17 years ago, we set up a parliamentary  association of friendship between Japan and the European  Community. As general secretary of this parliamentary league, I  did my best to ensure that we got to know each other better. I  now chair that parliamentary association.    I would like to give you one of the many examples which show  the results of our activities to promote friendship between  Japan and the EU. This example is the establishment of a  Japanese high school in Alsace, just near Colmar. I personally  sought the location for that educational establishment. I  personally had discussions with the inhabitants of the region,  and we thus succeeded in founding that high school, which is  called Seijo. I am a former pupil of the Japanese counterpart.  With the establishment of a Japanese high school in Alsace, we  also see many Japanese businesses becoming active in France:  Sony, Seiko, Yamaha, and so forth. That is merely one example  of the success of the activities of this parliamentary  association. If I had not been involved in the activities of  this association, that high school would not be there now. My  own son studied there for two years.    But let us return to the subject of your question.    In the aftermath of the Cold War period, Japan thinks that  it  is necessary to have a global view of its foreign affairs.  That is why we think it is necessary for ties between Japan and  Europe to be strengthened, especially because Europe is a region  which has very close relations with East Europe, Central Europe,  Russia, Ukraine, the African countries as well as the Middle  East and Far East countries.    We think that the strengthening of these ties with Europe  is crucial for Japanese foreign policy. Of course, bilateral  ties, discussions relating to bilateral problems, are very  important, but the aim of my visit to Europe is not limited to  that. We must also discuss global and international problems to  try to find out to what extent the sphere of cooperation can be  expanded.    And so, with a view to the Naples (G-7) summit, I wanted to  have discussions with the leaders of the countries which will  participate in that summit and establish personal relations with  them.    [Jacquet-Francillon] In particular, what is your assessment  of the talks you have just had in Paris?    [Hata] I have had a meeting with President Mitterrand, with  Prime Minister Balladur, and with Foreign Minister Juppe with  whom I had already met in Tokyo. I have also had talks with  Foreign Trade Minister Longuet.    We discussed bilateral problems of course, but what I regard  as very important is that we took time to discuss problems  relating to world peace, the need for cooperation to promote the  development of various regions of the world, including ties  relating to cultural activities.    [Jacquet-Francillon] The United States, probably even more  than the EU, criticizes Japan for an attitude which is described  as protectionist, to put it mildly. Do you think you will  shortly reach a trade agreement with Washington?    [Hata] The new government is determined to maintain good  relations with the United States. There are economic ties, on  the one hand, but there are also broader ties of friendship. We  also have a security treaty with the United States. So, in many  spheres, bilateral relations with the United States are very  satisfactory.    But, it is true that, in the United States there is some  anxiety regarding the nature of the Japanese market which it  sees as closed. It is true that, to improve the quality of  Japanese life, it is important to open the Japanese market more  to imported foreign products and services whose quality must  satisfy Japanese consumers.    Also, with the opening of the market, we would like to see  more foreign capital invested in Japan.    We have taken a series of fiscal and monetary measures on  several occasions to try to achieve this goal by stimulating  internal demand. With regard to the the current Japanese  surplus, our aim is to significantly reduce it in the medium  term.    It is true that, with regard to sector-based negotiations  with the United States, we are currently in a period of  reflection. We are convinced that these negotiations are  necessary and we would like to reopen them before the Naples  summit.    Having said that, the doors are wide open for the resumption  of the negotiations on both sides. We are attentive to any  opportunity which arises to reopen these discussions. On 29  March, we made a decision relating to the measures which should  be taken to achieve that goal. And they include deregulation  which must be specifically decided before the end of June.    I ask you to understand that any result from negotiations  with the United States would not just concern products  benefiting the United States. On the basis of the  most-favored-nation principle, any result from our agreements  with the United States would also favor third countries,  including the EU member countries.    [Jacquet-Francillon] Here in Paris two years ago, in an  exclusive interview granted to our newspaper, one of your very  recent predecessors, Prime Minister Miyazawa, insisted on the  fact that Japan henceforth intended to play a greater part in  building the new world order.    Since then, it is true, Japan has played a considerable role  in UN operations in Cambodia and everybody also knows that the  UN secretary general's personal representative in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is a Japanese citizen, Mr. Akashi.    Do you not think that, at a time when Japan is legitimately  claiming a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, that it  would be logical for Mr. Akashi to have a contingent of Japanese  blue helmets at his side?    [Hata] It is true that Japan is trying to play an important  role on the world stage with the aim of contributing to peace  and world prosperity. A series of examples indicates this.  This is true of the provisional administration in Cambodia. In  that country, there are also members of the Japanese defense  force, and civilians who have taken part in these UN activities.  We have also organized a conference in Tokyo on the rebuilding  of Cambodia. We have therefore been involved in the process of  establishing stability and, at the same time, in rebuilding.    With regard to the former Yugoslavia, we have provided  humanitarian aid through international organizations, like the  UN High Commission for Refugees, and through the World Food  Plan, in which our total contribution amounted to $97 million.    We are going to release a sum equivalent to $20 million for  Albania. There is therefore a whole series of ways of in which  Japan is being useful: the dispatch of human resources for  rebuilding; the supply of necessary technology; participation in  the peace process, and financial aid. We are convinced that, to  be useful in maintaining and promoting peace, there is a series  of measures which Japan can take, and that, by taking these  measures, we can be useful. Japan is now undertaking these  activities.    [Jacquet-Francillon] Is it conceivable that, once a peace  agreement is achieved in Bosnia, members of the Japanese defense  force will be sent to the area to verify the implementation of  that agreement?    [Hata] Five conditions must be satisfied for peacekeeping  operations. But whatever happens, once peace is established,  people should be sent to verify the situation, to rebuild the  region. That is something which can be done.    [Jacquet-Francillon] Is Japan prepared to side fully with  its  allies, particularly the United States, if there is a  confrontation imposed by North Korea's plans to equip itself  with nuclear weapons?    If it is a question of implementing an embargo on Korea  tomorrow, in the framework of a UN Security Council resolution,  would Japan be prepared to allow the United States unrestricted  use of its military bases on Japanese territory?    Do you think that Japan could play a mediation role with  China to persuade it to use its influence to keep North Korea on  the path of moderation?    [Hata] The international community is currently trying to  find, through dialogue, a negotiated solution to the problem  presented by the suspicions hanging over the possible  development of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Because the  question of economic sanctions has not been discussed in the UN  Security Council, you will allow me to make no comment on any  practical arrangements Japan might make should the need arise.    However, from a general viewpoint, it is obvious that if the  Security Council decided to take certain measures, our country  would adopt a responsible attitude compatible with the terms of  its Constitution.    In addition, because the PRC is currently the country which  maintains the friendliest relations with North Korea, our  government thinks that China's role in the solution of this  problem is particularly important.    [Jacquet-Francillon] The economy of most of the developed  countries seems to be on the road to recovery. Japan -- like  France -- seems a little behind compared with its partners. How  do you explain that?    Should Japan not contribute more to world economic recovery  by developing domestic consumption, especially through fiscal  measures?    [Hata] The Japanese economy is currently going through a  process of adjustment, the essential cause of which lies in the  cyclical development of the economy. It is also suffering the  indirect consequence of what is known as the financial bubble.  If you add to that the sudden increase in the value of the yen  last year and the particularly cold temperatures in our country  in summer 1993, you will see that our country suffered a series  of unfavorable phenomena.    However, the upward trend of public and property investments  is continuing to strengthen, and household consumption seems to  be showing some signs of improvement too. All these factors  allow us to think that the economic situation is, at least  partly, on the road to recovery.    Our country's economy is starting to show signs of recovery,  and the Japanese Government knows the extent to which it is  important to help it to firmly take this course in fiscal 1994.    That is why a comprehensive program of economic measures,  worth around 15,000 billion yen [Y] -- the central point of  which is a reduction in income tax of Y6,000 billion -- was  adopted last February, on top of many provisions already taken  in the financial sphere.    In addition, a series of reforms aimed at improving economic  relations with foreign countries was presented in March. The  three essential points on which this plan is based are the  strengthening of market mechanisms, the improvement of access to  our internal market (secured, in particular, thanks to  deregulation), and the establishment of economic management  likely to boost domestic demand.    Moreover, we have the firm intention of making as much  effort  as possible to ensure that a fiscal reform, including a  reduction in income tax, is produced in the course of this year.    With the implementation of a broad range of measures already  announced, I think that our country's economy will be poised for  a sustained recovery and thus make a greater contribution to the  economic recovery of the whole international community.</p>

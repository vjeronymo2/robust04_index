			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FBI EXPERTS BELIEVE VIDEOTAPE SHOWED HIGGINS  </P> <P> The FBI said today that its experts believe the body hanging from a rope in a  videotape released last week by Lebanese terrorists is likely that of hostage  Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, but offered no judgment about the time and  cause of death.  </P> <P> An agency statement said "a judgment has been made within a reasonable degree  of medical certainty that the person depicted in the videotape is dead."  </P> <P> "Although a positive identification could not be made, numerous observable  characteristics were noted, indicating that the person depicted in the  videotape is Higgins," the FBI said. "This judgment was made by forensic  experts and pathologists."  </P> <P> Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the only way  the FBI could deliver a completely positive identification would be to have  Higgins' remains or other physical evidence, such as fingerprints.  </P> <P> Higgins, head of a 75-member U.N. peacekeeping team, was kidnaped in south  Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988. His captors claimed last Monday that he had been  hanged in retaliation for Israel's refusal to release a kidnaped Muslim cleric.  </P> <P> A videotape of a figure, hanging by his neck, bound and gagged, was released  that day.  </P></p>

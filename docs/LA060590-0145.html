Currie that, given the current uncertainty of the  defense budget, the company is not interested in buying another big defense  operation.  </P> <P> However, Currie left open the possibility that Hughes might bid on parts of the  division if it is parceled out to bidders. Ford Motor Co. put the division up  for sale in January.  </P></p>

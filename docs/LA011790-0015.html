			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> MUSIC IN SCHOOLS: A SOUR NOTE;  </P> <P> SPUTNIK AND PROPOSITION 13 PUT A DAMPER ON TEACHING OF THE SUBJECT. BUT NEW  PRESSURES COULD PROMPT SCHOOLS TO START CHANGING THEIR TUNE.  </P> <P> Donald J. Dustin's hands keep time with his words as he recalls the glory days  more than a decade ago when he could field 200 musicians for the halftime show  at a high school football game.  </P> <P> Dustin, who resigned as band director at Locke High School in 1983 to become  director of performing arts for the Los Angeles Unified School District, then  settles back in his chair to deliver his dreary coda: "The band has about 70  students now."  </P> <P> The once-proud Locke marching band is only one casualty of a decline in music  education at public schools in California that started 30 years ago and  accelerated during the last decade.  </P> <P> Although modest gains over the last two years hint that the decrescendo may be  over, the recovery of music programs in the state's public schools could be a  long time in coming.  </P> <P> Shrinking budgets and a belief that music education was a frill have triggered  a cutback of elementary and high school music programs in which generations of  students were taught to appreciate music, as well as to sing and to play  musical instruments. With fewer programs in place, it was no surprise that the  number of music classes and music students had fallen to the lowest levels ever  by the mid-1980s, educators say.  </P> <P> Statewide, the number of students playing in high school bands and orchestras  was cut in half between 1982 and 1986, from 124,549 to 64,989. The number of  junior high and high school students taking other music courses dropped about  25% during the same period, even though student enrollment in grades 7 to 12  held steady at about 2 million.  </P> <P> Nationwide, the decline has been less dramatic. The percentage of junior and  senior high students enrolled in music classes remained at about 30% from the  end of World War II to the late 1950s, according to the U.S. Department of  Education. But by 1960, enrollment had dropped to 28%, and by 1972 to 25%. In  1981, the last year for which such numbers are available, only about 21% of  students signed up for music courses, including band, orchestra and choir, as  well as music appreciation, theory and history.  </P> <P> Elementary school orchestras, once a fixture at nearly every school in the  state, either have been eliminated or have been drastically cut back since the  late 1960s. In the Los Angeles school district, once considered a national  leader in music education, only about one-fourth of the 420 elementary schools  offer instrumental music instruction.  </P> <P> "There was a time when we had an instrumental and choral program at every  school, with a regular music teacher assigned to every school, plus a traveling  music teacher," Dustin said.  </P> <P> Now the district has fewer than 25 instrumental music teachers for its  elementary schools. Seventy-two traveling music teachers are assigned to 360  elementary schools, and each teaches as many as 1,300 students a week. The  remaining 60 elementary schools are on a waiting list.  </P> <P> "My long-term goal is one music teacher for every elementary school or at least  one music teacher for every 600 students," Dustin said. That would require the  hiring of at least 300 more music teachers, an expensive and unlikely prospect,  he said.  </P> <P> The weekly one-hour lessons by Los Angeles elementary school music teachers are  by necessity fast-paced. Fourth-graders, for example, listen to the teacher  play a version of a traditional song such as "Shenandoah." The teacher explains  briefly the concepts of melody and chord patterns. Then the children sing and  dance to the music.  </P> <P> Critics say that an hour a week isn't nearly enough.  </P> <P> "You just can't do the job that way. Cut the roots and the tree dies," said  Dennis Davies, music director for the Arcadia Unified School District, which  still employs 10 music teachers for its 10 schools and offers instrument  lessons beginning in the fourth grade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Interest  </P> <P> Many educators say the cutbacks at the elementary level are responsible for a  lack of interest in music among high school students. In the Los Angeles school  district, about 20% of students in grades 7 to 12 enrolled in music classes --  such as band, orchestra and choir -- between the end of World War II and 1978.  Now, only 10% enroll in such classes, even though the number of music teachers  has remained about the same over the last 20 years.  </P> <P> Before 1960, music was usually a daily lesson in Los Angeles schools. At that  time, fourth-graders, for instance, would be taught to sing songs by their  music teacher, who would also play classical music on phonographs for them.  </P> <P> The cuts also have come at the top. The number of supervisors heading music  programs at California school districts fell from 400 in 1978 to a low of 41 in  1987.  </P> <P> Without those music supervisors -- whose job is to make sure that there are  enough music teachers and instruments -- orchestra and other music classes  became especially vulnerable to school boards looking for quick ways to save  money, many music educators say.  </P> <P> And because of the resulting sharp decline in the number of music-teaching  positions available, college students in the last 10 years have avoided the  field, college music educators say. Last summer, qualified music teachers could  not be found for 38 available teaching positions around the state, said Judy  Gunderson of the Southern California Band and Orchestra Assn., a nonprofit  organization that promotes music programs at public schools.  </P> <P> Educators say a rebound in music education may be in the works because of new  requirements for admission to the state university system, an influx of Asian  students and a renewed interest in adding music to statewide tests measuring  students' achievement. Enrollment in music education statewide has risen by a  few thousand for each of the last two years, they say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Persuasion  </P> <P> "There is a slight turnaround, and we're optimistic and encouraged," said  Francie Alexander, a state associate school superintendent.  </P> <P> State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, himself a piano player, wants to  start a $100,000 radio and television campaign to persuade the public of the  importance of arts education.  </P> <P> "You don't have to sell math, but when it comes to music, some people see it as  a frill," Alexander said.  </P> <P> A major renovation of music curricula could also come if music is added to the  California Assessment Program, a battery of tests that show how individual  schools compare in subjects such as math and reading, Alexander said. "What is  tested is what gets taught," she said.  </P> <P> A state task force on arts education, headed by state Assemblyman Sam Farr  (D-Carmel), is preparing to release a report recommending that all high school  students be required to complete a year of art and music before they can  graduate.  </P> <P> Beginning this year, high school students applying for admission to schools in  the California State University system must complete two semesters of art and  music. UC is considering a similar requirement.  </P> <P> "I think public opinion is starting to support what arts educators have always  known -- the arts contribute to thinking skills," said Joan Peterson, an arts  consultant to the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> Pollster Louis Harris last year found that 70% of U.S. parents say they would  favor a small tax increase to give their children better education in the arts.  </P> <P> But when it comes to asking for more money, said Donald Gunderson, music  director at Los Altos High School in Hacienda Heights, "music teachers are the  worst lobbyists in the world."  </P> <P> Gunderson said his school's award-winning marching band has survived because of  strong support by parents and alumni. After a season of football halftime  shows, Gunderson said, the students break into smaller jazz and stage ensembles  to perform more musically challenging pieces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents Raise Money  </P> <P> Community support also has allowed music programs to survive virtually  unscathed in school districts such as Glendale, Long Beach and Burbank, despite  fund cutbacks caused by Proposition 13.  </P> <P> In Glendale, as well as in the Palos Verdes Unified School District, parents  formed local foundations to raise funds to pay for music teachers and programs.  </P> <P> "For a brief period after Prop. 13 (was passed), instrumental music was reduced  considerably," said Vic Pallos, a spokesman for the Glendale district. Now, the  instrumental program in the elementary schools "has really made a comeback," he  said.  </P> <P> Many educators attribute part of the resurgence to an influx of Asians into the  community. "A lot of our Chinese and Korean students study the piano and a  string instrument," said music director Davies of the Arcadia school district.  </P> <P> A few bright spots also can be seen in the Los Angeles district.  </P> <P> Reed Junior High School music teacher Yolanda Gardea said she used to take a  brass band to nearby elementary schools, hoping to spark interest in her  dwindling band and orchestra classes. "It was a real sales job."  </P> <P> Now, instead of trying to drum up business, the North Hollywood teacher turns  away students. "I had 150 students four years ago, and now I have 225 in band  and orchestra," Gardea said.  </P> <P> In addition, more young Latinos aspiring to play in mariachi bands are  enrolling in instrument classes, said Gardea and other Los Angeles-area music  teachers.  </P> <P> North Hollywood eighth-grader Woody Malone, whose 5-foot, 6-inch frame is  dwarfed by the 6-foot string bass that he has to lug home to practice, said he  is taking music at Reed because he wants to learn jazz. Classmate Jessica  Klatzker said she likes playing her viola because it is relaxing and has "a  beautiful sound."  </P> <P> Some music educators speculate that the decline of music education began with  the 1957 launch of Sputnik. Parents and politicians, fearful of falling behind  Soviet technology, demanded more emphasis on science and math at the expense of  school arts programs.  </P> <P> "Sputnik ended a golden era of music in the 1950s," said Henry Use, a retired  music director and co-chairman of the Legislative Action Coalition for Arts  Education. "It stung the American pride, and people asked, 'If the Russians can  do it, why can't we do it?' The perception was that we weren't putting out good  engineers, and people called for more science and math requirements that took  up music time."  </P> <P> But it took more than a Soviet satellite to shoot down music education. Voters  and their representatives also contributed to the decline.  </P> <P> When the Legislature approved the state's 1983 school reform laws, enacted to  toughen graduation requirements, students were given the choice of taking a  foreign language instead of art or music.  </P> <P> "If you're college-bound, you're going to take foreign language," said Su  Stauffer, a Northern California parent and longtime music activist.  </P> <P> In 1970, the California Legislature eliminated all music requirements for  prospective teachers, who previously were expected to read music, sing and play  an instrument.  </P> <P> That change, which was included in legislation creating the state Commission on  Teacher Credentialing, probably happened by accident, said Ken Lane, head of  teacher training at UC Berkeley's School of Education. Legislators working on  the changes wanted to simplify the credentialing process, as well as to  increase teacher training in subjects such as math, science and English, Lane  said.  </P> <P> "It turned out to be a demotion for music," said Lane, who wrote his  dissertation on the 1970 Ryan Act, which established state  teacher-credentialing laws.  </P> <P> Music appreciation, which traditionally had included memorizing classical music  and composers, was discarded from the curriculum at most school districts at  about the same time.  </P> <P> With few specially trained music teachers available, most elementary schools  have had to rely on regular classroom teachers for music instruction, even  though most of them have little or no training in music.  </P> <P> "Elementary school teachers are not prepared to teach music," said Cecilia  Riddell, who teaches a music course at Cal State Dominguez Hills. "They take a  one-unit course from me, which is supposed to teach them all they need to know  about singing, listening, folk dances and everything else."  </P> <P> Compounding the problem, said Riddell -- who has taught music to classroom  teachers for 25 years -- is that the current generation of college students  training to be teachers learned little themselves about music in public  schools.  </P> <P> "When I grew up in Redwood City there was a certain body of literature that  everybody was expected to know," said Riddell, who attended elementary school  shortly after the end of World War II. "Pieces like . . . the overture to 'The  Magic Flute' by Mozart, the 'Nutcracker Suite.' Now, I'm astonished how many of  my students have never even heard 'Peter and the Wolf.' "  </P></p>

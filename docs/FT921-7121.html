			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Mubarak to meet Mitterrand on Libya PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt travels to France today in his continuing efforts to calm international anger over allegations that Libyan agents were responsible for downing US and French commercial airliners in the late 1980s. A spokesman for Mr Mubarak said yesterday that the Egyptian leader in a planned meeting with President Francois Mitterrand tomorrow wanted to 'reach a formula' that would save Libya from any harm, and at the same time 'satisfy the world community which is so angry'. Meanwhile, Libya's Colonel Muammar Gadaffi has told Le Figaro, the French daily, that Libya understood it was obliged to co-operate in the investigations into the blowing up of a Pan Am jet in 1988 over Lockerbie in Scotland, and a French UTA airliner over Niger in 1989. The Libyan leader made it clear he was responding to threats of a US military strike which he described as virtual state terrorism. 'America today is the No. 1 military power in the world and isn't counterbalanced by anyone,' he said. 'An armed confrontation would crush us. We are aware of the danger. That's why we prefer to play the card of conciliation, and justice, rather than defiance.' The US and Britain are seeking extradition for trial of two Libyans accused of planting a bomb on Pan Am 103, causing the deaths of 259 people on board and 11 on the ground. France wants to interview four Libyans, including one of Col. Gadaffi's brothers-in-law, over the 1989 crash of the UTA jet with the loss of all 171 passengers and crew. Tripoli has refused to yield its accused, insisting that it is conducting its own investigation.</p>

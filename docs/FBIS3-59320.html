			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ouyang Yuanfang (2962 7122 0337 2455): "Is </F> Corruption the Evil Consequence of Reforms Leading to a Market  Economy?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] There are more or less two  reasons indicating worsening corruption. First, administrative  constraints have been relaxed somewhat, while the ownership  system at state-owned enterprises has not yet been reformed, and  the constraints of ownership have not yet taken shape. This has  given rise to much disorder. Second, during this period when the  function of government is being transformed and the style of  effective macro adjustment is changing, all at once certain  areas of uncertainty have appeared, leading to some irregular  government activities. These circumstances have created  "openings," "facilitators," and "accelerators" for the emergence  and spread of corruption. Therefore, we cannot say there is no  relationship at all between the spread of corruption and the  market economy; but we also cannot say that it is the necessary,  evil consequence of reforms leading to a market economy. At  most, the imperfections in the process of reform toward a market  economy have provided corruption with an opportunity to come  forth!    The crux of the problem is whether the root of corruption is  in the market economy or in the old system. This writer believes  that the root cause is in the old system. This is a special  feature of the corruption problem as it exists in China at the  present stage. Mainly, it has the following manifestations:    First, state power is marked by direct control over  micro-economic activity. The agencies with authority, and even  the individuals in charge, hold de facto power of life and death  over enterprises and small-scale activities. Enterprises and  small-scale activities need administrative approval at every  turn; without it, nothing can be so much as talked about.  Therefore, making and using connections, doing business through  influence, "greasing palms," and "cutting red tape" have become  the "standard topics" in economic life. From this, there have  arisen all kinds of bad practices, bribery, and the perversion  of justice.    Second, improper hiring is a major breeding ground for  corruption. Interpersonal relationships are complex, leading to  tangled webs of interrelations, where "one bureaucrat protects  another." In some units, only relatives, or only mediocrities,  or only slavish-minded people can be hired. Such bad practices  as hiring people related through marriage, forming cliques, and  bureaucrats protecting one another have been going on for a long  time; the masses have been angry, but do not dare to speak out.  These bad hiring practices are both a major manifestation of  corruption and a source of it.    Third, there is a lack of suitable control over government  actions, or even on the exercise of personal authority. There is  no objective mechanism for preventing excesses, and no effective  system of oversight. This is a major reason why corruption has  persisted despite repeated prohibitions against it, and even  became more and more rampant. For these two reasons, the  original mechanisms of vertical and horizontal supervision have  become weak. Moreover, it has been extremely difficult for law  enforcement agencies and the media to carry out their functions  independently. When the masses have made reports, usually very  little has come of it, and it has also invite open or disguised  retaliation. Over time, the exercise of authority has become  unconstrained and "omnipotent," and when it has become thus  corrupted, then it "does as it pleases."    Fourth, corrupt activities and corrupt elements often cover  themselves with a camouflage or veneer of high-mindedness. Many  bad practices, or open corruption, are not only dressed in  official garb, but are carried out under the banners of "public  spirit," "principle," "guidance," and the like. When something  goes wrong, then the corrupt elements can still drag in all  sorts of irrelevancies, and shift between soft and hard tactics,  plus bringing in exculpations and intercessions from above,  until things are hopelessly confused. This concealment in  formalities has created the present pattern of widespread,  semi-public corruption, and the difficulty of suppressing or  striking out against such corruption so that the perpetrators  can rest easy, knowing that they are well-protected.</p>

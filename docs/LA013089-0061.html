			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXACO PAY-OUT PACT COOLS ICAHN TAKEOVER THREAT;  </P> <P> BIGGEST SHAREHOLDER WOULD GET $336 MILLION OF $1.9-BILLION DISTRIBUTION  </P> <P> Texaco announced Sunday that corporate raider Carl C. Icahn has agreed to stop  his threats to take over the energy giant as part of a $1.9-billion pay-out to  shareholders that would net Icahn an estimated $336 million.  </P> <P> The agreement ends a long-running feud between the nation's third-largest oil  company and Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines and Texaco's biggest  shareholder. It also appears to end the immediate threat of a takeover at  Texaco, according to industry analysts.  </P> <P> The $1.9-billion distribution to stockholders disclosed Sunday is higher than  the $1.7 billion the company had promised last June. Icahn had threatened to  launch a bid for control of the company unless the pay-out to shareholders was  increased.  </P> <P> Under terms disclosed by the company, Texaco will issue two special dividends  to its shareholders with a value of $8 per share and a total worth of $1.9  billion. With 16.6% of the company's stock, or about 42 million shares, Icahn's  portion will be about $336 million.  </P> <P> In exchange, the company said, Icahn entered into a "standstill" agreement in  which he pledged not to buy additional shares of Texaco stock and to vote his  existing shares along the same lines as other shareholders. A company  spokeswoman said the standstill pact will be in effect for seven years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stability Seen  </P> <P> Texaco also said it will buy back $500 million worth of its stock by August,  1990, bringing to $2.4 billion the price tag of Sunday's announcement.  </P> <P> The agreement closes another turbulent chapter for the New York-based oil  company, which has endured bankruptcy, a $3-billion lawsuit settlement  connected with its takeover of Getty Oil and the sale of nearly $7 billion  worth of assets in the last two years.  </P> <P> "The agreement with the Icahn interests should provide a period of stability  needed for Texaco shareholders," James W. Kinnear, president and chief  executive of Texaco, said in a statement after the board approved the package  Sunday.  </P> <P> Last year, a friendly offer from Icahn to buy Texaco was turned down by  management. He then waged and lost a costly proxy battle last June. Since then,  Icahn has been increasingly critical of Texaco's management and had been  preparing for another possible proxy fight.  </P> <P> He said in a recent interview that he had not ruled out a new bid for the  company. Two weeks ago, he announced that he had increased his stake to 16.6%.  But in a statement issued by his Mt. Kisco, N.Y., office on Sunday, Icahn  sounded a conciliatory note and acknowledged that he has entered into the  standstill agreement.  </P> <P> "I think that top management at Texaco during the last year has done a good job  in making Texaco leaner and more productive," said Icahn, who has made a  fortune in recent years by engaging in takeover attempts involving such major  companies as Philips Petroleum and American Can.  </P> <P> Eugene L. Nowak, a leading oil industry analyst at the New York investment  house of Dean Witter, said the agreement neutralizes Icahn and provides  substantial benefit for Texaco shareholders.  </P> <P> "It seems to eliminate the possibility of a takeover, or at least cuts those  odds significantly," said Nowak.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Victory for Kinnear  </P> <P> In addition to not buying more Texaco stock, Icahn agreed to give the company a  say in how he would dispose of his current holdings, should he decide to do so.  That presumably would prohibit him from selling out to another raider.  </P> <P> A Texaco spokeswoman characterized the agreement as a victory for Kinnear, and  industry analysts said Icahn must have decided he could not win a bid to elect  his slate to the company's board at its annual meeting in May.  </P> <P> The major institutional investors in Texaco apparently had aligned themselves  with management, as they did in helping to defeat Icahn's proxy bid last year.  </P> <P> Under pressure from Icahn to improve its return to shareholders, Texaco has  sold off nearly $7 billion in assets in the last year, including a  $3.24-billion cash deal to sell its interest in Texaco Canada to a subsidiary  of Exxon Corp. which was announced on Jan. 19.  </P> <P> The cash raised from the sales will be used to pay the special dividends and  help pay down the company's $8-billion debt if the plan is approved by  shareholders at the annual meeting in early May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Improved Prices  </P> <P> If approved, the first special dividend will be $4 per share in three-year  notes. The second dividend will consist of $3 in cash per share and $1 in a new  preferred stock.  </P> <P> In June, Kinnear had said Texaco would distribute $1.7 billion to shareholders  from the proceeds of asset sales. The higher distribution was the result of  improved prices for some assets along with pressure from Icahn, according to  analysts.  </P> <P> "I'd say in general that, from a shareholder's viewpoint, this is quite  satisfactory," said Todd L. Bergman, an analyst at the New York investment firm  of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.  </P></p>

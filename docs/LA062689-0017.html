			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAINLAND'S TURBULENCE ELICITS AMBIVALENCE;  </P> <P> TAIWAN VIEW OF BEIJING: SHOCK BUT DETACHMENT  </P> <P> A few days ago, while death sentences were being pronounced against  pro-democracy protesters in China, stockbrokers in Taiwan popped champagne  corks in celebration of a new market high.  </P> <P> The coincidence of events reflected a crosscurrent of attitudes in Taiwan  toward turbulent events on the mainland. Although the attack on Beijing's Tian  An Men Square and its aftermath deeply shocked people here, there was also a  sense of detachment.  </P> <P> Students and common citizens, imbued with feelings of kinship and shared  history with the mainland, donated blood and money for relief efforts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Great Effect  </P> <P> But the problem was viewed as one that would not, after all, greatly effect  Taiwan. Nor could Taiwan do much about the situation on the mainland. Talk on  the street just as easily turns to the local preoccupation with air pollution  as to the plight of Chinese dissidents.  </P> <P> "For most of us, Tian An Men was a televised event. We watched and then went on  with our business," said Zhan Hungzhi, a publisher and author.  </P> <P> Commented one Western observer: "Taiwan looked across and saw this giant  thrashing around and decided it was not worth getting too involved."  </P> <P> Taiwan residents pointed out that this island is not like Hong Kong, which  feels the mainland's breath getting closer -- the British colony is scheduled  to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fiery Analogy  </P> <P> People here feel confident that their lives will go on uninterrupted for the  foreseeable future. "Hong Kong is like a tenant in a building that is on fire.  It is screaming for help," said Edward Yang, a film maker. "Taiwan lives across  the street. The fire is compelling, even upsetting, but does not necessarily  effect the value of the property."  </P> <P> The ambivalence of the general populace was shared by Taiwan's ruling  Nationalist government that, being the political bastion of the late Chiang  Kai-shek's Kuomintang organization, bills itself as the archrival and future  successor of the Communist government in Beijing.  </P> <P> There was a time when turmoil in China would send hearts aflutter here among  Nationalist diehards who dream of taking back the mainland from which they were  driven 40 years ago. And a few old-timers did insist that now was the time for  the Nationalists to go home.  </P> <P> However, news of trouble in Beijing mostly brought out expressions of timidity  rather than predictions of impending triumph.  </P> <P> Although the government found its incessant anti-Communist propaganda  chillingly confirmed by the attack on Tian An Men Square, it was not eager to  crow about the troubles on the mainland.  </P> <P> Officials appeared to be ill at ease with Taiwan's being brought into the  picture at all. Word last week that China was blaming 13 alleged spies in the  service of Taiwan for inciting "counterrevolutionary riots" only increased  their anxiety.  </P> <P> "Our worst fear is that we be used as a scapegoat. That is why we restrain  ourselves," said government spokesman Shaw Yuming.  </P> <P> "We specifically avoided making propaganda points," added Liu Polung, who heads  the North American Department of Taiwan's Foreign Ministry. "All in all it is a  time for caution."  </P> <P> The muted response may also be due to the government's own record of putting  down demonstrations and popular movements, Chinese and foreign observers say.  Martial law was in place here for 38 years and was lifted only two years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hypocrisy Seen  </P> <P> "There was some hypocrisy in the government's clucking over Tian An Men," a  representative of a Western country said.  </P> <P> Before the killings in Beijing, Taiwan's government itself mounted  demonstrations, keeping them carefully under control lest they turn into local  pleas for greater democracy or for outright independence from China.  </P> <P> After the massacre, officials here took 48 hours to fully react and Chinese  commentators said that the government was doing too little to support  dissidence in China.  </P> <P> The government responded by sending up some balloons to carry newspapers into  China and by expanding radio broadcasts beamed at the mainland.  </P> <P> Most wallposters mourning the dead in Beijing are now gone from Taipei's  university campuses. The president of state-run Taipei University ordered a  display of posters removed from the school's front gate, saying that it was  unsightly. The banners included some commentary against the Taiwan government.  </P> <P> No one is saying that the turbulence in China has brought the day closer when  Taiwan will be reunified with its giant and impoverished cousin across the  Formosa Strait. On the contrary, a recent warming trend in relations between  Beijing and Taipei appears to be in unofficial suspension.  </P> <P> The government had authorized travel to China for non-government tourists and  in May sent an official representative to the Asian Development Bank meeting  held in Beijing. For several years, Taiwan had looked the other way as its  businessmen traded with and even invested in China.  </P> <P> "As we liberalize, there was an illusion that things would get better quickly,"  said Liu from the Foreign Ministry. "Perhaps now we will all have a more sober  view."  </P> <P> The government had recently floated an idea to ease tensions with China: a  so-called one country-two governments policy that would put the Nationalists,  who control only Taiwan and a few small nearby islands, on a par with the  Communists in Beijing.  </P> <P> A proposal was modeled on such split-nationhoods as East and West Germany and  North and South Korea.  </P> <P> This idea, too, appears to be a victim of the Tian An Men massacre.  </P> <P> No matter. Taiwan seems to have grown accustomed to -- even to have embraced --  its strange status as a country fully recognized by only 15 other nations,  including such exotic addresses as South Africa, El Salvador and Haiti. The  rest of the world either ignores the island or, like the United States and  Japan, maintains relations through private front organizations manned by  diplomats on leave.  </P> <P> Taiwan lost all this diplomatic status in the 1970s when erstwhile friends  rushed to open relations with China, which was beginning to emerge from the  shadows of the Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> Since then, the island has prospered mightily, joining Hong Kong, Singapore and  South Korea on the list of "little dragons" that have followed Japan, the Big  Dragon, in building impressive economies.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, Taipei was a sleepy provincial capital. It has now taken on  the trappings of a regional powerhouse.  </P> <P> A new theater and a new concert hall have been done in the manner of Qing  Dynasty palaces, down to the gold-tiled roofs and giant red pillars. A new  railroad station is also being built along the same lines. Glass-encased office  buildings are all the rage as well. Traffic is a world-class mess.  </P> <P> So confident are Taiwan residents of their economic future that some experts  see gain even from the crisis in China.  </P> <P> "It is my opinion that the impact will be favorable. Business people may  transfer purchases and even investment to Taiwan from China," said Chao  Kangyang, who heads the Chinese Economic Institute, a private think tank in  Taipei.  </P> <P> Chao considers that flight capital from Hong Kong may have fueled the recent  binge on Taiwan's stock market.  </P> <P> The willingness of Taiwan to brush aside the mainland crisis suggests to some  that emotional ties with the mainland may be loosening.  </P> <P> Bo Yang, a writer whose works have at one time or another been banned in both  China and Taiwan, noted that many citizens here have visited China and see that  there are grave practical differences that will keep the people apart for many  years.  </P> <P> "The failure of democracy on the mainland is yet another obstacle. Until Tian  An Men, perhaps we who live in Taiwan could think of reunification," Bo said.  "Now it is more difficult."  </P> <P> Economist Chao, who was born in China, is planning to make a trip there soon to  transfer the ashes of his in-laws from the path of a new highway being built  near his old hometown in northeastern China.  </P> <P> Would he like to return to spend his future retirement there?  </P> <P> "I have a house in San Luis Obispo," Chao said. "That is where I would like to  live."  </P></p>

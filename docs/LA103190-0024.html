			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN SPITE OF INFLATION, PRICES OF MANY ASSETS ARE FALLING;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: RISING ENERGY COSTS FUEL INCREASES. BUT REAL ESTATE, PRECIOUS METALS  AND OTHER ITEMS ARE DROPPING.  </P> <P> All the attention to rising energy costs is overshadowing a peculiar new trait  of the U.S. economy: It is displaying a split personality when it comes to  inflation.  </P> <P> Even as oil prices have dominated the headlines, prices for some raw materials,  real estate, precious metals and other assets have been falling in the slumping  economy. For these and other reasons, today's inflation flare-up could prove  less painful than past episodes.  </P> <P> "The impact of the oil shock on inflation is temporary," predicted Mickey D.  Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York.  </P> <P> You might not know it from recent statistics. In August and September, the  consumer price index jumped to a 9.5% annual rate. Wholesale prices took their  greatest short-term leap in a decade, according to the Labor Department.  Consumer inflation, measured for the final three months of this year, may hit a  10% annual rate.  </P> <P> Moreover, energy costs are certain to boost inflation for various goods and  services in the coming months.  </P> <P> "For the first time in 10 years, inflation is rising toward double digits,"  said Allen Sinai, chief economist with The Boston Co.  </P> <P> Yet there is a paradox. When the volatile factors of energy and food are not  considered, September consumer prices rose at a more modest 4% rate. The  statistic underscores the important differences between today's oil shock and  past bouts of inflation, including public psychology, the sluggish economy and  policies of the Federal Reserve Board.  </P> <P> While oil prices have been rising, prices for a wide range of assets have been  sliding in the United States and other countries.  </P> <P> "The undertow that we have in the economy right now isn't inflation -- it's  deflation," said John Rutledge, chairman of the Claremont Economic Institute.  </P> <P> What is more, these trends are not likely to change dramatically, as some  customers scale back their purchases in a time of recession fears.  </P> <P> A recent episode in the paper industry helps show why economic conditions may  not lend themselves to higher prices.  </P> <P> On Oct. 1, major producers of paper products announced a $30-per-ton increase  in prices for linerboard, a material used to make corrugated boxes. But the  customers -- box makers and other manufacturers -- have rejected the attempt,  citing the weak economy and the large supply of linerboard that remains  available.  </P> <P> The hike is "dead as a doornail," said George B. Adler, a paper industry  analyst with the Smith Barney investment firm in New York. "Customers for boxes  are not willing to accept the price increase."  </P> <P> In other cases, companies -- fearful of losing sales in a listless economy --  have passed on to customers only some of the increase in energy costs.  </P> <P> Chemical manufacturers, for instance, have faced a whopping 57% increase in the  cost of ethylene glycol, used for antifreeze. But so far they have passed on  just a 13% hike to their industrial customers; little if any of the increase  has reached the retail level, said Allen J. Lenz, director of trade and  economics for the Chemical Manufacturers Assn. in Washington.  </P> <P> Prices for petrochemicals and other oil-based products also have risen much  less than the price of energy.  </P> <P> "We see a situation evolving in which it will be difficult for industries to  pass on increases because of the weaker economy," said Frantz R. Price, vice  president of strategic industry analysis at the WEFA Group, consultants in  Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.  </P> <P> Indeed, some widely used industrial materials have been falling in price for  several months.  </P> <P> Prices for zinc, rubber, hides, certain metal scrap and other raw materials  have been running lower than a year ago, in some cases sharply so. Tin prices,  for instance, have recently been as much as 26% less than a year ago on the  open market.  </P> <P> A price index of 13 industrial commodities, compiled by the Commodity Research  Bureau in New York, stands 3.8% lower than it did last October. This pattern of  weak commodity prices carries a clear message, some say: The sluggish global  economy does not lend itself to red-hot inflation.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty good indicator of what's likely to happen to inflation and  interest rates," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers  Hanover Trust Co.  </P> <P> "You'll get a couple of bad months of inflation," he said, "but by the end of  the winter -- assuming a normal winter -- I think we'll be back down to a 3% to  3 1/2% inflation rate."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, tried and true inflation hedges of the past, such as real estate and  precious metals, have been stagnating or declining in value.  </P> <P> Commercial real estate values, for instance, have been hammered in much of the  country. Reasons include a surplus of office space -- vacancy rates now hover  between 15% and 20% in much of Southern California -- and the scarcity of  financing for projects, arising from problems in the thrift and banking  industries.  </P> <P> "The two of those things together are causing a downturn in real estate  prices," said Frederick K. Zimmermann, president of Boylston Capital Advisors,  a money management firm in Boston.  </P> <P> Prices for gold, another popular refuge in times of inflation, also have been  dropping. After soaring by $42 an ounce in the first weeks after Iraq invaded  Kuwait, gold has fallen back to pre-invasion price levels of less than $380.  </P> <P> Gold investors are not convinced that inflation is going to surge, explained  Bruce L. Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp; Co., a precious-metals consulting  firm in Los Angeles. The lackluster economy also has taken the sparkle out of  such other precious-metal investments as silver, used in the photographic  industry, and platinum, used by auto makers.  </P> <P> "Investors are reading magazines like Fortune that say inflation may be topping  out right now -- even with the increase in oil prices," Kaplan said.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve policy may be yet another reason that inflation does not take  off in the coming months.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the Fed moved to ease interest rates as a way to stimulate  the economy. But the move was modest, a clear sign that inflation fears remain  strong among policy-makers in Washington.  </P> <P> "They've learned from their mistakes of the past," said Michael Penzer, a vice  president and senior economist at the Bank of America in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Still, as the Fed's caution demonstrates, nobody is writing off inflation as a  threat. In particular, some worry about stagflation -- a bout with  uncomfortably high prices at a time of uncomfortably sluggish growth.  </P> <P> These days, the weak U.S. dollar creates inflationary pressure by pushing up  import prices and by forcing the Fed to keep interest rates high enough to  attract foreign investment.  </P> <P> Health care -- notably hospital fees -- higher education, local taxes and the  cost of shelter all have risen substantially this year. Even before Iraq  invaded Kuwait, the underlying annual rate of inflation was creeping up from  the 4.5% range to greater than 5%.  </P> <P> "The question is how do you stop it?" asked David Wyss, an economist with Data  Resources-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass., of inflation in health care and  other services. "The standard formulas don't work very well."  </P> <P> There also is no standard formula to forecast how members of the public will  behave in the coming months. Back in the 1970s, Americans got so accustomed to  a never-ending spiral of rising wages and prices that the hikes were accepted  routinely.  </P> <P> But after years of restraint in wage and price increases, public psychology may  be different this time, with employers less willing to raise wages and  consumers less accepting of higher prices.  </P> <P> For all the uncertainties, "I absolutely expect inflation to fall next year"  from current levels, said Joel L. Naroff, senior economist at First Fidelity  Bancorp in Philadelphia.  </P></p>

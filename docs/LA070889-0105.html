Strub Stakes, will be when  Bill Shoemaker makes his last ride.  </P> <P> Shoemaker, 58 next month, has been riding since 1949, and by bowing out next  year he will be able to do what no other jockey has done -- ride in six  decades.  </P> <P> Shoemaker, who has ridden more than 8,800 winners, announced his impending  retirement earlier this year and is on a farewell tour that has taken him to  many of the tracks in Europe. Today, he is scheduled to ride at Phoenix Park in  Ireland.  </P> <P> On July 21, Hollywood Park will run a special evening program in its farewell  salute to Shoemaker, who is returning from Europe earlier that week.  </P> <P> Shoemaker has won the Strub and its forerunner, the Santa Anita Maturity, seven  times, his last win in the stake coming aboard Spectacular Bid in 1980.

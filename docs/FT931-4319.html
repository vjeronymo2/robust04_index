			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Tax cuts help boost Novo Nordisk net NOVO NORDISK, the pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group, reported a jump of 38 per cent in net profits to DKr1.27bn (Dollars 198m) last year from DKr928m in 1991. The boost to net earnings was helped by a reduction in the Danish corporate profits tax rate from 38 to 34 per cent, a factor in reducing Novo Nordisk's tax to DKr401m from DKr531m in 1991, according to the preliminary report. Earnings per share were up by 26 per cent from DKr27.02 to DKr34.12. An unchanged DKr4 per share (20 per cent) dividend was proposed. Pre-tax profits increased by a more moderate 15 per cent to DKr1.67bn from DKr1.48bn. Sales were ahead by 14 per cent to DKr10.69bn from DKr9.36bn in 1991. The group continued to expand production capacity in both Denmark and abroad, mainly in the US, for its major products, insulin, growth hormone and enzymes, with investment expenditure rising by 45 per cent last year to DKr1.95bn. Trading conditions and instability in the foreign exchange and capital markets may make it difficult to achieve the group's goal of an annual 15 per cent growth in pre-tax income, the report said.</p>

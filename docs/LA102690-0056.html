Gen. Michel Aoun and two aides and is looking for an  additional $50 million.  </P> <P> A government official said the seizure of Aoun's money was part of a drive by  President Elias Hrawi to reunite Beirut and regain state resources, utilities  and money lost to armed groups during the 15-year civil war. Aoun was toppled  Oct. 13 by a Syrian-led assault on Beirut's Christian enclave.  </P> <P> Six Lebanese banks handed over the money of Aoun and aides Edgard Maalouf and  Issam abu Jamra to the Central Bank after the government froze their Beirut  accounts, the official said.  </P></p>

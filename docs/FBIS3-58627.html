			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider by Eva </F> Grosskinsky, Heiner Emde, and Eugen Georg Schwarz; place and  date not given: "Still Guest of the FDP Grass Roots"]    [Text] [FOCUS] Your Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] is on  bad terms with the Liberal International. The Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP] no longer appreciates you as a guest  speaker. Do you now want to gain a foothold in Germany with the  help of your friend Manfred Brunner?    [Haider] I was never popular as a guest speaker with the  FDP.  I am still popular with the grass roots. I will also participate  in some events in the foreseeable future, in order to signal  that the FDP leadership is ill advised and there is apparently  no consensus with its grass roots.    [FOCUS] Do you believe Mr. Brunner's movement will be able  to  create such grass roots?    [Haider] First of all, it is important that his party  exists.  I also believe his chances in the European elections are not  bad. And if it is desired, I will be absolutely prepared to  support him.    [FOCUS] In what form?    [Haider] I do not yet have a clear idea. It will also depend  on what he is really going to make of his group. It probably  has to be seriously discussed to what extent his "citizens"  movement is a party that can be regarded as a possible sister  party. Of course, we do not have the intention -- as the FPOe  or with Brunner's party -- to establish branches throughout  Europe. It is my wish that Manfred Brunner will establish  something like an independent Freedom Party of Germany. There  is a voters' potential of at least 15 percent. In my opinion,  Germany needs a liberal power, something like the FPOe in  Austria. After all, the FDP has become a leftist party. And  the Republikaner do not offer anything either. It is simply not  enough to take the problem of "foreigners" and to say: "This is  our issue."    [FOCUS] But you also have a preference for harping on it.    [Haider] Foreigners were the main issue in our petition for  a  referendum in 1993....    [FOCUS] ....which did not meet with sufficient agreement.    [Haider] At any rate, it was one of the most successful  petitions for a referendum in the Austrian Second Republic. And  now the main issue is the reform of the state as whole, by which  the political system is to be overcome.    [FOCUS] It is also one reason you are regarded as an  extreme-right politician. How do you deal with this reproach?    [Haider] With my party, I am simply a special Austrian  model.  I protest against being compared with anyone. At any rate, we,  the FPOe as a whole, are a compromise between a liberal and a  national position.    [FOCUS] You want to establish a Third Republic in Austria.  How do you envisage it?    [Haider] We need a new constitution, from which the systems  of chambers and associations as a pillar of the constitution  disappear....    [FOCUS] ....and with what do you want to replace it?    [Haider] The citizen.    [FOCUS] This is too vague for us. Who is "the citizen?"    [Haider] Our political system in Austria does not know the  citizen at all. We have a state of chambers, associations, and  parties, and the citizen is, so to speak, the raw material that  is supplied for the functioning of these chambers and  associations. This involves a considerable loss of freedom.  That is why we have the barbarism of the ideological terror of  party politics and a mediatized freedom of the citizens. For  example, these are two elements that are no longer supposed to  exist in a Third Republic.    [FOCUS] Nevertheless, you are encouraging the following  suspicion: "It is true that Haider is now saying that the  citizen's will is decisive -- but what if he is in power?" Can  you dispel the misgivings that your Third Republic will not be a  parliamentary democracy?    [Haider] This argumentation is inappropriate. You invalidate  the rules between government and opposition if you simply impute  to the opposition the statement that "in reality you want  something completely different!" It speaks in my favor that as  governor of a province during a limited period I showed that we  take promises seriously. In the two years in which I was  responsible for affairs in Carinthia, an incredibly large number  of reform steps were taken in this direction.    [FOCUS] What are the FPOe's conditions for Austria to join  the European Union?    [Haider] The first point is adopting the transit treaty we  have with the European Community. Second, we want to change  over to extensive agriculture and support our farmers with  direct payments. In this way, we can save a lot of money that  is already spent today on marketing the surplus. Third, in the  field of real estate transactions, we are thinking of the Danish  model: five years of residence in Austria, then the opportunity  to acquire land.    [FOCUS] Your phrases create the impression that you are the  stronghold against the immigration of millions?    [Haider] We are not afraid of the immigration of Sicilians  who want to open pizzerias everywhere here. The problem is the  Eastern European region, the Asiatic region, and North Africa.  We will be confronted with large migration movements from  there. Today nobody says any longer: "We must have open  borders!" We have reeducated the people in the government  parties.    [FOCUS] You? Not inherent necessities?    [Haider] We reeducated them.    [FOCUS] The Germans, too?    [Haider] I am not responsible for Germany. I am responsible  for Austria.    [FOCUS] The word "German" features largely in your  vocabulary. Do you want to go "home into the Reich" with Austria?    [Haider] We as Austrians do not want the anschluss. We work  hard enough ourselves, so we can be arrogant enough to say: We  do not necessarily need you. You need us. The national complex  in Germany and the Germans' self-hatred for their own people are  so great that we do not particularly wish to participate in it.  We prefer to go our own way.</p>

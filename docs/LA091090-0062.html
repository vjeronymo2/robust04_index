			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA ROUGH WATER SWIM;  </P> <P> RODRIGUES, KNIGHT LEAVE FIELD IN A FOG  </P> <P> A rosy-cheeked little girl with hope in her heart approached the check-in desk  at La Jolla Cove shortly after noon Sunday.  </P> <P> "Are we going to get to swim today?" she asked in a small but determined voice.  </P> <P> After a delay of an hour and 45 minutes, she got her answer when the 60th La  Jolla Rough Water Swim resumed.  </P> <P> Shark scares, polio outbreaks and wars have caused cancellation of one of the  premier rough-water swims in the country 14 times since 1916. But never has it  been a casualty of weather, much less fog.  </P> <P> "It's never cloudy in September. This is June weather," said Ken Kimball, a  co-founder of U.S. Masters Swimming and a participant in the event since 1962.  "There's been rain, and thunder and lightning, but it's only delayed it, never  canceled it."  </P> <P> Officials reasoned that if you couldn't see the buoys that marked the 1-mile  course, you couldn't swim it, not safely anyway.  </P> <P> "Our ultimate concern was for the swimmers," said Bill Uncapher, event director  the past 16 years. "We've had a perfect track record (no deaths or major  injuries) in 60 years, and I like to keep it that way."  </P> <P> Although each swimmer -- 1,200 participated -- is required to sign a waiver  that releases organizers of liability, Dave Lamott, chairman of Competition  Committee, said litigation was still a concern.  </P> <P> "We could have been accused of being negligent," Lamott said. "All it would  take is for one person to veer off course and lose them. I was very concerned  that we would have to cancel."  </P> <P> Organizers speculated that the unseasonable fog was a result of the humid air  hitting the chilly (63-degree) water. Although skies in La Jolla were sunny  Saturday, Kimball said the water temperature had dropped five or six degrees.  </P> <P> Before the sun finally burned through the thick blanket of fog and increased  visibility enough for lifeguard Marshall Parks to give clearance to resume the  event, swimmers read, cradled babies in their arms, walked dogs and chatted  with friends.  </P> <P> But those who traveled from out of town figured the wait wasn't going to ruin  their day.  </P> <P> "It was nice to get a delay," said Gerry Rodrigues of Santa Monica, the overall  men's masters winner. "Maybe more guys left because they didn't want to wait."  </P> <P> Rodrigues, who skipped the event last year but won it in his first try in 1988,  didn't wait for the competition. He surged to a quick lead and held it until  the final 800 yards, when Bari Weick and William Purcell started to close in.  </P> <P> "Then the three of us were lined up," Rodrigues said, "Bari really turned the  jets on. It was an all-out sprint, and I was fatigued. We stayed together until  the last 10 yards, where I managed to get a body length lead."  </P> <P> According to Rodrigues, organizers did the right thing in delaying. By the time  his group -- the men's masters -- hit the water, conditions were close to  perfect.  </P> <P> "They made sure you could see the first marker," he said. "They did a good job.  There was no problem seeing."  </P> <P> Del Mar's Beth Knight also found the conditions to her liking. Knight easily  won the women's masters title, finishing almost 90 seconds ahead of the  second-place finisher in her age group. She is now seven for seven in this  event, having won since 1984.  </P> <P> Knight said that although it has been four or five years since she has been  seriously challenged here, she still feels pressure.  </P> <P> "I am very aware that this isn't handed to me," she said. "I have to work.  Every year is different, and I'll just prepare and do the best I can, until my  number's up."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKYER'S BILL ON WAITING  </P> <P> State Sen. Bill Lockyer is right on target with his bill that would require  businesses to specify a two-hour "window" during which they will appear at a  home ("At Last, Revenge on Those Who Make Us Sit and Wait," Op-Ed Page, March  23). I would suggest he go a step further and require all public utilities to  provide turn-on service on Saturdays.  </P> <P> How many of us have had to spend a day off work waiting for the gas or  electricity to be turned on?  </P> <P> If the utilities were truly public-service oriented, they wouldn't need a law  to force them to provide this service. They would do it because it's reasonable  and good business!  </P> <P> ROBERT J. BANNING  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

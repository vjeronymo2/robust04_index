			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURANCE POLICIES  </P> <P> I read with interest your editorial "How to Make a Financial Killing" (Oct. 8).  Gang violence is a tragedy that touches us all.  </P> <P> Your newspaper reports almost daily on the unfortunate problem and its toll.  </P> <P> Your editorial makes many important points. In commenting on insurance  salespeople who use (and abuse) the natural fears of people living in  crime-torn neighborhoods to sell low-cost policies, you observe that the public  should aim its disgust at the gang problem rather than a few "brazen insurance  salesmen." I agree.  </P> <P> However, as a representative of the life insurance industry, I decry the  questionable and inappropriate marketing strategies which your editorial  discusses. In fact, these insurance "salespeople" tarnish the reputations of  the vast majority who are decent, ethical and hard-working.  </P> <P> The life insurance industry takes its community responsibilities seriously. As  corporate citizens, we are involved in the community and provide ongoing  support for many activities, including those that serve the needs of urban  areas.  </P> <P> BRAD WENGER, President  </P> <P> Assn. of California Life Insurance Cos.  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

"Debts must be paid," he said, meaning the 220 billion ruble  debt of television companies to the Ministry of Communications.    At the same time Viktor Chernomyrdin said that it is  necessary "to sort out to whom and how we broadcast." He  believes that not all programs should be broadcast on state  channels. The head of the Russian Cabinet did not rule out that  in very near future a number of channels and TV studios may be  privatized or sold off.    Chernomyrdin expressed doubt in the necessity to continue  the  practice of broadcasting on all channels until 0300. "There  should be broadcasting, but not on all channels," the premier  underlined.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / N Sea oil rig workers evacuated MORE THAN 30 oil workers were evacuated from a North Sea platform last night after it was hit by a power failure. Oil company Amoco said they were airlifting non-essential personnel from the Montrose Alpha platform, about 130 miles east of Aberdeen. The Aberdeen coastguard said no-one was understood to have been injured and the platform, which is permanently secured to the sea-bed, was in no danger. The coastguard added: 'We don't know why there was a power failure. There's no danger of the platform drifting anywhere, but the loss of power means that communications are difficult.' Oil production by the main countries involved in the North Sea will reach a record level of nearly 5.5m barrels per day in 1995 - a 41 per cent increase on 1991 - according to a report from Mackay Consultants, oil industry analysts. Mackay says output from new oil fields coming on-stream mainly in the UK and Norway sectors will more than compensate for declining production in some of the older fields. In their report, Prospects for the North Sea Oil and Gas Industry 1993-95, Mr David Rennie and Mr Tony Mackay say the expected increase is a result of a high level of development work over the last five years. They do not expect a continuing rise after 1995 because the level of such activity is much lower.</p>

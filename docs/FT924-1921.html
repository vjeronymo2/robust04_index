			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Peruvian army's anger rumbles on: Growing calls for amnesty echo its resentment A MONTH after the failed coup attempt against the government of President Alberto Fujimori, newly elected congressmen are calling for an amnesty for the military involved. As resentment within the armed forces at the treatment of their arrested colleagues spreads, and with the installation of the new congress just a fortnight away, Peru's new politicians say it is time for national reconciliation. Tension heightened at the weekend when the government took the unprecedented step of sending four leading generals, including the coup ringleader, retired Gen Jaime Salinas Sedo, to Lima's infamous Castro high-security prison. 'This is criminal,' said Mr Javier Valle Riestra, acting defence counsel for Gen Salinas since his previous lawyer, Mr Alberto Borea, was banned from acting for his client last week by the military judge trying the case. Mr Borea is one of a number of civilians allegedly implicated in the aborted coup attempt of November 13. 'The four generals, and nine or 10 other senior officers, are held like common delinquents in a prison for drug traffickers and terrorists,' Mr Valle Riestra said. 'The only purpose can be to intimidate any other officers who have the same constitutionalist leanings.' Gen Salinas has justified the November 13 coup attempt in repeated statements smuggled out of his previous army detention centre. He claims Mr Fujimori's April 5 overturning of the 1979 constitution gave the armed forces the right and indeed the duty to rebel. His arguments have got support from consitutionalists and politicians. Gen Salinas has consistently denied Mr Fujimori's allegations that the plotters intended to assassinate the president. Sources close to senior Peruvian military men say the treatment meted out to the officers under arrest has angered their armed forces' colleagues. Army wives have protested that the interrogation of their husbands included torture at the hands of the national intelligence service. Although the top military backed Mr Fujimori's April moves to dissolve congress, there have been rumblings of discontent in the middle ranks of all three services for some months. Low pay is a prime concern, as are recent modifications to internal promotion and retirement systems. Some officers at commander, major and captain level (who call themselves Comaca), have been circulating pamphlets accusing their superiors of 'servility' to the government.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: Sedipova - singled out for praise / Recital The love affair between the Wigmore Hall public and its Russian singers gets ever more intense. On Wednesday there was a new object of adoration, the soprano Valentina Sedipova, making her London debut during the Mariinsky-Kirov Series. Sedipova, one of the seemingly endless supply of young Russian sopranos making an impact in the west, is a leading member of the Kirov Opera. Reporting from St Petersburg in February, Max Loppert singled her out for praise after her alluring Sea Princess in Sadko. This recital confirmed those impressions: hers is a well-supported voice, powerful and full of colour throughout its range. She sang a fascinating programme that underlined the richness of Romantic Russian song. No less than seven composers were represented, including rarities by Sergey Taneyev, Alexander Grechaninov and Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov. Sedipova began, appropriately, with the 'father of Russian music', Glinka: initial nervousness soon disappeared, and the soprano revealed a liveliness in 'To her' and 'Bolero'. She caught the languid atmosphere of Taneyev's 'Through the ethereal haze' perfectly. Three familiar Tchaikovsky songs were given fresh treatment by Sedipova and her idiomatic accompanist, Larissa Gergieva. The soprano scaled down her voice for the light 'Serenade', and opened it out again for the bursting emotion of 'Whether the day reigns'. In the encores Sedipova finally allowed her operatic voice to come out. Santuzza, Cio-Cio-San and Gioconda were brought to impassioned life in full-throated Italianate singing. We must hear her at Covent Garden. The Mariinsky-Kirov Series is supported by the Regent Hotel (London) and British Airways (St Petersburg).</p>

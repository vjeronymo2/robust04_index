			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The road from Edinburgh to Emu still looks bumpy THE Edinburgh summit will be hailed as a triumph. But euphoria should be contained. The journey to economic and monetary union may have not been abandoned, but the road ahead will be bumpy. The past three months have demonstrated how bumpy it can be. When the FT last published a table on convergence, on December 9, 1991, many thought that the ERM, which had operated without a significant realignment for almost five years, offered a smooth road to Emu. Things look rather different after the exit of the Italian lira and pound sterling and the realignments of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo. Whether the French franc retains its parity with the ERM is likely to prove more important for Emu than anything agreed by the 12 leaders of the European Community over the weekend. It is the Bundesbank's determination to preserve the value of the D-Mark, despite German unification, that has so shaken the ERM. But the Bundesbank is not engaged in a quixotic tilt at inflationary windmills. Its goals are shared by many Germans, as was demonstrated by the terms on which the Bundestag ratified the Maastricht Treaty earlier this month. By insisting that they be given another chance to examine Emu before signing away the D-Mark, German politicians have warned others of their opposition to any watering down of the convergence criteria. The criteria in the Maastricht Treaty were that a country shall possess: 'an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than 2 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing member states in terms of price stability'; and an average rate of inflation 'that does not exceed by more than 1 1/2 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing member states'; a currency that 'shall have respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination'; a sustainable government financial position. This is defined, first, by 'whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product exceeds' 3 per cent, 'unless either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to' 3 per cent or 'the excess . . . is only exceptional and temporary', and, second, by 'whether the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeds' 60 per cent, 'unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching' 60 per cent 'at a satisfactory pace.' What, if any, progress has the EC been making towards the convergence aim? Eight countries meet the interest rate criterion, the same countries also meeting the inflation criterion. The countries with the best inflation performance in 1992 were Belgium, Denmark and France. Only seven countries - the minimum number for Emu in 1997 - meet the ERM criterion. But who knows how many more realignments may be forced on the ERM? Only France, Denmark and Luxembourg are forecast to meet the government borrowing criterion next year (see chart). As for the target for government debt, it is currently met by only five countries. In sum, Luxembourg and France alone would pass all the tests for Emu. But Germany and, intriguingly, Denmark are close enough to make the grade. Thus, half the countries eligible for Emu do not want to join and one of the other two, Luxembourg, is already in a currency union. Ireland still fails on public debt; the UK now succeeds on inflation, but fails on the fiscal deficit and ERM membership; Belgium and the Netherlands fail on both aspects of fiscal policy; Spain fails on everything, apart from the public debt ratio; and Greece, Italy, and Portugal fail on everything. The economic significance of these criteria must not be exaggerated. They are not logically necessary for a successful Emu. But Emu is a political project. If German politicians want to be difficult, it looks as though they will have plenty of excuses.</p>

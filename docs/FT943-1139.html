			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Llewellyn gives up Paris for Lehman Bros Lehman Brothers clearly has a liking for talent grown in the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, writes Peter Norman. It is appointing John Llewellyn, currently head of the private office of OECD secretary general Jean-Claude Paye, to be its London-based head of European economic research. Llewellyn (below) will take up the post of managing director and chief economist, Europe in January. He will step into shoes vacated by Gerry Holtham, a former close colleague at the OECD, who moved this summer to head the Institute of Public Policy Research, a left-of-centre think-tank in London. Llewellyn, 50, will manage a team of five economists in London and will report to Allen Sinai, global chief economist of Lehman Brothers in New York, and to senior management in London. He will have overall responsibility for Lehman Brothers' pan-European research and for spreading the company's economic message to its clients in Europe. There, the contacts and experience acquired during 17 years at the OECD should prove invaluable. While Llewellyn has acted as Paye's eminence grise for the past five years, implementing the secretary general's policy inside the organisation and liaising with member and non-member countries, the bulk of his career in Paris has been more directly concerned with economic policy and analysis. He was deputy director of the social affairs directorate from 1986 to 1989 and head of the economics prospects division, editing the twice yearly Economic Outlook, from 1978 to 1986. Llewellyn, who has UK and New Zealand nationality and was a Cambridge economics don before going to Paris, said he was drawn to Lehman because 'it is the most global in outlook of the investment banks'.</p>

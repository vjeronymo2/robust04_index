			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "International Forum Brings </F> Together New Boys in the Computer World"]    [Text] The Fifth International Computer Forum, which  traditionally assembles the world market leaders in information  technology, has opened at the International Trade Center. The  International Computer Forum is an elite gathering of computer  people -- tickets for the event are not on sale, you cannot just  "walk in" off the street. Each year the International Computer  Forum marks a stage in the country's progress toward the  assimilation of modern information technology.    This time around 600 computer industry leaders were  registered in Moscow. Some of the ever-presents -- such as the  famous "Borland" -- decided to miss out on this forum. On the  one hand, this looks like a slight, but most often refusal is  due to the fact that the leading computer firms in Russia  already have a network of dealers and distributors, and they  usually display only innovations at the Moscow forum. The  International Computer Forum differs from the larger "Komtek"  exhibition in that the forum is not a trade fair but a place to  draw attention to your name. The practice of previous forums  shows that invitations to the International Computer Forum are  much in demand and are sold and resold at large "mark-ups."    In the opinion of Mikhail Mishustin, chairman of the  International Computer Club Board, the distinctive feature of  Russia's computer market in 1994 will be the increasing  activeness of managers who have been trained in the West.  Talented programmers who have surprised their colleagues with  their output play a secondary role, while the businessmen, who  just five years ago could make some kind of a living by  reselling simple Western computers, are quite overshadowed.  These changes show that Russia, following the example of the  developed countries, is gradually organizing a civilized  information technology structure.    The number of computers in Russia is currently put at 3  million "PC's," while the software market is valued at $350  million. Last year around 500,000 computers were sold in Russia  -- still very few by the standards of the developed world. But  attention is drawn to the increasingly widespread switch from  286's to more modern processors.    The Fifth International Computer Forum was marked by the  number of new boys in the computer world. The Banyan company,  which has thrown down the gauntlet in the network operating  systems market to the mighty Novell, was making its Moscow  debut. "Entrepreneur of the Year" Dzherri Rodzhers [name as  transliterated], president of the Cyrix firm, which destroyed  Intel's long-standing monopoly in developing 386- and  486-compatible processors, will be coming to Moscow. The forum  is particularly valuable for the participation of Sisko [name as  transliterated] Systems, the world leader in the market for  internetwork communications -- which Russia needs more than  anything. It is clear from the list of participants that the  International Computer Forum is seen by Western participants as  an important springboard for the veritable war that is currently  being waged in the market for central processors.    The special events include the first presentation of  certificates to the 100 most influential people in the Russian  computer market -- whom we have now followed the developed  countries in identifying. The "top 10" were also picked out.  These included IZVESTIYA's hero -- Yevgeniy Veselov of  "Mikroinform." Stepan Pachikov ("Paragraf") was named most  influential person in the software sector, with Anatoliy  Karachinskiy ("Ay-Bi-Es") getting the hardware award. The "top  10" includes seven Russians and three foreigners.</p>

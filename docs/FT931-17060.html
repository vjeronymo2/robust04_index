			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Resignation boosts shares - At a glance Brazilian shares moved up in the week that beleaguered president Fernando Collor de Mello resigned. Politics has bedevilled the stock market which began its slide in May when Collor's brother accused him of corruption. The political crisis continued with a parliamentary inquiry and an impeachment debate. The market has lost nearly half its dollar value since its peak in April, according to emerging markets data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank. The political crisis brought to an end a bullish run which saw the market more than quadruple between January 1991 and April 1992. Share prices had been pushed higher as foreign institutions were allowed to operate directly in the market and other positive steps, such as tax reform and privatisation, occurred.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLD DEALS GROWERS HEAVY BLOW;  </P> <P> WEATHER: OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULD BE HIGHER BEGINNING TONIGHT, FORECASTERS SAY,  BUT THE BITTER COLD COULD RETURN BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.  </P> <P> A winter frost described as one of the worst in recent years destroyed a  significant portion of the county's strawberry crop Thursday, and area growers  were scrambling to protect their remaining plants from a second night of  freezing temperatures.  </P> <P> Most spots in the county reported lows in the 30s Thursday morning, but  temperatures in some places fell into the 20s. The county's coldest spot was  southeast Irvine, where the temperature dipped to a record-breaking 22 degrees.  The previous record was 23, recorded in Orange on Feb. 15, 1942, county  historian Jim Sleeper said.  </P> <P> The cold snap is the aftermath of an Alaskan cold front that was blasting  through Southern California this week, said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with  WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. The front has settled  in the Rocky Mountains, Dittmann said. Temperatures were expected to fall below  freezing in much of the county Thursday night and early this morning, Dittmann  said. Although higher temperatures are predicted beginning tonight, freezing  conditions could return by the middle of next week, he said.  </P> <P> For today, forecasts called for increasing afternoon clouds with high  temperatures in the 50s and 60s and lows in the 30s and 40s. Weekend weather  could include showers beginning late Saturday and continuing through Monday;  highs ranging from the 40s to the 60s are expected.  </P> <P> The chill has also affected the county's homeless population, which is  estimated at about 10,000. Scott Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless  Task Force, said that already overtaxed private shelters were strained beyond  capacity Wednesday night and early Thursday. In addition, about 250 people went  to the two National Guard armories that were opened because of the cold.  </P> <P> "Most of the shelters are full every night, no matter how cold it is," Mather  said. The armories have been opened about 10 times so this year, he said, when  nighttime temperatures have dipped below 40 degrees.  </P> <P> At dawn Thursday, icicles were hanging off fences around farm fields, and  Laguna Canyon Road was covered with a hazardous coat of ice. Laguna Beach  police said the road was treated with a combination of sand and cat-box litter  to keep drivers from skidding around the dangerous curve known as Big Bend.  </P> <P> "Ice formed about a quarter-inch thick on our fields, and there were icicles  around the strawberry leaves and the sprinklers," said Paul Murai of Murai  Farms on Laguna Canyon Road in Irvine. Murai shook his head in dismay Thursday  as he was surveying the damage to 150 acres of strawberry fields.  </P> <P> Murai estimated that he lost 25% of ripe strawberries and blossoms that would  have produced fruit in another month. He added that about 120 workers were  expected to arrive at the farm this  </P> <P> morning to pick the damaged berries, which will be used for juice.  </P> <P> "This is probably the worst frost we've had in three years," Murai said. "And  when it comes this late in the year, we have the potential of losing a lot more  money because the crops are all ready" to pick.  </P> <P> Similarly, farm owner John Magarro estimated that he sustained a 25% loss to  the more than 4,000 tons of berries produced on his 150 acres.  </P> <P> Growers protected their fruits, vegetables, trees and nursery plants with  techniques that included wind machines, sprinklers, smudge pots, thermal  coverings called "hot caps" and special frost-resistant chemical coatings.  </P> <P> "Most of us have been up since 10 p.m." Wednesday, Magarro said Thursday  morning of the efforts to protect his fields. "We'll be out again" Thursday  night, he said.  </P> <P> Alice Volkert at SeaTree Nurseries in Irvine said Thursday that workers there  were preparing for the cold by refueling smudge pots, readying wind machines  and sprinklers. They also were trying to get some sleep during the day so that  they could make it through another all-night vigil, Volkert said. The nursery  has managed to save most of its trees so far, she said.  </P> <P> At the 400-acre Magarro Farms in east Irvine, employee Dominic Etcheberria said  the strawberry harvest season, which normally reaches its peak in April and  May, would be delayed four to six weeks this year because of the cold.  Strawberries are typically planted in October, and the first berries harvested  in January, he said.  </P> <P> Citrus crops, avocado groves, vegetables and nursery plants appeared to have  suffered the least frost damage, according to early estimates by John Ellis,  the county's deputy agricultural commissioner. Some winter tomato crops may  have been destroyed by the frost, however, Ellis said.  </P> <P> "Citrus trees are better able to hold their own against the cold," Ellis said.  Because the sugar content of the fruit is higher at this time of year, he said,  the citrus trees probably suffered less damage than they would have a month  ago.  </P> <P> Valencia oranges are the county's biggest citrus crop, he said, and these are  harvested in late March and in April.  </P> <P> El Modeno Gardens, a wholesale nursery in Irvine, had covered its plants with  heavy plastic but still lost some less hardy ones, said JoAnne Groot Beall,  vice president of operations for the firm. Those lost included flowering  specimens such as marguerites, hibiscus and bougainvillea, Beall said.  </P></p>

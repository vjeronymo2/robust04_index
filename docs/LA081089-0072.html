			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR NAVY FAMILIES, IT'S A HARDSHIP POST  </P> <P> Thomas R. McClelland has a wife and three children, but he cannot afford to  live with them.  </P> <P> McClelland, a Navy lithographer stationed at the Pacific Missile Test Center at  Point Mugu, visits them in San Diego on weekends.  </P> <P> "I've been living in the barracks here since I was transferred from San Diego  in November," McClelland said. "I travel back to San Diego on Friday night and  get up Monday at 3 a.m. so I can be back here.  </P> <P> "It's rough on me, no doubt about it," McClelland said. "It's rough on my car  too."  </P> <P> Seaman Apprentice Joy Anita Reid, 21, joined the Navy a year ago and lives with  her 3-month-old baby in a one-bedroom apartment in Port Hueneme. Reid's sister,  who takes care of the baby during the day, shares the apartment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uses Welfare Program  </P> <P> Reid's take-home pay is about $960 a month. Her rent is $585 monthly. She has  applied to a state welfare program for free cheese and milk and is thinking  about signing up for food stamps.  </P> <P> "The cost of living is so high here," she sighed. "But it's easier for me than  some other people because I'm a Christian. God takes care of me."  </P> <P> McClelland and Reid are two of thousands of military personnel at Point Mugu  and the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme trying to adjust to  the harsh realities of the Ventura County housing market.  </P> <P> While Navy officials at the two installations are concerned about the recent  loss of top civilian scientists and engineers who quit to buy houses elsewhere,  the Navy also faces increasing problems in finding decent rental housing for  enlisted personnel.  </P> <P> Of the 8,000 military personnel at the two Navy installations, about 5,500 live  off-base. The Navy warns personnel that it may be best to leave their families  behind when moving to Ventura County until housing can be secured, but most  bring their wives and children and hope for the best.  </P> <P> The typical tour of duty at both Point Mugu and Port Hueneme is three years,  and it can take up to two years for a family to get the limited military  housing available.  </P> <P> For the most part, they are on their own when it comes to finding an apartment  in the surrounding communities of Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Camarillo.  </P> <P> Like many Navy personnel, Colleen Griffith, an aviation maintenance  administrator, had to get financial help from her parents to cover the rent and  security deposit on her apartment when she was transferred to Point Mugu 18  months ago from San Diego.  </P> <P> Griffith, 32, a single parent with a 4 1/2-year-old son, had been paying $525  for a two-bedroom apartment in San Diego. After her transfer she moved first  into a one-bedroom apartment in Oxnard for $600 a month and now pays $650  monthly toward the rent of a Port Hueneme townhouse that she shares with one of  Point Mugu's civilian employees.  </P> <P> "I was on a waiting list for base housing for 14 months and then decided to  forget it," said Griffith, who has been in the Navy nine years. "The rents are  higher here than almost any place in the country, but the toughest part is  getting the money together to move in. Landlords want about $2,000 for most  places.  </P> <P> "I know people who commute very long distances because of the housing here,"  Griffith added. "My hope is that I'll be going back to San Diego after my tour  here. Housing is one of the reasons."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Borrowed Money  </P> <P> Many turn to Navy Relief for help in raising the money necessary to move into  off-base housing, among them John Sawyers, 26, a photographer's mate who  borrowed $550 to move into a two-bedroom Port Hueneme apartment with his wife  and two children when he arrived at Point Mugu two years ago.  </P> <P> "That was a lot of money for me," Sawyers said. "But we were lucky. We found an  ex-Navy guy who gave us a break on the rent. Two-bedrooms usually go for a lot  more."  </P> <P> Sawyers waited almost two years before his name came up on a list for a  three-bedroom house at the missile center itself, and he considers himself  fortunate to have a back yard and adequate space for his family.  </P> <P> "It's helped out a lot," he said. "But most of the people here never make it  into the base housing."  </P> <P> In addition to high rents, Navy families often wind up in substandard housing  because of the general shortage of apartments in towns surrounding the bases.  </P> <P> Patricia Mathews, another Navy photographer, was living with her two sons in a  two-bedroom south Oxnard apartment before recently getting for one of the 315  Navy-owned townhouses in Camarillo.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a real good area at all," she said. "The apartment wasn't very plush  either. There were no drawers for silverware in the kitchen."  </P> <P> According to Navy officials, the housing situation has dramatically worsened in  the last few years. Senior Navy personnel at Point Mugu recall when there was  relatively little difficulty finding good housing in the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Condo  </P> <P> "I was actually able to buy a condo in north Oxnard when I moved here five  years ago," said Aviation Machinist Mate John Wallis, 42. "I paid $89,400. The  only reason I did it was I was able to go VA, with no down payment."  </P> <P> Wallis, who will retire from the Navy next year, recently moved into the  bachelor's quarters at Point Mugu, sending his wife and two children to  Waynesville, Mo., to wait for him.  </P> <P> "I was able to sell the condo here for $190,000 and I found a place back there  on 10 acres that was going for $95,000," he explained. "I could have never  found something like that here, and it was too good a deal to pass up."  </P> <P> With the separation from his family, the next year will be a long one, Wallis  said. But he added that he considers himself lucky in comparison to younger  enlisted personnel entering the local housing market too late to qualify as a  home buyer.  </P> <P> "I feel sorry for them," Wallis said. "I couldn't afford to have bought my  condo if I'd been transferred here today. It's hard to find anything  affordable. These young kids put half their pay and more into an apartment, and  they don't have much left to live on.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make for an easy life," he said.  </P></p>

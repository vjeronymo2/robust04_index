			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Government has decided to impose a  27.19 percent "antidumping" surcharge on Brazilian imports of  low-carbon ferrochromium alloy from Russia, Kazakhstan, and  Ukraine, in accordance with Decree No. 233 dated 27 April and  published in the DIARIO OFICIAL DA UNIAO on 28 April. The  decision came in response to a complaint lodged by the  Ferro-Ligas da Bahia Company (Ferbasa) with the Foreign Trade  Secretariat in November 1992, on the grounds that these imports  were hurting Brazilian production.    Ferbasa is the only Brazilian manufacturer of low-carbon  ferrochromium alloy, and its factory in Pojuca, Bahia State, can  produce 11,000 metric tons annually. Rising imports have since  1990 been causing Ferbasa to sharply reduce its production, to  the point of shutting down one of its furnaces.    Based on a preliminary investigation into "dumping," the  Brazilian Government decided to impose in September 1993 a  provisional surcharge of 18.97 percent. In accordance with the  Finance Ministry decree, the prices of imported alloy from the  above coutries are now 27.19 percent lower than prevailing  market prices. The surcharge will be in force for five years.</p>

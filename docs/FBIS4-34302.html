			<p>BFN     [Text] For years the Investigative Police intelligence  brigade has been dogging the steps of the Lautaro Group leaders.  Investigative Police detectives arrested Pablo David Contreras  Olivos, aka Jose Luis or Joam, yesterday in the vicinity of the  Plaza Italia. Contreras Olivos, who has been identified as the  current number two Lautaro Group leader, was in charge of the  group's military structure. He was arrested along with Maria  Angelica Medina Soto, aka La Cuca. She led the MAPU-Lautaro  [United Popular Action Movement, Lautaro Group].    Through these arrests the police were able to establish that  Guillermo Ossandon was in Cartagena, where he had been residing  for some time. The police arrested Ossandon in a telephone  booth in Cartagena. He did not offer any resistance. Along  with Ossandon, the police also arrested his companions Sandra  del Carmen Ramirez Barahona, and Flor Ines Alcallaga Cepeda.    [Begin Investigative Police Public Relations Chief Luis  Cariz  recording] All the investigations leading to the arrest of these  people were conducted on the basis of a decree issued by Judge  Dreiser, who has already been duly informed. We also asked  Judge Dreiser to authorize an extension of the detention period  in Investigative Police barracks for up to 10 days.    We are now proceeding to compare the existing evidence with  their testimony, so as to establish their involvement in the  numerous crimes with which they have been charged. [end  recording]    The government praised the Investigative Police for their  work, and commended the successful investigation that led to  breaking up the guerrilla group.    [Begin Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco  recording] During the operations officials seized the following  guns: one pistol, four revolvers, nine sawed-off Tamara  shotguns, and two double barrel shotguns.    We must also praise the Investigative Police intelligence  brigade's professionalism in planning and conducting this  operation. We must also praise them for the fact that no one was  injured.    As is well known, in the last couple of years the police  force has been increasingly coordinating its actions to  effectively comply with their role as established in the  Constitution. [end recording]    Guillermo Enrique Ossandon Canas, alias Diego Carvajal,  established the Lautaro Youth Movement in 1983. With a  dissident MAPU group Ossandon was able to establish an  organization that later developed into the Lautaro Rebel and  Popular Front [FRPL] Forces. Since then homicides, bomb attacks,  bank holdups, and armed propaganda actions increased  considerably in Chile.    FRPL forces first centered their actions in the southern  region of Santiago. Later they expanded their operations to  other regions. A few years ago the police arrested some FRPL  leaders. On one occasion the police almost arrested Ossandon,  but he was able to escape. In view of this the Investigative  Police special corps took action only after the entire operation  had been secured. They decided nevertheless to delay the  operation so as not to allow Ossandon to escape in the dark.    The Lautaro Movement leaders were brought in from the coast  aboard an airplane. They are currently under arrest at a  Santiago Investigative Police barracks.    Fearing extremist reprisals, the Investigative Police have  reinforced the guards throughout its units. Moreover, personnel  from several police precincts will take turns watching the  Lautaro Movement leaders.    The Interior Ministry will submit an injunction against the  five arrested Lautaro Movement members, who have been charged  with terrorist actions. In the next few days they will be  placed at the disposal of Judge Arnoldo Dreiser, who is in  charge of investigating the crimes perpetrated by the Lautaro  Group crimes.</p>

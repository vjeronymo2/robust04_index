			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Observer: Ex-adviser One company that's glad it doesn't have to listen to any more financial advice from the Duchess of York's adviser John Bryan, is Oceonics. In 1988 Bryan and his dad bought 20 per cent of Oceonics' equity, got a couple of seats on the board, and took the North Sea firm into the German property market. It could hardly have picked a worse time to diversify. The Bryans quit 18 months ago and a new management team is nursing the company back to health. Oceonics (Deutschland), whose involvement in Frankfurt's Messeturm tower nearly busted the parent, was sold to young Bryan for Pounds 1 and the group reckons that the ill-fated venture probably cost it Pounds 3m. Hardly the most reassuring record for a financial adviser.</p>

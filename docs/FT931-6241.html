			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: New closing peak for the Footsie THE UK stock market moved comfortably to a new peak yesterday, encouraged by favourable comments on the outlook for German interest rates by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, but it left share traders unsure whether the new ground had been securely captured. The driving force came from stock index futures, and genuine investment interest in equities was undramatic. After opening lower on ex-dividend adjustments in nine stocks in the Footsie list, the market turned sharply higher at 8.35am when the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index started trading with a burst of strength. The previous closing high of 2,873.8 on the Footsie was quickly left behind and a gain of more than 16 points raised hopes that the existing intra-day peak of 2,900.1 might be challenged. It was soon clear, however, that there was insufficient institutional demand to push the market above the mid-morning level of 2,884.9. Ex-dividend changes held the Footsie back by about 7 points and, although the March future contract maintained a good premium, the stock market settled down for a closing reading on the FT-SE 100 of 2,882.6 to leave an advance on the day of 14.6. At least one basket trade - a series of deals between the futures sector and the underlying blue chip stocks - was identified, but traders described the session as 'essentially boring'. With Wall Street a mere 5.68 Dow points ahead in UK hours, the London market was lethargic in the final hour of business. Seaq volume of 535.1m shares fell short of Friday's total of 671.3m, which was worth Pounds 1.41bn in retail terms. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 67 per cent of yesterday's Seaq volume, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 13.6 to end at 3,049.7, just short of its all-time high. In reviving optimistic views on the interest rate outlook, the stock market chose to focus on Mr Schlesinger's forecast after last weekend's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers of a decline in German money market rates. It also elected to ignore Mr Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who said following the same meeting that he did not envisage cutting UK rates at present. Stock market traders saw the firmness of sterling as an encouraging sign that the chancellor will feel able to cut rates around Budget Day, March 16. The first day of the new equity market account was also featured by caution ahead of the continued flow this week of trading statements from blue chip British companies. Abbey National, Fisons, General Accident and BICC are reporting this week and Thursday brings the important trading and dividend statement from Barclays Bank. Several of these names are also on the market's list of possible fund-raisers by means of rights issues in the equity market. Shell, Rank Organisation and Carlton Communications all took their ex-dividend moves badly yesterday. With these technical factors now taken aboard, the focus today is likely to be on the March stock index future. Traders will be watching closely to see if the FT-SE 100 Index can break through 2,900 convincingly; the March contract remained well short of this level in late trading yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO UNIFORM RESPONSE TO SCHOOL DRESS CODES  </P> <P> Re your article "Following Suit" (Nov. 14), the idea of uniforms in public  schools is not a new idea.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles junior high school I attended in the 1930s required us to wear  navy blue pleated skirts and middy blouses. They looked great and, personally,  I loved them. Further, there was no pressure about what to wear, which was the  original purpose of the idea at Belvedere Junior High.  </P> <P> After I left that school, uniforms were no longer required, due to pressure  from parents to allow the young people more freedom.  </P> <P> Now parents across the U.S. are considering uniforms in public schools, because  of the extreme pressures by children's peers to wear costly "in" clothes. In  the '30s, all clothes were considered costly; hence the idea of uniforms.  </P> <P> What goes around comes around -- with almost any idea.  </P> <P> MARY L. JONES  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

The  meeting was attended by Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski, our  reporter Kostadin Filipov reports.    [Begin Filipov recording] In his speech Ambassador Angel  Dimitrov stressed that Bulgaria had been the first state to  recognize the Republic of Macedonia, and the first direct  neighbor of Macedonia that had established full diplomatic  relations with that state.    This is an expression of the Republic of Bulgaria's  prudence,  farsightedness, and determination to develop relations with the  Republic of Macedonia on the basis of mutual respect and sincere  friendship -- the only possibility of asserting peace and  stability on the Balkan peninsula, Ambassador Dimitrov pointed  out.    Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov stressed the unique  personal contribution of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, with  whom he said he has relations of sincere friendship and  understanding. He also pointed out Macedonia's great interest  in maintaining stable and goodneighborly relations with  Bulgaria. Mr. Gligorov also expressed Macedonia's interest in  developing and strengthening cooperation in all areas of mutual  interest and benefit.    Now a broad field opens for cultural, economic, scientific,  and other cooperation, connecting the two countries with the  necessary railroad, modern highways, and telecommunications,  Kiro Gligorov stressed.

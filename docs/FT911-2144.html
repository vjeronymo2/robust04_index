			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lords set to be overruled - War Crimes Bill FOR THE first time under a Conservative administration, procedures allowing the House of Commons to overrule the Lords went into operation in a confrontation between peers and the government over war crimes. After a nine-hour debate yesterday, a cross-party alliance of peers defied the Commons by 131 votes to 109 to reject for a second time legislation which would enable British citizens who are alleged war criminals to be tried in UK courts for atrocities committed during the Second World War. They also condemned the use of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, which enable a bill passed by the Commons to become law even if the Lords has rejected it in two successive sessions, on an issue where MPs and peers have been allowed to vote according to their consciences. The Lords defeated the same bill last June, by 207 votes to 74, a much greater margin. MPs have twice approved it by substantial majorities. The defeat for the bill came despite a last-minute concession by Lord Waddington, the leader of the Lords. He said that the government would look sympathetically at amendments suggested by Lord Bridge of Harwich, supported by other law lords, to increase the prospects of a fair trial. He also reminded peers that the bill followed an inquiry by two distinguished prosecutors who had concluded that there were a handful of cases where there was enough evidence to support a criminal prosecution. Senior peers from all parties, including former Tory and Labour cabinet ministers, argued, however, in a series of powerful speeches that the bill was so fundamentally flawed that even if it were changed, a fair trial would be impossible and any defendant would face insuperable difficulties in preparing his case. Lord Shawcross, a former attorney-general and prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, said: 'It is our clear duty and constitutional right to express our independent views and vote according to conscience.' Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, said that the use of the Parliament Acts procedures would be a 'constitutional monstrosity'. The restrictions on the powers of the Lords were used twice by the Liberal government in 1914, and once by the Labour government in 1949. In theory, the government could still prevent the bill becoming law, but it has made a clear commitment to legislate.</p>

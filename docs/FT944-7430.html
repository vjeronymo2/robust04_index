			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Astra International gains 84% Astra International, one of the largest business groups in Indonesia, surprised the market with an 84 per cent rise in net profits for the first nine months of the year, Reuter reports from Jakarta. The company reported net profits of Rp186bn (Dollars 88m) against Rp101.93bn a year ago, on sales of Rp6,282.32bn, against Rp4,110.47bn. 'The impressive result was due mainly to higher automotive sales, which accounted for about 75 per cent of total sales,' Mr Jos Parengkuan, an analyst with Lippo Securities said. 'But gross profit rose only 41 per cent due to a lower gross margin, which resulted from the strong Japanese yen.' He said average gross margins edged up to 18 per cent in the third quarter from 17.4 per cent in the first half. Meanwhile, the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper reported yesterday that Astra would secure a Dollars 200m loan from a syndicate of several Singapore-based Japanese banks. It said the loans would be used to finance Astra's expansion programme in agriculture and financial services. Mr Rini S. Soewandi, the company's finance director, was quoted as saying that agriculture currently contributes about 4 per cent of the company's total revenue. Mr Rini said that Astra had planned to raise Dollars 200m through bonds to be issued in the US with interest rates of between 9.5 per cent and 10 per cent. That plan was postponed as several Indonesian companies were reported to have issued Yankee bonds with higher interest rates. According to the company, the syndicated loan agreement is expected to be signed in Singapore on December 16. Semen Gresik, Indonesia's state-owned cement company, is to acquire Semen Padang and Semen Tonasa, the other two state-owned cement companies, early next year prior to listing its shares offshore, Antara, the official news agency, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Jakarta. No details were revealed.</p>

Father Yvon  Massac opposes the arrival of this tanker in Haiti, as it is  tangible proof of the hypocrisy of the international community  in the Haitian crisis. Father Massac deems the mobilization  "iron cuts iron" launched by President Aristide necessary in  order to prevent the deterioration of the country's situation.    [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The hypocritical moral  standards of the international community want to paralyze  Aristide by advocating the ideal of nonviolence, an ideal which  is making him shirk his responsibilities as head of state. The  country's constitution gives the president the duty of ensuring  the good functioning of the state, of having all citizens enjoy  justice, safety, and the rights conferred on them by the  country's fundamental law. The president must create the  necessary conditions so the institutions can function. The  international community is making hypocritical statements. They  are setting traps under the cover of humanitarian aid while  people are dying. Can the president continue to stand aside  while his people are being pulled down in Haiti? No!  Self-defense must be organized. The president and the Haitians  in the 10th department [abroad] must set up a force in the field  so as to prevent the criminals from doing what they want with  people. [end recording]    This was Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest.</p>

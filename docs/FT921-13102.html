			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: IBJ plans to merge unit with broker INDUSTRIAL Bank of Japan (IBJ), a leading Japanese bank, and Wako Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, agreed yesterday to merge their asset management affiliates by the end of March this year. The move comes at a time when Japanese investment management companies are faced with declining profits due to the sluggish stock market and faltering investor confidence. Additionally, the announcement comes ahead of the deregulation of the Japanese financial industry, where barriers between banks and securities houses are expected to be abolished next year. IBJ Capital Management and Wako International Capital Management will merge to form IBJW Asset Management. The IBJ group will own a 67 per cent stake, while Wako Securities will hold 33 per cent. The Tokyo-based company will be capitalised at Y300m. IBJ specialises in fund management for institutional investors, while Wako depends largely on funds from individuals. As of September last year, IBJ had Y823.1bn in customer assets under management, placing it sixth in the industry, while Wako, ranking 55th, had Y128.5bn in managed assets. The IBJ group also manages clients' assets through its overseas operations at IBJ International based in London and IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust in New York. Further rationalisation in the asset management industry is expected ahead of financial liberalisation, as most leading financial institutions in the life assurance, banking and securities industries own asset management affiliates.</p>

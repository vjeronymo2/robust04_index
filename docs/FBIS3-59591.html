			<p>Language: <F P=105>German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Manfred Schmitt: "All Ways Open"] </F>   [Text] Due to the growing demands for accessibility and the  ability to communicate and the traffic and environmental  problems resulting from the mobility, there will be a continuing  trend toward mobile communication and toward transportation of  the information instead of the person. These developments apply  to all areas of life. At the behest of the European Commission,  the DECT standard was developed for the wide application field  of cordless telecommunication of voice and data in order to  access local mobile networks.    The DECT standard (Digital European Cordless  Telecommunication) represents an evolution based on the previous  industrial (CT0) and public standards (CT1/CT1+, CT2 as interim  ETSI standard). With its special targeting of mobility at the  office and at home, it is increasingly used as a method of  network access for private branch exchanges and the analog  telephone system, as well as for wide-ranging mobile  communication of voice and data. European manufacturers of  telecommunications facilities such as Siemens, Alcatel,  Ericsson, Philips and Nokia have committed themselves to use the  DECT standard and corresponding products are being developed or  are already available.    The DECT standard was defined and developed by ETSI  (European  Telecommunications Standardisation Institute) beginning in 1989  and was adopted in July 1992. The EC signature nations have  obligated themselves within the scope of an EC guideline to  introduce DECT by 1995 and to provide the required frequencies,  as well as to make the necessary permit regulations available on  a voluntary basis within the framework of an EC recommendation.  The DECT standard defines a transparent, digital aerial  interface between a mobile unit and a base station for cordless  telecommunication of voice and data over analog telephone  networks, ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network], GSM [not  further identified], package and wire-transmitted data networks  as well as local area networks.    Because of the Europe-wide application area, large markets  with enormous quantities are open to DECT, which makes rapid and  major reduction in technological and production costs possible  through scaling effects. Market demands, rapidly dropping  prices, versatile application, combined with diverse advantages  from the user's aspect, form the initial basis for successful  opening up broad mass markets for DECT in Europe and beyond. In  November 1992 the Federal Office for Posts and Telecommunication  issued the German licensing regulations for DECT systems and end  equipment and thus made the market introduction of DECT products  possible on a broad basis.  <H5>  Advantages for the User </H5>   The advantages of DECT for the user derive, on the one hand,  in general from the use of powerful mobile communication at  home, at the office and in the future from public access as  well, such as high accessibility/availability/communications  ability, mobile internal communication free of charge, increased  action/reaction speed, accelerated decision-making, faster  transaction processing, liberal waiting times for important  calls, higher measure of service, lower number of unsuccessful  calls, cost/time advantage because fewer return calls are  required, freedom of mobility during the connection and cost  savings when moving.    On the other hand, many user advantages are the result of  the  technical concept of DECT, such as high communications quality  through 32 kbit/s speech coding and continuous channel  optimization, high security against wiretapping including  through optional speech coding, high radio-technical area  coverage and space illumination, mastery of large subscriber  numbers or traffic density, roaming (localizing the subscriber  through all radio cells), simple installation and expansion  without frequency planning, the ability to integrate voice and  data as well as investment security because of a promising  standard and simple expansion possibility of the system.  <H5>  Technical Features </H5>   DECT is a cordless access method to target networks such as  the public analog telephone net, the ISDN net and in the future  also the GSM net. DECT offers the technical basis for  application-specific system solutions or special DECT profiles  in the form of a transparent aerial interface (Layer OSI 1  through 3). DECT's protocol supply includes all procedures for  realizing cordless end equipment and systems (authentication,  speech encoding, mobility management) as well as all important  standards and protocols of telecommunication (ISDN, LAN, X.25,  X.400...) for cordless telephones and branch facilities for the  home, office and in the future also for public networks (public  access).  <H5>  DECT Profiles and System Solutions </H5>   DECT's extensively defined protocol supply enables  definition  and specification of application-specific system solutions for  voice and data as well as access through the DECT aerial  interface to various target networks such as GSM, ISDN with  upstream DECT systems or base stations. According to an EC  recommendation, these kinds of DECT mobile units should be able  to work with various DECT profiles or system solutions (common  interface).    The voice-oriented DECT standard ETS 300175 (Common  Interface) and ETS 300176 (Approval Test Specification) were  adopted in July 1992 by ETSI and made available to the public.  At present a series of additional DECT profiles are operating at  ETSI, for which stabile drafts will largely be available in  1993/94, which can then already be used for development  activities. DECT-GSM Interworking enables the cooperation of  DECT mobile units with DECT systems which are connected to GSM  systems; DECT-ISDN Interworking permits the cooperation of DECT  mobile units with DECT systems connected to ISDN systems; DECT  Data Profiles enables data transmission between DECT mobile  units and DECT systems; DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP), based  on PAP (Public Access Profile, ETSI Draft TBR 11), defines a  public standard interface for access from DECT mobile units to  various fixed networks which take the mobility requirements into  consideration (probably available after 1995).  <H5>  Application Areas </H5>   At home, in small businesses and for the self-employed,  monocellular cordless telephones and cordless small branch  exchange facilities based on the DECT standard offer convenience  and flexibility in the house and garden, in the home office and  small business, with all the described advantages of mobility  with excellent communications quality and wiretapping security.  And this at a price level comparable to significantly simpler  analog products. Here it is primarily accessibility at all times  as well as the ability to be able to call at any time and  everywhere in the house, garden and business sector, without  charge between persons using internal communication or  externally via the exchange at normal charges. With the  available data capability of up to 19.2 kbit/s and with small  systems as well, interesting solutions are available  particularly for the home, because it is possible to be in  contact by computer with voice and data networks from any  arbitrary place within the range of the system without  installation of cables and telephone extension units, in  parallel with other internal and external conversations.    In larger organizations which cover a correspondingly larger  area or space and have their own PBX facility, powerful  multicellular systems are offered. By means of overlapping radio  coverage of surface and spatial building structures it is  possible to assure mobile communications ability, receiving and  transmitting, fixed and mobile, through continuous localizing of  the mobile units in the system range (roaming) and automatic,  interruption-free connection of conversations when changing from  one cell to another, all the while with a high quality of  communication. Because of the mobile subscriber's capability for  active and passive communication, he obtains the advantages  already mentioned such as rapid reaction capability, faster  decision-making and increased productivity. In connection with a  private branch exchange the mobile subscriber gets the  performance features of the PBS, with the free internal  communication which is so important particularly for business  applications and which is also available in mobile form, and the  external communication at normal charges.    In the office sector, data applications are also gaining in  importance. Here the data capability of DECT by no means  replaces the high-performance Local Area Networks. DECT's data  capability of up to 30 kbit/s, initially in the lower speed  range, covers the important portion, estimated at 80 to 90  percent, of internal and external data communication at the  office with a volume of up to 10 kbytes per operation. This  fully maintains the advantage of being able to transmit speech  and data at the same time over the same base station. By  establishing a special data profile (DECT-DATA profile) through  ETSI, pure data transmission speeds of 1 Mbit/s, in some cases  also significantly higher combination values, can be achieved.    In the public area, above all at special social focal points  such as pedestrian zones, shopping centers, athletic stadiums,  airports, railway stations, etc. with a defined area and a high  traffic density, the DECT is the more suitable solution compared  to GSM, since with 10,000 Erlang units per square kilometer  significantly more subscribers can be served (GSM: about 200  Erlang units per square kilometer). This requires the  establishment of a minimal common interface for DECT, however,  which at present is being used under the working name of Generic  Access Profile/Public Access Profile at ETSI.    In the areas covered by the radio technology the DECT  profile  GAP/PAP then enables access to PBS systems (and the use of the  entire range of functions thus provided) as well as public  analog networks, ISDN and GSM networks through integrated DECT  subsystems. Since GAP/PAP will become an integral component of  the DECT standard, it will then be possible, with one and the  same mobile unit, to communicate via the house base station of  the cordless DECT telephone or small system or through the  multicellular DECT office system or via a public base station.  In connection with the compactness and ease of the DECT mobile  unit, this sum of possibilities comes very close to the ideal  picture of a "personal communicator" which everyone can afford,  which can be carried everywhere and enables you to communicate  everywhere, at any time and with everyone.</p>

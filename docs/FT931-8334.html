			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: TransAmerica pushed to record TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based financial services group, yesterday reported record fourth-quarter profits from continuing operations of Dollars 86.5m, thanks to strong performances from its consumer lending, leasing, property services and life insurance operations. The group's net income for the quarter, however, was only Dollars 11.9m, after a Dollars 75m provision for estimated losses from the disposal of a majority interest in its property casualty insurance operations, which will be sold in the second quarter through an initial public offering of stock. In the fourth quarter last year, TransAmerica incurred a loss of Dollars 94.5m in the wake of a Dollars 130m after-tax charge at its commercial lending unit. For the full year 1992, TransAmerica reported net income of Dollars 243m, up from Dollars 50.1m in 1991. Excluding the provision for discontinued operations and investment gains, the group's earnings last year totalled a record Dollars 337.8m. Among TransAmerica's various businesses, earnings from the consumer lending operations set records for both the final quarter and year, while the commercial finance operation bounced back into profit after four quarters of losses in 1991. The group's leasing operation reported a small increase in quarterly earnings, and profits at its property tax services business were at record levels. On the insurance side, operating income from life insurance rose 25 per cent in the final quarter.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Afghan President Najibullah asserted that U.S. officials are trying to bolster  their aid to anti-Communist rebels by meeting with deposed Afghan King Mohammed  Zahir Shah in Italy. However, radical Afghan guerrillas with bases in Pakistan  threatened to assassinate the former monarch if he tries to return and head a  postwar government in Kabul. The warring sides in Afghan's civil war commented  after reports that a U.S. envoy met with the exiled king in Rome. After months  of trying to forge unity within the guerrilla coalition, Washington reportedly  is considering alternatives. But the rebels are split over a possible role for  the 74-year-old king.  </P></p>

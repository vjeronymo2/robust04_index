			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Schlossed in Erbach Autumn and winter are the best times to appreciate German food. Germans are partial to game and wild mushrooms, and they enjoy the pretext afforded by a religious feast day to gorge themselves. As often as not these festivals take the form of week-long blow-outs around a particular theme: strawberries, asparagus and chanterelles in the spring and summer; ceps, game and geese in the autumn. After two days of hectic shuttling up and down the Lower Rhine I felt in need of a little German Gemutlichkeit. My thoughts turned to the Rheingau, home to the vines which make Germany's noblest wines. I took the train to Eltville at the area's eastern end, a small town filled with a jumble of half-timbered houses and an old fortress overlooking a wide stretch of the great river. A refreshing provincialism was apparent from the first. In the local Konditorei a middle-aged German noblewoman was showing the staff the fruits of a shopping expedition to Wiesbaden. With each new revelation the old women clapped their hands with joy. Posters informed me that I had arrived in time for the Schlachtfest: the most dangerous moment in the life of a German pig. Not that the swine looked unhappy in the drawings: they were depicted running gamely off to the slaughter; altruistically disposed to yield up their all in the form of sausages, bacon, ham and roasting meat for the cold months ahead. But I did not go to the Schlachtfest. I went to Schloss Reinhartshausen instead. Schloss Reinhartshausen was once a royal residence. It was purchased by Princess Marianne of Holland in 1850 after her divorce from Prince Albrecht of Prussia, brother of the first German Kaiser. Albrecht's sexual misdemeanours forced him to quit his native land and live in Saxony where he built the ravishing Schloss Albrechtsberg on the Elbe near Dresden. The Schloss remained in Hohenzollern hands until a few years ago when Albrecht and Marianne's descendants sold it to a property company. The Hohenzollerns retained only a third part of the prestigious vineyards around the Schloss in Erbach. The new owners turned Schloss Reinhartshausen into a luxury hotel. The changes were not always for the best. In spite of the loan of Hohenzollern pictures and the profusion of Biedermeyer furniture, the mixture of old and new is uncomfortable in most of the main rooms. A clumsy verandah has been built on to the side of the building looking out over the Rhine. Everywhere there appears a lack of love and sympathy for the spirit of the house. Schloss Reinhartshausen has two restaurants: the informal Schloss-keller and the rather grand Marcobrunn. I ate in the Marcobrunn; one of the few rooms to emerge unscathed from the conversion. The wine list was a hefty volume containing the names of the world's best wines as well as those from the Rheingau and the Schloss itself. Drinking Schloss Reinhartshausen had its advantages: a lot of wines could be ordered by the glass. This was particularly useful when it came to ordering a sweet Auslese with dessert. The Marcobrunn's French chef was clearly tilting at his first star in the Michelin Guide: it was an ambitious menu. An amuse gueule of some sweetbreads, a little avocado mousse, some quail mousse and some sliced, waxy potatoes was followed by equally elaborate first courses: quail breasts with foie gras on a bed of green beans and mushrooms; zander and crayfish in rice pastry on a bed of chanterelles. Another ambitious dish was a partridge in three services. First came the breasts on a stock reduction with salsify; then liver in a game consomme; finally the legs were dished up with red cabbage and Schnupfnudeln (long, thin dumplings). It was an exciting concept, but it would have been a good deal more exciting if the bird had been hung for a day or three. The puddings were good: a fig strudel with coriander; an apple terrine wrapped in Baumkuchen, that legendary German dessert which is so complicated to make that it is rarely encountered these days - so much so that the only time I have eaten authentic Baumkuchen was in a German restaurant in Madrid. The Marcobrunn restaurant is good, but it needs to do something about the occasional moments of blandness. It was certainly new wave cooking of the sort now available all over the better-heeled parts of west Germany. The next day, however, was St Martin's, and the moment for proper Gemutlichkeit had come. I went into an unpretentious restaurant in Eltville and ordered cep soup and a goose leg; the largest goose leg I have ever seen, sitting on a huge pile of red cabbage. This was a homely sort of dish: the sort of thing the Germans do best. Marcobrunn restaurant in Schloss Reinhartshausen, Erbach im Rheingau, 65346 Eltville, Germany. Tel: 061-23 6760.

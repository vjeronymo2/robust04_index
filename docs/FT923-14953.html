			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fancy a lodger? HOMEOWNERS who are finding it difficult to meet their mortgage repayments may be considering letting out a room in their house. But they should be aware that this will have an effect on their house contents insurance cover. 'Most insurance companies will restrict theft cover and delete accidental damage cover when paying guests are living on the premises,' said Clive Longhurst, of the Association of British Insurers. The government has given a tax incentive to those considering renting out a room by adding a new clause to the Finance Bill which is expected to pass through parliament later this month. The rent-a-room scheme would allow people to let out a furnished room for Pounds 62.50 a week before becoming eligible for tax. The relief is available to individuals for their only or main home and will apply to gross rents, up to a limit of Pounds 3,250 for any tax year. It will take effect from the current tax year. If the rental income is more than this amount, homeowners face two choices: they can either pay tax on the excess, without any separate tax relief for allowable expenses, or they can calculate profit from letting a room and pay tax on the profit. Legal &amp; General is warning those who want to take in lodgers that house contents insurance cover will be restricted because 'people staying in short-term rented accomodation do not have the same incentive to take care of the property as the owner does,', according to the company's Rod Young. Like most insurers, it will withdraw cover for theft unless clear evidence can be given of a break-in. You would not be covered if the lodger stole from you and cover for malicious damage by the lodger would also be removed. Similarly, if the homeowner had accidental damage cover, this would also be withdrawn, although in most cases Legal &amp; General will refund the remaining cover for the year. It says that that cover cannot be restored through payment of increased premiums because that would have the effect of endorsing the homeowner's ability to judge who would be a good lodger. If you are considering renting out a room, you must inform your insurer in order to know how your cover is affected and inform the lodger that his or her possessions are not covered by your home contents policy. Other sensible measures are to take up references from prospective lodgers and to ask for a deposit to be repayable when they leave. It is also a good idea to use a formal agreement for letting. Lloyds Bank is launching a telephone insurance service from Wednesday. Insurance Direct will provide on-the-spot quotations for buildings and contents insurance. Two policies are available: Value Cover Standard, which offers basic cover and Value Cover Plus which includes accidental damage cover. Premiums are based on postcodes and the number of bedrooms in the house, with contents covered up to a maximum of Pounds 30,000 on a replacement-as-new basis. (Freephone 0800-300820).</p>

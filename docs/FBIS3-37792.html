Directly after the withdrawal of weapons from  around Sarajevo became a fact and the threat of bloodshed  receded, a pleasant scuffle began round the victory cake in  various capitals.    The United States was still only just waking up when the  mass  media were broadcasting the news of exultation in Moscow over  the "victory of Russian diplomacy." A little later a report  arrived from Prague, where, according to agency reports, Russian  Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev said that he sees no direct link  between "our actions and the NATO ultimatum," and television  repeatedly showed special envoy V. Churkin asserting that it was  President Yeltsin's personal participation that was the key to  the fact that the withdrawal of Serbian artillery passed off  peacefully.    The United States had Monday off. It was Presidents Day,  George Washington's Birthday. In view of the national holiday  Clinton's team allowed itself a very small indulgence: to  assemble a little later than usual at the White House -- 0900  hours rather than 0730.    After the meeting with his staffers B. Clinton held a press  conference. He was far from making any hints at revenge. On  the contrary, he thanked his European allies, who, he said,  unlike the United States, have many servicemen stationed in the  combat zones of Yugoslavia, whose lives are under constant  threat.    The U.S. President confidently rejected the idea of Russia's  decisive contribution to the bloodless withdrawal of artillery  from around Sarajevo. He again stressed that the desired result  had been achieved thanks to NATO's decisiveness.    One of the most important points in the President's press  conference was that, during the tense days and hours when the  ultimatum deadline was moving closer and the threat of air  strikes becoming increasingly real, the mechanism of  consultations with Russia operated smoothly -- both at the  presidential level, and between the leading officials of either  country: foreign and defense ministers and UN representatives.    However, the victory rhetoric, fully justified as it is in  the context of the complex internal political situation in the  United States, and especially in Russia, has its own inertia.  Beyond certain limits it could grow into a danger for the still  fragile cooperation between the countries which has no deep  traditions.    Hence the United States has deemed it necessary urgently to  invite Russian Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev for consultations in  Washington. He is expected to arrive on Saturday [26 February].</p>

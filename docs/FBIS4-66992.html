			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Huu Kiem: "Drug Addiction in the </F> Northern Mountain Region: Facts and Solutions"]    [Text] The "brown fairy" [opium] has been clinging to the  lives of the six northern mountain provinces for generations.  In almost every province in the region there are areas where  poppies are being cultivated at very high yields. In Ha Tuyen  Province [name of province as published] alone poppy plants are  being grown in five districts, producing high yields at low  capital and labor costs. These are the districts of Hoang Su  Phi, Quan Ba, Yen Minh, Dong Van, and Meo Vac. This region is  also part of the Brown Triangle -- better known as the Golden  Triangle -- the well-known poppy planting region in Southeast  Asia. Lao Cai Province has poppy cultivation areas in Bac Ha,  Muong Khuong, Bat Sat, and Sa Pa. Yen Bai Province has  intensive experience in poppy cultivation, with acreage of up to  1,484 hectares in Mu Cang Chai and Tram Tau districts.    Poppy plants are usually hard to grow, but not in high  mountain regions where the climate is cool and dry. The plant  does not require much labor or care. The current price in these  planting areas is one tael of gold for 3 kg of opium. The  further the opium is transported and the more control posts it  gets through, the higher the price.    The "brown fairy" has always been with the multi-ethnic  compatriots at funerals and wedding parties, spring festivals,  harvest festivals, and parties to congratulate people on their  job promotions or new houses. In recent years opium has become  so popular that people treat each other to opium the same way  they do with cigarettes. It has become a popular habit; in all  gatherings, there is usually a pipe and opium provided by the  host. In localities where poppies are grown, among every 10  local people -- regardless of age or gender --there are three or  four opium addicts, and one of them is heavily addicted. We do  not thus far have official records on the number of families and  individuals addicted to opium in the six northern mountain  provinces. Records in the former Hoang Lien Son Province three  years ago showed there were some 70,000 addicts, including  12,000 who were seriously addicted. Yen Bai Province's records  in 1993 showed 6,000 serious cases among 32,000 addicts. These  numbers were drawn solely from voluntary statements by the  addicts. We are unsure about the number of people who did not  declare. Among the addicts, more than 35 percent were young  people. They are usually heavily addicted and are the main  concern for society.    Prior to 1975, poppy planting was virtually eliminated and  the number of addicts was negligible. During the 1980's, the  poppy plant was imported and grown as a medicinal plant. Since  then, localities that have the appropriate soil conditions have  rushed to grow poppy plants and have neglected food crops. Poppy  plants have become a garden plant, and people smoke opium openly  just like cigarettes. There were times when opium was collected  in lieu of taxes because poppy growers did not pay taxes in cash  or food grains. In some years in the past, some district  authorities had to store several hundred kg of opium and put  them up for sale. The lawful buyers of this medicinal substance  are cigarette companies and the pharmaceutical general company.  Buyers were few but sellers were many, so naturally they could  not agree on prices. This paved the way to the development of  smuggling activities.    In poppy cultivation areas, each smoker uses about 3-4 kg of  opium a year. A family would spend many millions [currency not  specified] on it; could the amount a province would offer to the  "brown fairy" be hundreds of billions? There were times when  cadres and state employees used their savings to buy and store  opium at harvest time, and then sell it when the price was high.  Mountain regions have been haunted by the poppy plant again and  again; addiction has become ever more serious, people's health  has deteriorated, and poor regions have become even poorer  because poppy cultivation has prevented the development of food  crops.    After the successful August Revolution, we carried out a  movement to substitute food crops for poppy plants in parallel  with the campaign to control addiction. We also carried out  measures to prevent opium and other drugs from being imported  into Vietnam. Thanks to the universal movement to suppress  addiction, we basically eradicated drug addiction in the  fifties, sixties, and seventies. In the eighties, with poppy  plants being grown in the mountain provinces, drug addiction has  made a comeback.    To deal with the situation, we have motivated all people to  participate in movements to control and prevent drug addiction,  substitute food crops or other medicinal plants for poppy  plants, and punish offenders through strict administrative  measures.    In addition to imposing harsh punishment on drug procurers  and rehabilitating drug addicts over the last few years, the  authorities in Yen Bai Province have arranged to collect opium  and destroy it on the spot. Mu Cang Chai District, for example,  has burned 292 kg of opium. The province provided the local  H'Mong people with 80 tonnes of rice to help them during the  planting season for food crops. The province also invested over  4.1 billion dong in capital lending to local people to help them  grow corn, fruit trees, and wheat on lands that used to grow  poppy plants. Lao Cai, Lang Son, Son La, and Lai Chau Provinces  also provided tens of billions of dong and many thousands of  tonnes of food staples to help people overcome addiction and  substitute food crops and medicinal plants for poppy plants.  The agriculture sector has carried out successful research on  new species of vegetables and medicinal plants with high  economic value to replace poppy plants effectively.    In order to eliminate drug addiction successfully, we have  to  be persistent in encouraging the replacement of poppy plants  with food crops, high-value medicinal plants, or vegetables used  for oil. We have to accelerate the campaign to denounce drug  dependence as a bad and immoral practice. The families of drug  addicts, together with society, should help rehabilitate addicts  and keep them away from drug pushers.    The vice of drug addiction is bringing disaster to many  households. Nobody should avoid participating in the movement  to suppress this dangerous vice.</p>

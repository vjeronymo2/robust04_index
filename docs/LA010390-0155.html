			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRONCOS GIVE COLORADO COUNSEL OF EXPERIENCE  </P> <P> The Broncos, who have some idea of what it feels like to lose a championship  football game, are offering some advice to the University of Colorado  Buffaloes, who Monday lost the Orange Bowl and their claim to the national  college football title.  </P> <P> "Keep your heads up," said Broncos running back Steve Sewell. And tight end  Orson Mobley said the Buffs should "keep a winning attitude. Set your goals a  little higher and try to achieve them."  </P> <P> The Buffs were ranked No. 1 in the nation before Monday night's 21-6 loss to  Notre Dame. They finished the season ranked No. 4 in the nation; Notre Dame  finished No. 2.  </P> <P> The game could have handed the Buffs, 11-0 and the only undefeated major  college team going into the game, their first-ever national championship.  </P> <P> The Broncos lost consecutive Super Bowls in 1987 and 1988, and the NFL team  players and coaches said they saw a little of themselves in the Buffs' game  Monday.  </P> <P> "It looked like a couple of games we had played," Broncos Coach Dan Reeves  said. "You have a chance to do something in the first half, then you don't take  advantage of opportunities and it comes back to hurt you."  </P> <P> Mobley recalled missing some chances and regretting it.  </P> <P> "It reminded me a little of our game against the (New York) Giants. The first  half belonged to us, but we missed some key scoring opportunities," he said.  </P> <P> Sewell said he also knows what it is like. "It's a big letdown. But the younger  guys have a chance to come back. Now they know what it's like to win, and that  should give them some incentive," he said.  </P> <P> The Broncos agreed that the Buffs easily could be in a national title game  again next year if they do not let Monday's loss affect them too much.  </P> <P> And that is not likely to happen, the Broncos agreed.  </P> <P> 'They showed a lot of heart and a lot of class. That stands tall when all is  said and done," said Broncos quarterback Gary Kubiak.  </P></p>

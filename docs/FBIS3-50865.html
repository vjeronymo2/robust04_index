			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The executive branch has ordered the creation of a  Center for Advanced National Studies [Centro de Altos Estudios  Nacionales] (Calen) with the purpose of training Armed Forces  officers and civilians from both the public and private sectors  in strategic planning and advising.    The objective of Calen is, among others, to increase  knowledge of the true national situation within a regional,  continental, and international context, through appropriate and  modern methodologies.    This center will be in charge of the National Higher Studies  Course established in 1986. The center will be headed by a  director, who will be responsible to the Defense Ministry. It  will also have an academic deputy director and a course director.    The post of director will be held by a general, and the  deputy director will be a civilian (a professional with a  university degree), or a graduate from Calen or from Esendena  [National Defense and Security School].    The executive branch will select the civilians who will  study  in Calen, who will be nominated by various organizations. The  Defense Ministry and Armed Forces commanders will nominate  officers to attend the courses.    Within the military career, the completion of these courses  will be considered credit toward attaining an assignment.    According to the Defense Ministry the creation of this  center  will not represent any expense, because all the necessary  resources are already available and need only be reallocated.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: Unit trusts, derivatives and Imro Sir, You suggest incorrectly ('Unit trusts faced with hedging restrictions', August 17) that Imro has issued guidance which permits unit trusts to be invested on derivatives only in 'rare circumstances'. Imro has issued no guidance on correlations between portfolios and indices and has not specified any percentage of congruence to be achieved by portfolio managers hedging their positions. This would be inappropriate unless the views of practitioners had been established. The statement attributed to Mr Graham Dunnachie does not reflect Imro's position. There is much debate on the subject of 'congruence'. SIB has invited industry representatives to submit views on how indices may be used for hedging unit trusts. When those views are received, they will be considered carefully by Imro and SIB. Policy will not be set before the industry has been properly consulted. J A Morgan, chief executive, Imro, 5 Appold Street, London EC2A 2LL</p>

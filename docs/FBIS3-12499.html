In press statements published today, he said what has been  published abroad about the Yemeni crisis contains a great deal  of exaggeration and overstatement.    He stressed that the Yemeni people and leadership are  committed to the implementation of the accord document, which  was signed in Amman by all Yemeni political forces under the  auspices of His Majesty King Husayn on 10 Ramadan.</p>

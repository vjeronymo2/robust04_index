			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Sentiment in most of the LME base metals remained depressed by rising inventories, slack demand, and sluggish economic growth prospects. The latter factor was underlined by US economic data - August leading indicators fell 0.2 per cent, while September consumer confidence dropped to 56.4 from 59. COPPER continued to decline, dropping to the lowest levels for three months with stocks rising again. Final business was at the low of Dollars 2,360 for three-month metal, Dollars 19 down from Monday. In contrast ZINC rallied in kerb trading on late short covering to end at the day's highs after encountering solid support at Dollars 1,280 for three-month metal. PLATINUM closed easier in London and futures prices were down at midday in New York, under pressure from the downbeat US economic data and a fall in the Nikkei stock average. Japan is the world's biggest platinum importer. New York COTTON futures were lower in all months at midday but somewhat recovered from fresh life of contract lows. Analysts said there was no fresh fundamental influence, but prices continued to be dogged by world oversupply and sluggish demand for US cotton. Compiled from Reuters</p>

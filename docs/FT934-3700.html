			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Rebels in Burma take softer line The Democratic Alliance of Burma, a hard-pressed grouping of ethnic fighters, political exiles and students which has been the focus of opposition to the Rangoon regime, is willing to enter into peace talks to end four decades of armed struggle against the military government, it said yesterday. Dr Em Marta, spokesman for the Karen insurgents and a member of the alliance, said the DAB was willing to send a delegation to Rangoon to prepare the ground for substantive talks. 'We can go to Rangoon to see what they have to offer, to test their sincerity,' he declared. The alliance has until now said it would engage only in comprehensive round-table talks, outside Burma, after the release of all political prisoners. The heroine of the democracy movement, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, is now in her fifth year of house arrest in Rangoon. The Karen rebels who dominate what is left of the alliance have found themselves isolated because of Rangoon's policy of making ceasefire deals with elements of the grouping. The 3,000 Karen soldiers and the 2,000 fighters of the Karennis and Mon ethnic insurgencies who remain are now vulnerable to the Burmese army's best troops. But Dr Marta insisted Rangoon would have to negotiate with the DAB, and not keep on trying to pick off opposition groups one by one.</p>

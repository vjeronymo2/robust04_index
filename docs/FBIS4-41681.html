			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- Assessing the prospects for the  Russian Government's proposal to hold an international  conference on security on the Korean peninsula and nuclear-free  status for it, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov  said that "if the current bilateral contacts between the United  States and North Korea fail, there will be no alternative."    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, he described the chances for  this Russian initiative as "very strong." The diplomat believes  that if the bilateral dialogue between the United States and the  DPRK fails, it will become clear that "our position is  absolutely right," since it is based on common sense.    Aleksandr Panov considers that the consultations between the  United States and the DPRK, between North and South Korea, and  between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] could be rolled into one. "Our proposed format is the  best way of going about this," he noted.    Russia, he said, now believes that the number of  participants  in the conference on Korea could be increased. He said that, in  addition to the DPRK and the Republic of Korea, it could be  attended by the United States, Japan, Russia, China, and  representatives of the United Nations and the IAEA, as well as  Britain and France. France has already expressed a wish to take  part. "We have always said that our proposal is not something  sacrosanct," the Russian diplomat said, adding that each party  is free to express its feelings and additional suggestions as  regards the conference idea.    The situation on the Korean peninsula deteriorated after the  DPRK announced it was leaving the IAEA and that it might also  withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

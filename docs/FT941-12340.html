			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / People: The unstuffy privatiser There could be few less probable champions of privatisation than Lajos Csepi. The new managing director of the Hungarian state holding company AV RT rose through the ranks of the state apparatus, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The 43-year-old's communist-era career culminated as deputy president of the national price office. The outwardly gray Mr Csepi admits, 'I am a bureaucrat.' Not, at first sight, credentials designed to inspire confidence when the AV RT controls stakes in 162 strategic companies, including utilities, pharmaceuticals producers, engineering enterprises and commercial banks. After all, the last thing Hungarian business needs after 40 years of communism is more bureaucratic management. But Mr Csepi is full of surprises. For a start, he is about as unstuffy, frank and self-deprecating as high officials get. And then there is his passionate commitment to privatisation: 'I have seen for 20-30 years that public ownership simply doesn't work.' His belief has, if anything, firmed during since 1990 when he took over as managing director of the SPA state privatisation agency. Mr Csepi says of his new charge, the AV RT: 'Privatisation has not so far been the focus of this organisation. It will be.' AV RT's original philosophy, when founded in 1992, was to restructure state companies first, improve their value and only then, perhaps, divest them. The first two, Hungarian-American, managing directors of the state holding showed a touching faith in the state's competence. The irony is that a homegrown apparatchik like Mr Csepi is far more sceptical about reorganisation and consolidation, the polite words for state bailouts. He fears companies will deceive the authorities in order to win larger debt write-offs. Mr Csepi remembers that in the old days the prices office would ask companies for data needed to set prices in their sector. 'They gave us false information. They made fools of us.' Some things bureaucrats know best.</p>

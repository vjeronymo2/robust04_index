			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / People: New partners at Goldman Sachs Michael Sherwood, 29, one of the driving forces behind Goldman Sachs' rise up the Eurobond league tables, has been rewarded for returning to the fold by being made a partner of Goldman Sachs. Sherwood, who quit Goldman at the start of the year only to rejoin the firm a month later, and Richard Sharp, son of the late Lord Sharp, the former chairman of Cable and Wireless, are two of the 11 new London-based general partners elected to the 125-year-old partnership. Goldman is the largest private partnership remaining among the major US investment banking and brokerage firms. Its partners are reputed to earn a minimum of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m a year - hence competition for the biennial ritual of elevation to the partnership is fierce. This year Goldman appointed 58 new general partners, more than ever before. Apart from Sherwood and Sharp, Goldman's new London-based partners are: David Blood, Treasury, operations, technology and accounting; Zachariah Cobrinik, Japanese equity link trading; Gary Cohn, metals trading; Michael Evans, equity capital markets; Scott Kapnick, corporate finance; Scott Mead, IBS communications and technology; Kipp Nelson, derivatives triple joint venture; Wiet Pot, Euro share sales; Anthony Williams, derivatives triple joint venture.

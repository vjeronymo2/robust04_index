			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANT INFLUX MEETS HOSTILITY IN RURAL SOUTH  </P> <P> Ernie Pantoja traveled the migrant worker stream from Mexico through Chicago,  Florida, Tennessee and other Southern states before arriving here in 1985 and  "settling out" of the flow.  </P> <P> Pantoja, 34, now earns a living year round by picking tomatoes and planting  pine trees in this quiet farm community about 35 miles northeast of Birmingham.  It's backbreaking work, but he says it's worth it because he likes small-town  Alabama.  </P> <P> "Chicago was kind of dangerous," said Pantoja, speaking with quiet intensity.  "Florida, too. Then I came here. It was kind of quiet."  </P> <P> For similar reasons, the huge influx of Asian and Latino immigrants that in  recent years swept into the big cities of the North and West is increasingly  turning to the South. Many succeed in finding jobs, peace and tranquility. But  as their numbers increase in rural areas, others are finding something else:  </P> <P>  -- In Greenville, Miss., Wai Ma, a restaurant owner, carries a .38-caliber  Smith &amp; Wesson on his hip because two Chinese grocers have been robbed and  shot to death in his town in the last three months.  </P> <P> Born in Hong Kong, he lived in Cleveland before moving to Mississippi seven  years ago, attracted by "a small town where things went easy and slow." But  "for the last year or so," said Ma, "things are tough. People have started  killing people."  </P> <P>  -- In Raleigh, N.C., Ming Hai Loo was killed in a pool hall in July, hit on  the back of the head with a pistol and slammed to the ground, where his face  struck a beer bottle.  </P> <P> Witnesses quoted two white brothers as saying before the incident: "Because of  you people, our brothers and friends went to Vietnam and never came back. We  are going to finish you tonight." Loo was Chinese. The brothers were charged in  the slaying.  </P> <P>  -- In Gainesville, Ga., about 300 members of the Ku Klux Klan marched on the  Saturday before Labor Day "to protest the thousands of filthy, illegal wetbacks  that have ruined this fine north Georgia town," said a klan flyer.  </P> <P> According to the 1980 census, 14,622 Chinese, 12,536 Japanese and 9,273  Vietnamese lived in six Southern states -- Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, North  Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Those numbers are expected to jump  dramatically in the next census. Latinos, who numbered 127,300 in 1980, had  grown to 154,900 in those states five years later.  </P> <P> "As the influx increases, the (social) pressures increase," said Ozell Sutton,  southeast regional director of the Community Relations Service, an arm of the  Justice Department that works to ease ethnic friction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Built-In Hostility  </P> <P> The problem is particularly acute in the homogenous rural and small town areas  that typify much of the South. Here, unlike the urban North and West, large  ethnic communities built by immigrants and children of immigrants are virtually  unknown. As immigration to the South has increased, a clear pattern has  emerged: The first immigrants to a Southern community find curiosity and  hospitality. But as their numbers grow, so does the likelihood of hostility.  </P> <P> Mario Moreno of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  recalled that as a child in a migrant family he lived a while in Mississippi  during the late 1950s. There, he said, the family was "considered exotic.  Everybody wanted to talk to the family, learn about our ethnic background, eat  my mom's enchiladas and tortillas."  </P> <P> But when the larger community began to fear they were losing jobs to  immigrants, the family became "less exotic and more a threat; the attitude  changed," Moreno said. "I'm afraid as the (Southern immigrant) community grows,  there will be some tension."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen as a 'Novelty'  </P> <P> Po Chan, who was born in China and now lives in Raleigh, said he is perceived  as a "novelty" in groups where he is the only Chinese. "When people don't feel  threatened," they "treat me special." However, "when you have a group getting  larger and larger and competing . . . then they feel threatened."  </P> <P> Many immigrants complain that they are caught between two prejudices, one  black, the other white. Black people accuse them of taking jobs and making  money off black neighborhoods without reinvesting. White people accuse them of  taking jobs and reject them because of their ethnic heritage.  </P> <P> The klan march was targeted at Gainesville immigrants who often work at  low-skill, low-pay jobs in the agriculture and poultry businesses. "It's as if  the klan thinks its constituency has some great desire to go into those chicken  coops and pluck chickens," said Eva Sears of the Center for Democratic Renewal,  an organization that monitors hate group activity.  </P> <P> Melinda Yee, executive director of the Organization of Chinese Americans, said:  "People tend to get territorial, despite the fact that (the newcomers) are  bringing in business and money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dates White Woman  </P> <P> Ma, the pistol-packing restaurant owner, believes black robbers shot the  grocers in Greenville. Whites, he said, stare in hostility when he goes out  with his white fiancee. "You can see the expression on their faces," he said.  "What's that white girl doing with that Chinese?"  </P> <P> Paul Igasaki of the Japanese-American Citizens League recalls a friend's horror  when she traveled through a small town in Georgia and heard a television  announcer "using the term 'Jap' quite comfortably. She called the station and  they said they didn't think it was derogatory."  </P> <P> Along the Gulf Coast, clashes between Vietnamese and American-born fishermen  became commonplace as the newcomers began settling there in the 1970s. Now such  friction is played down, but as the population of Southeast Asians rises, other  problems emerge.  </P> <P> In Biloxi, Miss., Charlie Pham, a co-owner of an insurance firm, complained  that police failed to help him retrieve his stolen typewriter, even when they  knew the thief. "I don't want to say it is discrimination," he said, "but it is  the same thing."  </P> <P> Pham's business partner, Thomas Vu, said it is dangerous for Vietnamese to walk  the streets. "Whenever black people see Vietnamese people, they stop and rob  them," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Model Minority'  </P> <P> Immigrants everywhere share the problem of language barriers, which, according  to experts, can make newcomers tentative, unwilling to assert their rights.  Asians, in particular, say they suffer from what they call the "model minority"  syndrome that keeps some from speaking out about injustice and prevents  outsiders from perceiving their problems.  </P> <P> Here in Oneonta, population 5,000, the number of immigrants, mostly Latinos, is  still small, and townspeople are trying to ease the transition from  all-American town to an international one.  </P> <P> "We don't have the problems of gangs and different groups," said Mayor Danny  Hicks. "It doesn't matter whether you're white, black or Hispanic. People just  want to be treated right."  </P> <P> And many U.S.-born residents say they get along fine with the newcomers.  </P> <P> Judy Dempsey, a white cashier at a gas station out on U.S. 231, said: "I've had  'em move in all around me, and they come in here and never give me no  problems."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, there are signs of the pressures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Followed Into Store  </P> <P> Matter of factly, Pantoja said he and other Latinos have been followed in a  local store because the manager "thought we were going to steal something."  Sometimes when Americans "don't know your name, they say 'Hey, Mexican,' " he  said.  </P> <P> Along the red dirt roads that wind through nearby Straight Mountain and  Chandler Mountain, tomato fields and processing plants dot the landscape.  Trucks carry loads of Mexican workers to and from the fields, where, according  to Pantoja, a worker can earn $250 to $300 "in a good week."  </P> <P> In the brutally hot climate, some workers hang their sweaty work shoes under  porch awnings rather than bring them inside houses where several young men  often sleep in one room on beds made up on the floor.  </P> <P> Driving his van through the area, Joe Castillo, who was born in Ohio, grew up  in Texas and moved here in 1973, angrily recounted complaints that he hears  from many workers. The problem, he said, is not just low pay. "Sometimes it's  no pay. They (farmers) work them for a day or two and then run them off."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Radio Program Helps  </P> <P> Castillo recently began a radio program in Spanish to inform Latinos of their  rights as employees, and to provide information on immigration, English  classes, which he teaches, and other concerns.  </P> <P> Sitting around a table at Corpus Christi Church, several officials of the  Birmingham Diocese's Hispanic Ministry -- including Irma Nolla, the program  director, and Graciela Comontofski, a volunteer coordinator -- ticked off  problems that grow as the area's Latino population grows: shortage of  affordable housing, poor working conditions, lack of bilingual safety signs on  jobs, no bilingual driving tests.  </P> <P> "The immigrants come here and sweat and work to help the economy, but when they  want a driver's license, nobody wants to help them," Comontofski said.  </P></p>

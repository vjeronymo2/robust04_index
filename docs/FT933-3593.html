			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK superstores As Tesco tees up to start the food retailers' reporting season, attention will once again fix on the valuations ascribed to their vast property portfolios. James Capel calculates that, between them, the big three grocers own some Pounds 8.4bn of properties. This compares with Pounds 8.6bn owned by Land Securities, MEPC and British Land. Recent fears about the sustainability of grocers' margins and return on capital, however, increasingly call into question whether superstore assets should be depreciated over their useful lives. So far, Wm Morrison has been the only food retailer to respond to such concerns - although depreciating its land and buildings by just 1 per cent a year seems little more than cosmetic. The worry is that if food retailers do not steadily depreciate their assets they may be forced to take big one-off write-downs. By bidding up the cost of sites, the big grocers have had to work harder to maintain their return on capital. They have achieved this by widening their trading margins. If margins now come under pressure, the capital value of their sites may also fall. Should not that risk be reflected in their books? Arguably, superstore land may preserve much of its value over 15 to 25 years, especially if inflation returns, but the case for depreciating buildings over their useful lives appears overwhelming. Even this move would have a material impact on grocers' earnings, reducing some of them by as much as 15 per cent. Investors, though, scarcely need further encouragement to sell. The sector has under-performed the market by 18 per cent since the start of the year.</p>

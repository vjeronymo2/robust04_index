			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGE MORE TRAGEDY TO MARXISM;  </P> <P> DICTATORSHIP: THE SOVIETS HAVE BURIED COMMUNISM. BUT ONE-PARTY RULE BASED ON  MARXIST DOCTRINE LIVES ON ELSEWHERE.  </P> <P> The most pernicious influence of Marxism has been to provide an intellectual  rationale for dictatorship. The disastrous consequence of this for modern  Russia has now implicitly been acknowledged by the Central Committee of the  Soviet Communist Party. The doctrine of single-party rule, of party  dictatorship, has been abandoned -- 72 years too late for Russia, 46 years too  late for all the rest of us.  </P> <P> Marx himself, when he spoke of "the dictatorship of the proletariat," seems to  have had Roman dictatorship in mind: constitutional dictatorship, initially  limited in duration.  </P> <P> Under Lenin's leadership, a theory of government by the working class became in  practice rule by the Communist Party. Further elaborated in the doctrine of  "democratic centralism," the supposed dictatorship of the proletariat became  arbitrary and absolute dictatorship by the self-nominating and  self-perpetuating apparatus controlling that party.  </P> <P> When Mikhail Gorbachev launched perestroika, he did not intend to become the  gravedigger of communism. He meant to save it by reforming it. But he is now,  in essential respects, terminating it. Two years ago, his Extraordinary  Communist Party Congress to reform the Soviet political system took for granted  the Communist Party's continued monopoly of power. That is now is reversed.  </P> <P> The single-party question has been at the center of the political turmoil in  Romania since the revolution in December. Silviu Brucan, the veteran Communist  who played probably the most important individual role in preparing the  Ceausescus' overthrow and bringing the National Salvation Front to power -- who  usually is described as the front's theorist -- has said that "it will take 20  years for Romania to become a democracy." His implication is that Romania will  need 20 more years of direction by an elite.  </P> <P> He argues that the old-fashioned political party system has broken down  everywhere because of the rise to power of intellectual workers who refuse to  accept the rigid structures of traditional parties. He says that the ecological  movements in Europe, the Green parties, Solidarity in Poland, the "New Forums"  that have emerged in Hungary, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia, all are new  political phenomena produced by the failure of the old party system.  </P> <P> He thinks this new class of intellectual workers must be the leading class in  the future, but told a French interviewer in January that the difference  between West and East today is that in the West another class still is in  control over the intellectual workers, the capitalist class -- "what you in  France call the 200 families. In the East that class does not exist." He  doesn't want it to exist in the new Romania, which is the reason the National  Salvation Front has been hostile to Romanian exiles coming back from the West.  </P> <P> It is a demonstration of the extent to which the reformers in the East still  think in categories of the 1930s. Brucan, in certain ways correct in his  analysis, still does not understand that whatever capitalism in the West has  become, it certainly is not today dominated by the "200 families" of France --  or by Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Mellons in America.  </P> <P> He also fails to understand that Communists, even Communist reformers, are no  longer acceptable as leaders of a revolution against communism. Things have  gone much too far for that, as the Soviet abandonment of the one-party system  demonstrates. Brucan's associate, Petre Roman, currently the prime minister,  has repeatedly spoken of the need for "a new kind of democracy," as has Brucan.  A Romanian journalist, Octavian Paler, replies, "What don't they like about  Western democracy? I'm very afraid of new kinds of democracy."  </P> <P> Romania and the Soviet Union have been the last places where the single-party  idea survived -- in the Eastern Bloc, that is. One-party government has already  formally been renounced in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and  Poland. It survives outside the bloc, in Yugoslavia (where the Communist  parties of Slovenia and Croatia nevertheless advocate multi-partyism), and in  isolated Albania.  </P> <P> It survives in a great many places outside Europe, and Marxism bears a  responsibility for that, too. Every sub-Saharan African government except South  Africa's, Senegal's and that of the island of Mauritius is a one-party  dictatorship -- nearly all of them claiming to be "socialist." (Nigeria is a  doubtful case: There are two parties, both under army domination.)  </P> <P> One-party rule is the practice in most of Asia and the Middle East, and in  several Latin American countries. Marxism nearly always provides the rationale.  Today, some African leaders pay increasing attention to North Korea. As the  Soviet model falters, Kim Il Sung's dynastic Communist totalitarianism seems a  useful replacement -- a surviving mutation of Marxism able to justify a  dictator's quest for total control, as well as his need to believe that Marxism  has proved progress and science to be on dictatorship's side.  </P> <P> Africa's tragedy is just another charge on the account owed history by Marx and  Lenin. Had their beliefs not fused, so as to assign virtue to despotism,  promising that out of this could come the general happiness of mankind, the  20th Century would have been spared much grief. It all began in good  intentions. It ended, for all intents and purposes, in Moscow on Wednesday at  that meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee which abandoned the  principle of Communist Party dictatorship.  </P></p>

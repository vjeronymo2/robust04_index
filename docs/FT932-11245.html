			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Lasmo compensates former chief executive with Pounds 2.2m pay-off MR CHRIS Greentree, who was replaced as chief executive of Lasmo, the lossmaking independent oil company, last January, has received a pay-off totalling Pounds 2.2m. Under an agreement announced yesterday, the Canadian-born executive is also to receive Pounds 44,000 to cover repatriation and other expenses. Lasmo said it is paying Mr Greentree Dollars 1,233,500 (Pounds 785,000) for loss of office. He had two years of a three-year contract to run. He will also receive the benefit of various insurance policies and pension entitlements which are expected to provide him with a pension of Dollars 189,000 a year. The value of the insurance policies, built up over 10 years, is about Dollars 2.2m. The existence of the policies had not previously been disclosed, a spokeswoman for the company said yesterday. Mr Greentree was ousted from Lasmo after the company reported a loss of Pounds 385m and cut its dividend due to heavy borrowing costs. In his last year at the company he was paid a total of Pounds 480,647 including a Pounds 50,000 performance bonus, an increase of 40 per cent. After his departure, senior Lasmo executives took a 5 per cent pay cut. Mr Greentree's successor, Mr Joe Darby, was to be paid Pounds 200,000, the company said at the time. Mr Greentree's payment exceeds the deal agreed between British Petroleum and its former chief Mr Bob Horton, who left the company last summer. Mr Horton received a Pounds 1.5m package of compensation and pension entitlements.</p>

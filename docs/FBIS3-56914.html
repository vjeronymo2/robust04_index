Ozolas said  Kozyrev's statement refers to a new annexation of the Baltic  states.    Ozolas said the meeting in Moscow was attended by Russian  ambassadors to the CIS countries and the Baltic states, as well  as by a big group of Russian generals. It is also noteworthy,  Ozolas said, that the meeting was held immediately after the  visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Russia. According to  Ozolas, Kozyrev has hastily distributed the keys to the solution  of Russia's most important problems to the generals -- the keys  to the CIS countries and the Baltic states. This is confirmed  by Kozyrev's words that the refusal of military participation in  those states would be the same kind of extremism kind as  imperial suppression by tanks.</p>

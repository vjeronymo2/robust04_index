			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: European sector eases on dollar support rumours European government bonds fell back yesterday on rumours that the US Federal Reserve may act soon to support the dollar by raising official short-term interest rates. The shift out of US bonds into European bonds, triggered by the weakness in the dollar, which caused European markets to rally in recent days, also seemed to have slowed as the US currency regained some of its composure. The interest rate rumours were triggered by US data showing a 0.3 per cent rise in consumer prices in June. The more pessimistic tone in the German government bond market was compounded by disappointment over the Bundesbank's two basis point cut in its securities repurchase rate, from 4.93 to 4.91 per cent. 'Cuts in the repo rate have become smaller and smaller in recent weeks, suggesting that the Bundesbank is reluctant to lower interest rates further in the near term,' said Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi. Analysts said that data showing a rise in West German wholesale prices in June of 0.8 per cent, which was above expectations, had provided an excuse for the market to sell-off. French government bonds ended the day off their highs as investors squared their positions in thin trading ahead of the Bastille holiday today and tomorrow when French markets will be closed. UK gilts rose sharply in early trading, boosted by weaker than expected retail prices and employment data, but afternoon rumours of a another US interest rate hike triggered profit-taking at the long end of the yield curve, leaving prices to close only slightly higher on the day. As traders began to focus on Friday's gilt auction announcement, the Bank of England's announcement that it would issue Pounds 800m in tranches of existing bonds from today put a further damper on the market's mood. 'The obvious interpretation is that Bank is keen to take advantage of the market's positive sentiment in recent days,' said Mr Peter Fellner, gilts strategist at NatWest Markets. However, many participants said that investor demand remained subdued in recent sessions. 'We haven't yet got to the point where investors are willing to chase the market aggressively,' a dealer said. Italian bonds ended the day slightly weaker on profit-taking after Tuesday's strong gains. However, prices held up moderately well as dealers anticipated good news from the government on its fiscal plans. Still, with most of the package's details leaked in recent days, 'it will be hard to surprise on the positive side,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg Securities. There are widespread hopes that the government will announce dramatic cuts in health and pensions spending to cut the country's heavy fiscal deficit. Spanish bonds rose half a point amid fresh hopes that Spanish short-term rates could ease further after yesterday's encouraging June inflation data. The headline rate rose by 0.1 per cent on the month, bringing the year-on-year rate to 4.7 per cent. Analysts were particularly encouraged by the 0.3 per cent fall in service costs. In Sweden, bonds weakened again ahead of the special meeting of the parliament's finance committee, the auction of SKr12.5bn of Treasury bills and the release of June inflation numbers, all slated for today. The yield on the benchmark bond due 2003 rose by seven basis points to 10.87 per cent. US Treasury prices held steady across the maturity range in the wake of a consumer prices report that was in line with market expectations. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 83 15/32 , yielding 7.666 per cent, and the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 21/32 , to yield 6.17 per cent. After Tuesday's better-than-expected June producer prices report had lifted bonds, investors were hoping yesterday that the second half of the June inflation data - the consumer prices figures - would be equally positive. The figures, however, proved unexciting, with the 0.3 per cent increase reported in the consumer prices index being in line with economists' forecasts. A similar-sized increase in 'core' consumer prices (minus the volatile food and energy components) was also as expected, and consequently, there was little reaction from bond prices, which traded in a narrow range either side of opening values throughout the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "CMI Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Defense tonight issued a communique  detailing the information the government received on the  recordings. At approximately 1730 on Thursday, 16 June, Dr.  Andres Pastrana and Dr. Luis Alberto Moreno paid a visit to the  president and minister of defense and presented them with a tape  containing three telephone conversations. The first two  conversations were allegedly between journalist Alberto Giraldo  and Mr. Miguel Orejuela and the third conversation was between  Giraldo and Mr. Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.    Dr. Pastrana said he received the tape in the city of Cali  the day before from people who did not identify themselves.  Early on 17 June, the minister of defense, at the request of  the president of the Republic, ordered the military forces  general command and the police general directorate to confirm  the veracity of voices and forward, as soon as possible, the  tape and results of voice confirmation to the Prosecutor  General's Office. The same order was given to the DAS  [Administrative Department of Security] director.    After informing the prosecutor general, that same 17 June  Dr.  Ernesto Samper Pizano was informed about this situation and a  copy of the tape was forwarded to him. At about 1630 on 17  June, at the request of the defense minister, three Armed Forces  commanders delivered the recording personally to the prosecutor  general. The results of the confirmation of voices were  forwarded first on Friday and then on Saturday.    Taking into consideration that this investigation falls  under  the Prosecutor General's Office, the government immediately  forwarded the tapes and the voice confirmation to that agency.  Additionally and as is routine, the government and Armed Forces  are ready to assist the Prosecutor General's Office in all  support needed in this case.</p>

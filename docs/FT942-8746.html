			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Vacancies rise in Birmingham press The number of job vacancies advertised in the Birmingham press has risen by 33 per cent since the lowest point of recession in October 1992, but is still 57 per cent below the peak demand for labour in 1990, Paul Cheeseright writes. Figures published yesterday by Birmingham City Council show the number of permanent full-time jobs increased sharply over the last quarter. Previously the strongest demand was for temporary labour. The council reported there were 9,499 full-time job vacancies in the first quarter, 33 per cent more than in the 1993 first quarter. The main demand has come the engineering and construction industries and from public and miscellaneous services. 'The increasing number of vacancies in manufacturing are the first warnings of skill shortages ahead,' the council said.</p>

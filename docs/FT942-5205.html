			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Brinkmanship over Korea The crisis over North Korea's suspected covert nuclear weapons programme is entering a new and dangerous phase. This week the UN Security Council may move towards imposing economic sanctions on Pyongyang for impeding International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities. North Korea, which has always said it would regard sanctions as an act of war, may withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in protest. As international crises go, this must rank among the most frustrating. On the one hand, the issues it raises are of immense significance; on the other, the record does not suggest there is much the rest of the world, faced with a regime as erratic and mysterious as that in Pyongyang, can do peacefully to resolve it. If North Korea is allowed to develop an atomic bomb, the reverberations will be felt for years. In Asia, Japan would be tempted to review its constitutional aversion to nuclear weapons, prompting an inevitable resurgence of old regional insecurities. In the world at large, the campaign to prevent the further spread of such weapons - now focused on the prospective renewal of the NPT in 1995 - would suffer a blow from which it might not recover. Carrots and sticks Thus for the past 18 months, Washington has been busily waving carrots and sticks to persuade Pyongyang to open up its nuclear programme to inspection. So far, the carrots - principally offers of international recognition - have been to the fore, on the theory that the North Korean regime, fearing for its survival, was using the possibility of an A-bomb to extract political concessions from the west. The events of the past week - with the IAEA saying it could no longer reliably ascertain whether nuclear materials from North Korea's Yongbyon reactor had been diverted to weapons production - have tipped the balance towards the stick of eventual trade sanctions. The west probably has no alternative now but to call North Korea's bluff and proceed towards imposing some form of sanctions if it is to prevent further erosion of the NPT's credibility. But if so, it should hasten slowly, with the clearest of objectives and with the fullest awareness of the pitfalls. First, the US needs to strain every sinew to retain the co-operation of the regional players. South Korea and Japan both support sanctions with varying measures of enthusiasm and likely effectiveness. But to render an embargo even partly effective, China - a nominal ally and North Korea's biggest source of imported fuel and grain - will also need to be persuaded not to veto a sanctions resolution. Quiet persuasion That argues for continuing to play the issue long, and for giving Beijing ample opportunity to demonstrate that its preferred strategy of quiet persuasion can work. In particular, any measures should be preceded by an ultimatum giving North Korea a deadline to open up to inspection the two suspected nuclear waste sites at Yongbyon that now constitute the sole verifiable clue to the nature of its nuclear programme. Second, the western powers should not lose sight of the continuing need to offer Pyongyang diplomatic escape routes. In this respect, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's suggestion of a conference involving the two Koreas, the US, Russia, China and Japan would be worth considering. Such an initiative's chances of success would admittedly be slim. But only if all efforts to engage North Korea are shown to have been exhausted will it make sense actually to use the sanctions ratchet. Third, the west should recognise that North Korea's isolation is already intense, and that an unduly precipitate move to isolate it further could provide a desperate regime with either an alibi for its own economic failings or a convenient distraction in conflict. The US clearly needs to maintain its military umbrella over South Korea and to warn the North that if it initiates hostilities it will face immediate destruction. But war on the Korean peninsula, with or without nuclear weapons, is in no one's interests. The west should beware of inadvertently suggesting to the paranoid regime in Pyongyang that it has no way out but through waging one.</p>

A Foreign Ministry  statement said in this connection that the UN employees were on  a reconnaissance mission agreed upon by Operation Lifeline Sudan  to carry out a survey to assess relief requirements and to  organize a campaign for the vaccination of children in the area.    The statement said that the detained UN employees were four  Sudanese and a Briton, namely (Brian Tattersall), a Briton  working for the FAO; (John Owal), a Sudanese working for the  FAO; Dr. Malik Muhammad al-Badawi, a Sudanese working for  UNICEF; and (Christopher Farmela Noli), a Sudanese working for  UNICEF. The Foreign Ministry said that on 27 February (Brian  Tattersall), the Briton, was released but not the others, who  are Sudanese employees of the United Nations. They have been  flown to Nairobi.    The statement said that the commander of the rebels, (Jacob  Miarbin), stated in his report on the attempted aggression that  the aid workers' return to the town of Attar was not guaranteed  on the pretext of military operations in the area. However, the  area is completely secure and this is confirmed by the fact that  the steamboat (Baldiyah) which they traveled on, continued to  travel unhindered and was moored at Attar, which was made the  center for the vaccination campaign.    The Foreign Ministry said it was not surprised by this  inhuman stand on the part of the rebel movement, which has never  cared about values and ideals. This incident is only another  link in a series of crimes it has committed against the  innocent, starting with its assassination of relief workers in  September 1992 and its attacks on relief trains in May and  November 1993, as well as attacks on relief boats in January and  May 1993.    The Foreign Ministry statement said that the Sudanese  Government condemns and denounces this barbarous behavior of the  rebels and said it will hold the rebel movement fully  responsible for the safety of the detained persons. It demanded  the release of the detained persons immediately. The statement  confirmed that this action must be regarded as a violation of  the tripartite agreement signed by the Sudanese Government, the  United Nations, and the rebels to ensure the safety of Operation  Lifeline Sudan. It is also a violation of international norms.    The Foreign Ministry statement demanded that the United  Nations ensure the safety, protection, and return of its four  Sudanese employees who have been detained and demanded their  immediate release without any prior conditions.</p>

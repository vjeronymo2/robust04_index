			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Grandparent's travel costs questioned Sir, I am intrigued to know how Mr Foster (Letters, February 6) adds one grandparent to his group travelling from Skipton to London and increases his costs by Pounds 200. The most expensive ticket for the journey is Pounds 132. Should the grandparent be aged 60 or over, by purchase of a Pounds 16 Senior Railcard he or she can reduce that fare to Pounds 87.10. Would that BR were in the happy position of being able to 'mentally write off' the cost of its vehicles. In the real world, however, not only do the Intercity 225 trains Mr Foster would use for the bulk of his journey cost Pounds 4m a piece but we are expected to make a return on that investment too. That said, those without aspirations to a BMW can travel from Skipton to London from a little as Pounds 33 for an APEX ticket.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has only released  approximately 380 Palestinian prisoners. Approximately 250  freed prisoners arrived in the Gaza Strip and the remainder in  Judaea and Samaria. This was reported by Palestinian sources  this evening to our correspondent Moti Amir.    The sources claimed that the IDF had presented erroneous  figures and misled the media with regard to the exact number  prisoners released. Our correspondent notes that IDF sources  this evening confirmed that due to last-minute technical  problems, less than 400 Palestinian prisoners were released  today, and not 1,000 as originally intended.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Brussels plan for export credit rules European Union members would be required to move towards common guidelines for medium- and long-term credit guarantees for exporters under a directive proposed by the European Commission yesterday. The draft legislation is intended to limit unfair competition between the 12 governments in export financing and to control their mounting losses on bad debts, which have totalled Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in the past three years. Though drawn up in negotiations with EU government officials and export credit agencies, some of the proposals are likely to arouse concern in Britain and the Netherlands. The Commission hopes, nonetheless, that the directive will be approved this year by the Council of Ministers, on a majority vote, and will lead to a wider agreement between the 25 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. EU export credit agencies guarantee medium and long-term contracts worth about Ecu30bn annually, roughly two thirds of total guarantees by OECD members. Many national treasuries are unhappy about the costs and risks involved. The directive falls short of calling for full harmonisation of export credit rules, but seeks more common ground in three areas: By setting guidelines for guarantee conditions, notably in respect of the types of risks and the proportion of loss covered. Coverage would be limited to 90 per cent of the value of an exporter's order and 95 per cent of a project's cost. In the UK, the only EU member where cover up to 100 per cent is available, exporters have protested that a reduction in the percentage would raise their costs and handicap them against bidders from the US, Japan and Canada, which all provide 100 per cent guarantees. The directive seeks to meet these objections by allowing 100 per cent cover when there is only one EU bidder for an international contract, or when several EU export credit agencies agree to match support available to non-EU bidders. By laying down rules for calculating export credit premiums. These would have to be no more than 35 per cent above or 10 per cent below an agreed norm. By dividing country cover into six categories, according to the countries' creditworthiness, economic and political stability and weight in insurers' overall portfolios. The directive would also require greater transparency by obliging export credit agencies regularly to exchange information and explain cases of unusually large exposure to individual countries. This proposal is intended to underpin a future common EU foreign policy and is not expected to be widely applied until further progress is made towards that goal. Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department said yesterday it would closely examine the wording governing exceptions to the ban on 100 per cent cover. But it welcomed the commission's statement that premiums should reflect risks, and that rates should cover the cost of claims. Dutch concern is understood to focus on the proposals for the wording of policies. Unlike most other European agencies, Dutch policies cover all risks except for those specifically excluded. Commission officials said they expected growing budgetary pressures to rally governments behind yesterday's proposals. These are separate from proposals on short-term export credit rules, to be made by the Commission's competition directorate in September. Efforts have been made to harmonise export credit rules since the European Community was formed in 1957. Yesterday's proposals are intended to replace a 1970 directive which was widely ignored.</p>

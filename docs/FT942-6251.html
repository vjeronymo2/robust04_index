			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Inflation fears depress bonds: Bundesbank cancels auction - Dealers expect bear phase in markets Dealers across Europe drove government bond prices lower yesterday as the view took hold that inflationary pressures were on the rise and markets had entered a bear phase. Fears that resurgent inflation pressures will bring an end to interest rate cuts in Europe, and may indeed cause short-term rates to rise, have pushed bond yields sharply higher. Those worries were fanned yesterday by the continuing surge in commodity prices - which unsettled US Treasury bonds - amid reports of heavy buying on international markets, where hedge funds were said to be particularly active. Most of the activity in bonds took place in futures pits rather than in cash bonds. Technical support levels on several futures contracts were breached, which further shook confidence and gave traders the impression that prices would continue to fall. 'It's a very scared market,' one London bond trader said. 'Most bonds offer great value on a fundamental basis, but after the losses of the recent months, no one dares to get in, even at these levels.' Stock markets across Europe ended the day relatively unscathed after a roller-coaster session. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 4.1 higher at 2,970.5, having been more than 40 points down at one stage. Shares in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan all finished above their worst. In the bonds market, Germany led the decline when the June contract of the German government bond future fell to a new low for the year. The Bundesbank announced that a widely expected auction of long-dated bonds would not take place. While the Bundesbank said the move was due to the government's good cash position, it was taken as a sign that it was not prepared to risk an issue in a shaky market. It was the second time in a week that an issue has been delayed. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, reached a low of 92.62, before ending 0.62 points lower at 92.83. The yield on the German 10-year benchmark bond rose to 6.98 per cent. UK government bonds fell sharply on data showing M0 money supply rising a provisional adjusted 7.1 per cent in the year to end May. In addition, talk that today's UK purchasing managers' survey for May would show a rise in producer prices put further pressure on prices. The long gilt futures contract fell by 1 to 100 23/32 . French and Italian government bonds also fell sharply, tracking Germany lower but further weighed down by supply pressures. The June futures contract on the French exchange Matif fell by 1.00 point to 117.72. European traders said they were awaiting the Bundesbank's allocation of two-week securities repurchase agreements today, where they were hoping for a confirmation of recent Bundesbank comments that the repo rate has room to fall further. In the US, fears of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve eased slightly after the Commerce Department reported that disposable personal incomes had fallen by 0.2 per cent in April, while spending on personal consumption fell by 0.1 per cent.

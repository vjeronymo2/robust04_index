Akira Yamagishi, president of the eight-million strong  Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), told a meeting of  Rengo's central committee that the forum "is intended to back  the ruling coalition and to develop and establish a political  system for changes of governments." He said the forum "will  study designs for a broader spectrum of policies."    Yamagishi said Rengo will set up a preparatory panel in  early  April as a prelude to founding the forum.    On Rengo's support for political parties, Yamagishi said the  confederation will not only cooperate with the Social Democratic  Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP) and the Democratic Reform Party (DRP), a political arm of  Rengo, but also other parties.    Rengo, founded in November 1989, has backed the governing  coalition since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took power last  August.    Yamagishi has envisioned a future reorganization of Japanese  politics with three main political forces -- the conservative  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), new conservative forces, and  liberals. He has reiterated Rengo will back the liberals  comprising the SDPJ, the DSP, the DRP, new party Sakigake, the  Japan New Party and the more liberal elements of the LDP after  the political reorganization.    Yamagishi indicated at the committee meeting that Rengo will  shape its own tax reform plan and submit it to the government.  The governing coalition has set up a panel to conclude ways of  financing tax cuts of some 6 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994  state budget by the end of the current 150-day ordinary Diet  session that began January 31.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Boots pulls up its margins - The Bottom Line It was ironic that Boots' surprisingly good results this week - a 19 per cent increase in underlying profits to Pounds 484m - should come a day after a disappointing trading statement from rival group Kingfisher. It demonstrated how retailers' fortunes - and market sentiment - can change in a year. This time last year, rivalry between Boots and Kingfisher - and in particular between Boots the Chemists and Kingfisher's Superdrug - was seen as a microcosm of a wider clash of retailing philosophies for the 1990s. Kingfisher advocated a strategy of reducing profit margins to increase sales volumes and market share, adopting a policy of 'Everyday Low Pricing'. Boots stuck to the margin-led approach, which says growing profits is all about constantly engineering the profit margins upwards. In the first half of 1993, Boots' shares underperformed the market by 25 per cent, losing their premium to the stores sector, while Kingfisher's advanced. Price-cutting by Superdrug aroused fears that margins at Boots the Chemists - responsible for 60 per cent of Boots group's operating profits - were under threat. The picture a year on is rather different. Kingfisher's shares have slumped from 778p last December to 516p, after two disappointing trading statements, and results suggesting its margin sacrifices were not being compensated for by volume increases - at least not yet. Boots' shares have also fallen since December, but by much less, and at 525p are on a considerably higher rating. Results from Boots the Chemists on Thursday showed it had withstood competition from Superdrug, and pushed up its operating margin yet again, from 10.7 to 11.5 per cent. That has more than doubled from 5 per cent in the mid-1980s, and is getting into territory previously occupied only by Marks and Spencer. BTC reported a sales increase for the year to March 31 of 5.4 per cent; Superdrug a fall in sales in the first quarter of 0.7 per cent. The reasons for the reversal of fortunes are complex. But while it is too early to write off Kingfisher chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy's 'value retailing' approach, Boots' success does suggest the Mulcahy way is not the only way. Boots, however, differs in important ways from Kingfisher. First, it has the advantage when it comes to pushing up margins of vertical integration. Some 43 per cent of Boots the Chemists' sales are own-label, which earn a higher margin as the retailer can buy them more cheaply than manufacturers' brands. Much of that own-label product comes from Boots' own cosmetics and healthcare factories, now grouped in a separate division, Boots Contract Manufacturing. BCM sells 60 per cent of its output to Boots the Chemists - and lifted operating profits nearly a quarter last year. Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs division, also supplies Boots the Chemists with big-sellers such as Optrex, Strepsils and Nurofen. Healthcare International more than doubled its profits and is earmarked for expansion. A second difference is that a question mark hangs over one of Boots' main divisions - pharmaceuticals - and several of its retail chains are in rather worse shape than Kingfisher's. The withdrawal last year of heart drug Manoplax robbed Boots Pharmaceuticals of annual sales which analysts had forecast might reach Pounds 166m and left it too small to compete in a rapidly-consolidating global drugs industry. Boots is reviewing its future and examining sale, merger or asset-swap possibilities. The performance of the other retail businesses, especially those acquired in the 1989 take-over of Ward White, is patchy. Rationalisation of the DIY joint venture Do It All should reduce losses, and Halfords is recovering strongly. But Children's World and Fads made losses, and the task is still to raise the performance of these businesses to acceptable levels. Investors might be cautious of Boots until the future of the pharmaceuticals business is resolved - analysts fear a sale might be earnings-dilutive. It would, however add to Boots' Pounds 150m cash pile, providing opportunities for expansion, for example of Healthcare International. Boots also says it has 'no philosophical objection' to handing cash back to shareholders. Either way, Boots' success in confounding its critics during a tough period suggests it is likely to remain one of the market's more solid long-term performers.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (6): The longest subsea tunnel  -It's a roll-call of engineering achievements The French, with their natural panache, describe it as the project of the century. History will recall that they were correct. The Channel tunnel by any measure ranks as one of the world's great engineering feats. The success in completing the 50km (32 miles) crossing beneath the sea bed, in three tunnels, under one of the world's busiest waterways compares with the construction of the Suez and Panama canals. Memories of the bitter squabbles over costs and delays punctuating more than six years of construction will dim as future generations take pride in achievements of the British and French builders. It has been a massive feat: 150km of tunnels have been bored and lined with more than 800,000 concrete segments weighing anything up to nine tonnes each. Into these have been installed more than 22,000 tonnes of railway track, accompanied by more than 1,000 km of power cables and for signalling and communications. Jack Lemley, chief executive of Transmanche Link, a consortium of five French and five British construction companies which designed and built the project, says: 'In six and a half years we have created Europe's longest tunnel, the longest under-sea tunnel and the world's most advanced transportation system.' Rail traffic and engineering management constantly monitor 30,000 separate locations in the network - one of the largest systems of its kind outside of the space programme. Information is relayed through these fibre optic cables carrying 700m bits of data every second. At either end of the tunnels are electricity sub-stations each of which is capable of powering a city the size of Lille. Fifteen thousand supports had to be installed inside the tunnels to carry the catenary powering the trains. This involved the handling of about 1m separate components. Michel Barbier, responsible for the early stages of the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment from France, described the process of transporting such a vast quantity of equipment and personnel through the narrow aperture of the tunnel mouth as like 'force-feeding a goose in a very short space of time to produce the best ever pate de foie gras'. The goose has now been stuffed and Transmanche says the volume of mechanical electrical equipment installed is equivalent to building 10 cement works, 20 sugar refineries or two large nuclear power stations. The concrete linings of the tunnel have a crushing strength approaching twice that of concrete used in pressure vessels of nuclear power stations. They were manufactured at two purpose built factories, one at the French terminal and the other on the Isle of Grain in the Medway and Thames estuaries. All of this is a long way from where the consortium started in the summer of 1987 when the British and French parliaments approved legislation allowing construction to commence. On the site of the completed terminals near Folkestone, Kent and at Coquelles near Calais in northern France it is difficult to remember that this was once open countryside. The French site now contains a development the size of Heathrow airport. It was previously a marsh which had to be drained before work could start. The terminal now has its own water treatment plant capable of serving a town with a population of 20,000. The ground of the Folkestone terminal, the size of Heathrow's Terminal Four, had to be raised by up to 12 metres. This involved pumping 2.6m cubic metres of sand dredged from the Goodwin Sands, thereby avoiding half a million lorry movements. Construction of such a vast venture had many problems. Ten lives were lost during the building - eight on the British side and two in France  - requiring Transmanche to improve its health and safety standards, particularly training for tunnel workers. Tunneling initially was very slow and cost more than planned. Ground conditions under the British coast were much worse than expected. Salt water, percolating through fissures in the rock, affected the delicate controls on the 200 metre-long tunnel-boring machines. Attempts to insulate equipment caused overheating, periodic engine fires and many breakdowns. At one stage progress under the Kent coast was less than 20 metres a week, compared with more than 300 metres a week later. Mr John King, director responsible for the British tunnelling, later admitted: 'There were several times when I thought we might not make it. One of the worst moments was when, with water still pouring through tiny fissures in the roof of the tunnel, we had to decide whether the modifications we had made to the machines would be sufficient to let us proceed. If they had not worked I do not know what we would have done; fortunately, they worked.' At peak production, 2,000 tonnes of chalk marl an hour were be taken out of the British end of the tunnel alone to be deposited into lagoons at the base of Shakespeare Cliff, between Folkestone and Dover. The spoil contained within a purpose-built sea wall added 73 acres to Britain's land mass. In total more than 20m tonnes of spoil were removed from the tunnels along a narrow gauge construction railway totalling more than 300km. At the same time as spoil was being removed, concrete linings and equipment were being brought into the tunnels. The biggest problem facing contractors was that work was taking place before detailed designs for many parts of the project could be completed. It was not until plans started to emerge for the trains and transport system that it became apparent that a cooling system, which had not been included in the original proposal, would need to be installed. Friction caused by the passage of some of the largest trains in the world together with heat generated by the sophisticated signalling, communications and other installed equipment would have increased the temperature inside the tunnels to 50degC. To compensate, a cooling system was installed, involving pumping 220 litres of water a second chilled to 3degC through several hundred kilometres of pipes. The capacity of the cooling plants is equivalent to 25,000 domestic refrigerators. Design changes, imposed by the Inter-Governmental Commission established by the two Governments and responsible for granting Eurotunnel an operating licence, also have added to delays and increased costs. In one instance, the commission demanded that fire doors connecting the shuttle wagons be widened by just 10cm requiring substantial re-engineering of the wagons. The enormous air pressure created by large trains travelling through the tunnel at up to 160km per hour meant that every component installed in the tunnel had to be designed within specific aerodynamic coefficients creating additional problems for designers and contractors. Supports for pipework caused serious problems because they were too fragile even though they satisfied aerodynamic standards. In total, 20,000 light fittings have been installed in the tunnels, each of which has to be taken into consideration in terms of their effect on the temperature and aerodynamic efficiency of the system as a whole. Given the problems that have had to be overcome it is a wonder that the project did not take even longer and cost more to complete.</p>

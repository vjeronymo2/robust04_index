In 1993 alone, Tibet approved  40 cooperative investment projects with a contracted investment  volume of over 67 million yuan and $9.6 million, thus setting a  record in introducing outside capital to the region. Foreign  trade volume reached $100 million, setting a record. This shows  that the original rigid and closed form of economy in the region  has been broken and that the region's economy is beginning to  move in the direction of an open pattern. A new economic  operating mechanism is taking shape.    Last year, the regional party committee and government lost  no time in taking the initiative to open up Tibet to the outside  world by strengthening ties with neighboring provinces and  cities, especially strengthening lateral economic cooperation  with the coastal areas. Serious efforts were made to cultivate  markets outside the region and to support and encourage economic  departments and enterprises to seek markets in the coastal areas  and in other countries. According to incomplete statistics,  economic and foreign trade departments in various prefectures  and cities set up nearly 100 trade missions, export-oriented  trade display centers, and wholly owned or joint venture  enterprises in Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai, Liaoning, Tianjin,  Beijing, and Hainan Provinces and Cities. The regional  department of economic relations and trade alone set up more  than 20 foreign trade centers in the coastal areas. It also  cooperated with foreign firms to establish more than 10  export-oriented enterprises, including an eiderdown processing  plant in Shenzhen, a goat down processing plant in Hebei, and a  warehouse in the Tianjin Bonded Area. Through these centers,  Tibet's farm and animal products and nationality handicraft  products were able to enter the world market.    While transforming their operating mechanisms, state-owned  enterprises in the region also took the initiative to enter into  cooperation with large enterprises in the coastal areas. So  far, they have established dozens of export-oriented wholly  owned or cooperative enterprises in Chengdu, Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In Hainan Province alone, Tibet has set up  more than 10 enterprises there.    To attract outside business firms and to promote prosperity  by opening up to the outside world, the autonomous region  stepped up the construction of infrastructure facilities in 1993  despite financial difficulties in a bid to expand trading with  other parts of China and foreign countries. It invested more  than 1 billion yuan to finance the expansion of the Bangda  Airport in Gonggar County, to improve the Sichuan-Tibet,  Qinghai-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways, to import advance  communications equipment, to install program-controlled,  direct-dialing telephones in the urban areas of six prefectures  and cities, and to build new power stations. At the same time,  the right to handle foreign trade and the power to examine and  approve foreign trade investment projects were delegated to  lower levels, thus enhancing the capacity to attract foreign  investments and investments from other parts of China. So far,  Tibet has attracted nearly 1 billion yuan worth of investments  from more than 20 provinces and cities in China and more than  $100 million of foreign capital, and has accepted nearly 30 aid  projects, worth more than $40 million, from United Nations  organizations and the governments of foreign countries.</p>

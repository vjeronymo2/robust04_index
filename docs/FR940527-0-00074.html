Finally, under the Final Recommended Decision, AT&amp;T would make a $150 million transition payment (in two installments of $75 million each) to Alascom that would be applied to reduce Alascom's total plant accounts. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the Final Recommended Decision, the Alaska Joint Board recommended maintaining the current cost separations factor for circuit equipment for Alascom and United Utilities, Inc. (UUI). The Alaska Joint Board also recommended against establishing the Alaska Fund proposed in the Tentative Recommendation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III.

The Commission has wrestled for over 20 years with the question of what type of telecommunications structure for Alaska would best serve the public interest. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Over this time period there have been significant changes in the domestic telecommunications market in terms of the number of carriers that provide interstate service, the types of services they provide, and the technologies they use to provide telecommunications services. While these changes have been occurring nationally, the Commission has continued to search for the market structure that will best meet the needs of Alaskan consumers of telecommunications services, incorporate into Alaska telecommunications the changes that have occurred nationally, and harmonize rate integration, competitive policies, and universal service objectives in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As early as 1972, the Commission concluded that AT&amp;T should use domestic satellites to provide interstate MTS service, in conjunction with local carriers, to Alaska, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii to implement rate integration to these areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  Establishment of Domestic Communications Satellite Facilities, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  35 FCC 2d 844 (1972), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  aff'd on recon., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  38 FCC 2d 665 (1972), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  aff'd sub. nom. Network Project v. FCC, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  511 F.2d 786 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In 1981, AT&amp;T and Alascom began providing interstate MTS service to and from Alaska under the JSA. In 1982, the Commission rejected Alascom's claim to an exclusive right to provide interstate MTS, concluded that an open entry policy for Alaska interstate MTS was in the public interest, and authorized competitive entry into the Alaska interstate MTS market for non-bush locations (areas where facilities competition is allowed). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  MTS &amp; WATS Market Structure Inquiry (Phase II), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  92 FCC 2d 787 (1982) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->  recon. denied, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  FCC 83&hyph;213 (released May 9, 1983).

In 1985, the Commission referred questions concerning the appropriate market structure for providing Alaska MTS to a Federal-State Alaska Joint Board created pursuant to Section 410(c) of the Communications Act. These questions have been under review by the Board for over eight years. The Board has collected vast quantities of data, received extensive comments from interested parties, reviewed numerous proposals on this subject, and held a public hearing. The Final Recommended Decision sets forth the market structure plan for Alaska that the Board believes best balances its five public interest goals. We conclude that this new market structure will allow Alaskan telecommunications consumers to derive benefits from the changes in telecommunications services that have occurred over the last twenty years. We concur with the Board's evaluation of the record, and the legal and policy analyses and recommendations that are presented in the Final Recommended Decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. We agree with the legal analysis in the Final Recommended Decision that concludes that we have ample authority under the Communications Act to implement the Board's specific transition mechanisms. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  We conclude that, based on the record, the Board's recommendations, with modifications and clarifications in this order, are in the public interest as expressed in Sections 1, 201, and 202 of the Communications Act, because they provide a comprehensive solution to the market structure issues referred to the Board and because they best achieve the five objectives the Board adopted earlier and that we adopt in this Order. We conclude that the new market structure, and the transition mechanisms included as part of the comprehensive solution, are essential elements to that overall plan of ensuring universal service for Alaska consumers, consistent with the Communications Act and the Alaska Joint Board's Final Recommended Decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at paras. 114&hyph;127.

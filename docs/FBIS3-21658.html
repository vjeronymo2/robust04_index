			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tagalog </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Yesterday Director Epimaco Velasco, of the National  Bureau of Investigation (NBI), stated that a test case for the  death penalty will be the case which they will bring against two  notorious drug traffickers believed to be the source of 200  million pesos worth of shabu confiscated by the Philippine Navy  from a fishing boat sometime ago.    In this connection, also yesterday, the owner of F/B Pamela  Blizette, a fishing boat from which was confiscated 8.5 kilos of  shabu, surrendered to the NBI.    Torcuato Cunanan, 60, a broker residing at 758 Bagong  Silang,  San Nicolas, Binondo, Manila, personally went to the Narcotics  Division of the NBI after he learned that the NBI was looking  for him in connection with the above-mentioned case.    Most likely, Cunanan denied any knowledge of the seizure of  the shabu and emphasized that he was no longer the owner of the  fishing vessel, since he sold it in June 1992.    Cunanan pointed to a certain Alfredo Tiongco, who supposedly  bought the said fishing boat. However, the NBI will continue to  investigate him, since the 10 bags of shabu which were in the  fishing boat were consigned to him.    With regard to his statement that he sold the boat to  Tiongco  in 1992, the NBI has learned that in the last registration of  the fishing boat, he (Cunanan) is still listed as the owner.    He (Cunanan) also stated that Tiongco was a former customer  of his brokerage firm.    From the record check of the NBI, it was learned that a  standing arrest warrant has been issued for Cunanan and Tiongco  for violating customs laws, that is, for smuggling. The warrant  was issued in 1988.    According to Director Velasco, the case against these two  men  is a possible test case for the death penalty.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Arts: Dicing with destiny - Cinema FRIENDS (15) Elaine Proctor THE NORTHERNERS (15) Alex Van Warmerdam UNDERCOVER BLUES (12) Herbert Ross PROVIDENCE (PG) Alain Resnais STRANGER THAN PARADISE (15) Jim Jarmusch What is history? For us living in the real world today, it is the sum of all our yesterdays: the force that shaped the past and made the ingredients for the present. But for those living in movies about the past, history is one long tragicomic irony. We the audience know - they on screen do not - the outcome of all those Great World Events being lived through. This gives every historical movie a split personality. A film about the Battle of Waterloo is not just about the Battle of Waterloo. It is about us filmgoers looking down from Mount Hindsight on foolish old Wellington and Napoleon, as they throw armies at each other in unaccountable ignorance of the well-known outcome. The man in the boots does not know that he will defeat the man in the funny hat, but we do. Result: diminution in dramatic tension, compensated for by the luxurious pleasures of omniscience. In Friends, written and directed by first-time film-maker Elaine Proctor, 1980s South Africa is limbering up for black liberation. Though full of serendipitous life and insights, this is one of those films that has a historical destination to reach and lets us know it. The three ex-university girls of the title - one black, two white - must be split apart by political events and then reunited. Aninka (Michele Burgers), a working-class Afrikaner who weds an archaeologist, spends much of the movie digging up the back garden with her hubby, exposing symbolic layers of African history. Thoko (Dambisa Kente) is a goodhearted Zulu: a walking advertisement for Black Is Beatific. And anti-apartheid terrorist Sophie (Kerry Fox) - mad, bad and dangerous (but lovable) - dashes about the land planting time-bombs in order to catalyse a future we in the audience already know. Even had we not read our newspapers, we could presage the one-nation solidarity-out-of-trauma ending from this film's opening shot. The women sit in a steam room in a symbolic feet-outwards triangle (or three-point star). Their lives may be pointing in different ways, ah] but their heads and hearts are so close. History will bring them together after a first, rite-of-passage parting of the ways. For the 'We Hate History In The Movies' lobby - of which I am an occasional member - the divergence process proves more enjoyable than the obligatory reunion under the skies of Mandela's dawn. Kerry Fox, who riveted attention as the wacko grown-up heroine in An Angel At My Table, plays Sophie as if auditioning for a production of the Marat/Sade. Straggly blonde hair, blanched features, insomnia-shadowed eyes: this is the face of guilt and derangement with which terrorists must pay for their felices culpae. Yet her sacrificial courage, suggests the film, in fragmenting both her own personality and her friendship bond with Thoko and Aninka helps hasten the true healing process of the close. No omelettes without broken eggs; no Utopias without broken laws. The film is too programmatic and too contrivedly cross-sectional in its distribution of main roles; also, too ready to use Sophie-style scare tactics to shock us into enlightenment. (The prison scenes are the old thump/wallop/bright lights stuff we know from a hundred Cry Freedoms). Nor does Elaine Proctor, a South African-born graduate of our own National Film School, know how to keep Thoko and Aninka's roles nourished while Sophie runs off with the prime cuts of plot. Yet Friends has life even in the midst of dramatic anorexia. The love-hate vitality Proctor puts into Sophie also energises her picture of South Africa as a land: all that sun-scorched rural beauty side by side with shellshocked urban fragility. If visual nervous energy is the first quality a young director should have - and it is - Miss Proctor's talents are well worth keeping under surveillance. African history plays a nimbler game of hide-and-seek in the Dutch comedy The Northerners. The setting is a surreal one-street village in Holland, all that survives of an unfinished housing development floating in a vast plain. Now and then the action spills into a nearby wood where, inter alia, young Thomas (Leonard Lucieer) prances about in black-face and leopard head-dress pretending to be Patrice Lumumba (the time is the 1960s) and a runaway black (Dary Some) hides out after escaping from a travelling Missionary Exhibition. If the setting is odd, the film is odd with knobs on. Writer-director Alex Van Warmerdam seems to be spinning a fable about colonialism: more exactly, about Civilisation versus the Bush. Out in the wood anarchic, savage, magical things happen: from the postman's daily campfire, heating the kettle with which to steam open the villagers' letters, to a lady in the lake, a mad huntsman and a corpse under ice. Back in the village, all is politeness, hypocrisy and net-curtain voyeurism. The white man's burden of civilised Christian behaviour brings us everything from clandestine adultery (butcher with lady clients in meat locker) to religious delirium (dying housewife tended by a come-to-life St Francis statue) to the two priests with their phut-phutting, black-smoking carnival truck containing the great missionary roadshow. The film is like a Jacques Tati comedy mixed up with bits of Coronation Street. At one moment the action will freeze for a super-sitcom tableau of neighbours in shock: the beehive hair styles lining the street to goggle at the latest Miss Rape-Victim running out of the butcher's shop. At another moment, social comedy spirals into the balletic-surreal as a nymph and swain frolic underwater, or a vulture lands on a deathbed, or a boy walks the village in ten-feet-tall disguise, using a pal as stilts. The Northerners won a deserved Felix (or Euro-Oscar) as Young European Film of the Year. Its wit, verve and nerve lie in its refusal to explain itself. It could be an allegory; it could be a comedy of provincial manners; it could be a homage to Tati. Then again it could be all three, thrown into the Magimix and spun so fast, so deftly, that the audience is left happily clutching at flavours as they fly past. No such improving exercise in Undercover Blues. Here the ingredients thrown into the blender get stuck in the blades and churned to pulp before we reach reel two. Spy thriller, comedy, baby movie, New Orleans travelogue . . . Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid are Mr and Mrs Ex-CIA Spy-person, plus tiresome tot, and Herbert Ross (Funny Lady, The Goodbye Girl) directs the fun-free shenanigans in which they become enmeshed. These include a Hispanic mugger (Stanley Tucci), a lisping policeman (Larry Miller), an eye-rolling Czech villainess (Fiona 'RSC' Shaw), a subplot about super-weapons, a - no, don't go away, I am sparing you the worst. The cited model for this rubbish was The Thin Man movies. But the PR people cannot put that one over on me: I have seen the Thin Man movies. Instead of K. Turner, D. Quaid and an underscripted infant, they had W. Powell, M. Loy and a carefully scripted dog. And they had that all-important ingredient - outstanding here by its absence - wit. But there is always revival corner. This week it offers Alain Resnais's Providence (1977) and Jim Jarmusch's Stranger Than Paradise (1984). The Resnais is a comedy of ill manners, cracklingly scripted by David Mercer. Sir John Gielgud and Sir Dirk Bogarde play father and son, putting their fingers in the mains socket of life and exchanging literate, high-voltage shrieks across the lawns of France. (Was this the first ever Euro-pudding?) Jarmusch's film is his best in a downhill-ever-since career. Three loopy young persons, two from New York, one from Hungary, wander the Eastern seaboard looking for wisdom and serenity but finding only the nearest American equivalents. Beautiful boredom; the poesy of banality; the time-space continuum of the inner mind.</p>

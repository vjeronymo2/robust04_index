			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Wheelock posts 50% gain after big exceptional sales Wheelock, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir YK Pao's listed corporate empire, yesterday announced a 50 per cent rise in profits, totalling HKDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 286m) after tax and minority interests, for the year to March 31. Until last November it was known as World International. Profits, which grew from HKDollars 1.47bn, were boosted by two exceptional items totalling HKDollars 271.6m. The bulk of this accrued from the sale of two properties, while HKDollars 113.4m worth came from the sale of long-term investments. Wharf Holdings, Wheelock's 44 per cent owned associate whose interests span property, infrastructure and hotels, remained the driving force, accounting for around 70 per cent of profits. Wheelock hopes to reduce this domination as earnings from Wheelock Property and its joint ventures come on stream. In the past eight months Wheelock Pacific, the vehicle for the new businesses, has concluded joint ventures with Climax International, a Hong Kong paper company, Virgin Megastores, Maison Mode, NatWest financial services and Foster's, the Australian brewery group. The group is to pay a final dividend of 26.5 cents(HK), compared with 21 cents in the previous year. Earnings per share came in at 108.3 cents, up 51 per cent from 71.6 cents. The consolidated net asset value of the company stood at HKDollars 20.03 per share at the fiscal year end, an increase of 70 per cent over the 1993 figure of HKDollars 11.76. Mr Peter Woo, Wheelock chairman, said the company was looking at investment opportunities of HK10bn-HKDollars 20bn a year, which could be financed by debt issues and bank financing. The company has a modest debt-to-shareholders' funds ratio of around 4 per cent. Retailing contributions were strong, with net profits from the 70 per cent-owned luxury store operator Lane Crawford increasing 133 per cent to HKDollars 362.1m, compared with HKDollars 155.1m in the previous year. However, Realty Development Corporation, Wheelock's 72.4 per cent owned property company, saw earnings slump 42 per cent, to HKDollars 634.8m from HKDollars 1.1bn.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Dewhirst rise to Pounds 2.4m DEWHIRST, the clothing group, reported pre-tax profits near-trebled for the half year to July 17 on the back of its acquisition of Slimma, which supplies women's wear to Marks and Spencer. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 851,000 to Pounds 2.4m on increased sales of Pounds 81.3m (Pounds 54.8m). Mr Tim Dewhirst, chief executive, said: 'The six months' contribution from Slimma was a substantial part of the improvement in sales and profits. Marks and Spencer now accounts for more than 80 per cent of our sales.' The company has terminated its contract with a Serbian company to make clothes for Marks and Spencer from raw materials supplied by Dewhirst. When imports from Serbia were prohibited under UN Resolution 757, the Department of Trade and Industry granted Dewhirst an import licence to get its materials back from Serbia. Dewhirst had paid more than Pounds 750,000 to Genex, the Serbia-controlled trade company, to set up the deal with the Serbian manufacturer. However, Mr Dewhirst said the sum had been paid into a London account, which was now frozen. 'As far as I am concerned the case is closed,' he said. Since acquiring Slimma for Pounds 14.1m last year borrowings rose to about Pounds 6m. That is expected to be wiped out by cash generation by the end of the year. Interest payable rose to Pounds 365,000 (Pounds 306,000). Earnings per share increased to 1.25p (0.59p) while the interim dividend is raised to 0.32p (0.29p).</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (4): Shortcuts to a portfolio of equities - Collective Investments you cannot expect to beat the market unless you put in the hours. Those who do not have the time to look after their investments will need to join with others in a collective fund. The UK's fund managers offer two vehicles for collective investment: unit trusts and investment trusts. You can buy these as part of tax-efficient packages (through personal equity plans and pensions), and products such as single-premium bonds and with-profits endowments provide collective investments for those who do not mind using part of their savings to provide life assurance. But for those interested in pure investment, the choice is between unit and investment trusts. Differences between the two are often overstated, so here are the points they have in common: Both allow small investors to buy a portion of a large portfolio of securities. This is professionally managed, for a fee which reflects a small percentage of the portfolio each year. Thus they both allow diversification  -a spread of investments to limit the risk of capital loss which comes with investing in individual equities. Each trust has a defined investment objective - for example, growth or income - and a sector in which it can invest. Trusts can restrict themselves to geographical areas, or to particular kinds of company, or to particular classes of asset. This makes it easy to use them as building blocks for a diversified portfolio. Comprehensive statistics, regularly published in the FT and elsewhere, allow investors to compare funds, and to monitor which fund managers have delivered the best performance. Those are the points in common. In other ways they differ: Unit Trusts. A unit trust is a mutually held fund, which is split for pricing and valuation purposes into units. The price of units varies with the performance of the fund - if the portfolio of shares it holds goes up in value, then so will the unit price, by the same proportion. The price of the units multiplied by the total number of units will always be equal (once the various charges are taken into account) to the asset value of the portfolio which it represents. The number of units is determined by the relative amount of buying and selling. If more units are bought than are sold (or 'redeemed') on one day, then the number of units in the fund will expand. Administration of buying and selling, plus the valuation, is carried out by the unit trust company (or its agent). Unit trusts pay out a distribution each year, which is taxed as income, although this can be accumulated within your investment. Capital gains tax may be payable when you sell. Charging includes a 'front-end' charge, of typically 5 per cent, which is deducted from the value of the investment at the outset. This is part of the 'bid-offer spread', which is the difference between the price at which you buy units (the offer price), and the price at which you sell (the bid price). This also takes account of the costs of buying and selling individual shares. There is also an annual charge which varies between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent. There are many more unit trusts than investment trusts, including trusts devoted exclusively to cash, gilts, convertibles, and international bonds - these are not exclusively equity vehicles. Investment Trusts. Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts are quoted companies, which happen to have the sole aim of investing in other companies. You invest by buying shares in the company through a stockbroker (or direct from the trust, via a savings scheme). Note that this allows complex capital structures which can have useful applications (see Z for zeros). While unit trust prices are determined by the management company, the price of an investment trust is determined by the market. The size of the fund cannot fluctuate in accordance with flows of money from investors - instead, it only moves in response to the performance of the investments it holds. This makes investment trusts 'closed-ended', while unit trusts are 'open-ended'. In general, the market will value an investment trust's share price, so that it moves in line with the performance of its underlying assets. But if demand is heavy, the share price will rise disproportionately, while it will fall if there are few buyers. Most investment trusts trade at a discount to their net asset value - in other words, the share price is such that you can buy the assets of the trust for less than they are worth. This is an attractive proposition. However, it does add an extra level of risk and opportunity. You are at the mercy of the performance of the fund managers, as you are with unit trusts, but you must also contend with market sentiment about the trust. If the discount narrows, you will gain. If it widens, you will lose. Pricing provides an argument in favour of investment trusts. All you need pay is a standard bid-offer spread, commission to a broker and stamp duty. An annual charge is taken from the fund by the fund manager. As the trust itself bears less administrative costs, the result will normally be lower fees than on a unit trust. Unit and investment trusts lessen risk. Do they deliver good performance? The total return on the FT-A investment trust index was 105.5 per cent in the five years to the beginning of 1993, according to Datastream. Over the same period, total return on the All-Share was 99.32 per cent. This out-performance can largely be attributed to a narrowing of discounts which may not be repeated. Meanwhile, the average UK Equity General unit trust, over the same period, has grown only a paltry 52.81 per cent with income reinvested, according to Micropal (note that the investment trust figure will not include all the charges payable, whereas the unit trust figure does).</p>

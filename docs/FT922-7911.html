			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Keating accused of hampering probe into alleged corruption THE FUTURE of two senior members of Australia's federal Labor government was in doubt yesterday after Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, demanded a written account of their relationship with a businessman facing criminal charges in the Marshall Islands. Separately, Mr Keating was accused by a Western Australian royal commission of hampering investigations into alleged corruption between Labor politicians and local businessmen by blocking access to tax records. The allegations mark the end of a five-month honeymoon period during which Mr Keating has increased Labor's opinion poll rating to within three percentage points of the opposition conservatives. The government trailed by 18 points when he replaced Mr Bob Hawke in December. The most serious allegations revolve around Senator Graham Richardson, the transport and communications minister, whose brother-in-law, Mr Greg Symons, is on trial for forgery in the Marshall Islands, a US protectorate in the Pacific. Mr Richardson admits meeting Mr Symons in his office, writing a letter of introduction for him, and telephoning Mr Amata Kabua, Marshall Islands president, after Mr Symons was arrested. It later emerged that Senator Kerry Sibraa, Senate president, wrote to the Australian embassy in Washington in November, urging the diplomatic service to help arrange meetings for Mr Symons with US officials. Both senators deny wrongdoing, but the affair has left Mr Keating open to allegations of protecting political allies. In Perth, Mr Tony Templeton, counsel assisting the royal commission, said investigations into the collapse of Mr Laurie Connell's Rothwells merchant bank had been limited by Mr Keating's refusal to allow access to tax records. Mr Keating said he refused access on the advice of Mr Trevor Boucher, the tax commissioner.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: ESPOSITO, FIRED BY RANGERS, GETS RAKED OVER THE ICE  </P> <P> Phil Esposito was voted into hockey Hall of Fame after a fine career with the  Chicago Blackhawks, Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, but according to Helene  Elliott of Newsday, he was ill-suited to serve as a general manager.  </P> <P> Elliott had this to say about the Rangers' fired GM:  </P> <P> "Phil Esposito leaves behind a legacy of chaos and bankruptcy in the Rangers'  organization. . . . He traded away chunks of the club's future in the 43 deals  he made, and his disastrous pursuit and dismissal of Coach Michel Bergeron was  only one example of his appalling lack of judgment. Surrounding himself as he  did with yes-men advisers who owed him their jobs may have boosted his ego, but  it did nothing to bring the Stanley Cup nearer.  </P> <P> "When Esposito assumed the general manager job in July, 1986, the Rangers were  coming off a season in which they had shocked the NHL by advancing to the  playoff semifinals.  </P> <P> "Under Esposito's reign, they exited in the first round in 1987, failed to  qualify for the playoffs in 1988 and a month ago were ushered out of the first  round by the Pittsburgh Penguins in a four-game sweep that capped a complete  collapse. His grandstand ploy of firing Bergeron with two games left in the  regular season didn't save the Rangers' season or, ultimately, his own job.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate he wasn't fired sooner."  </P> <P> Trivia: The record for the highest winning percentage in the National  Basketball Assn. playoffs is .923. Which team set it, and in what year?  </P> <P> Advice from an ex-coach: Rick Pitino, coach of the New York Knicks, has been  offered the coaching job at Kentucky and is expected to make an announcement  early next week.  </P> <P> Al McGuire, former Marquette coach, thinks Pitino should accept the offer even  though Kentucky was recently put on probation.  </P> <P> "It would be the smartest move he ever made," McGuire said. "He'll have an  extended honeymoon to settle in and get himself and his family adjusted. He's  not going to be able to really do anything for three or four years, so he can  just work on getting his horses (players) in, build the program back up and get  re-established."  </P> <P> Costas roast-to-roast: Bob Costas, at a roast for NBC football commentator Paul  Maguire, said: "As you know, Paul is not a svelte guy. Once he was standing on  a street corner wearing a blue suit and a yellow hat and three people stopped  to drop off film."  </P> <P> And: "Paul has made a tremendous impact in broadcasting. He is to the  broadcasting profession what Oprah Winfrey is to pole vaulting."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: The Philadelphia 76ers in 1983.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Gordie Howe, asked if he ever broke his nose playing hockey: "No,  but 11 other guys did."  </P></p>

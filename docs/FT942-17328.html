			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Power chief calls for review of regulators Radical changes in the way Britain's utility industries are regulated are called for today by the chief executive of National Power, the UK's biggest electricity generator. Mr John Baker wants tribunals of three to five members to replace single regulators. Writing in today's Financial Times, Mr Baker also suggests that the regulators should be brought together in a common organisation with colleagues from other industries and that their deliberations should be more open. Mr Baker's article fuels a growing debate about utility regulation. Controversy will intensify this year and next as the number of industries affected by regulation grows through privatisation of the coal and rail sectors. Regulators will also reach conclusions this summer on their reviews of water and electricity distribution industries. The results will be compared with a recent review of rates of return in the gas industry. The water review is causing acute concern among fund managers, two of who are urging water companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept severe price limits. Mr Baker compares the UK regulatory regime with that in the US and, while criticising the US system as 'burdensome' and for promoting central planning, says Britain could 'learn something from the Americans'. Drawing on US practice of regulatory commissions with three to five members, Mr Baker suggests tribunals, rather than single regulators, would remove the 'cult of the personality'. A common organisation for the various regulators would 'enable the quality of support staff to be raised and to transfer experience between industries'. Mr Baker calls for: a precise definition of the role of regulation; publication by regulators of 'strategic plans' of their objections; greater use of public hearings; and quick appeals procedures.

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell son 'used German account' MR KEVIN MAXWELL used DM1.2m last March from a German account controlled by one of his late father's secretive Liechtenstein-based trusts to pay a German lawyer and ordered the rest sent to a bank in France, a parliamentary select committee has been told. Mr Peter Phillips, of Buchler Phillips - the receivers to Robert Maxwell's personal estate - told the Commons social security committee that he had then ordered the funds sequestrated in order to prevent further diversions of funds. Mr Phillips was testifying about efforts to recover funds stolen from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. Mr Phillips, however, said that the French-based funds, which may also be claimed by liquidators for other parts of the Maxwell empire, will first be subject to German taxes, and possibly taxes in Ireland and Canada as well, leaving relatively little money available for pensioners. Indeed, he testified, less has been recovered from parts of the empire than it cost in fees to search, and so far, only Pounds 1.48m had been recovered. Of that, nearly Pounds 1m must be shared with Arther Andersen or with Price Waterhouse, liquidators for other parts of the Maxwell estate. Meanwhile, the firm has charged more than Pounds 1m in fees for itself or its solicitors, of which roughly Pounds 700,000 has been paid. A portion of that has been paid by Mirror Group Newspapers, which agreed to indemnify the firm against any costs not approved by the courts. The firm identified up to Pounds 8.7m of 'potential gross realisations', including up to Pounds 2.6m from to be earned eventually on the sale of Oxford United Football Club. The estate - whose assets may well be claimed by pensioners whose funds were stolen - has also benefited from nearly Pounds 500,000 in foreign exchange gains on assets held overseas. He said that because of strict privacy laws in Liechtenstein, it is still impossible to say whether Mr Maxwell has hidden any assets away.</p>

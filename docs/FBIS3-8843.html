			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 16 (CTK) -- Roman Kovac, who has  become Slovakia's new deputy prime minister for the non-economic  sphere, was born in 1940, and in 1963 graduated from the Medical  School of Charles University in Plzen, west Bohemia.    He was an expert assistant in a Gynaecological and Maternity  Clinic in Bratislava, and later director of the Medical Bionics  Research Institute in Bratislava. From September 1990 to March  1992 he was chairman of the Czech and Slovak Confederation of  Trade Unions, and deputy chairman from March until June 1992,  when he was elected a deputy of the House of Nations of the  former Czechoslovak federal parliament. He was then appointed  deputy prime minister of the Slovak Government and Minister of  Inspection, holding the latter post until September 1992.    In the first round of presidential elections in the  independent Slovakia, Roman Kovac was the unsuccessful HZDS  [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] candidate. In relation to  his candidacy as president, his relationship with the Communist  Party of Slovakia (KSS) came into the foreground. In 1989 he  was a Communist Party candidate, but did not become a member.  Other sources say he actually became a member but was not able  to collect his membership card before the events of November  1989.    Roman Kovac is married. His wife Lubica is also a physician,  and they have two children.    Kovac handed his resignation as deputy Slovak prime minister  in the former Vladimir Meciar's government to President Michal  Kovac on February 25, an admission of defeat in a battle with  Meciar over policy formation in the governing Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).    Roman Kovac, once Meciar's right hand man, fell into the  prime minister's disfavour when he started to express himself  independently and without warning.    Among the first signals that Roman Kovac had got into  Meciar's bad books was a letter from the district board of the  HZDS in Vranov nad Toplou, east Slovakia. The board wrote that  "we have already registered, on June 10, 1993, our disagreement  with the activities of the deputy prime minister, and we stick  by them."    In an interview for NARODNA OBRODA on December 20, 1993,  Kovac said that not only between him and the prime minister but  between him and the government there were various opinions on  the solution of problems. In the interview he also said that he  had reservations concerning Meciar's style of work in the HZDS.  An acceptable solution to the Slovak political situation, he  said, would be a wide coalition government with HZDS  participation.    The disputes within the movement culminated at the meeting  of  the HZDS Deputies' Club on February 10 in Casta-Papiernicka,  west Slovakia. This was where Roman Kovac announced the  formation of the breakaway Alternative of Political Realism,  backed by nine deputies and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik.  The Alternative proposed the formation of a broad coalition  government without political leaders including Meciar. The HZDS  National Board called an extraordinary meeting on February 12,  at which it did not express political confidence in Kovac and  Moravcik, and proposed that they be expelled from the party. It  also recommended to Meciar that they be dismissed from their  government posts.    On February 15, Meciar asked them to leave a cabinet  meeting,  and a day later wrote to President Michal Kovac proposing their  dismissal. Roman Kovac and Moravcik said they would only step  down in accordance with a presidential decision, and that they  were prepared to continue their goverment responsbilities. As  reason for their refusal to leave they said that by doing so  they would be condoning the charges which Meciar had made  against them. Nonetheless, Moravcik handed in his resignation  yesterday, as did Kovac today. "Minister Moravcik and I have  decided to made the president's decision easier, partly in an  aim to prevent the deepening of the confrontation between the  Castle and the government," Kovac said about his decision.    The HZDS Bratislava-Old Town District Board had decided by  secret ballot on February 11 to cancel Roman Kovac's membership.</p>

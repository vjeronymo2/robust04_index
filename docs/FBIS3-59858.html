			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Potatoes: Imports No Solution"] </F>   [Text] In the coming days, some 25,000 tons of potatoes  imported by ENAFLA and ENAFROID [expansions not given] will  inundate the fruit and vegetable markets. This, essentially, was  the burden of a communique Tuesday from the Ministry of Economic  Affairs saying that arrival of the foreign potatoes would  facilitate a reduction in current prices for this truck-garden  product so popular with Algerians.    Discussing the intolerable increase in the price of  potatoes--in recent days it has stood at about 30 Algerian  dinars per kilogram--the ministry communique noted that retail  prices charged by fruit and vegetable merchants are "not subject  to controls." According to the ministry communique, "only  recourse to imports could influence the market situation in  terms of normalizing prices."  <H5>  Self-Sufficiency? </H5>   Well, if resorting to potato imports was the only solution  to  the above-noted overheating, why did they wait three months to  do it? Especially since the decision was actually made on 1  August. Even back then, potatoes were selling for 20 dinars per  kilogram, and the need to flood the market to influence prices  was being felt.    Looming behind all these questions linked to the delay in  provisioning and normalizing markets is the problem of  self-sufficiency: Is Algeria actually capable of implementing a  program of potato cultivation that would meet demand? Officials  have talked ceaselessly in the last two agricultural seasons of  big projects designed to end importation of potatoes for  consumption, above all imports of seed potatoes. Looking to  external markets for food is costing our country millions of  dollars. This is why the Ministry of Agriculture has made  intensified cultivation of certain strategic crops (seed  potatoes, industrial tomatoes, certain grains, etc.) a  categorical priority.    In potatoes, for example, the stated goal was a permanent  end  to imports. However, after awhile the ministry indicated that  "the road was still long before we reach real agricultural  take-off," despite the "incentives to production" approved for  strategic crops.  <H5>  Eating Seed! </H5>   Unlike last year, when Algeria did not resort to potato  imports, we now find ourselves unable to do without them. The  skyrocketing prices, caused in large part by speculation during  the interval between successive crop seasons, could not have  been tolerated any longer. Household budgets were being hit too  hard.    But the soaring prices for this tuber, which became a  popular  dish because people of modest means could always afford it,  cannot hide the dangerous phenomenon that has become more  pronounced during this period of tension.    Seed potatoes, normally used to meet growers' needs for the  current agricultural season, have been diverted to consumption.  In the last three weeks, and in more than one case, the potatoes  that ordinary citizens were buying in fruit and vegetable  markets for 30 dinars a kilogram were actually seed potatoes,  for which the officially decreed price is 10.5 dinars.  <H5>  `Scandalized' </H5>   Reports from CASSAP [agricultural supply coopertive] in  Cheraga, COPSEM in Staoueli, and COPASSAD [expansions not given]  in Zeralda--three institutions responsible for provisioning  farmers and especially for meeting seed requirements--show that  demand for seed potatoes has been high for some time. The COPSEM  official says that unlike last year, when his cooperative was  left with 3,000 tons of unsold seed potatoes, this year--in the  early vegetable program alone--his organization has already  delivered 900 tons more than projected, without even meeting all  the demand.    Our interlocutors, while not pointing the finger of blame at  anyone in particular, declared themselves scandalized by the  idea of seed potatoes finding their way into the market stalls.    We would remind readers that our country requires about  125,000 to 130,000 tons of seed potatoes per year.    In the last two seasons, these needs were met by Algerian  produce.    This saved the country valuable foreign exchange. But if  there is not enough seed to meet the needs of the agricultural  season now under way because it has been marketed to households,  potato production may decline as a result of market pressures  over the next few months. The early vegetables program is  already somewhat behind schedule.</p>

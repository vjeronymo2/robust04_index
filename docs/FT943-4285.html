			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance near trebled at Pounds 180m - Further restructuring at Swinton will involve 64 branch closures and Pounds 8m provision Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, yesterday reported a near-tripling of pre-tax profits from Pounds 61.7m to Pounds 180.2m for the first six months of 1994. The results were in line with analysts' forecasts and continued the recovery, particularly in the UK market, seen among the other general insurers. However, there was evidence of increasing competition in the UK home and motor insurance markets, where premium income retreated 11 per cent to Pounds 443m (Pounds 501m). The company also announ-ced a further restructuring of its Swinton high street insurance intermediary, which will involve the closure of about 64 out of a total of 690 branches and a provision of Pounds 8m. The turnround in the UK overall resulted in an underwriting profit of Pounds 33m, against a Pounds 100.6m loss. Mr Roger Taylor, chief executive, said: 'This was achieved as a result of the consistent application of firm underwriting practice.' Tighter risk selection and rating measures had also contributed. The underwriting loss including Sun Alliance's overseas business fell to Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 153.1m). Premium income from the UK commercial insurance business increased Pounds 16m to Pounds 469m, although the life insurance side was hit by slack demand in the housing market and slipped Pounds 9m to Pounds 364m. Investment income, on the other hand, grew 5 per cent to Pounds 186.1m (Pounds 177.3m). Overall, premium income from general insurance increased from Pounds 1.73bn to Pounds 1.79bn. Life insurance premium income grew 13 per cent to Pounds 576.9m (Pounds 509m). The solvency margin, which measures non-life premium income as a percentage of net assets, was 56 per cent, compared with 64 per at the year-end. Net assets stood at Pounds 1.72bn, against Pounds 2.01bn. Earnings per share increased from 5.2p to 18.2p, while the interim dividend has been raised 4.8 per cent to 5.5p. COMMENT There was much to be cheerful about in yesterday's results from Sun Alliance. But, as the restructuring at Swinton shows, the company is more heavily exposed than any of its competitors to the UK insurance market, with rates beginning to soften and competition from direct sellers beginning to bite. Forecast profits of Pounds 375m-Pounds 420m mean the company could produce earnings of 41p. A dividend increase to 15.75p for the full year would give a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent. That is about average for the sector and is likely to limit any upside in the shares. However, bulls will point out Sun's traditionally high investment exposure to UK equity and property, which means the company is well placed to benefit from the continuing recovery in those market conditions.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Portillo 'trick' astonished EU Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's employment secretary, was yesterday accused of deception by the senior civil servant at the German ministry of labour over his decision to veto the European Union draft directive on part-time workers. Mr Horst Gunther, a German state secretary, told a European trade union conference on working time that the other 11 EU member states at the EU's social affairs council meeting on Tuesday had been 'tricked' by Britain into believing that it was prepared to compromise. As a result, the draft measure was watered down to try to meet British objections but at the last moment Mr Portillo astonished and angered his employment minister colleagues by refusing to accept it. Mr Gunther made it clear that Germany intended to mobilise support among the other EU member states for a further development of the EU's social dimension  - through the creation of minimum labour standards without undermining competitiveness. The German government believes this will not require a comprehensive legislative programme but will emerge through agreement on specific fields of action. Bonn is insisting that this will involve an enhanced role for European trade unions in reaching consensus deals with European employers through social dialogue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition parties commented negatively on the Greek  Presidency and the European Union [EU] summit. Correspondent  Dinos Rodhopoulos reports:    [Begin recording] In a statement, New Democracy [ND]  stressed  that the failure to elect a new European Commission president  sealed the conclusion of the Corfu summit and confirmed that the  six-month Greek Presidency was a missed opportunity, since it  developed into a presidency of simple management and concluded  with wishes and vague promises.    Government Spokesman Ioannis Venizelos described the ND  statement as a monument of ignorance, cheapness, and timidity.  He stressed that it was issued even before the conclusions of  the EU summit were announced. The spokesman noted that if ND  Chairman Miltiadhis Evert had demonstrated an elementary  national and European responsibility, he would have at least  waited to hear the statements of the state and government  leaders and would have heard about the praise for the Greek  Presidency, and the developments regarding the election of the  new European Commission president due to British Prime Minister  John Major's stance.    Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said in Rethimnon  that there has been absolutely no progress for our country in  the Corfu Summit and that the government waved goodbye to the  great opportunity it had to promote its national issues and the  problems of the Greek farmers.    In a statement, the Greek Communist Party stressed that the  Greek Presidency is tremendously and historically responsible  for the pan-European sounding of the antilabor raid that was  decided in Corfu, noting that all the antipopular, antilabor  demands of the multinational capital were approved.

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Railtrack to raise charges by 194% Railtrack, the company set up to take over the infrastructure of the national railway system from British Rail, will charge metropolitan transport authorities an extra Pounds 144m in 1994-95 for the use of lines and signalling equipment. This is the first sign of increased costs for local rail travel as British Rail privatisation takes effect, prompting warnings of cuts in services. In the past, BR charges to passenger transport authorities did not reflect the cost of infrastructure. Track charges are rising from Pounds 74.2m a year to Pounds 218.2m - a rise of 194%. Chairmen of the seven authorities - from Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands, Strathclyde, Tyne &amp; Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire - were told of the new charges by Railtrack at a meeting in London this week. Mr Dick Worrall, chairman of the West Midlands PTA, said yesterday: 'The real cost of rail privatisation is beginning to emerge and it is extremely worrying. It would have a catastrophic effect on all passenger transport authority services, particularly, rail, if we had to find this kind of extra money.' The passenger transport authorities have not been told how much it will cost to run local trains. The train companies succeeding BR have not yet calculated their charges. Railtrack's calculation of its charges follows government demands that it should make a 5.6 per cent return, rising to 8 per cent, on its assets. The government has promised to meet the extra charges of the passenger transport authorities for fiscal 1994-95, but there are no arrangements thereafter.</p>

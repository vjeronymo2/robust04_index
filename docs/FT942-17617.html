			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lethal move for small business Sir, The debate rages on in your editorial ('Late payment of bills', March 28) with regard to the need for legislation to assist the cash flow of small and many medium-sized businesses. It is perhaps likened to killing the proverbial 'cat'. Why can MPs and others who lobby not see that this action will only accelerate the demise of the small business? All the major customer will do is use a supplier (accepting, of course, that some suppliers might just have an added 'unique' product advantage built in) which tends to be more lenient with regard to cash collection. The dog-eat-dog syndrome will ensure that there are many other willing suppliers happy to fill a hole left by a conscientious objector. As for balance sheet policing, a simple window dressing exercise at the year end will resolve that. The solution lies simply in ensuring that adequate, skilled resources are applied to the management of assets. Until then, I fear, the giants will continue to hold all the cards.

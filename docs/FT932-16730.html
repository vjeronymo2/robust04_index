			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Exhibition with a mission - Lynn MacRitchie shrugs off a feeling of dismay to applaud the Whitney Biennial LOOKING at a show like the Whitney Biennial, which opened in New York last month to howls of protest, is testing for reviewer and gallery goer alike. After my first visit I came out in despair - so many voices, so many problems . . . The Biennial, however, like most large group shows (82 artists are participating), is best not taken at one gulp. It is the rushed attempt to form a convenient overview which leads to that feeling of helpless dismay, the urge to shrug the whole thing off as a gesture by the middle classes to the dispossessed, or a protest by the blacks or the gays or the feminists or whoever, got up entirely to make the rest of us, whoever we are, feel bad. But the show is none of these things. The show is what it is supposed to be, a selection of contemporary American art, fulfilling the function established for it by its founder, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, nearly 60 years ago. Whitney was an artist herself, a sculptor who produced a fine series of monumental works, including the memorial to the victims of the Titanic. When in 1931 the Metropolitan Museum in New York rejected her offered gift of 400 examples of contemporary America art, she decided to start her own museum to show them. Being the richest woman in the country made setting up a museum comparatively easy, but being an artist, committed to supporting her fellow artists in their struggles and ambitions, made the function of her museum unique. This year's Biennial, the first under the directorship of David Ross and with Elizabeth Sussman as curator in charge, has a mission. The majority of the artists chosen are engaged with political questions, specifically those of identity and community. This may be because they have been so throughout their careers - the wall collage 'Mashe Brusinski' by Nancy Spero on the subject of the identity of a young Jewish woman executed by the Nazis in Russia in 1941 comes into this category, for example. Or it may be because for many artists, such as sculptor Pepon Osorio and many others, making visible the divers cultures which inform their work has become an accepted part of the artistic process. Some have seized the opportunity the Whitney invitation provided to offer a challenge to an audience they believe to be unaware of the circumstances of their lives - the entry badges by Daniel Martinez printed with 'I can't imagine ever wanting to be white' come into this 'couldn't resist it' category. But in a museum where, its director informed me, a distinguished guest, standing next to him at the opening, was asked the way to the bathroom by another guest because he happened to be black, a little 'in your face'-ness is surely forgiveable. Other works approach their concerns with subtlety. Of the many installations in the show, one of the most imaginative is by Maureen Connor who has used lipstick to make accurate models of the voice boxes of three women. Mounted on slender stands and lit from above, these eerily beautiful sculptures are displayed in a curtained area, where the viewer may contemplate their singularity while listening to tapes of three different women making wordless sounds. Sue Williams, who paints about pornography, is not subtle, but she is powerful, and makes good use of the crude graphic style she shares with Raymond Pettibon, showing a set of drawings. His exploration of the graphics of the supermarket and the comic book is evolving into a method of dealing with the most profound issues (religion is one of the subjects of the Whitney piece) in the most direct way. This commitment to the use of 'degraded' images or the subject matter of adolescent angst, also demonstrated by Lari Pittman and Mike Kelley, is evolving into a powerful statement about American culture, pushing through the trash to the feelings  -raw, hurting, confused - beneath. An aspect of the show which may console those worried about the impact of such unusual forms or practices is the strength of its video section. First included in the Biennial in 1975, video has become one of the most satisfying of contemporary art forms. Most beautiful of a strong selection is the installation 'Tall Ships' by Gary Hill. In this wonderful piece, viewers enter a darkened space where their movements activate a series of video projectors each of which shows the image of a different person. As the viewer moves through the space, a series of ghostly figures advances and retreats. Hill's piece, which could only exist in the much maligned age of television, is beautiful, moving and profound, a tribute to an artist's commitment to a difficult medium and a rebuke to those who maintain that the new or experimental can never produce art of emotional content and formal coherence. Those flickering, wordless figures coming closer and then turning resolutely away seem to sum up the transitory nature of human encounters and the profound difficulty of ever really knowing the other - an appropriate and solemn metaphor for a show which attempts to tackle just those issues. 1993 Biennial Exhibition, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, New York, until 13 June.</p>

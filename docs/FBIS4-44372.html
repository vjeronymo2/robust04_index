			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By William Massie] </F>   [Text] Loyalist terrorists have targeted the American  ambassador to the Irish Republic, Jean Kennedy Smith.    The threat to assassinated President John F. Kennedy's  sister  emerged after phone calls between suspicious Protestant  extremists were intercepted.    In one taped conversation they discussed action against  targets in the south and in particular "that American bitch in  Dublin."    The latest threat comes amid fears of a new Loyalist terror  campaign in the south.    Mrs Kennedy Smith, 66, was appointed by President Clinton in  March last year.    U.S. diplomat Dennis Sanberg said at the Dublin Embassy:  ``There is a lunatic fringe and precautions are being taken.  The ambassador certainly appreciates the delicacy of the  security situation.    ``She, more than anyone, is aware of the dangers because of  her family.''    The presence of the Kennedy clan earlier this year at the  successful appeal of freed Guildford Four member Paul Hill  against a murder conviction angered the Loyalist community.  Hill is married to Mrs Kennedy Smith's niece Courtney.    Loyalist extremists accuse her of persuading the American  government to back the Republic's growing "interference" in  Ulster affairs.    But Mr Sanberg stressed: "The ambassador has reached out to  the Unionists at a political level and was instrumental in  arranging for James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist Party leader,  to see Vice- President Al Gore."    The British and Irish governments yesterday discussed joint  action against terrorists. MI5, RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary]  Special Branch and Army Intelligence have completed a hit-list  of around 200 "players."    They will be rounded up when the Cabinet reintroduces  internment.    But last night Irish advisers appeared reluctant to carry  out  a simultaneous sweep south of the border.    They apparently want to wait until the IRA formally rejects  the Anglo-Irish peace initiative.</p>

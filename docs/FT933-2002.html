			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Georg Fischer foreshadows net loss for full year GEORG FISCHER, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, expects to report a group net loss of between SFr30m (Dollars 21.1m) and SFr5m this year, following a depressed SFr11m profit last year. Mr Martin Huber, chief executive, also forecast at a press conference in southern Germany that sales would fall by about 15 per cent from last year's SFr2.45bn. The group, which is heavily dependent on the German motor industry, said it had made a loss in the first half, but gave no figure. Sales in the first eight months fell 23 per cent to SFr1.3bn, 18 per cent excluding divested businesses. New orders during the same period fell 18 per cent to SFr1.3bn. The group said its process of concentrating on key businesses was largely completed and it aimed to return to break-even next year in spite of recessed markets. Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the Austrian engineering group 71 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein, plunged to a first-half loss of Sch161m (Dollars 14.2m) after a Sch22m profit in the same period last year. Sales tumbled to Sch5.59bn from Sch8.13bn. The group saw no improvement in the short term.</p>

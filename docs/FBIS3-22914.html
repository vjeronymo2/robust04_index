The shouting down of General Constand  Viljoen by his own followers, the spate of explosions in the  Transvaal and [Orange] Free State, and threats of "total war"  have all been offered as portents of large-scale resistance by  the far Right.    While these developments undoubtedly reflect a hardening of  attitudes among the conservative whites -- and the willingness  of a minority to take up arms -- security analysts believe they  do not signify the start of a major terror campaign.    Instead, the analysts argue, the major rightwing groups --  the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement], the Conservative Party and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front] -- are likely to continue to  negotiate and/or use disruptive strategies before resorting to  open violence to achieve their aims.    Bill Sass of the Institute for Defence Policy says he doubts  whether the current bomb blitz -- railway lines, pylons and ANC  [African National Congress] property have been targeted in about  30 attacks since November -- directly involves the major players  "yet."    SAP [South African Police] public relations chief  Major-General Leon Mellet agrees, saying the bombings are  probably the work of small radical groupings or "cranks."    Political-risk consultant Dr. Wim Booyse argues that the  bombings to a large extent reflect the revival of  "fundamentalist" groups, of the small "brandy and Coke squads"  which were active in 1990/1991.    "Some of the individuals may be linked to the formal  right-wing but the deeds themselves are being carried out under  the auspices of fundamentalist organisations. These, we found  in the past, don't have any organisational structure. They are  two and three-man bands." Referring to recent police  breakthroughs in investigations into the attacks, Booyse adds  that he would be "very surprised" if large numbers of people  were arrested.    However, while the small groupings lack identifiable  structures and are more security conscious after the police  successes in 1990/1991, the groupings tend to be vulnerable to  police penetration. Booyse says police solved 87 percent of the  56 incidents in 1990.    When, then -- if ever -- is the formal right wing likely to  enter the fray in earnest?    Mellet says that while many conservative whites who are  disenchanted with the political process are preparing to defend  themselves, "the actual number of people prepared to take up  arms and start a war is few." He adds: "On the other hand, you  take the IRA. They're only about 300-strong. You don't need an  army to cause trouble.    "A lot of these people are also ex-military people and you  can't ignore that fact.    "One can expect an increase in acts of sabotage and terror  attacks ... I think they can cause enough trouble, but I don't  think they have enough to ensure the election won't take place."    Despite the probability of a Freedom Alliance election  boycott, Sass says the major right-wing groupings appear to have  written off the election as "political action between the NP  [National Party] and ANC to put themselves in a better  position." He says: "The next step is to keep making their  point, making their emphasis with the future government. I  don't see a sudden escalation (in right-wing violence). What we  are seeing now is not just because of the election -- it's going  to continue past the election."    Booyse and Sass suggest that a real showdown could be  delayed  as long as five years after the election -- when the  Constitution has to be implemented -- and then only if the  formal right wing is not accommodated politically.    Sass says that even before resorting to bloodshed, the Right  -- because many of its supporters are farmers, miners and  electricity supply workers -- has the ability to severely  disrupt the country. Although collective campaigns involving  white labour unions and agricultural unions -- and possibly the  Right's Freedom Alliance partners -- would be difficult to  organise, they "could come later."    If the Right threw its full weight behind a concerted  sabotage campaign, the results could be very costly for the new  government. On the strength of the various right-wing  para-military formations, Sass says, the AWB could have as many  as "5,000 or 6,000 trained men," a relatively well-organised  logistical line and, significantly, strong community support.    On the other hand, the more significant of the smaller  paramilitary groupings would be able to deploy "tens or maybe  hundreds" of combatants.    In terms of weapons, the organised right wing would have 9  mm  pistols and shotguns in abundance and "probably quite a few  AK-47s, R-4s and R-5s," Sass says. Also, because of strong  support from white miners, they would have access to "a fair  amount of commercial explosives."    All told, they would have adequate quantities of weapons to  wage a terror campaign, but not enough to take on the new  government.    Booyse echoes this view, saying that although the Right  would  have the ability to carry out a sophisticated IRA-type terror  campaign, it would lack the resources to wage low-intensity  guerilla warfare.    Despite concerns about the extent of right-wing support in  the SADF [South African Defense Force], Sass dismisses the  prospect of a coup attempt -- in the short term -- by the  generals who are currently negotiating the new National Defence  Force with the ANC. However, he says sympathetic SADF members --  particularly in commandos in the rural areas where the right  wing has strong support -- could break ranks if there was a  major reaction on the part of the ANC against the Right "or if  they perceived whites in general were under threat."</p>

The Duma's activity will be supported by 677 full-time  staffers, not including technicians. In addition, faction and  deputy group apparatuses are to be manned by 132 people, along  with the 386 support personnel approved for the Duma's  committees and commissions.    The Duma's apparatus is to have the status of a legal  entity.  It was suggested that the Duma chairman continue working on the  formation of the apparatus in accordance with the chamber's  structure.    It was resolved that workers in the parliament's lower  chamber will be considered equal to comparable workers in the  apparatus of the Russian Federation Government in terms of  salary, and social, material, and medical support.

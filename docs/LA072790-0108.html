			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL GAMES;  </P> <P> THEY HAD THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN TRACK AND FIELD  </P> <P> The name that Ted Turner gave five years ago to his pseudo-Olympics, Goodwill  Games, could not have been more appropriate than Thursday night in track and  field competition at Husky Stadium.  </P> <P> In the men's 400-meter relay, an event traditionally dominated by the United  States, it appeared as if Cuba might score a major upset.  </P> <P> Cuba's anchor man, Joel Isai, had a two-meter lead when he received the baton  and looked like an easy winner until he began to tighten up, enabling U.S.  sprinter Dennis Mitchell to nip him at the tape.  </P> <P> The four Cubans thought they won and, arm in arm, excitedly began a victory  lap.  </P> <P> Midway around the track, they stopped to watch the television replay on the  scoreboard and realized that they finished second. Their time was 38.49,  four-hundredths of a second behind the United States' 38.45. Those are the  second and third fastest times in the world this year.  </P> <P> Having also seen the replay, the U.S. team began its victory lap. Isai waited  for the Americans, and when they arrived, raised Mitchell's hand triumphantly  and helped him wave a small American flag.  </P> <P> Also in the spirit of good will, Soviet hammer throwers swept the medals but  wished nothing but the best for their U.S. competitors.  </P> <P> Said silver medalist Andrei Abduvalyev, "I wish the American hammer throwers  would throw farther so we could come over and compete more."

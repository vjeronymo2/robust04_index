			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Daewoo to set up its own car 'supermarkets' Daewoo, South Korea's second-biggest carmaker and the world's 33rd biggest business group, is to sell its cars direct in the UK from its own 'supermarket' sites - complete with cafes and qualified nannies to look after prospective buyers' children - starting in March. Daewoo's Pounds 150m experiment to eliminate independent dealers, using a network of 30 'Vision 2000' superstores backed by 100 wholly-owned or leased service and used-car sales centres, is believed to be unprecedented. It is not unusual for a manufacturer to own some of the outlets in its dealership network. But most are independently-owned and the conventional car distribution business is thus structured to achieving profits for both parties. Daewoo appears ready to mount a significant challenge to traditional car retailing by stripping out a profits tier, using the scale economies of its operating systems and taking advantage of its purchasing muscle. Mr Leslie Woodcock, managing director of Daewoo Cars, the wholly-owned subsidiary, refused yesterday to give any details of the pricing policy Daewoo will pursue when its Nexia and Espero hatchback and saloon ranges go on sale next March. But Korea is an efficient car-making country with much lower costs than Japan. Motor industry pay rates are about Dollars 8 (Pounds 5) an hour compared with Japan's Dollars 32 and the Korean won has yet to rise sharply against western currencies in the same manner as the yen. The Retail Motor Industry Federation said yesterday: 'We shall watch what Daewoo does about pricing with great interest. Will it mean, for example, that they won't get into dealing - offering discounts on their list prices. Will it mean that the sticker price on the windscreen is the end of the story?' Daewoo has set a target of selling 20,000 cars a year in the UK by 1997, about 1 per cent of the new-car market. Mr Woodcock said the UK venture would create nearly 2,000 jobs over three years. The Nexia competes in the Ford Escort-sized sector and the Espero in the medium-to-larger-sized sector. Letters, Page 18</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Greek ferry operator in cash call Strintzis Lines, Greece's largest private ferry operator, plans to raise Dr5.7bn (Dollars 23.7m) in what will be the first flotation of a shipping company on the Athens stock exchange. The company, which controls an Irish ferry line as well as its Mediterranean operations, wants to diversify in preparation for deregulation in European Union coastal shipping at the end of the 1990s. Strintzis will increase its capital base by 25 per cent, issuing 4.08m new shares. The company will use 60 per cent of funds raised to buy a new ferry for its fleet. The remainder will provide long-term working capital to finance future expansion, including the acquisition of a high-speed ferry. Strintzis operates eight medium-size ferries on the Ionian crossing between Greece and Italy and through the Cyclades islands to Mykonos and Santorini. The new ship will be used on the Ionian crossing, where Strintzis has increased its share of truck traffic by 40 per cent in the past year. Year-round traffic on the Ionian crossing has increased sharply in recent years. The company last year acquired Swansea Cork Car Ferries, which operates a daily crossing between Wales and Ireland, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Strintzis Lines Ireland Strintzis expects pre-tax profits to total Dr2.5bn for 1993, a 51 per cent increase on 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Pact for Italy leader Mario </F> Segni in Rome on 15 February: "Pact for Italy Leader Explains:  `I Am Not Acting Out of Stubbornness'"--first paragraph is LA  REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- Mario Segni's press conference started an  hour and a half late, and barely lasted 10 minutes. The  journalists were outraged: Did it make any sense to convene  them just to read out five lines and then run away? Segni  listened with some embarrassment to the journalists' protest  before being swallowed up into the nonstop meeting with the  Piazza del Gesu [Italian People's Party headquarters] bigwigs.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So then, deputy Segni, have you reached an  agreement?    [Segni] We are going ahead with determination and  conviction,  putting forward the Pact for Italy electoral lists. We are  going ahead in the belief that we must offer the country a  European political platform, which is modern, moderate, and  reformist. This evening, or at the latest tomorrow morning  (this morning -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), we will complete  the process of choosing the candidates. We are committed to  ensuring that they represent a profound renewal, and that there  will be nobody among them who may still have to settle accounts  with the law. In my capacity as the coalitions's candidate for  the premiership, I will express an overall opinion on the  composition and the drawing up of the lists.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So you are going ahead?    [Segni] Policymaking is always a difficult business.  Attempts to reach broader agreements are often defined as  "wavering," whereas standing firm on a principle is called  "stubbornness." We are not wavering and we are not being  stubborn. I have always had the country's interests at heart.  It is those same interests which are now guiding my actions.  We must get down to work with the greatest determination,  because the future of our country depends on the results we  achieve.    [LA REPUBBLICA] What about names?    [Segni] I do not wish to go into the details, as far as  names  are concerned. When the lists are drawn up, we will see the  results, and then you will be able to judge for yourselves.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Why are you encountering so many  difficulties, however?    [Segni] The difficulty lies in defining the principles,  detailing the rules, deciding on the candidacies. We have not  yet mentioned any names, and I do not wish to mention any now.  However, I am sure that the PPI will follow criteria of  openness and political clarity.</p>

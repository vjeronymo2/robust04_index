			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Turkey aims for higher success rate TURKEY IS taking steps to ensure a higher success rate in its privatisation programme. In May, the government plans to offer to the public all or part of its 49 per cent stake in Netas, the telecommunications company, and further sales are expected over the summer. Mr Ustun Sanver, chairman of the Prime Ministry Public Participation Administration (PPA), told fund managers in London yesterday that the PPA intends to avoid the supply/demand imbalances created by past privatisations through the use of underwriters, and if necessary, by cancelling sales if investor interest is too low. In response to foreign investors' complaints of a lack of liquidity in privatised stocks, as well as inadequate prospectuses, Mr Sanver said that the PPA is prepared to provide stock directly to investors if none is available in the stock market, and that documentation on future privatisations will be upgraded.</p>

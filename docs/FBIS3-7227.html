			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced on 25 March a  "new program for international cooperation" showing its plan for  purchasing automobiles and auto parts made in European nations  and the United States. According to the program, it plans to  purchase $4.3 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal  1997 (up 80 percent from fiscal 1992). On expansion of import  of finished automobiles, it said that "we are ready to accept  auto manufacturers' request to expand purchase of their  automobiles and we can ask domestic dealers--which also deal in  foreign-made automobiles--to increase their sales efforts for  imported cars." Following the failure in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks in February, each of the major auto  manufacturers has started considering working out its own plan  for purchases of U.S.-made automobiles and parts. Nissan is the  fist manufacturer to officially announce its own purchase scheme.    "The new program" is a revised version of "the international  cooperation program" announced in 1989 and 1991, and it is  mainly composed of: 1) an automobile production plan in the  United States, Mexico, and European nations, and a parts  purchase plan; 2) an auto parts import plan; and 3) a plan to  cooperate with foreign auto manufacturers in promoting importing  finished automobiles.    As for the U.S.-made automobiles and parts, Nissan, by  taking  advantage of its plan to produce new model of "Sentra" (known as  "Sunny" in Japan] at U.S. Nissan Motor Manufacturing Company  (NMMC), plans to increase the amount of purchases of U.S.-made  parts needed for assembly and repairs to approximately $3.4  billion in fiscal 1997 ($1.95 billion spent in fiscal 1992) on  the assumption that the NMMC is fully operational and produces  approximately 450,000 Sentras.    Moreover, Nissan plans to import over $9 million of worth  U.S.-made parts and materials in fiscal 1997 ($4.4 million in  fiscal 1992) on the assumption that Nissan produces  approximately 1.8 million autos a year in Japan.    When (then) President Bush visited Japan in January 1992,  Nissan set $3.7 billion ($2.9 billion for purchases in the  United States and $800 million for import) as its U.S.  automobile parts purchase goal for fiscal 1994. In this  connection, the actual amount of purchases of U.S.-made parts in  fiscal 1993 is likely to reach $3.3 billion.    Meanwhile, Nissan intends not to get itself directly  involved  in campaign for the promotion of sales of imported automobiles.  However, at the request of foreign manufacturers, it plans to  ask its "keiretsu" dealers to handle foreign-made automobiles.  Such Nissan-affiliated dealers in Kanto and Kansai districts as  Tokyo Nissan Sales Dealer have announced their plans to deal in  U.S. Ford- made automobiles from 1994.    In the announcement of its new program, Nissan said that "we  have judged that private-sector efforts will lead to preventing  international trade friction," thus indicating a stand of  drawing a line between its own program and a package of  market-opening measures being worked out by the government.    Moreover, Nissan stressed "there may be a change in the  target figures described in the program if assumed preconditions  are not met."</p>

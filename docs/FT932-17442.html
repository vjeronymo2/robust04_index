			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Trade News: US fury over piracy by Taiwanese A COALITION of leading trade associations in Washington is demanding sanctions against Taiwan unless it shows 'with specific actions' its intention to control its 'staggering levels of piracy' of copyrighted works, videos, compact discs and computer software. The International Intellectual Property Alliance, which represents more than 1,500 companies, claims US copyright industries lost a total of Dollars 669m in Taiwan last year through piracy. Mr Fritz Attaway, a senior vice-president of the Motion Picture Association of America, accused Taiwan of lacking 'the political will' to enforce an anti-piracy pact, signed with the US last June. If sanctions were imposed on Taiwan, they would fall under the Special 301 section of the 1988 Trade law, which requires the US trade representative to compile an annual list of countries which allow the highest levels of piracy and designate them as 'priority foreign countries'. He then has 6-9 months to negotiate agreements before retaliating. This year's list is due to be published on April 30. Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate trade subcommittee, said Thailand, along with Taiwan, was a candidate for the 'priority' list. Bangkok pirates had been 'one of the most egregious offenders'. Now they were 'scrambling up the technological boarding ladders to raid new industries and plunder new products'.</p>

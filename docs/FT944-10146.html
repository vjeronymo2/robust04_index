			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Burton jumps High street retailer Burton Group was one of the day's most active stocks as the market celebrated a robust set of annual figures from the company. Turnover at the close stood at a hefty 21m and the shares climbed 7 1/2 to 71p. Burton reported profits of Pounds 41.1m, up from Pounds 16.3m, and maintained the final dividend at 2p. Brokers upgraded current year profits forecasts, and joint broker BZW was said to have weighed in with a sharp increase of Pounds 15m to Pounds 70m. However, BZW was unavailable for comment. A rival broker said: 'There is a lot of comfort in these figures. For one thing there are no nasty surprises. It seems as if things are beginning to get back on track. We must now wait to see how the trends that have emerged this year develop.' The favourable sentiment in Burton also boosted Next, which added 5 at 247p.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [INTERFAX item: "Ukraine's Debts to the CIS Have Exceeded </F> Three Billion Dollars"]    [Text] The general volume of Ukraine's state foreign debt  to the CIS countries as of March 1994 amounted to 3.426 billion  dollars [$]. (Including $2.703 billion to Russia, $693 million  to Turkmeniya, $28 million to Moldavia [Moldova] and $1.3  million to Kazakhstan.) Aleksey Berezhnoy, chief of the  department of foreign debt for the Ukrainian Finance Ministry's  currency-economic administration, reported this.    He noted that in 1994, according to an intergovernmental  agreement, they plan to pay nearly $1.5 billion (including $421  million to countries of the far abroad, $668 million to Russia  and $359 million to Turkmeniya) although at the present time  Ukraine does not have available the hard currency funds in the  amount which would allow it to service its foreign creditors.    Mr. Berezhnoy remarked that this year payment of the debt to  Russia included the basic debt and interest in accordance with  an intergovernmental agreement. As regards the debt to  Turkmeniya, it is a result of the unbalanced import of energy  sources for Ukraine's enterprises and agriculture.    It is expected that by the end of the year the centralized  hard currency funds, the amount of which today does not exceed  $1 billion, will increase to $1.3 billion due to profits from  exports according to state contracts. According to forecasts of  Ukraine's Ministry of Economics, the general profit from exports  will amount to $20 billion by the end of the year. However, the  same amount of expenditures on critical imports is planned (in  1993 Ukraine was able to ensure receipt of only 20 percent of  the predicted profits from exports). In the opinion of experts  from Ukraine's Ministry of Economics, the debt problem can only  be solved after the resumption of trading in freely convertible  currency in Ukraine's interbank currency market and the  liberalization of foreign economic activity.    According to Mr. Berezhnoy's information, the republic  government is currently reviewing a draft Ukrainian-Latvian  agreement which is also supposed to determine the amount of  Ukrainain debt to Latvia for 1993.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TAX CUT AIDS RICH, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The lion's share of benefits from cutting capital gains taxes would go to  people who report gains year after year, not those whose incomes are boosted  once in a lifetime by the sale of a family farm or business, congressional  analysts said today.  </P> <P> The new report from the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation rebuts a key  Bush Administration argument for the reduction and provides new evidence for  Democrats who view a capital gains cut as a windfall for the rich.  </P></p>

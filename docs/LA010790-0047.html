			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OHIO;  </P> <P> CULT SLAYING SUSPECT STILL BEING SOUGHT  </P> <P> An eighth suspect in the reportedly sacrificial slayings of a Kirtland, Ohio,  family of five turned herself in, but the self-styled prophet who led the  religious sect involved in the crime remained at large.  </P> <P> Sharon Bluntschley, 31, formerly of Kirtland, turned herself in to police at  Bay City, Mich., officials said. In addition to the cult leader, Jeffrey  Lundgren, authorities were seeking his wife, their 19-year-old son and two of  his followers. The remains of the slain family, including three daughters, were  found last week buried in a barn on the northeast Ohio farm where Lundgren and  the religious commune lived until last April.  </P></p>

			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / CIS energy talks collapse Talks on the signing of a multilateral treaty to help the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and east European states exploit their energy resources have been suspended until June because of the inability of CIS members to commit themselves to the agreement, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The treaty will underpin the European energy charter, a political declaration which was signed in December by nearly 50 states, including European Community members, the US and Japan. The charter aims to encourage investment, and aid regeneration of the east and central European economies.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko: "Russians in Estonia"] </F>   [Text] In these notes I am simply relating what I was told  in numerous conversations in Tallinn by so-called  "representatives of the Russian-speaking population" of Estonia.  I will not give the names of the people I spoke with, because I  do not want to create additional problems for people who are  already sufficiently well-known. I will stress, however, that  these people were not "extremists," but completely loyal  residents of the republic: Most of them are citizens of Estonia  (and consequently are not experiencing these difficulties  personally) and some even acquired this status through a special  procedure for the extraordinary services they performed for the  young state.  <H5>  "They Cheated Us Again!" </H5>   Minister of Nationality and Population Issues Peeter Olesk  recently commented on the resurgence of tension in Estonia. He  was right: There could be an explosion, because they cheated us  again. During the arguments over citizenship, we told the  "internationalists" not to be ridiculous: The "zero option" was  unacceptable to the Estonians and incomprehensible to the West.  In the final analysis, Estonia was regaining its statehood with  an alarmingly skewed demographic tendency: Before the war 8  percent of the population was Russian, but now Russians  represent 38 percent of the total. All we wanted was for each  inhabitant who had a permanent residence permit prior to July  1990 to be granted the status of a permanent resident. This  status would secure virtually all of the necessary rights and  all forms of social protection.    Here is what we achieved: The law on foreigners stated that  everyone would receive a residence permit, but one word was left  out of the text--permanent. The result was a  procedure by which each non-citizen would first receive a  temporary residence permit and the right to apply for permanent  resident status in three years. At that time officials could  either approve or deny the request. What is even worse is that  according to the published regulations, the present temporary  document will expire on 12 July 1995. At that time non-citizens  will have to apply for a new temporary permit, and whereas  Estonia promised to issue the present document to everyone, it  can be selective in issuing the next. If they catch a "temporary  resident" in an intoxicated state, they will have grounds for  denying his application. For that matter, the government could  decide that the country does not need that many temporary  residents....  <H5>  Return My Property </H5>   More than 600,000 of the 1.5 million people in the republic  are Russian-speakers. The Estonians believe that this poses a  threat to the very existence of their nationality: It could be  diluted to the point of its complete disappearance. They say  that the proportional number of Russians should be reduced to a  more acceptable 25 percent of the population. They encourage  "Estonization"--requiring the non-Estonian spouse in a mixed  marriage to take the Estonian surname. This was already the case  in the years between 1932 and 1938, when a person had to have an  Estonian name to get a job. Many of today's prominent Estonians  are the descendants of people who changed their names (for  example, Foreign Minister Juri Luik). For this reason, the  suggestion that the Russians represented only 8 percent of the  population before the war is a myth.    [Boxed item: "The goal of Russian policy is not armed  intervention. The Russians have economic ambitions. They want to  buy economic property of strategic significance through  figureheads and then demand maximum rights for all of the people  living here" (Tiit Viahi, chairman of Tallinn Municipal  Assembly, DEN ZA DNEM, 28 April 1994).]    The official slogan of the campaign--the suggestion that the  Soviet Union pursued a policy of Russification in Estonia--is  also a myth. The Soviet Union had no demographic policies at  all, including a Russification policy. It pursued a policy of  assistance in the economic development of outlying regions. The  Estonians, who are conformists and are loyal to the existing  government, joined the "socialist competition" for the highest  indicators of regional industrial development. Estonfosforit was  turned into an industrial giant at the request of the Estonian  Government, and so was Dvigatel, the New Tallinn Port, and  Estonslanets--all in response to local initiatives. The  industrial giants needed manpower, and the Estonians themselves  did not want to work in industry, transportation, or  construction.    According to one theory (not all of the people I spoke with  agreed), the movement to "get rid of the Russians" had no  political aims in the beginning. It was simply that the  Estonians were frightened by the growth of the Russian-speaking  intelligentsia, which had begun to strive for secondary, if not  primary, positions in public administration, science, and  culture.    There is a suspicion that the present move to turn all  non-citizens into temporary residents of the republic is based  on purely materialistic motives. During the three years it will  take the Russians to acquire the status of permanent residents,  all property in Estonia will be privatized, and the republic  "pie" will be divided up among a million residents instead of a  million and a half. The establishment of a non-state economy  will be completed during those years. Today the "Russian  Estonians" are stronger than the ethnic Estonians in the  economic sphere, but the opposite will be true in three years.  <H5>  Miscalculations </H5>   Estonia began pursuing its stringent economic policy with  this slogan: We will suffer for a while and we will endure, but  "they" will not be able to take it and they will leave. Special  sociological surveys confirmed that eight out of ten Estonians  were still in contact with relatives in the countryside, which  would help them survive the hard times. Only one out of every  four Russians had connections of this kind. No one, however,  expected the state of the Russian economy to undergo such rapid  deterioration.    Only 80,000 people left in two years. According to  projections, the same number of "Russian-speaking residents"  will leave the republic in the future. The rest have nowhere to  go. The main problem is housing, and buying a home will be  almost impossible even for those who manage to sell a home in  Estonia: Apartment prices in Tallinn, for example, are only  one-fourth as high as they are in Moscow.    [Boxed item: "The issue of ethnic minorities is still  unclear  to many people. Only a handful of people in Estonia can  categorize themselves as members of ethnic minorities. The rest,  according to international law, are immigrants. If we continue  to stress this fact, Russia will have no more arguments in  defense of its minority...." (Mart Rannut, director of Language  Department, DEN ZA DNEM, 28 April 1994).]    These prices are likely to drop again in the near future.  The  last military troops are expected to leave soon (making 1,500  dwellings available), and there is a plan to force the veterans  out--leaving another 10,000-12,000 apartments vacant. This will  not change the demographic situation in the republic, but as a  result of its efforts to get rid of the "dead weight," Estonia  is now losing the most highly skilled segments of its labor  force: The people who are leaving are those who can expect to  find good jobs elsewhere. The youngest and most confident  individuals are moving to the West, and the others are heading  east. The people who are staying are those who are not needed  anywhere else.    Meanwhile, the rate of unemployment in the republic is  rising, primarily in "Russian" production areas. As a result of  this, the crime rate is also rising. The northeast has become a  high-crime zone. Police records indicate that thefts are not  confined to valuables. Thieves are stealing food out of  refrigerators and cellars. The transfer of non-citizens to the  category of temporary residents could make them ineligible for  unemployment benefits, and this could lead directly to a life of  crime.    The lumpenization of the Russian-speaking population is  being  fostered by the quick transition to the "official state  language": The number of Russian schools and classes is  decreasing, and instruction is being offered only in the  Estonian language in tekhnikums and in vocational and technical  institutes as well as in higher academic institutions.  Difficulties in obtaining an education or training in a special  field are helping to turn Russian-speaking youths into criminals.  <H5>  Russian Policy: Just Imagine!... </H5>   At the end of last year Pavel Grachev suddenly announced  that  he was stopping the withdrawal of troops from Estonia. Everyone  here, however, saw the continued departure of one echelon after  another. Recently there was another such statement: The troops  will not be withdrawn! But there are no more troops in Estonia.  Estonian radicals are quite pleased with these announcements: We  have an enemy in the East! The National Independence Party holds  demonstrations--with picketers holding up signs saying "Russians  Go Home!"--each Monday in front of the headquarters of the naval  base, where the remaining staff consists of only around 15  officers. The admiral sitting in the headquarters building gets  extremely irritated.    This is certain to affect the Russian community in the  republic. The next parliamentary elections will be held in a  year, but the campaign has already begun. Many parties and  politicians are building their campaigns around the "enemy  image" of Russia. The logical extension of this is the  suggestion that the Russians in Estonia are the enemy within.  They are even using a new term to refer to the Russians: the  civilian occupation.    There are many things Russia could have done. If it had just  pursued a more or less consistent policy toward the Baltic  countries, or if Russia had used its authority to influence the  European countries when Estonia wanted to join the Council of  Europe, so that this membership could have been conditional upon  several factors--this would have been fully in accordance with  international standards. Instead, just two days before the  ceremonial act, after everything had already been decided,  Andrey Kozyrev made a fiery speech. He had his say, Estonia was  accepted as a member anyway, and the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs fell silent again.    There is so much that Russia could do without interfering in  the internal affairs of other states: It could offer legal  assistance or legal reviews of the legislative instruments and  administrative ordinances pertaining to the Russian-speaking  population. After all, the Russians here have a problem: There  are no experts in international law! They can sense that an  inhumane legal instrument has been passed in violation of  international law. They can say that it is a violation, but they  cannot say exactly why it is a violation. When the delegation  from Russia at the talks with Estonia was headed by Sergey  Shakhray, he would state his objections in the most precise  terms, saying that something was in violation of a specific  article of a specific document, and no one could argue, because  he was an expert!  <H5>  Economics and Politics </H5>   Russia took the wrong approach to the Baltic problems from  the very beginning. One of Boris Yeltsin's advisers came to  Tallinn, brushed our questions aside, and made this promise:  Everyone owes us money, he said, and Estonia owes us 7 billion  rubles. It will give us the union enterprises in payment of the  debt, and everything will be as it was before! This aroused a  wave of protests in the republic: Even if the government had  wanted to make concessions to Russia, it could not do this any  longer. Estonia had to apply to the West for credit, but it did  pay its debt to Russia.    After this, Russia even had difficulty buying a mineral  fertilizer plant in Estonia--even on the most beneficial terms  for Estonia. There was a time when Russia could have taken the  metallurgical combine in Sillamae "under its wing"--becoming a  shareholder on the strength of its raw materials (the combine  had always worked with raw material from Kazakhstan and the  Urals). This is a city with 20,000 inhabitants, and almost half  of them were employed by the combine. If Russia had done this,  they would not be living in a state of almost total unemployment  today and they would have kept the Russian schools and cultural  centers open. Instead of living like parasites, they could be  respectable individuals and taxpayers and would be defending  Russia's strategic interests here.    Instead of this, Russia decided to support the Estonian  middlemen who were sending Russian nonferrous metals to the  West: If an Estonian and an Estonian Russian applied to a  Russian official for an export license, the Estonian was more  likely to receive preferential treatment.    [Boxed item: "I think Mr. Peeter Olesk--minister of  `nationality and expulsion issues'--and Mrs. Marju  Lauristin--minister of social `ills'--should ask the government  to consider establishing a special ward in some hospital for  people who have been driven to distraction by the government and  the inhumane laws, so that they could come to terms with life  with a physician's help. Civilized countries have hospitals of  this kind for cancer patients, but we should have them for  people in a completely hopeless situation" (from a letter by  Z.S. to MOLODEZH ESTONII, 28 April 1994).]    Today the "troubled waters" that once offered such lucrative  fishing opportunities no longer exist. This means that the  Russian immigrants in Estonia have an even more critical need  for Russia to pursue a reasonable protectionist policy. Transit  shipments through Estonia, for example, should be handled by  Russian firms, which would be willing to do excellent work even  with a lower profit margin as long as they could have long-term  contracts. These firms would spend part of the profit on social  programs to aid the Russian-speaking population. The Business  League in Estonia and the Estonian-Russian Business Chamber  could aid in finding these partners and in monitoring the  fulfillment of obligations.    In fact, a relationship of this kind is already being  established with Moscow because of the policies of the pragmatic  Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov. This could serve as a model of relations  with other countries that were once republics of the USSR. After  all, there are Russians (or "Russian-speakers") everywhere  today, and the attitude toward the ethnic Russians would change  if people could see how diligently Russia can support its  "fellow-countrymen"....</p>

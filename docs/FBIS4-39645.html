			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 8 June TASS -- According to information  received from Russian naval sources, the main problem of the  two-day negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian  delegations, which began today in Kiev, is to divide the bases  and coastal infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet.    The Russian delegation is led by roving Ambassador Yuriy  Dubinin. He arrived in the Ukrainian capital together with  Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy.  The admiral told ITAR-TASS on the eve of the trip, that the  sides were able to switch over during their talks in Moscow and  Sevastopol from verbal declarations to the concrete discussion  of the difficult problem of drawing up a complete list of all  the warships and other surface craft, and deciding where the  Black Sea Navy and the Ukrainian naval forces should be based.  This work will be continued in Kiev. He noted that the  parameters, according to which the warships should be divided  between the two sides, were already been determined. Working  parallel with military experts are economists and financiers,  who are estimating the cost of the ships and of the fleet's  infrastructure. Their conclusions will be submitted to the two  delegations.    Gromov believes that both sides will table their own drafts  during the negotiations. He does not rule out differences on  individual matters, but believes that it is necessary to do  everything to achieve mutual understanding.</p>

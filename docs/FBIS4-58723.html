			<p>BFN     [Text] The JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY's Arab affairs editor  has said that the United Nations has failed to implement any of  its resolutions against the racist Israeli entity that occupies  Arab Palestine and other Arab territories. The editor pointed  out that the so-called Security Council has passed roughly 50  resolutions on Palestine. Most of them have been calling for  the withdrawal of the Israelis from the occupied Arab  territories, be it southern Lebanon, the Golan, or others.  However, none of these resolutions have ever been implemented;  they have been rejected by the Israelis who showed them contempt.    The Arab affairs editor wondered why the United Nations has  not implemented any of its resolutions regarding the racist  Israeli entity saying: Why has the United Nations not returned  the territories of those Arab states that happened to be UN  members. These territories were seized by force by the racist  Israelis who decided to annex them and change their demographic,  cultural, and political character--a matter that has contravened  recognized norms. The editor also indicated that the Israeli  entity has exploited the UN failure to put pressure on those  concerned Arab parties. It obliged these parties to recognize  Israel's racist and alien existence in exchange for its  so-called withdrawal from the Arab lands that it has occupied.  This condition constitutes an insult to the Arab countries  whose land has been occupied. The Arab affairs editor concluded  his comments by saying that real peace would not come to the  region except with the return of the Palestinian people to their  land and homes, the departure of the Israeli invaders and their  return to where they came from, and the establishment of a  democratic state in Palestine. Without this, peace in the  region will remain delusion, fantasy, and unrealistic.</p>

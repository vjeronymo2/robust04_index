			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Warning that EU fisheries deal could be imposed The government appeared last night to be preparing for a European Union fisheries deal with Spain and Portugal which opposition MPs claim will outrage the UK fishing industry. Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, warned the Commons that a deal might be imposed by the EU fisheries council in Brussels on Monday, in spite of British and Irish objections. The government also announced that legislation restricting the number of days on which fishing vessels can put to sea has been suspended following a court challenge by fishermen. The High Court has referred the so-called 'days at sea legislation' to the European Court. The government refused to confirm that a Pounds 25m decommissioning scheme designed to help trawler owners leave the industry will continue after next year. Mr Jack said ministers wanted to reconsider all the options for meeting fishing quotas set by the fisheries council. The issue is complicated by the requirement for a decision by the end of this year on a EU fisheries regime to replace the transitional arrangements for Spain and Portugal. The existing regime, which expires in 1996, has assisted UK fishermen by limiting access to territorial waters for Spanish and Portuguese vessels. British ministers have argued that overall controls on catches must be increased to compensate for the impending relaxation of the restrictive regime. Only Ireland has given strong support to this position, raising fears that Britain will be outvoted. Opposition MPs urged the government to abandon the days-at-sea legislation, and guarantee the future of the decommissioning scheme to help reduce the British fleet. Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, said: 'This decision was another botched opportunity. What the industry needed was a clear-cut decision that days-at-sea restrictions had gone for good.' He added that the government's refusal to guarantee the future of the decommissioning scheme was 'petulant.' The suspension of the days-at-sea rule strengthened the case for an enhanced decommissioning scheme. Argentine anger, Page 28</p>

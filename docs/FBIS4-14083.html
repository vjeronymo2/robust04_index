			<p>BFN     [Text] The former president of Afghanistan, Professor  Sebghatollah Mojaddedi, called on the president, Mr. Farooq  Ahmad Khan Leghari, in Islamabad today. During the meeting, he  held wide-ranging discussions with the president. Speaking of  prospects of peace in Afghanistan, President Leghari emphasized  that this will have to be an indigenous process, as anything  imposed from outside would never last. The president also  expressed the hope that developed countries would not wait for  complete peace to begin reconstruction work in Afghanistan.  Prof. Mojaddedi thanked the president for his noble sentiments  and affirmed that he would make every effort to bring to an end  the fratricidal struggle in his country.</p>

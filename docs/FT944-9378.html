			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Abbey National boosts direct line Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, is to expand its telephone finance operation by an extra 250 jobs in the next three years. Mr Peter Sunderland, director for direct distribution, said customers would be offered financial services by telephone from March next year. The first 50 jobs would be advertised this week. The new jobs will be based in Glasgow, where Abbey's life insurance division is located, and will take the number of Abbey staff in the city to more than 1,500. The existing Abbey National Direct operation employs 90 people in Bournemouth and can handle 250,000 telephone calls a year. Although Abbey has had a telephone operation since 1989, it has focused on mortgages and related products. This move should allow it to offer a wider range of life insurance, investment and pensions policies on the telephone. One area of expansion could be general insurance, when Abbey's joint venture with Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, starts next year. The group emphasised, however, that it saw the telephone business as an extra service for customers rather than as a stand-alone operation. Abbey's move comes as competition intensifies in telephone banking and financial services. Last week Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, took a further step towards offering life insurance when it was accepted by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor.</p>

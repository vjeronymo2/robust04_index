			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Obituary: Interventionist with a zest for action Lord Kearton, who died last week at the age of 81, was one of the outstanding industrialists of the postwar era. As chairman of Courtaulds between 1964 and 1975, he drove the company forward from its base in fibres into fabric and apparel manufacture, and in the process reshaped the British textile industry. His influence extended to other industries, particularly through his chairmanship of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the 1960s, and British National Oil Corporation in the 1970s. To all these posts - and to many other part-time roles in both public and private sectors - Frank Kearton brought a zest for action and a readiness to seize opportunities. It was these qualities which transformed Courtaulds from a respected but declining member of the British business establishment into a vehicle for dynamic growth. Some of the growth was ill-conceived. It might even be said that Kearton saved Courtaulds and then nearly destroyed it through over-expansion. The problems which he bequeathed to his successors, compounded by the severe recession and overvaluation of sterling in 1980-82, were formidable. Yet Kearton gave Courtaulds new life, broadening the range of businesses which the company could do well. Born in 1911, Christopher Frank Kearton was educated at Hanley High School and at St John's College, Oxford, where he took a first class degree in chemistry. Despite earlier thoughts of becoming an academic, he joined the oil-from-coal project at ICI's Billingham works, and was later involved in the production of aviation gasoline for the second world war. He was invited to join the Anglo-American nuclear weapons programme, and worked on the fuel enrichment side of the project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He rejoined ICI briefly after the war, but in 1946 he was recruited by Courtaulds to head the chemical engineering department. Six years later he was appointed to the board and played an important part in the more expansionist strategy that began after 1957. Kearton was closely involved in the merger with British Celanese, Courtaulds' main rival in rayon, in the development of Courtelle acrylic fibre and in Courtaulds' diversification into paint and packaging. But it was the bid from ICI in 1961 which galvanised Courtaulds into a far more aggressive set of policies and put Kearton into the driving seat. A press conference held by Courtaulds to explain its attitude to the bid began with introductory statements from the deputy chairman and other directors. Then, as D C Coleman, historian of the company, described the scene: 'Kearton took over and began more and more to dominate the conference. It was an egocentric performance with plentiful use of the first person singular, but it was also vigorous, assertive, fluent and confident. He laid about ICI . . . He threw facts and figures about with cheerful abandon and some inaccuracy. He raised laughs, bubbled with ideas and was the total antithesis of the old, stuffy Courtaulds.' Seeing off ICI was one thing. Devising a strategy for profitable growth was quite another. Courtaulds was over-dependent on a declining group of wood-based fibres, viscose rayon and acetate; its principal customer, the Lancashire textile industry, was extremely weak. Diversification, both in the newer synthetic fibres and away from textiles, had been seen as a priority before the ICI bid. But after the bid the urgent need to secure outlets for fibre impelled Courtaulds into a hectic programme of taking over spinning, weaving, knitting and garment-making companies. As Arthur Knight, Kearton's successor as chairman, later wrote: 'At no stage was the objective of Courtaulds becoming a fully fledged vertical group (from fibres through textile manufacture to garment-making) explicitly enunciated, and an account in retrospect of the development makes it all seem much more logical than it appeared while it was going on.' Vertical integration was a reaction to events - the threatened disappearance of a large part of Courtaulds' UK customer base - and Kearton plunged into it with characteristic verve. Was this strategy correct? Courtaulds seemed to have no alternative if it was to safeguard its fibres business. But Kearton assumed too readily that managers brought up in capital-intensive fibre production could adapt quickly to the fashion-sensitive and shorter-term requirements of the downstream industry. There was an optimistic be-lief that competitive success could be won by throwing management and money at the problem. With hindsight it might be said that Kearton approached the textile industry's problems from the wrong end. Retailing was central - and one of Kearton's errors was to try to build up Courtaulds as a counterweight to the retailers. He resented the domination of Marks and Spencer; he wanted to call the tune himself. What also proved to be wrong - again with the benefit of hindsight - was the idea that Courtaulds could become a low-cost, high-volume supplier of standard textile goods to the rest of Europe. The climate of the l960s favoured large-scale mergers, reflecting an over-simplified diagnosis that British industry was too fragmented to compete effectively in world markets. Appropriately enough, Kearton was chosen by the Labour government to chair the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (IRC), which helped to bring about some of the biggest mergers of the late l960s. Kearton's commitment to active state intervention in industry made him a natural choice, under the next Labour government, to head the British National Oil Corporation - a post which he took on after retiring from Courtaulds in 1975. Supported by the then energy minister, Mr Tony Benn, Kearton was not content with a passive role in the North Sea, monitoring developments on behalf of the government. After the transfer to BNOC of Burmah Oil's North Sea assets, Kearton's team was soon completing the Thistle field as operator and building up its own exploration programme. The Thatcher government saw no place for a state-owned oil company, but Kearton's retirement from BNOC enabled him to start a third career as an active member of the House of Lords, a dedicated chancellor of the University of Bath, and a participant in numerous committees and institutions connected with industry, technology and education. As a businessman, Kearton was a breath of fresh air in the staid ranks of British industrialists. He was unusual in combining scientific distinction with entrepreneurial flair; to this was added remarkable stamina and a fierce will to win. His enthusiasm was infectious, especially among younger colleagues. He had an extraordinary capacity to absorb and retain information, and a readiness to deploy it selectively in support of whatever point he might be making. He could be a formidable, even ferocious opponent, but he showed unswerving loyalty and friendship to those who worked with him.</p>

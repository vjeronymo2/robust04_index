			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Luxembourg (DPA) -- The Western European Union  (WEU) has decided to admit the six Central European states and  the three Baltic countries as "associated partners." The  foreign and defense ministers of both sides want to adopt the  relevant documents in Luxembourg on Monday [9 May].    "In this way, we have come far closer to the objective of a  pan-European peace policy," FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  stated in his speech, which was publicized in advance.  Meanwhile, Russia shows understanding for the extension of the  WEU to East Europe, he said.    The new associated status is granted to Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and the three  Baltic states. Thus, the associated partners will be able to  attend WEU Council meetings at regular intervals in the future.  Moreover, they get the opportunity to participate in  humanitarian and combat missions. The East Europeans will not  get a security guarantee.    FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed in Luxembourg  that  Germany will do everything to create "legal and real  prerequisites" for future WEU missions. This also includes the  rescue of European Union citizens from places such as Yemen or  Rwanda.    Kinkel announced that Bonn is basically prepared to  participate in the development of satellite-assisted  reconnaissance of the WEU states. However, the FRG Government  has not yet made a final decision. Without such reconnaissance,  which the United States ensures in NATO, the combating of crises  by the WEU is hardly conceivable. The costs will probably be  substantial, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

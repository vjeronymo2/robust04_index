			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Company News This Week: Oil price weakens Elf's last figures before privatisation - Other companies Elf-Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group which is slated for privatisation, will announce its provisional results for 1993 tomorrow. Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman last August, has already warned that profits will see a sharp fall from FFr6.2bn (Pounds 710m) to just over FFr1bn. The decline reflects the weak oil price, the write-down of certain oil assets and Mr Jaffre's desire to clean up the group's balance sheet ahead of Elf's privatisation, which is due to be launched later this month. Chrysler: The US car manufacturer is expected to report strong fourth quarter figures tomorrow. The domestic car and light truck market is enjoying solid growth, with sales up 8 per cent in 1993, and Chrysler has been faring particularly well thanks to a strong line-up of new high-margin vehicles. Its December sales were up 7 per cent on 1992 and were its strongest for the month in five years. Forecasts of fourth quarter earnings per share range from Dollars 1.37 to Dollars 1.90, with a mean around Dollars 1.60. Volvo: Shareholders will elect a new seven-man board on Wednesday, following the clear-out that accompanied last month's collapse of the planned merger with Renault. Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish operations of Asea Brown Boveri, is expected to be confirmed as chairman, with Renault chief executive Louis Schweitzer also gaining a seat. Nominations to all seven posts have been made by shareholders accounting for at least 40 per cent of Volvo's votes and are unlikely to be opposed. Gestetner Holdings: The UK-based office and photographic equipment distributor is expected to announce full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 38m on Thursday after taking a Pounds 48.3m provision at the interim stage, mainly to cover the restructuring of its European operations. The results will be the last before Inchcape, the international services group which bought 15.3 per cent of Gestetner in May, must decide whether to exercise its option to acquire convertible unsecured loan stock, enabling it to lift its stake to 24.6 per cent. The exercise price on the option, which expires on July 1, is equal to 172p a share - well above the current 140p level. Photo-Me International: The world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator is likely to show first-half pre-tax profits little changed from last year's Pounds 10.5m, when it reports tomorrow.</p>

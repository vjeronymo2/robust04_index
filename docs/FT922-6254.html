			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / MoD denies being forced to remove Ulster brigadier THE MINISTRY of Defence insisted yesterday that the removal of a senior Army commander in Northern Ireland was 'an unfortunate coincidence' unconnected with the recent controversy over the actions of paratroopers in County Tyrone. The decision to relieve Brigadier Tom Longland of his duties as commander of the Armagh-based 3 Brigade was taken before the incidents earlier this month in Coalisland, the MoD said. The brigadier, who had completed only five months of his two-year posting, was replaced last Wednesday. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told BBC Radio's Today programme: 'I am quite clear in my own mind that the incidents which took place in Coalisland were not relevant to that particular decision.' In spite of Mr Rifkind's words, Northern Ireland politicians were united in seeing a connection between the brigadier's departure and the incidents. It is likely to be raised in today's plenary session of the talks that resumed earlier this month between Northern Ireland party leaders on the political future of the province. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said he suspected the brigadier had come into conflict with the police over their primary role in maintaining security. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said it was unfortunate that the brigadier's removal would be seen as a result of pressure from the Irish government. The Army is awaiting the outcome of police investigations into the two Coalisland incidents, in which members of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, allegedly rampaged through bars and, in a subsequent clash, fired shots into a crowd, injuring three people. A junior officer in the battalion was suspended from duty after the first incident. The battalion is due to leave Northern Ireland shortly. It was sent in April on a temporary basis to replace one of the reinforcement units deployed in the province after an outbreak of violence late last year.</p>

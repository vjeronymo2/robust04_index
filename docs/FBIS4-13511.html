			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On at least five separate issues Israel and the  PLO have now reached agreements at their talks in Cairo.  [passage omitted]    The chief Israeli negotiator, Amnon Shahaq, spent the  morning  in Jerusalem, completing a round of consultations before  returning to Cairo.    Under the agreement on water, the Gaza Strip and settlements  will get their supplies from the Israeli Meqorot Company. The  Palestinian autonomous authority which is to pay for the water  it gets from Israel has also undertaken to maintain quality  standards. Details were given by the chief Palestinian  negotiator, Nabil Sha'th.    Norway and the PLO are trying to persuade the World Bank to  finance projects in Gaza and Jericho regardless of the progress  of the peace talks. Palestinian negotiator Sa'ib 'Urayqat and  Norway's UN ambassador are concentrating their efforts to raise  funds in the United States for sewage, medical, and other  projects for the autonomy period.    Israel is insisting that industrial concerns in the  autonomous areas comply with ecology standards. The request,  originated by Israeli industrialists, was put to the  Palestinians at the multilateral committee meetings on the  environment. One of the Israeli concerns is that pollution will  be caused by the unsupervised flow of sewage into a nearby  aquifer or a natural underground water reservoir.    We have just received a report from Cairo. It is in fact  Jamil al-Tarifi, the head of the PLO's committee for civilian  matters. He is speaking to Moti Amir in Cairo about agreements  the two sides have reached so far:    [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] We finished the whole  negotiations at civilian committee, and we already agreed about  all the papers, and we transfer the whole authorities to the  Palestinian national authority.    [Amir] How many issues?    [Al-Tarifi] It's 38 issues, and we already finished it  yesterday, at 0400 morning.    [Amir] Including the water?    [Al-Tarifi] Including the water, including everything.    [Amir] And you are satisfied about the water? It was a long  discussion yesterday.    [Al-Tarifi] Yes. It's not only the water. Many issues took  long discussions. The water -- we have the full authority on  Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and we have the right to  development our resources and to drilling our wells. In the  meantime, the wells inside the settlements is under the control  of Meqorot Company, but we have to know exactly how many wells  they have. And, we have to know, in monthly basis, how many  cubic meters they will pump from these wells. [end recording]</p>

He said the  embassy always takes precautionary measures but Thai police have  not assigned extra reinforcements to guard the embassy.  "Reinforcements are at the discretion of the police," he said.    The embassy is located in Soi Langsuan. Police suggested  earlier in the day that the explosives could have been designed  to avenge the massacre last month at Hebron on the West Bank.  "But it could be the embassy was selected at random. The  incident may be connected with the problems in the South.  Whatever it is, the result could have been a major disaster,"  he added.    The embassy has reported the finding of the explosives to  Jerusalem. "This is standard practice in these circumstances,"  he said.</p>

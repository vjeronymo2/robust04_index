			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Cigarette advert curb backed PRESSURE on the government to ban cigarette advertising intensified yesterday when the cross-party Commons health committee supported the move. The committee urged the government to support proposals to restrict tobacco advertising to points of sale when they are considered by EC health ministers later this year. It said that if Britain dropped its opposition, it would require the support of only one more country for a directive banning advertising to be adopted. 'The government cannot continue to procrastinate on the issue of an advertising ban on the grounds that it is awaiting a level of proof about its effectiveness which is in the nature of things unobtainable,' said the committee. Yesterday's report was widely welcomed by organisations campaigning for a ban. The British Medical Association said the committee's acceptance of evidence that tobacco advertising increased tobacco consumption - a disputed issue - was a 'victory for common sense'. But the Tobacco Advisory Council, the industry's trade association, said the report leant 'too heavily on data which are seriously flawed, muddled and unsubstantiated'. Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York, is to introduce a private member's bill next week calling for a ban. Observer, Page 19</p>

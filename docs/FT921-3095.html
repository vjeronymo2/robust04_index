			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rockwell to take Dollars 1.5bn charge ROCKWELL International, the US aerospace and automotive group, is to take a Dollars 1.5bn charge against net income to cover the cost of moving to a new accounting standard for retired employees' health benefits. All US companies have to adopt the new accounting method by early next year. Many leading corporations have already announced plans for multi-billion dollar charges. Rockwell said it would take the charge in the second quarter, ending March 31, and would restate its first-quarter figures. The restatement would mean a net loss for the first quarter, and for the full 1992 fiscal year. Mr Donald Beall, chairman, said the group did not see any significant improvement yet in its markets. It expected earnings per share in fiscal 1992 to be about 15 per cent below 1991's total of Dollars 2.57, before the special charge. Mr Beall had previously restricted himself to saying that because an economic turnround had not materialised, it would be increasingly difficult to match 1991's figures. The company earned Dollars 600.5m in the year to September 1991, on sales of Dollars 11.93bn, and Dollars 123m on sales of Dollars 2.56bn in the first quarter of the current year.</p>

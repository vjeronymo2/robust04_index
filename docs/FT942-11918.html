			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Formula 1 safety meeting follows deaths An emergency meeting to consider Formula One safety has been called for tomorrow by the world governing body of motor sport, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), after the deaths at the weekend of grand prix drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger. The move to ascertain as quickly as possible the precise causes of the double tragedy came as tributes were paid around the world to Senna, the 34-year-old triple world champion from Sao Paulo. Mr Itamar Franco, Brazil's president, has declared three days of national mourning for Senna, who died of head injuries on Sunday when his Renault-Williams car left the track at 180mph during the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola. Austrian driver Ratzenberger was killed 24 hours earlier when his MTV Simtek Ford left the track near the same spot at similar speed during practice. The FIA said last night that tomorrow's meeting in Paris would examine technical, medical, safety and supervisory staff reports, as well as take evidence from team and circuit personnel. By last night, no firm evidence had emerged of the cause of either fatality, Mr Max Mosley, FIA president, said. Defending rule changes imposed by the FIA which this year have outlawed electronic driver aids, such as traction control to prevent wheelspin, Mr Mosley said there was nothing to link the accidents with the technology ban. Grand prix drivers are to make their own reassessment of the safety situation at a meeting before the Monaco grand prix in two weeks' time. Ford and Renault, both major engine suppliers to leading teams, last night supported calls for a further safety review. An indication that grand prix racing may now face a period of public controversy came with a strong attack by the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano. High-powered decisions ahead, Page 15</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC WASTE PLAN RISKS FARMLAND, SUIT ALLEGES  </P> <P> The Sierra Club and a grass-roots environmental group filed a lawsuit Wednesday  alleging that hazardous-waste management plans pushed by the state will turn  rural, farming counties into dumping grounds for urban toxic wastes and  industrial poisons.  </P> <P> The Tulare County Superior Court suit said Tulare County supervisors violated  the California Environmental Quality Act in approving a hazardous-waste  management plan on May 16.  </P> <P> Attorney Bob Wright, who filed the suit in Visalia on behalf of Visalia-based  Citizens for a Healthy Environment and the Sierra Club, said agricultural  Tulare County could be turned into a "dumping ground" for toxic wastes from the  Silicon Valley and Los Angeles. He said such wastes should be taken to remote  desert areas, not farming communities where ground-water protection is vital.  </P> <P> "We don't want to see the urban areas dump on us," said Marcie Williams,  president of Citizens for a Healthy Environment. She said two hazardous-waste  companies now want to build disposal sites in her county and others may follow.  </P> <P> At the core of the lawsuit is a dispute over "fair share" language in the  county's hazardous-waste management plan regarding how much toxic waste  smaller, rural counties can be required to take from big, urban counties.  </P> <P> Tulare County supervisors adopted "fair share" language pushed by the state  Department of Health Services.  </P> <P> The County Supervisors Assn. of California has proposed alternative "fair  share" language supported by 42 of the state's 58 counties.  </P> <P> Pam Milligan, legislative analyst for the supervisors association, said her  group's language gives county governments more control in determining whether  hazardous waste dumps are built in their areas.  </P> <P> Tulare County and adjacent Kings County are the only counties supporting the  state's "fair share" language. However, Health Services Department officials  have vowed to veto any "fair share" language proposed by the supervisors'  association.  </P> <P> Under recent legislation by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-El Monte), all of the  counties in the state must develop hazardous-waste management plans and most of  them must be submitted by September.  </P></p>

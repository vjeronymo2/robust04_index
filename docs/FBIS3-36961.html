			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by Enrique </F> Serbeto in Kiev; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Serbeto] How do you believe  Ukraine is viewed from Spain?    [Zlenko] Well, we have no pending problem with Spain. I  believe that we are on very good terms. Spain's embassy is  working very well in Kiev, and we are considering setting up our  embassy in Madrid, and this will be one of the topics of  conversation [during Zlenko's visit to Spain], since we hope to  do so in the course of this year. We have many joint  enterprises which are making their way in trade, and we hope  that this process will be accelerated with the treaty of  friendship and cooperation which we will sign and with President  Leonid Kravchuk's visit, for which we will also be preparing  during these days. Ukraine has been independent for two years,  and has already established relations with many countries,  including Spain. Now it is necessary to begin with the legal  basis of our relationship, and this treaty represents a very  real step toward our relations' embodiment in law.    [Serbeto] One of things which link Spain and Ukraine is that  both countries are keeping troops in the former Yugoslavia.  What is Kiev's stance on the possibility of a decision to  launch air strikes in Bosnia in order to support the Blue  Helmets' work?    [Zlenko] Ukraine believes that all possibilities of a  negotiated solution should be sought, and through an overall  view. It seems to us that the embargo against Serbia and  Montenegro is creating a terrible situation in which only the  children, who have no medicines, and the civilians, who are now  beginning to have problems in feeding themselves, are suffering.  I believe that this is creating bitterness and very great  resentment among people who could believe that they now have  nothing to lose, and so we would be fostering an uncontrolled  reaction which could go beyond the Balkans and perhaps extend  throughout Europe. I therefore believe that we should study the  possibility of scaling down the blockade in return for being  able to extend the humanitarian action to Serbia as well.  People who do not eat and are desperate are capable of anything.    [Serbeto] Would Ukraine withdraw its troops if the United  Nations had recourse to retaliation by air?    [Zlenko] Spain contributes 1,200 troops to the UN  peacekeeping forces, who are on the spot like the Ukrainian  troops. We do not want an escalation or an internationalization  of the conflict, because our troops and the Spanish troops would  become hostages of this situation.</p>

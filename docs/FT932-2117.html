			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Macedonia gains time to resolve row over name GREECE and Macedonia have been given another three months by the United Nations to solve their dispute over finding a new name for the former Yugoslav republic, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The two countries are expected to hold direct talks on the issue as well as on confidence-building measures that will guarantee Macedonia access to the Greek port of Thessaloniki, its nearest outlet to the sea, and allow Macedonian citizens to visit Greece. Because of their respective leaders' domestic problems, Greek and Macedonian officials last month agreed at secret talks held in parallel with negotiations at the UN to reject a UN compromise proposal on the name, according to diplomatic sources. The UN's new September deadline grants a breathing space both for Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, and President Kiro Gligorev of Macedonia, who is under pressure from his country's nationalist faction not to compromise on the name. Mr Mitsotakis faces such stiff opposition from his New Democracy party over the government's economic policy that his one-seat parliamentary majority could be overturned if he agrees to 'Nova Makedonija', the name proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance, the former UN mediator. Both Mr Mitsotakis's party and a large section of the Greek population object to the neighbouring republic's use of the name Macedonia on the grounds that it implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of the same name. There is less urgency on Macedonia's part to resolve the dispute since its admission in April to the UN under a temporary name, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, ended more than a year of diplomatic and economic isolation.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / House price fall triggers Halifax warning on rates Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, yesterday reported the biggest monthly fall in house prices for 12 months and warned the government not to damage the fragile housing market by raising interest rates. Halifax said UK house prices fell on average by 1.6 per cent during May, compared with the previous month. It is the second month in succession that the society has reported a price fall. In April, prices fell 0.3 per cent. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst with stockbroker UBS, said yesterday he was halving his forecast for house price increases in 1994 from 7 per cent to 3.5 per cent after the Halifax survey. 'This is a serious wobble on the road to recovery,' said Mr Wriglesworth. Halifax, which previously had forecast that house prices would rise on average by 5 per cent this year, says it now expects smaller increases, possibly of 2-3 per cent. Tax increases which took effect in April and a rush to complete purchases ahead of the ending of fixed price mortgages which caused a bunching of sales earlier this year, were the most likely causes for the decline, it said. The latest falls mean the average price of a home of Pounds 62,728 has remained static over the previous 12 months. It is the first time since August 1993 that the Halifax has not reported a year-on-year price rise. Only three months ago, in February, Halifax reported a year-on-year increase of 3.8 per cent, the highest annual increase since November 1989. In a clear warning to the government, it said concern that inflation might be returning, particularly asset price inflation, had been 'greatly overblown'. 'Any moves to raise interest rates, tighten fiscal policy or mount a further attack on housing market subsidies would risk destroying a very fragile recovery.' Signals from the housing market, however, remain mixed. Average prices for new homes, for example, rose by 0.6 per cent last month, according to Halifax. Housebuilders, are estimated to have increased sales by 10-15 per cent during the first five months of this year. Halifax's latest survey also conflicts with a study by Nationwide, the country's second largest building society, which reported on Wednesday that house prices had risen by 1.4 per cent in May compared with the previous month. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, warned: 'Recent indicators of market activity have been mixed. The underlying strengthening of the market which began in the spring of last year is likely to be maintained but progress is steady rather than spectacular.' The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the revised 1994 forecast for house prices by Halifax was in line with its own assessment of the market. Mr Wriglesworth, in spite of reducing his 1994 forecast, believed the market would bounce back this month. Houses were the most affordable for many years, and mortgage interest rates low, he said.

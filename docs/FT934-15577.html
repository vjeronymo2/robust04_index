			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gormly gives up top job at Trafalgar MR ALLAN GORMLY will next year step down as chief executive of Trafalgar House when he is expected to take a more prominent role at Royal Insurance, where he is a non-executive deputy chairman. Trafalgar, the construction, engineering and shipping group, is planning to announce the move in the next few weeks. Mr Gormly's departure is not expected to take place until the middle of next year. Mr Gormly will remain on Trafalgar's board and is likely to be succeeded by Mr Nigel Rich, who retires as managing director of Jardine Matheson in March 1994. Mr Rich is expected to take an extended holiday before returning to the UK. Hongkong Land, controlled by Jardine Matheson and which has a 25.3 per cent stake in Trafalgar, has tightened its control over the UK construction and engineering group. Earlier this year Mr Simon Keswick was installed as chairman and Mr David Gawler as financial director. However, Trafalgar said yesterday that relations between Mr Gormly and the Keswick family, who control Hongkong Land, remained very good. Trafalgar's financial year ended on September 30 and the results, to be announced on December 14, are expected to show a loss. Mr Gormly is one of the last surviving board executives before Hongkong Land took effective control at the end of last year. He was previously chairman of the company's engineering division.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's corporate  investment in foreign countries in the first quarter amounted to  466 million U.S. dollars, up 250 percent from a year earlier,  according to the Finance Ministry. The sharp increase was  attributed to greatly relaxed rules governing foreign  investment. The manufacturing sector accounted for 70 percent  of the amount, and trade, transportation, construction and  fisheries the rest.    North America was the top investment market for South Korean  industries, representing 46 percent, or 214 million dollars,  thanks to brisk investment in computer parts factories in the  area. Asia placed second with 32 percent and Europe third with  19 percent. Investment by small- and medium-sized businesses  also increased 55 percent from the same quarter of last year,  indicating that small-amount overseas investment was steadily  increasing.</p>

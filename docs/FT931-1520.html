			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fuji Heavy sees Y4bn deficit FUJI Heavy Industries, the Japanese car manufacturer, yesterday revised down its forecast for results to the year ending this month, and now expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y4bn (Dollars 34.7m), writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. This compares with a previous forecast of Y1bn pre-tax profits and would mean the third consecutive year of losses. Sales for the year are expected to be Y870bn, instead of Y900bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 20 (AFP) -- The European Community  tried here Thursday [20 January] to lower the temperature of a  subsidy row between British Airways and Air France, insisting  that British criticism did not amount to a formal complaint.    A spokeswoman for the EC's executive European Commission  said  that British Airways criticism about allegedly illegal state aid  for state-owned Air France had been made in response to an  existing EC inquiry.    She contradicted reports that British Airways had lodged a  new complaint.    The privately-owned British Airways called on the Commission  Wednesday to demand that Air France return a capital injection  of 1.5 billion francs (253 million dollars) extended in the form  of a bond issue and other securities.    The EC's executive had already begun a probe of the  injection  last November on the grounds that it might contravene  regulations against state aid which distorted competition and  would not be granted by private investors.    Air France has maintained that the bonds were taken up under  normal market conditions, largely by an affiliate of the Caisse  des depots et des consignations (CDC), a state-owned institution.    British Airways has been campaigning against further  government aid for loss-making state-owned European airlines.</p>

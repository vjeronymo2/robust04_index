			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Random Talk on Economic Life" by staff reporter Wang </F> Yantian (3769 1750 3944): "Let Work Force Enter the Market"]    [Text] The "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed "reforming the labor  system and gradually establishing a market for the work force."    How did the "labor market" change into a "market for the  work  force"? Is there any difference between the two?    A market for work force is a new employment mechanism.  Instead of adopting administrative means to directly control  the distribution and flow of the work force, the state will  allow enterprises to independently employ workers and the  workers to chose their employers.    The biggest difference between a market for the work force  and a labor market is that the former is a new type of  employment mechanism while the latter is merely a labor or  information exchange.    Zhejiang's Wenzhou, one of the cities in China which took  the  lead in developing a market economy, also marched ahead of  others in developing a market for the work force. Wenzhou  implemented an "enterprise staff system" in 1992, regarding all  employed laborers in the city as enterprise workers. The  ownership of the enterprises where they worked could be  different, but the workers enjoyed the same status, irrespective  of their positions. All kinds of enterprises could issue rules  for employment in the market for the work force. When the  workers are employed, they only have to go through the  procedures of signing the contract and insurance. Workers could  also flow between enterprises of different ownership, with the  approval of both sides. They only had to transfer their  insurance at the social insurance office.    The administrative departments here no longer exercised  direct control over distribution of laborers or restricted their  identity. The workers enterprises wanted and the jobs the  workers looked for were all realized through market competition.  This is the basic characteristic of employment in a market for  the work force.    In the market for the work force, the flow of workers is not  conditioned by ownership. Instead, it is guided by wages  (influenced by the price of laborers). Beginning from 1992, a  "reverse flow" of laborers appeared for the first time in  Wenzhou since the founding of the PRC. In two years, more than  3,000 workers from state and collective enterprises resigned and  found jobs in township, individual, and private enterprises.  One of the reasons is that they were "better paid there."    Some people were not willing to go to individual and private  enterprises because "these enterprises merely took care of the  young but not the old." Retirement pensions were an essential  condition related to social insurance for developing a market  for the work force. In view of this, Wenzhou implemented an  integrated social insurance system commencing in 1991. Laborers  employed in Wenzhou, whether they belonged to state, collective,  neighborhood, township, private, individual, or foreign-funded  enterprises or were self-employed workers, all joined the social  insurance and employment insurance plan. By paying the same  amount of premium, they enjoyed the same retirement pension.  Because of this, some 200,000 salesmen from Wenzhou went to  other parts of the country while around 400,000 people came to  Wenzhou to look for jobs.    The development of a market for the work force will  exert a great influence on labor reform and economic structural  reform as a whole. It will also have an impact on people's  sense of employment and value.    The formulation of a market for the work force will exert a  significant and far-reaching influence on China's labor reform.    The conference of heads of the labor departments and  bureaus,  a high level meeting on the country's labor work, held in  December 1993, proposed for the first time that reform of the  labor system as a whole should focus on nurturing and developing  a market for the work force. In the reform of the labor system  in the past, the development of a labor market constituted only  part of the work.    China's largest special economic zone, Hainan, enjoys a high  degree of freedom in employment, and was once a "popular place"  for employment. The Hainan Provincial Government promulgated a  document in 1992, which clearly stipulated: Competent  government departments will no longer assign quotas of cadre  employment, staff recruitment, technical title assessment, and  wages and promotion. These problems will be resolved by the  employer and the employee at the labor exchange. To develop a  market for the work force, an official of the Labor Ministry  said, competent government departments must change their  functions and reform their organs and working methods. Hainan  has taken a lead in this regard.    The development of a market for the work force is required  for deepening enterprise reform. In turn, it also promotes  deepened reform and a change in enterprise operation mechanisms.  To let enterprises enter the market, it is necessary for them  to independently recruit staff and implement a unified social  insurance system. To practice a new employment mechanism, it is  also necessary for enterprises to accelerate reform of the labor  system, such as implementing the all-personnel labor contract  system, optimizing labor combinations, removing the demarcation  line that separates cadres from workers, introducing  distribution reform, and letting society absorb redundant  personnel.    To develop a market for the work force, an increasing  number of people will have to get their jobs through competition  and very few will be able to find jobs through mandatory orders.  Naturally the mentality of urban people having a secure job and  the sense of instinctive superiority of state enterprises should  change gradually. In employment, the principle of distribution  has been replaced by the principle of competition and the  phenomenon of "sharing secure jobs" has been changed to "vying  for a secure job." People's sense of employment and value will  change along with the development of a market for the work  force, and the earlier they adapt themselves to the new  employment mechanism, the earlier they can gain the initiative.    An economist said: A foreign businessman asked him about  Chinese officials, who are called servants while the workers,  masters. But the officials sit in cars while the workers drive.  How come the master drives for the servant? The economist  replied: The status of master refers to the working class as a  whole, not a specific individual. This story tells us that  foreign people do not understand China's national conditions.  However, it reminds us that the problems which crop up in  reform should be resolved by more work and fewer disputes rather  than arguing first about the truth. The formulation of a market  for the work force will exert influence on concepts at the  deeper layer. We need the spirit of doing more work.    A market for the work force is complicated system  engineering. The Labor Ministry predicts that the embryonic form  of a modern market for the work force will need seven years to  take shape.    The development of a market for the work force can  breakthrough the demarcation line between urban and rural areas  and allow free flow of laborers. It is a piece of good news for  surplus laborers in rural areas because they can enter the  cities. Nevertheless, such a situation will not likely appear  within the near future. This is because the the work force  market has just started and it is still at the initial stage.  Moreover, it is impossible for China's urban areas to absorb  large numbers of surplus rural laborers at present. Hence, it  is a relatively long-term objective.    Development of a the work force market is complicated system  engineering which includes the whole course of laborers seeking  jobs, introduction, signing contracts, employment, terminating  contracts, reemployment, and retirement. The establishment of a  new employment mechanism of free selection of staff and  employers involves reform of government functions, and social  insurance, distribution, personnel, and household registration  systems. However, the deepening and completion of these reforms  cannot be done overnight.    There are difficulties at least in the following five  respects for the development of the market for the work force at  present: While selecting a job, laborers are still restricted by  status and ownership, state enterprises still cannot  independently employ workers, the main redundant personnel are  not brought into line with social settlement, and a certain  number of personnel are placed by the state; in income  distribution and wages, total payroll of a considerable number  of state enterprises is still under administrative control and a  new enterprise wage increase mechanism has not yet taken shape;  in social insurance, there is a lack of a unified management  system and the coverage and its extent of socialization are  limited, which cannot meet the needs of enterprises entering the  market and flow of the work force; market regulations are still  imperfect and there is a lack of means for maintaining market  order; and in macroeconomic control and regulation, methods of  control and regulation that can meet the needs of a market for  the work force have not yet taken shape.    The extent of the comprehensive and corresponding reforms  determine the development of a market for the work force. Labor  Minister Li Boyong had the following views on the prospects for  a market for the work force: We will use seven years, that is,  by the end of the century, to coordinate the reforms of various  fields, further push them in depth, and basically establish an  embryonic form of a modern work force market. By then, a new  employment mechanism will spread from a small number of  localities to the whole country.</p>

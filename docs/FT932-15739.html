			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fear of floating: 3i's bumpy road to a market listing For a business with so much experience of bringing other companies to market, Investors in Industry (3i) is having considerable difficulty managing its own flotation. And for an organisation with a reputation for sobriety verging on staidness, Britain's largest venture capital company has given its plans to list a surprising air of drama. The unexpected announcement on Thursday that 3i's shareholders had postponed indefinitely plans for a float and that Alan Wheatley, chairman for just nine months, was to resign, was the latest in a long line of setbacks. The cancellation of the float brings back to the fore an implicit conflict of interest between 3i and its shareholders - principally high street banks and the Bank of England - in the provision of finance to small business. The glacial progress towards the stock market has also ground down the company's chairmen. When Sir John Cuckney, Mr Wheatley's predecessor, took the helm five years ago it was assumed that he would steer the company to the market. But bringing the banks into line proved more difficult than expected, causing a frustrated Sir John to step down in 1992 to clear the way for the final push. This was to be led by Mr Wheatley, a former senior partner of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm. Now he too has given up in frustration. Sources close to 3i's management suspect the banks have become concerned at the ambitious expansion plans being hatched by the 3i management and decided to delay any action. The company was working on a plan to raise extra capital at the time of the listing; a more aggressive 3i, willing to consider possible mergers with other financial groups, was in prospect. The difficulties of one company - admittedly a large one - coming to the stock market might be of only passing interest but for 3i's crucial role as a provider of equity and long-term loan finance to small and medium-sized companies. It typically takes a minority stake in small businesses with growth potential and provides financial resources. The ultimate aim is to enable a stock market listing or to sell the holding to another investor. Yet so long as 3i's managers are absorbed with the unresolved issue of the flotation they will be diverted from their main task of helping small companies to rebuild their balance sheets at a time when the recession is showing signs of bottoming out. 3i no longer dominates the private equity market in the way it once did. But with more than 4,000 companies in its portfolio, it is still a significant player. Established in 1946 as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation with the backing of the Bank of England and the clearing banks, 3i was set up to help finance the postwar reconstruction of Britain. For the next three decades 3i grew on the back of shrewd investments and a near monopoly in this sector of the financial markets. It was not until the late 1970s that competition began to stir. During the 1980s Britain developed a vigorous and innovative venture-capital sector with more than 120 active players at its peak. The story of 3i's move to a public listing goes back nearly 10 years when several of the banks which are its shareholders started to look for ways of selling their holdings in the company. 3i and its shareholders decided to go for a public listing in the form of an investment trust, though at one stage National Westminster Bank considered acquiring all of 3i's shares. Other banks, notably Barclays, objected. Investment trust status gives significant tax advantages but 3i became embroiled in a lengthy wrangle with the Inland Revenue and it was not until 1990 that the company won official approval to go ahead with the flotation. It was 3i's misfortune that just when the final obstacles to flotation were removed the economy slipped into a prolonged recession. Before last Thursday's indefinite postponement the flotation had already been twice delayed in response to stock market conditions. Few observers foresaw the depths of the recession though analysts do question how well 3i and its shareholders responded to the economic climate in preparing for a market listing. Even if the banks had been willing to push ahead 3i might not have found the stock market willing to value its shares very highly. 'I am surprised they ever thought they would be able to float a venture capital company at the end of a recession,' commented one analyst. 'The small companies which 3i backs have been hardest hit and failure rates will continue at a high level for some time to come.' The company's approach to the market has been tinged with arrogance, some analysts believe. The share prices of investment trusts specialising in unquoted companies have recently traded at a substantial discount to the value of their net assets. The discount for this sector has remained high throughout the recession and is currently about 30 per cent. '3i thought it could convince the market that it was different to the other investment trusts specialising in unquoted equities and should trade on a smaller discount. But the market didn't believe it,' one analyst said. In any event, 3i's shareholders have now accepted that they cannot obtain an adequate valuation of the company's assets. 'We believe we will get better value if the flotation is deferred,' said a spokesman for National Westminster, representing the bank shareholders. 'There is no pressure on us to realise our investment. Since 3i is in a position to benefit from the upswing we have decided to wait.' Midland, at one stage the bank under most pressure to sell its stake in 3i because of problems with an ill-fated move into the US, now has the backing of HSBC Holdings, parent of the powerful Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. The repeated delays have caused analysts and 3i's rivals in the venture capital market to question whether 3i ever will float. But the shareholders insist it will. 'It is still seen as a key part of 3i's long-term development,' NatWest said. But 3i has not only consistently failed to meet its own flotation timetable, it has also fallen out with some the companies in which it invests. Concerned that a flotation would lead to a neglect of their interests a small group of companies in the 3i portfolio last November set up a group to make sure their voice was heard. Mr Barry Baldwin, chairman of the group, welcomed the decision to delay the float. But if many of the companies backed by 3i are happy with the latest twist, morale within the group's high rise headquarters near London's Waterloo Station is unlikely to have been improved. The repeated postponements and a tough cost-cutting programme - in part recession induced - to prepare 3i for the market have taken their toll. Staff numbers have been halved to about 550 over the past three years and several branch offices have been closed. After 47 years as an unlisted company, sheltered from short-term performance pressures, it was perhaps inevitable that 3i's move to the stock market would arouse controversy. What could not be foreseen was that the company and its shareholders would develop an unfortunate knack for making things even more difficult for themselves.</p>

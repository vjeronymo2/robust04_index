According to SIA, Canadian officials earlier this week rejected a proposal that the airline suspend its transatlantic flights in exchange for an expanded service across the Pacific to Vancouver. SIA currently has a twice-weekly service to Canada's west coast. SIA said it plans to suspend the Toronto service in July, Mr Paul Tan, but an SIA vice-president based in Toronto, said yesterday he expects further talks to take place in the forthcoming months. The dispute led Canada to give one year's notice last August that it was terminating a bilateral air services agreement with Singapore.

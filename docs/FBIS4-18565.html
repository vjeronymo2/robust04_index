			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Cesare Previti, Forza Italia's </F> "number-two" man, in Rome on 5 April: "Previti Warns: `If He  Betrays Us, He Will Be Punished'" -- first paragraph is LA  REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "Afraid? Of whom? We can go back to the  polls, hold new elections in no time. And then we will have a  good laugh. The truth is that [Northern League Secretary] Bossi  is a haywire splinter, with certain irrational traits. He has  not understood the turn that things have taken since the  elections. There are no more blank-check delegations. There is  an agreement that we must honor. He reminds me of those  characters of the past, those of the First Republic. Do you  remember that guy who wanted to have a free hand at all costs?"  We were watching the TG3 [third channel TV news] 7 o'clock news  in the office of Roman lawyer Cesare Previti, Forza Italia's  number two. We were watching a news show displaying in turn the  faces of the "pole of freedoms," now the "squabble pole,"  triumvirate. Faces, such as [Forza Italia leader] Silvio  Berlusconi's and [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's,  which showed rage and tension. Tense faces, uttering icy words  addressed to the odd man who has turned the tables on them and  may end up giving their opponents a present. Bossi, instead, was  shown wearing a windbreaker, smiling. Previti then broke out:  "He will be the only one to blame if in the end everything  collapses. If this guy betrays the alliance, the only solution  will be to go back to the polls."    [LA REPUBBLICA] Everything seemed to be ready: a government,  a platform, a majority. From [Fiat director] Agnelli to  [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, everybody wanted  Berlusconi at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office].    [Previti] Speaking of Bertinotti, let me say that I found  him  a rather interesting person. Following Costanzo's election  show, I got better acquainted with him, he was quite pleasant.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Were you expecting the League's wrath? What  unleashed it?    [Previti] Who knows, it is difficult to say. There are no  apparent facts or definite causes. Perhaps Bossi felt crushed  by Forza Italia, by our electoral lists' enormous success,  although, as a matter of fact, we had already witnessed some  outbursts toward the end of the election campaign. However, the  Senator [Bossi nickname] would be well advised not to indulge in  outbursts, considering the 28 March election results.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a threat?    [Previti] No, it is an argument based on readily available  data and figures. In Milan, in the proportional round, Forza  Italia defeated the League. And in Bossi's own constituency, we  won a relative majority. All this explains why the League's  leader is so jittery. He knows that his deputies' positions are  rather precarious.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Precarious? Does this mean that they will  soon go over to Forza Italia?    [Previti] No, I am not saying this. I am saying that, if we  went back to the polls immediately, those deputies and senators  would have to approach us in order to be reelected (may I remind  you that, in the north, Fini had presented his own lists, and  our agreement with the League was a fully-fledged electoral  agreement).    [LA REPUBBLICA] One-third of the pole of freedoms is still  in  Bossi's hands, for the moment. How will you manage to win them  over?    [LA REPUBBLICA] We were straightforward. We enabled the  League's candidates to win votes, without arguing, and with no  hidden aims. I wonder whether all the League members that have  been elected are now backing Bossi, whether they wish to follow  him into this adventure. I believe that many of them feel  betrayed. We had asked for votes in order to govern, and we are  now bogged down in these tactical stratagems, these games that  reek of the old system. The country is waiting for a  government, a guide. May I remind them, moreover, that they are  largely answerable to Forza Italia's voters. Voters who opted  for a more transparent policy: The winners govern the country.  I have remarked that, even among the ranks of the defeated,  this clarity, guaranteed by the new rules, is considered a  positive innovation.    [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, for you Bossi is a traitor. Did  you expect him to be one? Do you know him well?    [Previti] Not at all. I barely met him once, in Arcore  [Berlusconi residence], when I still had no thought of entering  into politics. However, I did become personally acquainted with  Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni, last Sunday. We were in  Silvio's gym, watching the soccer game on short-wave TV. I  supported Lazio, and Speroni the Milan team. Gosh, he was  wearing a buckle with a bull on it, with an inscription saying  he has got what it takes, a leather tie....    [LA REPUBBLICA] What is Berlusconi's opinion of Bossi?    [Previti] He also only met him by chance. Bossi always sends  forth Maroni [League lower house floor leader], Formentini,  Speroni. However, the League leader is warned. He has stumbled  on a hard stone. Berlusconi is sailing full steam ahead. We  are straightforward people, who have taken up straightforward  commitments with the Italian people. We are in a position to  submit a government plan and a platform by 15 April. If things  do not develop smoothly, we will know whom to blame. Two months  from now, in the European elections...    [LA REPUBBLICA] What will happen then?    [Previti] We will go to the polls in a free-for-all fashion  and we will see who wins. Everything will be clearer then.  Forza Italia will become a major party, a new count will have  to be made. And you will see how the League will cool down, boy,  will they cool down.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Bossi says you are a nonexistent party.    [Previti] And it will never exist in a traditional way, for  that matter. We are not the sort of guys who go to Pontida  [League rally venue], to have their hands kissed by the insane.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Speaking of Pontida, next Sunday [10 April]  Bossi will be raising the devil there.    [Previti] I would advise him not to overdo things, not to  carry things too far. He might be signing his own death  sentence.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Hopes rise for Ulster talks A FLURRY of activity by diplomats, politicians and civil servants yesterday followed what may prove to have been a breakthrough in Northern Ireland's politics. Preparations are under way for a meeting that will bring Unionists face to face with the government of the Irish Republic for the first time since partition in the 1920s. Plans are being laid for the UK and the republic to start work on a replacement for the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement. However, the worth of a deal struck by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, with local politicians just before midnight on Friday is not yet clear. Officials in London and Dublin have kept tight control on information with no details of any meetings being released. Perhaps the biggest clue yesterday was an air of optimism among government officials in London and Dublin, and no sign of a breach in the participants' vow of silence. For seven weeks Unionists and nationalists have been discussing proposals for devolution in Northern Ireland. This was Strand One. Little progress has been made but the agreement struck before talks began was that 'within weeks' negotiations would turn to Strand Two, when the republic would enter to discuss relations between north and south. Sir Patrick could have suspended the talks or forced a move to Strand Two with Strand One in disarray. Lengthy deliberations followed. Unionists, particularly the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said Strand One had to be completed. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party argued that the 'totality of relationships' in Northern Ireland had to be addressed and that a move to Strand Two would help to solve Strand One. Sir Patrick's answer was a complex compromise. Strand Two is not about to start, but the proposed independent chairman - Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia - will convene a meeting this week in London, probably on Wednesday, to discuss a possible agenda for Strand Two. Junior representatives of the two governments and the main political parties will attend. Meanwhile, the British and Irish governments will meet, according to the official statement, 'to give preliminary consideration to the issues likely to arise' in the third and final strand - on Anglo-Irish relations, principally the 1985 pact. With the duration of the talks limited - the cut-off point is a meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference at the end of next month - excessive time-wasting has been avoided, and discussions will continue. Sir Patrick may regard that as a breakthrough in itself.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Arts: Bubbling and fizzing around a bitter centre - The Libertine At the opening of Stephen Jeffreys' riotously funny new play, The Libertine, the Earl of Rochester - the infamous Restoration degenerate of the title - taunts the audience with a little prologue. 'You will not like me,' he assures us. 'No, I say you will not.' Rochester (David Westhead) then proceeds to charm us with an outrageously frank advertisement of his sexual availability, but the combination of pride and self-loathing of that opening speech returns to haunt you throughout the play. With it, Rochester has set a challenge to the audience, and Jeffreys a challenge for his play. Can we like this man? Can we ignore him? But, above all, can we find out what made him tick? Why was this evidently charismatic, brilliant wit so resolutely self-destructive? Did his determinedly bad behaviour spring only from scorn of his age, or did it reveal a deeper disillusionment with life itself? Rochester is thought, of course, to be the inspiration behind Dorimant, the heartless rake in Etherege's The Man of Mode, and Max Stafford-Clark's new company Out of Joint is performing Etherege's Restoration comedy alongside Jeffreys' new play. The double-bill offers a fascinating two-way mirror on Rochester and his age, allows plenty of opportunity for playing theatrical games (in The Libertine, Etherege is shown in a not altogether flattering light) and also provokes deliberation about the validity of art. At one point in The Libertine, Etherege taunts Rochester with the fact that he has not written a great play. 'I have caught the scent and flavour of our age and set it down for all time,' crows Etherege (a pinch-faced, bitchy little fellow in Jason Watkin's fine performance). Rochester's defence is that he is too busy living his life to chronicle it. In a sense, Jeffreys has written Rochester's play for him. But while Etherege may have caught the age in its hedonistic heyday, with Rochester at the helm living to excess, Jeffreys presents another view: the morning after. His portrait is altogether more sour. Here the king is beginning to worry about money, while the writers of the age spend their time drinking, bitching, whoring and brawling. On this detritus Rochester floats, rubbishing everything with devastating wit. And Jeffreys incorporates some of Rochester's bawdiest, most graphic and scurrilous writings, suggesting that they were every bit as revealing about the age as Etherege's play. But while the shallowness of the waters in which Rochester swam were provocation enough for his cynicism, and the physical damage of his lifestyle was enough to darken his mind, neither fully explains his destructiveness. In Jeffreys' play, it is Elizabeth Barry (a glowing performance by Katrina Levin), the actress with whom Rochester fell passionately in love, who puts her finger on his more profound despair. So determined herself, she represents a positive life force that he has turned his back on and can no longer reach. Around this bitter centre, the play bubbles and fizzes like a glass of champagne. Jeffreys writes with enormous exuberance, achieving an eminently credible cod Restoration style, and the dialogue drips with wonderful witticisms and bawdiness. Max Stafford-Clark's crystalline, effortless production trips along, is full of enjoyable performances, and embraces the excesses of Rochester's writings with great gusto (it will be a long time before I forget the dance of the dildos). At the centre of it all reigns David Westhead's excellent squat, hammer-headed Rochester - now boorish, now charming, now petulant, he is always compelling, conveying the many sides of this bundle of contradictions. In the end, the play does not quite answer its challenge. Though we understand him better by the end of Jeffreys' play, Rochester finally remains an enigma. This is frustrating - but I suspect it is the point, for to pin down Rochester completely would clearly be an insult to the hard work he put in to staying out of reach.</p>

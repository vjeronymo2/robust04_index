			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Molson suffers setback MOLSON Companies, the diversified Canadian brewer, suffered a 24 per cent setback in its latest quarterly earnings, largely as a result of a weak beer market, retaliatory duties on beer imposed by the US and the costs of converting to a new beer bottle. Net earnings fell to CDollars 25.3m (USDollars 20m), or 42 cents a share, in the three months to December 31, the third quarter of the company's fiscal year, from CDollars 33.4m, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 769.8m from CDollars 723.3m. The negative factors were partially offset by CDollars 4.9m in fees received from the North American ice hockey league, one of whose teams is owned by Molson. Nine-month earnings fell to CDollars 100.1m, or CDollars 1.68 a share, from CDollars A 110.4m, or CDollars 1.97 a share. The company said yesterday the decline in earnings for the year as a whole was likely to be 10 to 12 per cent.</p>

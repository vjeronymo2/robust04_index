			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rudolf Wassermann: "Lessons of Magdeburg, or </F> Signals to the Police"]    [Text] Some time has passed since the events in Magdeburg  on Ascension Day; and this enables us to say more than could  have been said while the discussion was still characterized by  justified dismay. There is no doubt that the police have  failed. For many hours they did not turn up at all,  preservation of evidence and cooperation with the Federal Public  Prosecutor did not work. What is the point of having a "Police  Concept for Fighting Political Extremism and Xenophobic Crimes,"  which the interior minister sent to police stations in January,  if it does not produce any results in practice?    What happened in Magdeburg is nothing new, though. Police  have made mistakes in the old laender as well. We still  remember the picture of a police officer being chased through  the streets of West Berlin by rampaging leftist gangs on 1 May  1989 -- before reunification.    In the new laender, the situation is aggravated by manpower  shortages and a lack of motivation. People say that in Dresden  you have to report a murder to get a policeman to the scene of a  crime. In Saxony-Anhalt, police vehicles are said to be  reluctant to go to the scenes of crimes, but they would rather  go as far away from it as quickly as possible -- after all, you  do not want to risk your life because of some criminal. Such  reports are certainly exaggerated, and one should be careful not  to make sweeping judgments. But there is no harm in knowing  what the difficulties are that police authorities are facing.    The Federal President made a welcome statement, saying that  it is hard to grasp how hooligans and right-wing extremists  could hunt down people in the middle of a big city and be  released after having been detained. Such a clear statement had  been long overdue. As long as the perpetrators came from the  left-wing scene, appeasement was the order of the day. Only  since right-wing extremists have started imitating and outdoing  the other end of the spectrum and since -- last but not least --  effective solutions have been demanded abroad, the mood has  changed.    Political signals for a more severe fight against extremist  violence can, however, not be put into practice without  problems. The existing laws especially prevent this.  Admittedly, criminals that are caught red-handed can be  detained by police officers without an arrest warrant -- but  this is only possible if they are suspected of escaping, if  their identity cannot be established, or if there is imminent  danger providing sufficient cause for an arrest warrant. In the  interest of the freedom of the individual, the limits of the  latter have been set out very narrowly, also, and especially, as  far as the danger of recurrence is concerned. The judiciary is  meticulously monitoring the observance of these limits, and  police officers have been told to follow them strictly. In  addition, there is the possibility of protective detention to  avert danger (up to two days in Saxony-Anhalt).    Police are bound by these laws. Before criticizing police  actions, one should be aware of this situation. Otherwise, one  might get the impression that the police are accused of obeying  the law.    On the other hand, the Magdeburg events once again underline  that the laws urgently need to be adapted to the changing  circumstances. The coalition's 1994 Crime Prevention Act, which  is meeting with resistance in the Bundesrat, will improve this  situation considerably. It is high time that the police and  judicial authorities are provided with instruments that are more  suitable for fighting violence -- especially right-wing  extremist violence -- than the existing ones. Further delays  would be irresponsible. The given law has become a test case  that will show whether politicians are willing to fight violence  effectively, doing something beyond expressing dismay.</p>

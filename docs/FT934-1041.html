			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stores mixed There was mixed reaction among stores stocks to reports that pre-Christmas trading had picked up in recent days. Most of the leaders continued their recent dull form, undermined by what many in the market consider a bout of overbuying in the wake of the Budget, as well as by cautious reports from suppliers, particularly in textiles. Marks and Spencer shaded a half-penny to 430p, Kingfisher and Dixons managed rises of 2 to 719p and 271p respectively, and Great Universal Stores remained at 605p. Boots, performing better, added 7 at 557p and WH Smith 'A' put on 9 at 526p. However, second liners responded more positively to the reports, with Austin Reed climbing 13 to 172p, Allders 6 to 198p and Argos 5 to 381p. Signet Group, formerly known as Ratners, and one of the worst affected stocks of the recent rash of bearish stories on sales, gained 20 per cent as two institutions were reported big buyers of the convertible preference shares. They finished 2 up at 41 1/4 p, with the ordinary eventually 4 1/4 ahead at 24 1/2 p after a hefty 8m traded. News that an international industry conference aimed at cutting back ethylene production had been abandoned sent ICI down against a bullish London market. ICI is a big producer of the chemical and its shares fell 34 to 734p at one stage but rallied to end 14 off at 753 1/2 p on 3.7m dealt. Hoare Govett, a long-time seller of ICI, reiterated its bearish stance and reinforced its bottom of the range 1994 profits forecast of Pounds 350m. Some dealers expected investors to adjust chemicals sector weightings by switching into companies such as BOC, Courtaulds and Laporte. But the sector remained churlishly unresponsive - BOC gained 5 at 645p, Laporte 2 at 718p and Courtaulds only a penny at 470p. Schroders, one of the two merchant banks in the FT-SE 100 Index, jumped 22 to a peak 1360p, albeit in painfully thin turnover of 113,000 shares. SG Warburg, also in the FT-SE 100, raced up 16 to 914p, while Kleinwort Benson advanced 8 to 561p and Hambros 6 to 387p. Prudential stood out in insurances, touching 360p before closing a net 11 1/2 higher at 359p, with the market responding to suggestions that one of the big German pension funds was seeking to buy a block of 2.5m shares. The British Petroleum buy story gathered momentum, with domestic and overseas institutions continuing to chase the shares higher after last week's highly successful UK and US presentations delivered to the big institutions by Mr David Simon, BP's chief executive. At those meetings Mr Simon said BP was on track to attain the Dollars 2bn profits target he set for end-1994 and he increased this to Dollars 3bn as a projection for end-1995. At the close, BP was 9 stronger at 357p, having touched a three-year high of 358 1/2 p in midsession, and many oil sector specialists expect the shares to launch a determined challenge to the all-time high of just above 377p reached in July 1987. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares. BP's performance was all the more impressive given a background of continuing uncertainty in crude oil markets, where Brent crude remained steadfastly below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark. Shell also came in for good support, closing 6 higher at 718p after 4.8m traded. Another purchase in the ice cream industry by Unilever, which paid Pounds 220m for a majority holding in a French manufacturer, helped the shares climb 15 to 1187p. Takeover fever in the television sector faded somewhat and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television fell 7 to 151p in reaction to a press report that LWT Holdings had ruled out a bid for the company. LWT rose 6 to 605p. By the close of trading yesterday the Granada all-paper offer for LWT was worth 632p per share as Granada ended 7 up at 527p. Bid talk returned to haunt troubled Fisons, whose shares recovered 3 to 115p.</p>

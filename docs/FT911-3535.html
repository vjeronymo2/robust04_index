			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Dinkins dithers as NY sinks in the quagmire: Bernard Simon on the Big Apple's big problems ALMOST every city in North America is feeling a three-way squeeze these days, but New York is worse. The recession is eroding tax revenues; demands for social welfare and other costly services are spiralling; yet little help is forthcoming from governments preoccupied with balancing their own budgets. These woes are only part, however, of the economic and political quagmire in which New York finds itself. The fiscal crunch in the US's biggest city is being compounded by a mayor seemingly unable to take tough decisions, a white business community nervous about upsetting the black mayor, and bureaucrats and trade union leaders who want everyone to make sacrifices except themselves. New York's latest budget worries have not yet reached the proportions of the mid-1970s, when the city came close to financial collapse. 'It's a difficult problem, but it's not a crisis,' says Mr Quentin Spector, executive director of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, the body set up 15 years ago as banker to the city, which now acts mainly as a financial adviser. The budget impasse has so far had little more impact on New Yorkers than the prospect of a shortened season at municipal swimming pools this summer, fewer lifeguards on the beaches, and a drive for private donations to save the Central Park petting zoo. The long-term damage could be far more severe. While the budget deficit is projected at a relatively manageable Dollars 450m-500m for the fiscal year to June 30, it is expected to soar to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in 1991/92. The city's borrowing ability is also at risk, at a time when it needs to raise about Dollars 3bn a year to fund new capital projects. New York bonds are already trading at a premium of about 1 percentage-point to those of issuers with a similar credit rating. Mr Don Mele, director for public issues at City Partnership, a non-profit civic group, is worried that the improvements made to New York's infrastructure over the past decade - ranging from street repairs to gleaming new subway carriages - will gradually unravel if a solution is not found to the budget problem. At the core of the problem is New York's heavy exposure to the real estate and financial services businesses, and related sectors, which have been especially hard hit by the recession. The city's economy tumbled into recession more than a year before the rest of the country, and has felt its impact far more severely. According to the New York Port Authority, construction activity fell by 28 per cent last year, compared to a national decline of only 11 per cent. With many high-income earners in the financial services and related industries out of work, retail sales dipped by 1.2 per cent last year, against a 3.9 per cent advance in the country as a whole. Matters have been made worse by the dithering of Mayor David Dinkins and the intransigence of the city's trade unions. Instead of taking the tough decisions needed to balance the budget, Mr Dinkins has gone out of his way to avoid confrontation with the city's many special interest groups. He lifted, then reimposed, a freeze on hiring municipal workers. At the same time, he has proposed hiring several thousand police officers to dampen fears about a new crime wave. Several deadlines are looming. The financial markets' opinion of New York's financial condition will become clearer within the next 10 days when the city is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn in 'revenue-anticipation' bonds  -money required because the New York state budget, which will provide for transfers to the city, is itself almost a month overdue. If Mr Dinkins fails to bring the municipal budget shortfall below Dollars 100m by the end of June or if the city is shut out of the capital markets, administration of municipal finances could pass to the Financial Control Board, another agency set up in the mid-1970s to bring more discipline to New York's financial affairs. The chances are slim that the FCB, whose members include the governor, the mayor, city and state comptrollers and three private-sector nominees, will actually step in. Whether by fiscal prudence or by some sleight-of-hand accounting, Mr Dinkins is likely to pull out all the stops to avoid the humiliation of outside intervention. According to Mr Spector, 'the betting seems to be that the city will make it through 1991 intact, but partly by mortgaging 1992. The question is: Will they use that time well?' The answer depends largely on how quickly the city emerges from recession and can rebuild its eroded tax base. Ms Nancy Feldman, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency, asserts that 'there's no question New York will lag the rest of the country.' The danger is that a prolonged slump or very slow recovery will not give Mr Dinkins the tax revenues he needs to balance the 1991/92 budget. The city will then face far more unpleasant choices than it does today, plus the risk of more severe labour strife and political turmoil.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: NFL DOESN'T LIGHT UP BERLIN  </P> <P> The mystery of the missing scoreboard at Olympiastadion remains unanswered, so  let's stick with the questions raised by Saturday's clueless affair at American  Bowl '90.  </P> <P> Was there no scoreboard because the Rams and the Chiefs made one unnecessary?  </P> <P> Or did the Rams and the Chiefs stop scoring because there was nowhere to put  the points?  </P> <P> Did the American Bowl planners simply forget the scoreboard in their haste to  provide 50,000 Germans with Scottish bagpipe bands, Orange County cheerleaders,  American rock 'n' roll, world-champion whistlers and Frisbee-catching dogs?  </P> <P> Or did we just forget that Olympiastadion is normally used for soccer, which  has favored the one-finger method of scorekeeping for years?  </P> <P> Confusion was going to reign, regardless of when the Rams and the Kansas City  Chiefs brought the strange sport of NFL football to the Deutschland for the  first time. But playing this new game without keeping track of points, downs,  quarters and yards-to-go was to throw the game into a new kind of darkness.  </P> <P> The Germans weren't the only ones who didn't know what was going on.  </P> <P> The Americans didn't know, either.  </P> <P> "I couldn't see what down it was, I didn't know what the score was," Ram  offensive tackle Irv Pankey said. "Maybe if they start playing more football  here, they'll do a little bit more to the stadium. At least, maybe, they'll  keep track of what down it is and how many timeouts are left."  </P> <P> Olympiastadion is equipped with a full-color video screen at its east end and a  fine screen it is. The replays were laser sharp and brilliant, rendering U.S.  Diamond Vision a rhinestone by comparison.  </P> <P> But the screen is all video and video was on the screen at all times, for the  benefit of the Berliners in the cheap seats. The game clock was superimposed  onto the action but the only other numbers visible were the ones on the field.  </P> <P> Matthias Theil, a Berlin college student working the game as an usher, tried to  keep up, but soon abandoned it as hopeless. He had seen American football  before, twice, but never without directions.  </P> <P> "The game promised a lot," Theil said from a seat behind the west end zone,  "but I'm a bit disappointed with the action because I can't get who is leading.  It is a very complex game to understand."  </P> <P> Theil admitted that he is not much of a sports fan. "Churchill said, 'The best  sport of all is no sport at all.' That is my opinion as well," Theil explained  with a grin. But since he was already here -- and getting paid to be here -- he  figured, why not give it a go?  </P> <P> By the third quarter, Theil had decided that he may not know football, but he  knows what he likes.  </P> <P> "One team passes and one team makes the yards step-by-step," Theil noted. "I go  for the effort of playing with the passes. It is more beautiful to see."  </P> <P> That made Theil a Ram fan. In the first half, Jim Everett and Mark Herrmann  combined to pass 16 times, or twice as often as Kansas City quarterback Mike  Elkins. Of course, the Chiefs didn't do much step-by-stepping, either --  netting 23 yards on the ground while the Rams turned one touchdown and one  field goal into an insurmountable lead.  </P> <P> Simone Fleigner, a 26-year-old woman from the East German city of Leipzig, was  watching her first football game, most of it with a furrowed brow.  </P> <P> "I don't understand much of what is going on," she said. "But it looks very  nice, very attractive."  </P> <P> What Fleigner liked best were the clothes -- Ram blue-and-gold clashing with  Chief red-and-white. "I never saw such uniforms before," she said. "It is more  like a spectacle than a game."  </P> <P> Fleigner was less enamored with the grunt work of the sport. "I don't like when  all the players jump on each other and fall over," she claimed.  </P> <P> Why not?  </P> <P> Fleigner smiled.  </P> <P> "Because it looks like it hurts."  </P> <P> While the Rams and the Chiefs did more hurting than scoring -- the game was a  13-3 snoozer before Ram cornerback Alfred Jackson returned an interception with  1:24 left in the fourth quarter -- German minds began to wander. They much  preferred the leg kicks of the Ram cheerleaders, the imitation Ashley Whippets,  the Chuck Berry tunes -- even the scourge of the American mainland, the dreaded  Wave.  </P> <P> "I like the show," said Burkard Ahlcyt from his seat above the 10-yard line.  "The dogs, the girls, the music. This is gut. It has a lot of life."  </P> <P> Theil, however, believed that it could have been better.  </P> <P> "I think it should be a more effective show," Theil said. "In Berlin, we have  the (amateur) Adler team and you can see the cheerleaders more in action. Here,  they are too far away. There is no feeling for the action from the  cheerleaders."  </P> <P> But even if they put the cheerleaders in the aisles, Theil doubts that the NFL  game has much of a future in Germany.  </P> <P> "It has no chance," Theil said flatly. "It is too complex. It is a very  strategic game, unlike German or English soccer, which is easier to understand.  Germans like to have an easier time at their games. They do not want that much  thinking during the game.  </P> <P> "Things are too conservative here. Things are slow to change, especially in  Berlin, which has been influenced by the old thinking from the GDR. I do not  think Berlin will become a second Wembley for American football."  </P> <P> But then at Wembley Stadium, they speak the same language.  </P> <P> And they have a scoreboard.  </P> <P> Fleigner, a fast learner, had already adopted one ancient Los Angeles custom  and was heading for the exit early. Three-and-a-half quarters through one  once-in-a-lifetime experience was more than enough.  </P> <P> Would she ever consider coming back?  </P> <P> "I'd rather go to a Pink Floyd concert," she said.  </P> <P> All in all, a Ram exhibition game in West Berlin was just another brick in the  wall.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] When speaking of the  October events, we cannot pass by the opinion of Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev. It was, after all, the Army that played  the decisive role in the drama.    [Grachev] We have not forgotten those terrible events,  although six months have passed since then. I want to say that  the Army at the time was simply obliged to act decisively and  show unity and understanding. To this day the military feel and  sense what happened, possibly more so than anyone else.    The sad thing is that the Army had to clean up the mess,  figuratively speaking, created by political confrontation.    Once again, I want to repeat that the Armed Forces at that  time prevented a civil war. I want to make it clear that the  Army want to see the maximum amount of accord in society.    At the moment, accord is simply essential. Without accord  there cannot be any reform, not political, economic, or cultural.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> $500,000 FINE IMPOSED IN OIL SPILL  </P> <P> A federal judge today fined the captain and owner of the tanker World Prodigy  more than $500,000 for a June 23 spill that dumped an estimated 300,000 gallons  of light oil at the mouth of Narragansett Bay.  </P> <P> U.S. District Court Judge Ernest Torres fined Capt. Iakovos Georgudis $10,000,  plus a mandatory special assessment of $25. In levying the fine, the judge  noted that Georgudis had an excellent record and had assisted in clean-up  efforts.  </P> <P> "The court has received assurances that the captain's conduct was negligent, as  opposed to willful or reckless," Torres said.  </P> <P> The owner of the ship, Ballard Shipping Co. of New York, was fined $1 million  and placed on one month's probation. However, the judge suspended half that  fine.  </P></p>

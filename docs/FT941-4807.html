			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market economy bears fruit in Budapest - A wholesale revolution has brought an array of exotic produce Budapest's wholesale market, on the outskirts of the Hungarian capital, offers a fine example of the remnants of the old eastern bloc sampling the fruits of the market economy. A steady stream of battered Lada cars processes through the damp spring morning past stalls brimming with imported oranges, grapefruits and kiwi fruit. The drivers - grocers and traders from the city - pause to see who is offering the keenest price before chugging on. The market, which provides 90 per cent of Budapest's fresh fruit and vegetables, is a pioneer in the reconstruction of eastern Europe's troubled agricultural sector, being the largest in the region and the first organised along western lines. Mr Gabor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest, was in London yesterday to sign a Dollars 6.7m (Ecu5.9m) loan agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to help provide the market with a cold store, bigger parking and service areas and facilities for ripening bananas. Thanks to the market, bananas have become an everyday fruit in Budapest, says Ms Anne Bosche-Lenoir, the EBRD's project manager in Hungary. But the problem is that 'the bananas are already yellow when they arrive, so the value is being added somewhere else'. The bank sees competitive wholesale markets as the key to reducing distribution costs, creating efficient pricing and breaking the stranglehold of Mafia-style operators on traditional east European production and distribution networks. It has received requests from Albania to Alma Ata for help in setting up markets. But progress has generally been slow. Attempts failed in Moscow and St Petersburg because of problems over land reform and resistance from organised criminals. Budapest was different. The city authorities had set up the market themselves in 1991. They created a company to operate it, with shareholders including a leading Hungarian savings bank, an agricultural co-operative, whose land was taken over for the market, and several small companies, as well as the municipality. Within a year of opening, it had become severely congested. About 95,000 farmers, anxious to break with the discredited co-operative distribution system and sell their produce direct, descended on the market in the first summer, queuing for up to three hours to get in. Annual turnover rose to 350,000 tonnes, five times that of the old wholesale operations in the city centre, and the market found itself handling half the country's fruit and vegetable imports. The EBRD, drawing on wholesale systems in France, Italy and the Netherlands, stepped in to provide advice on reorganising operations. This included setting up television screens to track prices and introducing a proper accounting system. Then it agreed to fund part of the Dollars 26.4m extension, allowing the city rather than the government to guarantee a loan for the first time. 'Without our money, they wouldn't have been able to finance this infrastructure,' says Ms Bosche-Lenoir. 'There's no long-term finance available in Hungary.' To minimise the company's borrowing costs, wholesalers are being asked to pay a lump sum for leasing rights before construction begins in May. The market has been a blessing for Mr Gabor Czeizler, managing director of Wienimpex, a wholesale operation distributing greenhouse produce from south-east Hungary. He has seen his annual turnover nearly double since he moved out from the city centre. 'This place is reachable from all directions,' he says. 'There's a very good network of roads.' Mr Lajos Juhasz, who works on a stall in the covered part of the market, is glad of its existence too. He used to be deputy manager of a butcher's shop, but the state meat company that owned it went bankrupt and he was out of a job. 'The money is better but the hours are very long,' he says. The market has also spawned rivals in other cities, which has made the competition tougher. For the people of Budapest, the increased availability not only of exotic fruits but also of peppers, one of Hungary's most typical vegetables, is welcome. 'Now we can buy tomatoes and peppers in the winter,' one woman explained. 'They come from Holland, but they don't have the flavour of our own Hungarian peppers.'</p>

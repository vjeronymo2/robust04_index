			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Irish out of luck in EC aid row: Brussels to reject Dublin's insistence on extra funding THE row sparked by Ireland's blocking at the weekend of the European Community's largest ever regional aid programme looks set to worsen today, as signs emerge that Brussels may not even be able to guarantee Dublin the funding that the Irish government has already rejected. The European Commission and EC ambassadors to Brussels hold separate meetings today to try to break the logjam, caused by Ireland's refusal to accept less than the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) that Prime Minister Albert Reynolds says he was promised at last December's Edinburgh summit. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, is understood to have offered the Irish IPounds 7.5bn last weekend, when EC foreign ministers tried to agree on the Community's Ecu157bn (Pounds 121bn) regional aid programme for 1994 to 1999. But the Commission is divided on whether Ireland has been offered more than it is entitled to under the criteria set at Edinburgh. Spain, Portugal and Greece - which with Ireland make up the 'Cohesion Four' member states earmarked for the EC's most generous grants - are objecting that some of the money already offered to Dublin will have to come out of their pot. 'There's a limit to the number of times you can hand out the same money,' one EC diplomat said. Mr Bruce Millan, the Scottish commissioner for regional policy, is insisting on sticking to the Edinburgh criteria. These weigh factors like regional per capita income, unemployment levels, size of population and of rural population. In the 1989-1993 regional aid package, Ireland got 13.5 per cent of funds for the 'Cohesion Four' - giving it 2 to 2 1/2 times more per capita than its poor colleagues - whereas now it is being offered an 11 per cent share. 'On the most generous interpretation of Edinburgh,' one senior EC official said, 'you just about arrive at IPounds 7bn for Ireland. Even IPounds 7bn would leave Ireland measurably in front of the other three' on funding per head. 'There's only so much we can do to get (Mr Reynolds) out of a hole he's dug for himself.' An ambassador from one of the 'Cohesion Four' said the three others were not ready to be flexible. It was not reasonable for anybody to offer something which differs substantially from what was approved by the Edinburgh summit. If the package is not wrapped up this week for delivery to the European Parliament next week, funding is unlikely to start next January. It is understood, however, that Mr Reynolds' government is examining ways of dressing up the offer to Ireland, by trying to squeeze more money out of Community regional funding and out from unspent 1989-1993 aid funds.</p>

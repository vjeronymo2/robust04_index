			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.3(e) would permit the Funding Corporation to present the information required by this part in any order it deems suitable in the report. Under proposed &sect;630.3(f), the Funding Corporation must disclose in the report that additional financial information regarding individual banks is contained in the banks' periodic reports and state where the reports can be obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Funding Corporation would be required to file the report to investors with the FCA in the same manner as individual banks or associations file their periodic reports with the FCA. Proposed &sect;630.3(g) provides that at least one of the three copies of the report filed with the FCA must be dated and manually signed on behalf of the Funding Corporation by: (1) The officer(s) designated by the Funding Corporation board to certify the report; (2) the chief executive officer of the Funding Corporation; and (3) at least one of the members of the Funding Corporation board. The signers of the report must certify that the report has been prepared in accordance with all applicable statutory or regulatory requirements and that the information it contains is true, accurate, and complete to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Responsibilities for Preparing the Report to Investors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.4 delineates responsibilities of the disclosure entities and associations for preparing the report to investors. All disclosure entities have a role in the preparation of the report to investors, either by supplying essential financial information or by compiling and combining it into a meaningful Systemwide report. The disclosure entities thus bear the responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the published report. The associations, which are not disclosure entities under this part, would be required by proposed &sect;630.4(d) to provide for direct communication between disclosure entities and association external auditors regarding questions pertinent to association financial information that arise in the preparation of the report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Responsibilities of the Funding Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.4(a) sets forth the responsibilities of the Funding Corporation. The proposed regulations formalize the Funding Corporation's function in the existing System Disclosure Program by assigning the Funding Corporation the lead role among disclosure entities in preparing the report to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;630.4(a)(1), the Funding Corporation would be required to publish the reports required by &sect;630.3(a). The annual report to investors must be published within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. With the exception of the quarter coinciding with the fiscal yearend, the Funding Corporation would be required to publish a report covering each quarter within 60 days after quarterend. Within the same time period, pursuant to &sect;630.4(a)(4), the Funding Corporation must file these reports with the FCA in accordance with &sect;630.3(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;630.4(a)(2) would require the Funding Corporation to establish a system of internal controls over Systemwide financial disclosure to investors. The internal control policies and procedures must be approved by the System Audit Committee. Under this system of internal controls, the Funding Corporation must: (1) Maintain written policies and procedures to be carried out by the disclosure entities for preparation of the report to investors; (2) provide instructions to the disclosure entities regarding the information needed for preparing the report to investors; (3) provide for the review and verification of information submitted by all other disclosure entities to the Funding Corporation; and (4) specify procedures for the monitoring of interim disclosures of System institutions and timely disclosure of any material changes to the most recently published report to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As defined in proposed &sect;630.2(f), the ``materiality'' of an event must be determined at each reporting level in light of the surrounding circumstances under which the reporting is made. Therefore, each bank must submit to the Funding Corporation all information the bank believes to be material either to the financial statements of the bank or to the combined financial statements of the bank and its related associations. On receipt of information from all disclosure entities, the Funding Corporation must in turn make a materiality judgment based on the aggregate effect of all information received to determine the extent of discussion and analysis to be presented in the report to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;630.4(a)(3), the Funding Corporation would be responsible for collecting the component financial data and related analysis needed from each disclosure entity to prepare the report to investors. This provision would authorize the Funding Corporation to collect the information and any supporting data needed from each disclosure entity to comply with the requirements of proposed subparts B and C. Under the proposed regulations, the Funding Corporation would obtain associations' financial information through the banks rather than from the associations. This proposed rule integrates the requirement of part 620 of this chapter that banks prepare combined financial statements with their related associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

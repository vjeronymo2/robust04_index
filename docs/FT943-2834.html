			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures bounced back strongly yesterday, moving to a premium against the cash market for the first time in more than a week. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened modestly higher but it took until lunchtime to break upwards through 3,100, by which time the underlying cash market was doing most of the pace-making. At the close the index was at 3,116, with the relationship to the cash market firmly reversed to a premium of almost 2. Ahead of this morning's expiration of the September contract, the fair value premium was around zero. The market consensus was that the index had been heavily oversold on Wednesday, and at one time yesterday the premium to the cash market was as high as 10. Once again the main drive came from independent traders. Trading volume was substantially down from Wednesday's 23,088 lots at 18,066, about half of which reflected roll-over into the December contract where volume totalled 10,765. Activity in traded options moved up strongly to 53,043 contracts, from some 40,000 the previous day. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE option volume accounted for some three-quarters of this trading. Vodafone (1,182 lots) and BP (1,000) were the most actively traded individual stock options.</p>

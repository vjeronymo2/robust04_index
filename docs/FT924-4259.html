			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / People: Sailing by to IMI Alan Emson, who has just been named as the new finance director of IMI, says he feels like a sailor returning to the sea. 'It is very nice to be back in engineering' says Emson, 49, who is remembered by the City for his part in the vigorous but ultimately unsuccessful defence of Birmid Qualcast from the hands of Blue Circle. The Birmingham engineering group, which analysts regard as tightly managed and well-positioned for economic recovery, has traditionally looked inside to fill board positions, but this time there was no suitable internal candidate to replace Gordon Taylor who is retiring, at the age of 60, after 5 years as finance director and 24 years at IMI. Emson is remembered for preserving his cool during the Blue Circle bid - which in 1988 was declared successful only for the result to be reversed when the votes were recounted - answering the phone with the comment 'hello, deputy escapologist speaking'. When Blue Circle ultimately achieved its target the following year, in a deal analysts characterised as very favourable for Birmid shareholders, Emson left to become finance director of motor dealership Evans Halshaw. He now explains that move as being largely determined by his wish to stay in the Midlands despite several approaches from London-based public companies. He says the style of management at IMI - 'conservative but granting a lot of autonomy to the divisions and subsidiaries' - is very similar to the old Birmid Qualcast culture, in which he spent 18 years, the latter 12 as finance director. Evans Halshaw is replacing Emson with Charles Cameron, 36, finance director of the Midlands and the specialty vehicles divisions.</p>

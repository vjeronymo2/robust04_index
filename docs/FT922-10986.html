			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Arts: Chinese artist who weathered the revolution Wu Guanzhong is a figure more characteristic of the oriental than the occidental cultures, an artist schooled in the ancient tradition of his country yet avowedly modern in practice and intention. Whether or not he reconciles the old with the new is another matter, but it is that polarity that makes his work remarkable and intriguing. Indeed it presents the dilemma with particular force, for the circumstances of his career are those of China itself during the past 60 years, torn between the old ways and the modern world, still unsure of where the commitment should lie. He was born in 1919 in Jiangsu province. It was at the University to the Academy of Art, Hangzhou, that he first became aware of modern western art, in particular that of the impressionists, the post-impressionists and fauves. But during the Sino-Japanese War, which broke out in 1937, the school was merged with the Peking Academy. Before the war the policy had been to expose students to foreign influence and many of Wu's teachers had studied abroad in Europe and Japan. His turn came in 1946 when the post-War government reintroduced the system and he was one of three artists to win travelling scholarships to Europe. He spent three years in Paris, returning in 1950 to teach at the Central Academy in Peking. By this time, however, Socialist Realism was asserting itself as the new orthodoxy and sole alternative to the traditional schools. As a teacher, Wu's opportunities were inevitably constricted, but he was at least free to carry on his own work more or less as he pleased. With the Cultural Revolution of 1966, all that changed. Along with his colleagues and students he was committed to hard labour in the countryside and, for the three years from 1969, not allowed to paint at all. In 1972 his situation eased somewhat when recalled to Peking, though the move was marked by his readoption of the imagery and techniques of the Chinese ink and paper tradition that he had been taught as a student. Since 1976 and the Revolution's end, his artistic freedom has been uninhibited, but, as this exhibition so clearly demonstrates, he has continued for the most part with ink and paper, and remained consciously much closer to the traditional preoccupations than he was before. In recent years Wu has again travelled widely and his work has been shown in Japan, Russia, America, India, Hong Kong and the Middle East, but not hitherto in Europe. This show at the British Museum is a notable first. To concentrate so much on the biography is neither to deny nor evade the work itself, but very much to inform it in what is a special case. Here we have the work of the 20 years since that return from internal exile, the oil paintings and the works on paper, the topographical studies, the modest and charming landscapes in the manner of later post-impressionism, shades of Van Gogh, Matisse and Derain. Here too are the larger, freer, more consciously ambitious works that teeter on the verge of figuration and yet remain wonderfully descriptive and evocative, embracing at once abstraction, modernism, tradition and the old calligraphy. Wu is at his best when least self-consciously modern, indeed when least concerned to demonstrate the western conventions. His work in the western manner is competent enough but by no means exceptional. But as we move on to the principal works on paper, dating mostly from the 1980s to, it would seem, the day before yesterday, with their swirling floods of ink, their nervous, active line and instinctive, decorative handling of the surface, we come to something truly original and as visually joyful as anything seen here in a long time. The bright-eyed birds blink out from a Banyan Forest that is as free and confident in its abstraction as a Jackson Pollock, though no less a forest for that. Trees and Temple roofs peer over the great rockery or 'false mountain' of the Lion Grove Garden, a calligraphic rock face as active as anything of Mark Tobey. The exquisite Lace Bark Pine twists and writhes before the Imperial Household at Peking, a tree that with its fellows, in every year of the Qing dynasty, between 1644 and 1911, was given a salary of hundreds of silver pieces. This late and easy acceptance of meaning and particular association in the work, steeped in the Buddhist tradition, is at the heart of the matter. For Wu there is no longer anything of the western modernist critical opposition between form and content. 'I love wistaria', he says, 'the hoary strength, the gnarled crookedness, the creeping and the spreading of its sinews and bones, and I love its noble bearing and charm . . . In the Lion Grove Garden at Suzhou is the wistaria planted by the painter Wen Zhengmin (1470-1559) and to this day the trunk and leaves conceal the sky . . .': and this of one of the freest and most abstracted of the paintings of the 1990s. Here, so it would seem, we have again an old and universal paradox. The artist, no longer embattled, sees his former necessities fall away, the public front to keep up, the principle to uphold. And that freedom he so long defended is now not indulged as something quite distinct, so much as naturally reconciled to the tradition. But that freedom is still there, even so.

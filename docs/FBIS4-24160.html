			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 23 SAPA -- South African President  Nelson Mandela has agreed to become involved in international  mediation attempts aimed at ending Angola's civil war. Mr  Mandela said at Tuynhuys on Thursday that he was prepared to  meet UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  leader Jonas Savimbi, preferably in South Africa.    Speaking after a meeting with United Nations Mediator  Alioune Blondin Beye and representatives of the United States,  Portuguese and Russian Governments, Mr Mandela said he would  first contact Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and then  Dr Savimbi.    "I would be happy to invite Dr Savimbi and to sit down and  have a discussion with him. I know Mr dos Santos' point of  view, but I've never had the honour of meeting Dr Savimbi. I am  prepared to see both parties in the near future," he said.    Mr Beye said Mr Mandela had been asked to become involved as  the leader of a nation that neighboured Angola and also had  substantial assets there. He said South Africa had  geographical, historical and political ties to Angola.    Mr Mandela said South African companies had invested in oil  and diamond mining in Angola, and an end to the civil war that  has raged since 1975 would be a positive advantage to South  Africa.    Mr Beye said the UN's priority was not to bring about a  direct meeting between Dr Savimbi and Mr dos Santos. It first  wanted to contact Mr dos Santos and then to set up a meeting  between Mr Mandela and Dr Savimbi.</p>

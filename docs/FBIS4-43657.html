			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riccardo Orizio: "Italy Supports Brittan and </F> Nominates a Number of Its Own Politicians and Academics in  Exchange"]    [Text] The arrangement was agreed last week by Foreign  Minister Antonio Marino during a secret meeting in Paris: For  the position of President of the European Commission -- the most  prestigious of the European prizes in this summer's great  sweepstake -- Italy will support the candidacy of British  outgoing European Commissioner Leon Brittan, who is Jacques  Delors' deputy, and who until now was considered to have fewer  chances than Belgian Prime Minister Jean- Luc Dehaene.    The agreement, confirmed by Brittan's spokesperson, marks  the  beginning of a sort of Italian-British axis as regards the  complex issue of the distribution of top positions in various  institutions, including the European Union, NATO, the OECD, and  the WTO [World Trade Organization] (GATT's successor).    Dehaene is being supported by both France (because he is a  federalist, and French-speaking), and Germany (because he is a  Christian Democrat). For his part [British Prime Minister]  Major is supporting Brittan, not because Major is convinced that  he will ultimately win, but rather, to prevent the Paris-Bonn  axis from achieving too much power. If Brittan is defeated,  London will demand a substantial consolation prize.    Dehaene's true rival is former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers. Chancellor Kohl tried to convince him to withdraw from  the contest by offering him the post of NATO secretary general,  but Kohl was unsuccessful. The decision will be made in Corfu  at a dinner which is likely to be stormy.    Italy will be presenting a long list of candidates, headed  by  former Foreign Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero, who is aiming for  the OECD, and the Socialist former head of government Giuliano  Amato, who is being considered for NATO. On the other hand, as  regards the European commissioners, Berlusconi's government is  preparing to replace outgoing Commissioners Ranieri Vanni  d'Archirafi and Antonio Ruberti. Two names that are being  mentioned are those of Romano Prodi and Mario Monti, the rector  of the Bocconi school. However, [Radical leader] Marco  Pannella, disappointed at not having been chosen as foreign  minister, is also aiming for a European position. Another likely  candidate is European Parliament Secretary General Antonio  Vinci, who is considered one of the most experienced and  powerful Eurocrats in Brussels.</p>

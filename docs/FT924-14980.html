			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japan's car industry 'at crossroads' - The opening of the Paris motor show THE JAPANESE motor industry 'may now be at a structural crossroads,' Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan, the second largest Japanese carmaker, warned yesterday. 'The global motor industry is facing a business climate of unprecedented severity,' he said. Amid worldwide recession, vehicle demand had dropped in all three of the world's major markets - Europe, the US and Japan. Nissan, which is this year expecting its first loss since 1946 and which is omitting its interim dividend, was being hit by falling sales in both domestic and foreign markets, which had 'been worse than anyone projected,' said Mr Tsuji. The Nissan president said the company was operating at less than 80 per cent of capacity in Japan, and three assembly lines had been reduced to single shift working. Mr Tsuji said Nissan was seeking to reduce its Japanese workforce by around 4,000 in the three years from 1992 to 1994 from 56,000 to 52,000. The company was planning to cut 8,500 jobs in Japan - 6,500 direct workers and 2,000 indirect and salaried jobs as a result of cost-cutting. However, around 4,500 new jobs would be added to compensate for reductions in working hours and to account for the greater complexity of making more up-market models. Working hours are to be cut from 2,100 hours a year at present (including overtime) to 1,900 hours a year by the end of 1994. This will reduce Japanese working hours to the present level of Nissan's European car assembly plant at Sunderland, north-east England, where assembly-line workers currently average around 1,900 hours a year, including 100 hours overtime. In Japan, Nissan has already cut the level of temporary workers to around 10 per cent of the direct labour force from the earlier industry average of 20 to 25 per cent. This will be cut further to around 5 per cent by the end of 1994. Mr Tsuji warned that there was 'little expectation that the market will recover quickly in the immediate future.' The company was facing 'a very difficult time with respect to profitability.' It was taking 'urgent steps' to improve its profit structure. Nissan is undertaking a drastic review of its product plans in order to cut the number of model variants and types of components offered. It plans to promote 'vigorously' the greater use of common parts among different car models.</p>

What are your guidelines for buying investment properties?  Currently I own two rental houses but am considering buying apartments and  maybe commercial buildings. What do you think of land investments?  </P> <P> ANSWER: My basic guidelines for buying investment property include buy "fixer  property," which will go up in value $2 for each $1 you spend on improvements;  make as small a cash down payment as possible to get the best terms and obtain  seller financing; buy properties in locations that you expect will appreciate  in market value, and aim for at least break-even cash flow from rentals.  </P> <P> This last guideline is hard to meet on rental houses but I don't mind a little  negative cash flow if the residence is appreciating nicely in market value.  </P> <P> The profit on rental houses usually comes from the resale , whereas profits  from apartments and commercial buildings come from net operating income and,  hopefully, resale profit, too.  </P> <P> I do not recommend investing in vacant land because it is very difficult to  finance and usually requires a large down payment, usually produces little or  no income and may never appreciate in market value. I prefer improved property,  especially well-located but run-down property that can be upgraded for  immediate increase in market value.  </P> <P> Use 'Lemonade' to Get Rid of Sour Deal  </P> <P> Q: Please help me. I recently inherited a one-sixth partnership share in an  apartment building. The estate executor tells me it is worth about $200,000.  But the other five partners do not want to sell the building, which produces a  nice cash flow. I have tried to sell my share to the other partners but the  best I can get requires a 20% discount. I want to use the money to buy a nice  home. Any suggestions?  </P> <P> A: As you have discovered, there is virtually no market for a one-sixth share  of an apartment building partnership. But that $160,000 offer for a $200,000  partnership share is very good. You might reconsider accepting it.  </P> <P> Another alternative is to offer to trade the partnership share as all or part  of your down payment on the home you want to buy. Many home sellers would love  such a big down payment, especially since it produces a good cash flow. But you  may have to sweeten your offer with a little cash, especially to pay the realty  agent's sales commission. This technique is called "lemonading."  </P> <P> Does It Matter to Be Realty Dealer?  </P> <P> Q: As an investor, I frequently buy and sell properties. I recall years ago it  used to be important to avoid being called a "real estate dealer." Since the  capital gains and ordinary income tax rates are now the same, does it matter  anymore?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Although I haven't heard of the IRS arguing much about dealer status  lately for very active realty investors who frequently buy and sell properties,  if you are declared to be a dealer then you would become ineligible for  depreciation of your properties and for tax-deferred exchanges. Those are the  two major disadvantages of being a realty dealer. Consult your CPA for further  details.  </P> <P> Be on Guard Against Property Milker  </P> <P> Q: About a year ago, we sold our apartment building and carried back a $225,000  second mortgage. All went well for about six months. Then our mortgage payments  stopped coming in. When I contacted the buyer, she said the building was  suffering high vacancies and she couldn't afford to pay us.  </P> <P> But I drove by the building and didn't see any vacancy sign. I phoned some of  my old tenants who still live there. They said the new owner has cut back on  maintenance and the building is going downhill rapidly. As far as they knew,  the apartments are all full. What can I do to get my money?  </P> <P> A: The new owner is obviously milking your former building by keeping the  rental income and failing to pay the expenses. Check with the first-mortgage  lender to see if payments are being made. If not, to prevent the first lender  from foreclosing and wiping out your second mortgage, your best protection is  to immediately begin foreclosure.  </P> <P> You may also be able to get a receiver appointed by the court to collect the  rents, operate the building and pay the expenses. You may already have waited  too long to consult a real estate attorney to start foreclosure.  </P> <P> Negligent Agent Is Liable for Thefts  </P> <P> Q: I live out of town and a local realty agent manages four rental houses for  me. When one was vacant, the agent gave the key to a prospective renter who  came to his office. The key was never returned. The next day the agent went to  the house and found it stripped of the appliances, new carpets, water heater  and even some of the light fixtures. The cost of restoring the house will be  about $4,000. Do you think the realty agent should pay?  </P> <P> A: Yes. The realty agent who manages your houses appears to have been grossly  negligent for giving out the key to a prospective renter without accompanying  him or at least taking identification, such as a copy of the prospect's  driver's license and holding some credit cards as security. Since the agent  breached his fiduciary duty to you, the agent should pay for your loss.  </P> <P> Be Prepared for IRS Tax-Deferral Challenge  </P> <P> Q: About a year ago, we tried to sell our home but were unable to do so because  of local economic conditions. So we rented the house. Now we want to sell as  the market has improved considerably. Will we be able to defer the tax on our  sale profit which we expect will be about $30,000?  </P> <P> A: Probably. As you surely know, Internal Revenue Code 1034 allows you to defer  your home sale tax when selling your principal residence if you buy a  replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost within 24 months  before or after the sale.  </P> <P> However, this law does not say if a temporary rental due to local economic  conditions will disqualify the tax deferral. But a Tax Court decision (Clapham  63 T.C. 505, 1975) allowed tax deferral in similar circumstances where the  seller took three years to sell his former residence which he rented in the  interim.  </P> <P> If you claim tax deferral be prepared for an IRS challenge which you may  successfully meet. Please consult your tax adviser for full details.  </P> <P> What Is Break-Even Point for Commercial?  </P> <P> Q: I am considering buying a mixed-use commercial and residential property. The  apartments are 95% full. But the commercial space is about 35% vacant, due to  absentee management. The seller is offering the property at eight times gross  income. Do you think this is a good buy?  </P> <P> A: Never, never, never buy income property based on its gross rent multiplier.  The reason is the gross multiplier does not consider the operating expenses and  debt service. The gross multiplier method of pricing income properties is used  by sellers who hope an inexperienced buyer will overpay for the investment.  </P> <P> Since the property has a very high vacancy factor, one approach to evaluating  it is to consider its break-even point. Based on realistic rents, not the  seller's projections which are probably far too high, calculate what rental  income is needed to break-even with operating expenses. Then evaluate the  probability of attaining at least the break-even point within six months.  </P> <P> Presuming the property is well-located and in basically sound condition,  another approach to evaluating income property is to capitalize its net income.  Be sure to include a realistic vacancy estimate. Use a capitalization rate for  the net operating income (excluding depreciation and mortgage payments) based  on recent sales prices of comparable nearby income properties.  </P> <P> Resale Market Slim for Partnerships  </P> <P> Q: Just before the 1986 Tax Reform Act, I invested $40,000 in a small real  estate limited partnership syndication of 12 investors. The property is doing  quite well and provides nice cash flow of about 12% annually.  </P> <P> However, the other investors have no intent of selling the building any time  soon. But I want to sell my share. I offered it to all the other investors and  they will pay me only a small fraction of my investment. I contacted Liquidity  Fund in Emeryville, Calif., which you recommended some time ago but they are  not interested. Any ideas?  </P> <P> A: One way to get rid of your limited partnership share is to offer it as all  or part of your down payment on real estate you may want to buy. But you may  have to sweeten your purchase offer with a little cash. However, be sure to  first consult your tax adviser about the tax consequences of such an offer.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J.

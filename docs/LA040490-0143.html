			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORMER TITAN STEWART SIGNS FOR TWO YEARS WITH OILERS  </P> <P> Alex Stewart, a former Cal State Fullerton defensive end who was released in  November by the Dallas Cowboys, has signed two one-year contracts with the  Houston Oilers, his agent, Jim Spellman, said Tuesday.  </P> <P> According to Spellman, Stewart, who was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in  the eighth round of the 1989 draft and sent to Dallas in the Herschel Walker,  will receive about $400,000 with incentives for two years.  </P> <P> "It's a great opportunity for me to contribute and play a lot," said Stewart,  who will report to the Oilers' mini-camp in May. "I'll worry about starting  when I get there."  </P> <P> Spellman said Stewart was in contention for a starting berth on the Vikings'  defensive line in 1989 but broke his hand a few weeks before the season. He was  traded to Dallas while he was still on the inactive list and spent his time  there on the Cowboys' six-man development squad.  </P> <P> Stewart was the subject of controversy last fall when the Fort Worth  Star-Telegram, quoting a "highly placed team source," said the Cowboys cut  Stewart in part because they suspected he was using steroids.  </P> <P> The newspaper also reported that "three other league sources," none of which  was named, confirmed that Stewart tested positive for steroids on a drug test  administered during the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Stewart denied those reports. "There was never a positive test and, as far as I  know, there were no problems with the test at the combine," he said. "Whatever  happened in Dallas is behind me, and I can't wait to play in Houston."  </P> <P> Stewart, 6-feet-4 and 262 pounds, played at Fullerton in 1988 after  transferring from USC. He had 21 tackles and 17 assists in eight games for the  Titans. But Stewart's stock rose when he played well in the 1989 Blue-Gray game  and earned defensive most valuable player honors at the 1988 Senior Bowl. MIKE  DiGIOVANNA  </P></p>

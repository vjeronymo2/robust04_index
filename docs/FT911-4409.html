			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Inland Steel hit by fall in demand LOW demand for cars and appliances slashed first-quarter results at Inland Steel Industries, the large Chicago-based steelmaker. The company reported a Dollars 40m net loss, or Dollars 1.50 per share, for the first quarter, against net income of Dollars 18.7m, or 37 cents, a year ago. The loss came on a 16 per cent decline in sales to Dollars 832.7m from Dollars 992.5m a year ago. Mr Frank Luerssen, chairman and chief executive, said the market for their principal products - sheets and bar steels used in consumer durables - was weak. Mr Luerssen, who was pessimistic about the near-term prospects of recovery, said he saw no indication of a US economic rebound in Inland's second-quarter order book. Quarterly shipments by the wholly-owned integrated steel subsidiary, Inland Steel Company, were the lowest in 20 years. Shipments fell during the first three months by 19 per cent, to 937,000 tons, while sales plummetted 20 per cent to Dollars 437.9m. Lower-priced product mixes, start-up costs for its new high-technology steel plant I/N Tek, a joint venture with Nippon Steel, and a 50-cents-per-hour rise in steel workers' wages all helped to push down Inland's results. The company's service division of materials distribution centres reported a profit of Dollars 5.9m, but this was down from Dollars 9.8m a year ago. For all of last year, Inland suffered a net loss of Dollars 20.6m, or Dollars 1.41 per share, its first full-year loss since 1985.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (8): Quirky offshoots gain respect - The growth of futures exchanges TWENTY years ago, futures exchanges were viewed as quirky offshoots of larger markets. Although still treated with suspicion in some quarters, futures exchanges have now positioned themselves at the heart of the world's financial markets. According to a recent report by the Group of Thirty, the Washington-based think-tank, the notional amount of futures traded annually is now estimated at Dollars 140,000bn. The growth of futures markets has been fuelled by the increased sophistication and internationalisation of financial markets, including the proliferation of complex over-the-counter products which are then hedged using exchange-traded products. In fact, the rapid development of financial markets in the past 20 years could arguably not have been realised without the growth of futures and options exchanges. As barriers between markets have fallen, and international investors have turned their attention to new markets, the establishment of futures contracts has been an important factor in ensuring liquidity and hedging opportunities. The new techniques developed in the derivatives markets have had an impact on investment management, trading, technology, and risk management. In spite of this success record, the exchanges themselves appear less than confident. In the US, the futures business is showing all the signs of a mature market  -margins are shrinking, competition is intense, and market share is being lost to younger European exchanges. But in Europe, too, in spite of annual volume growth of 40 per cent for many exchanges, exchanges are aware of new pressures. Mr Jorg Franke, chairman of the Deutsche Terminborse in Frankfurt, believes that with more than 20 futures and commodities exchanges, Europe has more exchanges than it needs. Although new products are still being launched, the flow is easing, as the pool of potential new products dries up. Without new contracts such as Italian bond futures, it will be more difficult for European exchanges to build volume. For all exchanges, the development in the past few years of an increasingly active over-the-counter market in products such as swaps and options, which can be used for some purposes instead of exchange-traded products, is a cause for concern. Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of OM London, believes the OTC market will continue to grow 'but some of their new products will be adapted for exchanges'. The most successful such attempt so far is the Chicago Board Options Exchange's FLEX options, which have exceeded Dollars 10bn in underlying notional value in the first seven months of trading. FLEX Options allow investors to use customised derivatives based on stock indices to select various terms such as strike price and maturity. Exchanges have also been trying to prepare themselves for a potentially more difficult environment by creating cross-trading agreements, linkages and even partnerships. One example is a grouping of smaller European exchanges, known as First European Exchanges (Fex). The only linkage currently in place is between OM London, the Swedish-owned electronic exchange, and the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam. Under that agreement, EOE members have OM screens on their desks in Amsterdam. However, OM members are linked to the EOE only by telephone. Not surprisingly, the flow of business from EOE members to OM has been the more significant. Fex's other plans have already faltered. In July, Switzerland's Soffex was forced to pull back from its linkage plans under pressure from Swiss banks which want to get their own electronic stock trading system in place first. Still in the early stages is a linkage of France's Matif and Germany's Deutsche Terminborse, using DTB screens. As these exchanges command some of the most actively traded contracts in Europe, this alliance could become a powerful force. The development of these linkages has fuelled discussion of technological developments. Such linkages only really function efficiently for products traded on a screen. Most large exchanges still trade using the traditional open-outcry method, which involves grouping traders in a large pit. Proponents of open-outcry trading claim that screen systems cannot cope with heavy volume. The success of the DTB has shown that screen trading does not necessarily mean illiquid trading. Nevertheless, most traders familiar with both methods prefer trading using the open-outcry method. Some, though, say that it is only a matter of time before the technology of screen-trading is sufficiently advanced to be able to simulate pit-trading. Despite its shaky start, the most important development in exchange trading so far this decade was the launch last year of Globex, the international after-hours screen trading system jointly developed by Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. Volume on the system jumped when France's Matif, the only exchange to join the system so far, added its products earlier this year; but much of the volume was a direct shift of business from the Matif's over-the-counter after-hours market, which closed at the same time as Matif products moved on to Globex. Globex has also been dogged by squabbles between the two exchanges, and failure to reach agreement with other potential members of the system, particularly Liffe. Nevertheless, the description of the system at its launch by Mr Leo Melamed, then head of Globex, as 'the dawn of a new era', could still prove true. The Chicago exchanges point out that the system cannot be judged to have failed until it has screens all over the world, as envisaged in their original vision of a global trading village. 'How do you sell hot dogs in Japan when you don't even have a hot dog stand there?' asks Mr Jack Sandner, head of the CME. Globex has only recently received regulatory approval to install screens in Asia, which is potentially the key time-zone for the after-hours market, and is starting a marketing thrust in the region. Nevertheless, the success of the system will also depend on attracting other exchanges to list their products. The recent reopening of talks between Liffe and Globex is clearly a hopeful sign, but the battle for a critical mass of volume on the system has yet to be won.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VOLUME ON INTERNATIONAL FUTURES AND OPTIONS EXCHANGES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Number of contracts traded                                         Jan-Dec 1991    Jan-Dec 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chicago Board of Trade                   139,437,140     150,030,460 Chicago Mercantile Exchange              108,128,604     134,238,555 Liffe, UK                                 38,583,877      71,977,025 Matif, France                             36,978,966      55,474,238 New York Mercantile Exchange              40,786,714      47,212,417 BM&amp;F, Brazil                              18,768,564      35,072,146 DTB, Germany                              15,369,730      34,842,778 London Metal Exchange                     16,937,909      24,736,920 Osaka Securities Exchange                 33,478,949      21,184,310 Sydney Futures Exchange                   12,496,018      17,557,685 Stockholm Options Exchange                13,442,850      17,147,096 Tokyo Intl Financial Futures Exchange     15,149,104      15,540,487 Tokyo Stock Exchange                      16,601,899      14,538,717 Tokyo Comm Exchange Industry              14,949,199      13,585,379 Commodity Exchange, Inc                   15,123,655      12,673,179 Tokyo Grain Exchange                       9,699,883      12,416,671 Simex, Singapore                           6,068,044      12,180,174 Intl Petroleum Exchange, UK                8,412,689      10,674,803 Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange             9,494,734       9,275,708 Soffex, Switzerland                        6,971,740       9,258,859 Osaka Grain Exchange                       4,123,743       5,441,392 European Options Exch, Amsterdam           3,469,945       3,856,247  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Futures Industry Association (provided by exchanges); excludes individual equity options  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Caste law upheld India's Supreme Court yesterday upheld a federal order reserving government jobs for low-caste Hindus, a decree that had prompted dozens of high-caste students to commit suicide in protest, AP reports from new Delhi. The court was ruling on appeals against the August 1990 decision by former Prime Minister VP Singh to hold 27 per cent of jobs for the low-caste. The present government of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, which came to power in June 1991, endorsed Singh's policy. However, action was halted while the Supreme Court weighed arguments that the quota was unconstitutional. Another 22.5 per cent of government jobs previously were set aside for untouchables. In a separate order, the nine-judge court asked the government not to increase the total job quotas beyond 50 per cent.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Pension law review soon THE GOVERNMENT is prep-aring to announce a review of legislation on pensions, under an independent chairman, beside interim measures to aid victims of the depleted Maxwell pension funds, Ivo Dawnay writes. In spite of growing pressure from MPs, the terms of the review may not be set out until next week to allow ministers time to prepare their response to the highly critical inquiry into pensions legislation conducted by the Commons social services committee under the chairmanship of Mr Frank Field. Many of the committee's recommendations for tighter controls on fund management are expected to be taken up. Steps to help the Maxwell pensioners are also expected shortly.</p>

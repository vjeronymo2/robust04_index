			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Bonn braced for ruling on treaty: The court verdict on Maastricht is expected next Tuesday BARRING last-minute flood or pestilence, Germany's constitutional court will rule next Tuesday on whether the Maastricht treaty on European union is in conformity with the country's basic law. The date has been confirmed by senior officials of the court, while reserving the right to change it at the last minute if the eight learned red-robed judges in the court's second senate so decide. Whatever happens, both supporters and opponents of the Maastricht treaty are on tenterhooks - the decision could allow Germany to ratify the treaty, or ratify with strings attached. The question is just how tough the conditions would be. The concern in government circles in Bonn is that the court may attach strict conditions, severely restricting Germany's room for manoeuvre in any future negotiations on further integration in the European Community. Such restrictions would be profoundly embarrassing for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as one of the most enthusiastic proponents of Maastricht, but not necessarily fatal for the ratification process. Opponents of the treaty, who have tabled 20 separate complaints before the constitutional court, still hope, but do not really expect, that the court may yet decide that the entire treaty be declared void under the constitution. 'We are in suspense,' says Mr Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in Brussels, and now the treaty's most prominent opponent before the court. 'At the very least, I cannot believe that the constitutional court will accept the automatic process leading to the final phase of European economic and monetary union.' Mr Brunner, who was sacked from his job in Brussels for campaigning against the treaty, hopes the court may decide there should be no final move to Emu without a referendum in Germany. Given opposition to a single European currency - 71 per cent were against the abolition of the D-Mark in the latest opinion poll - such a referendum would probably reject German participation in Emu. Such a drastic condition imposed by the court is still regarded as unlikely. The Foreign Ministry sees three possible outcomes: that the Maastricht treaty is constitutionally acceptable, but that any future steps to transfer national sovereignty to EC institutions must be subject to more restrictive conditions; that the treaty must be subject to specific legally-binding 'interpretations' to ensure that it is in conformity with the constitution; that the deposition of Germany's ratification documents in Rome must be accompanied by unilateral declarations stating that they apply to Germany only to the extent permitted by the country's written constitution. If the court does decide on the last course of action, it could present a difficulty to the government, for no other EC member state has sought unilaterally to define the application of the treaty. 'We have made it clear to the court that we cannot reopen the treaty,' a senior government official said yesterday. 'But nobody has deposited such unilateral declarations before.' The other EC member states would almost certainly have to decide if special German conditions would amount to a form of treaty amendment. The main grounds of challenge to the treaty tabled by Mr Brunner and other challengers, including Green members of the European Parliament and a senior Justice Ministry official, are that it offends inalienable rights in the German constitution by transferring national sovereignty to institutions over which ordinary German citizens have no control. Mr Brunner also complains that a new article in the German constitution, on future transfers of sovereignty to Brussels to build a real European union, fails to contain adequate constitutional safeguards.</p>

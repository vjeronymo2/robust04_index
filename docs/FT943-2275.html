			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Japan Tobacco attracts strong demand for shares Individual investors showed strong interest in buying Japan Tobacco shares when they are listed on Japan's eight stock exchanges on October 27, though foreigners appeared less keen. The ministry of finance, which will announce winners in the lottery for shares on October 4, said yesterday that Japan Tobacco attracted buy applications for 21.15m shares against 436,666 shares available, with individuals accounting for 21.05m. Foreign investors applied for only 4,764 shares, and institutional investors for 85,835, the ministry said. A Japan Tobacco employees' shareholding group sought 7,000. In spite of the large number of subscriptions, however, many analysts are bearish over the demand for Japan Tobacco. Some imply that intensive sales by brokers could have pushed the number of subscriptions higher than genuine demand since a single investor was allowed to place orders for up to 9,999 shares, but is not obligated to buy them even if they win the lottery. 'Given what happened with Japan Telecom, there's a lot of anxiety with foreign investors towards new issues,' said Ms Patricia Horvath of UBS Securities.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM upbeat on 'green' targets MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday claimed that 'the environmental buck stops in our backyard' and said he wanted Britain to take the lead internationally in implementing the targets of last June's Rio Earth Summit. Opening the Global Technology Partnership conference in Birmingham, the prime minister announced a package of measures to help businesses adopt new technology and to encourage energy efficiency. The UK would also publish its plan for 'sustainable development' - one of the policies agreed at Rio - by the end of the year, he said. Opposition MPs and environmentalists attacked the new-technology measures as insubstantial and said the energy efficiency schemes were not new and would do little to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Mr Andrew Lees of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, called the speech an own-goal. 'Now that Mr Major has claimed that the buck stops here he cannot make the UK's target of returning CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 conditional on similar action by other countries,' Mr Lees said. The new measures announced are: A global technology partnership initiative 'to create a green virtuous spiral of growth and higher environmental standards.' The scheme will run for three years, and wants British companies to help counterparts in industrialising countries 'to bypass old technologies and to move straight to cleaner processes.' A hands-on training scheme, through which the Department of Trade and Industry will meet half of the costs of British companies offering training to executives from companies overseas. Eligible costs include training, including travel to and from the UK, accommodation and medical insurance. Mr Major also drew attention to the Energy Management Assistance Scheme, in operation since April 1992 to encourage energy efficiency in small businesses. Companies with up to 500 employees worldwide can apply for grants from the Department of the Environment to cover up to 10 per cent of the costs of energy efficiency projects which offer a good chance of achieving energy savings of more than 10 per cent. The department's energy efficiency office has received 1,000 applications and payments to companies are running at Pounds 15,000 a week. He also highlighted the Energy Saving Trust, intended to identify ways in which the gas and electricity utilities can help householders save energy. Mr Chris Smith, the shadow environment secretary, said: 'There is little that is new here - it clearly does not amount to a national energy efficiency policy'. He said the trust had been 'very slow to get off the ground'.</p>

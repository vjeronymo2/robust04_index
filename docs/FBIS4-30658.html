			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edu Lopez and F.V. Maragay] </F>   [Text] President Ramos yesterday issued Executive Order  [EO] No. 182 allowing foreigners to invest in more areas of the  local economy.    EO 182 dovetailed with the announcement of the National  Economic Development Authority [NEDA] yesterday that "List C" of  the First Regular Investment Negative List (RFINL) [as  published] would be "empty" or a total blank because no petition  from local industries was filed as of the deadline on 31 August  1993.    "This is a development welcomed by the investing community  because there are no further restrictions being made by the  government on the investment environment," NEDA said in a  statement.    List C, which was approved by NEDA last 21 June, was  intended  to be a list of investment areas that existing local industries  have adequately filled and are therefore off-limits to foreign  investors. Since list C is a total blank, only negative lists A  and B remain.    List A includes areas in which foreign ownership is limited  by mandate of the Constitution and specific nationalization  laws. List B contains investment areas where foreign ownership  Is limited for purposes of public health and safety and to  protect small and medium-sized domestic market enterprises.    Among the restricted areas in List A are mass media,  licensed  professions, cooperatives, utilization of natural resources and  public utilities. List B includes manufacturers of weapons and  explosives, dangerous drugs, small and medium scale domestic  market enterprises and export enterprises which utilize raw  materials from depleting natural resources.    Pursuant to RA [Republic Act] 7042, no foreign equity is  allowed in mass media, retail trade, cooperatives, private  security agencies, small-scale mining, utilization of marine  resources and rice and corn industry.    Industries where 40 percent foreign equity may be allowed  include exploration, development and utilization of natural  resources; ownership of private lands, operation and management  of public utilities; ownership and establishment of educational  institutions, and financing companies regulated by the  Securities and Exchange Commission.    Manufacture, repair, storage and distribution of products  and  ingredients used for manufacturing firearms, gunpowder, dynamite  and blasting supples. [sentence as published]    Manufacture and distribution of dangerous drugs; sauna and  steam bath houses, massage clinics; certain forms of gambling  like race track operations and racehorse ownership and  importation domestic market enterprises with paid-in equity  capital of less than the equivalent of $500,000 unless they  involve advanced technology; and export enterprises which  utilize raw materials from depleting natural resources and with  paid-in equity capital on less than $500,000.    EO 182 means that foreign investors would then be allowed to  invest in such formerly restricted businesses as travel  agencies, tourist lodging services (pension houses and tourist  inns), convention and conference organizing, life and non-life  insurance business including professional insurance services and  reinsurance brokerage.    The Federation of Philippine Industries (FPI) headed by  businessman Raul T. Concepcion had protested NEDA's decision to  close the "List C" of the RFINL on the ground that local  businessmen were not adequately informed that they had to submit  petitions for entries in the list.    The Cabinet cluster-B, however, turned down FPI's petition  for an extension of the period for filing of petitions for  inclusion in "List C," citing that ample announcements had been  made and sufficient time was given for the filing of petitions.    NEDA argued that adequate exploitation by Philippine  nationals as a criterion for determining foreign equity  participation should not be at the expense of the majority of  Filipino consumers whose interests should also be of primary  concern.    "Adequate capacity" is not a sound basis for excluding  foreign investments in a particular sector, NEDA said.  Restricting entry in an industry on the basis of "adequate  capacity" encourages existing firms with high-cost production  techniques to continue operating at the expense of consumers, it  said.    A foreign company would enter if it has something better to  offer and can compete with the existing firms by offering  quality products at lower prices that would benefit consumers  and domestic producers, NEDA added.    The Board of Investments (BOI) had stopped using "adequate  capacity" as a criterion because it would only enable existing  enterprises to exercise monopoly powers.</p>

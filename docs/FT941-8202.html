			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo While the sluggishness of the Japanese economy remains unchanged, Japanese government bond prices may lose ground on supply and demand factors. Profit-taking ahead of the March book-closing by life assurers and banks is expected to accelerate, depressing long bond prices. The Japan Securities Dealers' Association, says trust banks became net sellers of government and corporate bonds in January for the first time in a year, selling a net Y368.5bn. City, or commercial, banks were net sellers for the fourth consecutive month, while long-term credit banks were net sellers for the third straight month. An increase in supply of medium-term corporate bonds is also adding to the lack of appetite for government bonds among institutional investors, while hedge selling on the futures market by underwriters has been weighing on the market. Traders are also cautious ahead of an increase in issuance of municipal bonds over the coming months. However, the Bank of Japan is increasingly wary of a further rise in medium and long-term interest rates while the slump in business confidence continues. Some traders hope that the central bank will allow short-term money rates, which are already at record lows, to ease further, thus supporting bond prices.</p>

Even an ordinary opera-lover, unfamiliar with the Polish composer's virtually unknown sole, full length opera, might have found it worth a trip to Palermo last month where he could have heard not only a more-than-respectable performance of the piece but also could have seen the city that largely inspired it. Like so many Northern artists, Szymanowski loved Southern Italy, and Sicily in particular, seeing the sensual, scented island as a Dionysian antidote to his cold, stern, inhibited homeland. In choosing the Norman king Roger II as their emblematic hero, Szymanowski and his librettist Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz gave themselves ample occasion to surround the intimate conflict of the introspective king with Byzantine colour and pagan solarity.</p>

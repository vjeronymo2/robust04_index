			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Regalian confidence after sales REGALIAN Properties yesterday told shareholders it had agreed the sale of eight flats in its Kensington Palace Gardens development, its ambitious residential project that has been on the market for the last two years. Sale prices of the flats were not disclosed, but analysts believed they were equivalent to a reduction in the building's value from an initial asking price of Pounds 117m two years ago to about Pounds 45m. The flats are being bought by Hong Kong and Middle Eastern clients, who were encouraged to purchase in the UK by the devaluation of sterling. Mr David Goldstone, chairman of Regalian, said there was substantial interest in the other 12 apartments in the block. Sales of the remaining residential portfolio continued to be buoyant, he said. 'It is confidently expected that in respect of both the Kensington Palace Gardens project and the Central London portfolio, the majority of remaining units will be disposed of within the current financial year.' Regalian's banks have agreed in principle to extend its facilities until December 1994. The company said that its improved cashflow resulting from property sales would give it the opportunities to buy development sites on attractive terms. The shares price rose from 15 1/4 p to 19p.</p>

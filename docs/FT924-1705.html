			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Members back merger of public-service unions THE three-way merger between Britain's main public-service unions has been overwhelmingly backed by the members of three unions. About 550,000 out of a possible electorate of 1.5m voted and by a margin of four to one endorsed the creation of Unison, which will function from next July. Unison - formed out of Nalgo, which predominates in local government, and Nupe and Cohse, both with their roots in the health service - will be the largest union in Britain, underlining the extent to which union membership is now concentrated in the public sector. Mr Alan Jinkinson, the Nalgo general secretary who will lead the new union until February 1996, said yesterday: 'This is a historic day for our three unions and for Britain's cash-starved public services.' Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, the current Nupe leader, is expected to take over as leader when Mr Jinkinson retires. Unison is breaking new ground among larger unions by having 44 out of its 67 executive seats reserved for women and 13 of those reserved for women on low pay. About two thirds of the merged union's members will be women. One of the strongest arguments put by supporters of the merger was that a radical union shake-up was required as a response to the changes in the health service and local government, especially the decentralisation of bargaining. Cohse and Nupe, which are both affiliated to the Labour Party, will merge their political funds. Nalgo, which is not affiliated, will continue to have a separate political fund.</p>

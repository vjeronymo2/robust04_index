			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Husni Mubarak by </F> AL-HAWADITH Chief Editor Milhim Karam in Cairo, originally  published by the London-based AL-HAWADITH magazine, issue not  given; date of interview not given]    [Text] [Karam] In your opinion, what will happen with  regard to the peace process?    [Mubarak] Despite what has recently happened and despite the  difficulties attending the negotiations, which is natural, we  consider the peace process a basic issue for all Palestinians  and the whole region.    I believe that the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is a  terrible tragedy. We were all deeply hurt by it. The person who  committed this crime was an extremist and we all know how every  extremist behaves.    I expect the peace process to continue; in fact, I am  confident it will. I also know very well that the Palestinian  and Israeli leaders need peace, and extremists in any part of  this world do not want peace because they thrive in an  atmosphere of extremism. However, the peace process must  progress.    [Karam] What happens after peace?    [Mubarak] There has to be effective cooperation in the  interests of the people. The French and the Germans were  arch-enemies but common interests imposed cooperation upon them.  The issue is not one of friendship, fraternity, and love; that  is another issue among the countries of the region. There are  mutual and shared interests and we all need to cooperate on them.    [Karam] What do you think about the growth of fundamentalism  in the region?    [Mubarak] Fundamentalism in the region requires the  attention of the leaders. It also requires firmness.  Fundamentalism has existed for some time. It was never given  the attention it merits. This was the case in Algeria, and today  Algeria is suffering from this problem. The same applies to  Tunisia as well, but the Tunisian leadership under Zine El  Abidine Ben Ali has succeeded in muzzling and containing the  growth of fundamentalism. This phenomenon also emerged in  Egypt, but they are not Muslims in the real sense of the word.    They are all a batch of dangerous mercenary criminals  manipulated from abroad. They are paid by some people who want  to create unrest in Egypt and in the region. These sides are  spending large amounts of money to implement their schemes. The  Hebron operation is extremism par excellence. Extremism exists  not only in our region but in the United States, England, and  Australia. I do not wish to mention other countries.    [Karam] You mentioned that it should be paid due and careful  attention. Does this mean that some leaderships have neglected  this problem?    [Mubarak] I cannot call it negligence, but the leaders need  to realize that some nongovernmental bodies with huge funds at  their disposal are carrying out suspicious acts. We need to  know how these funds are spent. In the end, extremism will bite  the hand that feeds it.    Can you believe that the nongovernmental societies that  solicit contributions spend these contributions only on building  mosques? Bear in mind that these societies use mosques as a  pretext to plant extremism in the countries where they build the  mosques. They form hotbeds and cells in the various regions.  When these hotbeds get stronger, they make their move.    [Karam] Don't you think that the lack of remedies for  economic problems and poor living conditions are the cause of  these movements' growth?    [Mubarak] They might be a secondary factor, but not the  basic  factor. Economic crises and unemployment existed in the past  and economic problems have always existed worldwide. Why have  these movements appeared only now? I remember we had the  problem of a continually rising cost of living during my student  days. It is not possible for a government employee to own a  villa and a car and live in total comfort on his salary. A  government employee's salary is small because it comes from the  state's revenue, from taxes and customs duties.    [Karam] What is Egypt's attitude toward the new world order?    [Mubarak] What order? You should ask what Egypt's attitude  is toward the new chaotic system. It is a chaotic system;  today's world is chaotic. Is what is happening in Russia a new  world order? Is what is happening in the eastern bloc a new  world order? Is what is happening in Iran and Afghanistan a new  world order? Is what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina a new  world order? Do the conspiracies we see today indicate a new  world order? The term is wrong; I call it the new chaotic  system. Today's system is not permanent; it is transitional,  and the final shape of the world order is not clear yet. China  is still growing stronger, Japan's trade is prospering. There  is a conflict between the United States and Japan. Indonesia is  still making progress in development. Russia is still living in  the shadow of nuclear and nonnuclear conflicts. The process is  far from clear and will need a long time to settle down. We  must not feel optimistic about the appearance of a new world  order in view of the chaos in which we are living today. The  international order will come only after the chaotic system ends.    [Karam] Your Excellency, as OAU chairman, could you please  speak to us about Africa's aspirations?    [Mubarak] Development is scant in Africa. The continent is  still suffering endless problems and will need great efforts and  many years to overcome them. We are trying hard, something we  began to do at the last summit, to end the current conflicts and  disputes, which are mostly border disputes. Had they abided by  the OAU summit's resolution of the 1960's... [sentence  unfinished as published] May 'Abd-al-Nasir rest in peace. He  used to say all African countries must accept the borders drawn  by the colonialists and that they must not be at each other's  mercy. Problems persist in Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan.    [Karam] What does the South want form the North?    [Mubarak] Dialogue. We do not want the North to buy raw  materials from the South at cheap prices and sell commodities at  exorbitant prices that the South cannot afford to buy. This is  only one of several examples. A dialogue must be held between  the South and North. It is unreasonable for the North to live  in luxury while the South can hardly subsist.    [Karam] Egypt is a member of the Group of 15. Is this a  nucleus for the South to reach a unified stance?    [Mubarak] That is possible, because all members of the Group  of 15 are from the South.    [Karam] What about reconciliation in Somalia?    [Mubarak] There are numerous problems there. The African  summit sought to set up a committee to settle the Somali  problems. There are problems impeding our work. We hosted a  meeting of certain rival Somali factions, but not Farah Aidid,  who did not wish to come. As chairman of the OAU, I speak  fairly and neutrally and I do not take sides with any party. I  do not support Mahdi against Aidid or vice versa. We are  working to achieve Somali unity. The rival factions must agree  among themselves so that their people can lead a stable life.  If the leaders fail to agree, the people will not be able to  lead normal lives. Our goal is to work out a way for the rival  factions to reach an agreement and form a government that can  take care of the people's interests.    [Karam] What about Sudan and Hala'ib?    [Mubarak] What about Hala'ib? They raised this issue during  President al-Sadat's as well as 'Abd-al-Nasir's eras. Now they  are raising the issue with me. They want to fabricate a case  against us. Al-Turabi wants to trump up a problem. They are  free to do what they want, but we have no problems.    [Karam] What about the Nonaligned Movement and the Group of  77?    [Mubarak] They are all aligned. Small countries need big  ones to help them in their development plans. That is what  brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said. He is right; all the  members are aligned. These days alignment concerns to whom and  against whom. The Nonaligned Movement has lost its reasons for  existing.    [Karam] Will the Hebron Mosque massacre recur?    [Mubarak] I pray to God it will not recur against anyone --  be they Muslims, Christians, or Jews.    [Karam] And the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in al-Zuq?    [Mubarak] That was also a painful massacre for all of us.  People are getting mad. What have innocent people done? Why  has the criminal entered the mosque to kill people? Why have  they entered the church to kill people? Worshipers went to holy  places to pray to their God, but had a date with death instead.  Is this acceptable?    If a Muslim makes a mistake, then let us deal with him  personally. If a Christian makes a mistake, then let us deal  with and punish him personally. If a Jew makes a mistake, let  us deal with him personally and not butcher people at random.    [Karam] Since we mentioned Lebanon, what about Resolution  425  and peace, especially as Egypt has responded to the Arab League  resolution in Damascus to help Lebanon in its dealings with the  Arab countries. What is the extent of this help?    [Mubarak] We are committed to this aid and the time will  come  to send it to Lebanon.    Regarding the issue of peace, we have been working for peace  in Lebanon in all international circles even before the peace  process began. When Shim'on Peres was prime minister, I spoke  with him about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. He was  convinced and drew up the withdrawal plan. He told me: If you  guarantee that not a single Katyusha will be fired at northern  Israel, then I will withdraw immediately. Peres also told me:  I do not want to stay in Lebanon. An Israeli withdrawal must  be provided for in the peace process.    [Karam] Is the peace process serious and imminent?    [Mubarak] Of course, but it requires some time. Let us not  forget that this issue is 45 years old and we should not expect  it to be resolved immediately.    Of course there are obstacles, but peace is coming. The  Palestinian issue is the crux.    [Karam] Is the Israeli Government in danger and will  extremism triumph in Israel?    [Mubarak] I do not believe that extremism will win in  Israel.  Either Israeli or Palestinian extremism might delay the peace  process, but they will not sabotage it because peace is the just  demand of the peoples, who want to live.    [Karam] What is the fate of the negotiations with Israel?    [Mubarak] They are part of the peace process. Israel and the  Palestinians are supposed to meet in the United States in order  to act on what they decided on in Cairo. They almost ended all  the differences. The agreement that they reach in the United  States will later be signed in Cairo.    [Karam] Will Lebanon and Syria reach a solution with Israel  on its withdrawal from the Golan and the south?    [Mubarak] I am confident that these two issues will be  solved.    [Karam] What about Iraq's status; and how are the current  ties between Egypt and Iraq?    [Mubarak] We feel sorry for the Iraqi people. We are against  the partitioning of Iraq. Our stand on this issue is firm and  clear-cut. We support the Iraqi people, who cannot eke out  their livelihood. What pains us is that the Iraqi people are an  Arab Muslim people. Had Saddam Husayn heeded my words and  honest advice, nothing would have happened. His position could  have grown even stronger and that Iraq's strength could have  been an additional force in support of the Arab force.    [Karam] What about Egypt's relations with Saudi Arabia?    [Mubarak] Our relations with Saudi Arabia and all the other  Gulf states are good and fraternal.    [Karam] And what about your relations with Iran?    [Mubarak] We have no relations with Iran. We were about to  exchange ambassadors a year ago. But obviously they differed  among themselves. Velayati said he would open an embassy  office. I told him: No thank you; we do not need embassy  offices.    [Karam] What about your relations with Lebanon and Syria?    [Mubarak] They are integrated, fraternal relations.    [Karam] What do you think of the situation in Algeria, and  what about the Lockerbie issue?    [Mubarak] I hope that our brothers in Algeria, led by  President Zeroual, will end the rancorous extremism that is  bound to nullify all the people's potentials. All sides, if  they wish to preserve their country, must sit together with the  president and talk about solutions that will end the problems.    As for the Lockerbie issue, we made strenuous efforts, but  the world is currently preoccupied with the security of Bosnia  and Somalia. I hope we will find a solution that will enable  Libya to end the issue, because handing over citizens is  difficult and sensitive.    [Karam] Has communism ended? And what about Egypt's  relations with Russia today?    [Mubarak] Egypt's relations with Russia are very good. It's  my policy to establish good relations with all countries. I do  not want to be anyone's enemy. Only Iran is hostile to Egypt.  We are not hostile to Iran. We did not even sever ties with  Sudan, which cooperates with Iran.    There are 4 million Sudanese citizens in Egypt, maybe more.  President al-Bashir once told me that there are only 120,000  Sudanese in Egypt. I told him: I can send them to you so that  you can count them.    As for communism, we cannot say that it has ended. It is  developing so as to be in line with the new world order, or the  new chaotic order.    [Karam] Has tourism suffered a setback in Egypt? Have the  fundamentalists' acts of violence frightened tourists away?    [Mubarak] Yes. The number of tourists visiting Egypt has  decreased. The fundamentalists -- whom I call terrorists --  have nothing to do with religion. None of them memorizes a  single Koranic verse. Egypt's civilization goes back 7,000  years, so Egypt will not be crippled by a group of terrorists.  Egypt is not just Husni Mubarak: There are a million Mubaraks  and leaders in Egypt. The terrorists will have no impact on this  state, which believes in its democratic course.    [Karam] Has the Egyptian economy suffered a recession as a  result?    [Mubarak] Recession is affecting all countries of the world  and not Egypt alone. There is recession in Europe, the United  States, and all other countries.    [Karam] Those who like you say that President Mubarak is  inimitably easy going, that is, his cards are on the table.  Despite this, he plays his cards well, puzzling other players.  President Mubarak's approach is that he does not despair if  there is little hope. He does not show his emotions and always  maintains his poise. How have you managed to combine all these  qualities?    [Mubarak] This is my way of life, since I started work, when  I was a pilot. I have always been patient, thought ahead, and  planned for the future. I do not look just at what is under my  nose but ahead. I not only work for tomorrow but for what comes  after tomorrow. If I merely wanted to work for tomorrow, people  would stand in line and applaud me, but when I am gone there  would be a collapse. I think of the future generations. I do  not want to be egoistic, but I want those who come after me to  live. I do not just seek my own good. Had the infrastructure  been taken care of before, I would not have had to spend 100  billion pounds on rebuilding it. We would have a more prosperous  life, but this is our fate. After we finished with war, we  began to work to enable our people to live. We built the  infrastructure and then the new cities, factories, agricultural  projects, and production sites for the Egyptian people.    [Karam] What are you doing to resolve the problem of the  1.25  million people born in Egypt every year?    [Mubarak] That number is currently decreasing and we are  trying to create many jobs for Egypt's sons.    [Karam] Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat has repeatedly  described Egypt as a full partner of the Palestinians. How does  Egypt view its role within this framework?    [Mubarak] The Palestinian issue is our own; we have adopted  it. We were attacked several times for adopting this stance. We  still defend the Palestinian issue; we cannot go back on our  support for the Palestinians.    [Karam] You played a personal and effective role in  concluding the Cairo agreement at a time when the talks had  almost failed. Did the problem lie in the Palestinians' refusal  to abandon the Oslo agreement or in their bypassing of that  agreement?    [Mubarak] We tried to help the Palestinians when they  reached  a dead end and asked for our help. We spoke with the Israelis  and solved the obstacle to the talks.    [Karam] Some moderate Palestinian parties saw in the Cairo  agreement an unwarranted concession on their part. What is the  Egyptian view of this?    [Mubarak] You have to get a foothold and then ask for more.  Public opinion must know that coexistence will happen.    [Karam] There is a prevailing belief that the Cairo  agreement  was lax on the issue of the existence of the settlements and the  settlers' freedom of movement during the transitional stage, as  this would strengthen their presence even in the final stage.  This entails the building of roads and bridges that will cost  too much and are unjustifiable. If the transitional period is  to last just three years, why build bridges and roads?    [Mubarak] We have nothing to do with the details; they are  the affairs of the two sides. As to the first part of the  question, I say that you cannot demand the removal of the  settlements on the first day of your entry. First you have  first to enter and settle down. The contacts will lead to a  solution of the settlement issue and both sides will reject this  issue. [sentence as published] Had they accepted the principles  of the Camp David agreement, they would have found that there  were only four settlements in 1978, and these were very small.    Today there are 180 settlements and they are all very large.  The settlement issue is not an easy one, but very difficult. We  were late in agreeing to start of the peace negotiations.    [Karam] What are the effects of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre on the Cairo agreement? Some people are saying that  this agreement is finished now that the failure of the Israeli  protection for it has been shown?    [Mubarak] The Cairo agreement was an affirmation of some  principles of the Oslo agreement. We negotiated here to resolve  the details of the issues and were almost finished. I expect  the negotiations to resume soon, once things calm down, and that  the parties will sign the agreement.    I do not pay attention to statements and rumors that come  from here or there. The one making a statement might want to  sow unrest between the Palestinians and Israelis so that they  will become more intransigent. But we are fully conscious of  this. I tell the Palestinians: Get a foothold first, and then  make further demands. Today the Palestinians are talking while  they are outside their territories. When I am on the outside,  my words are weaker than when I am speaking on the inside.    [Karam] Are you happy with the Palestinian coordination  with the Arab sides directly concerned with the peace  negotiations? Egypt, and you personally, played a major role in  bringing the PLO closer to Syria and Jordan.    [Mubarak] There must be cooperation and coordination. I have  a mission to carry out, namely: unity.    [Karam] If the al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre is not enough --  as  seems to be the case judging by Israeli statements -- to gain  vital concessions during the negotiations, do the Palestinians  still have a chance to make better gains and to overcome the  breaches in the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and how?    [Mubarak] I hope that some of the existing problems will be  solved. The two sides are discussing the details of the  agreement; there is no real problem. We have made a big stride.    [Karam] Why is no Arab summit being held to deal with the  Arab situation, and what are the real obstacles impeding the  convening of such a summit?    [Mubarak] We do not do not have an Arab summit absolutely  every year. Arab divisions after the invasion and occupation of  Kuwait caused a split in the Arab world.    At the same time, we see that Abu-'Ammar has visited Saudi  Arabia to perform the minor pilgrimage. I expect that King  Husayn will make a similar visit. I have talked with brother  King Fahd concerning Abu-'Ammar and King Husayn. But when I  talk with King Fahd, some people think that I am trying to turn  him against them. This is absolutely untrue. I contact Arab  brothers and the outside world to serve the Arab nation. I also  managed to bring the views of Presidents Clinton and al-Asad  closer.    [Karam] The Arab delegations have suspended their  participation in the peace talks in protest of the al-Ibrahimi  massacre. And now that Egypt has asked the UN Security Council  to form an committee to investigate the massacre, what, in your  opinion, should be done to resume the negotiations and to end  the stalemate engulfing them in order to reach a real,  all-embracing, just, and comprehensive peace? And are we still  likely to see the real beginning of peace in 1994?    [Mubarak] I am confident that this year will see the real  beginning of peace. The delay in the peace negotiations is  regrettable. The Arab countries did not ask for a suspension of  the negotiations. Rather they asked for a postponement of the  negotiations in consideration of Palestinian feelings. Everyone  demands peace.    We cannot give up on peace because of the massacre, for this  would mean the triumph of brute force. We condemn this massacre  and we demand that measures be adopted to prevent any similar  massacres. But it is inadmissible to stop the peace process  because of this massacre.    [Karam] Do you see any links between the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre in Hebron and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church  massacre in Lebanon?    [Mubarak] I do not have enough information about these two  massacres, but both are tragedies.    [Karam] What do you believe is the ideal solution for the  future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and for ending the Muslims' tragedy  there? What role must the United Nations and the big Western  powers play to deal with this crisis? Will the intervention of  NATO speed up the solution, and in whose favor?    [Mubarak] All I can say here is that the isolation of the  Muslims in a state on their own is wrong and dangerous. The  Muslims and Christians must coexist within the framework of  their state.    [Karam] It is known that you are a great media man. What  role do you feel the Arab media should play at this extremely  crucial and sensitive stage in the life of the Arab nation?    [Mubarak] I ask the Arab media at this point in time to be  realistic and accurate in their reports, because communications  in the world are now very fast. The Arab media should do this  to avoid harming the Arab nation.    Let us be realistic, moderate, logical, and intelligent in  our media, whether in presenting our causes or discussing  problems.    [Karam] Do you believe the Arab world will emerge from the  narrow definitions that have been set for it -- namely, that it  belongs to the Third World?    [Mubarak] If the Arab countries could cooperate with each  other on firm and strong bases, and if we could do away with the  spirit of scheming and aggression against each other and give up  ideas of intervening in each other's affairs, we could become a  strong, gigantic entity.</p>

Advocated by the Chinese Government since the late 1980s,  the  program has focused on building water conservancy projects,  introducing new and advanced agro-techniques, setting up  commodity grain production and animal-breeding centres and  training farmers technically.    "It has proved a successful way to rejuvenate China's  agriculture," a government official in charge of agriculture  said.    With the program, according to a recent survey, China has  transformed 7.33 million hectares of low-yield farmland into  high- yield land, reclaimed more than one million hectares of  waste land, planted trees on 1.04 million hectares, and improved  306,000 hectares of grassland over the past decade and more.    As a result, it has obtained 17.16 billion additional  kilograms of grain, 2.52 million kilograms of cotton, 700,000  tons of oil- bearing crops, 9.77 million kilograms of sugar and  620,000 tons of meat.    Farmers in areas included in the program have earned 200  yuan  extra per capita a year.    One example is the Huanghuaihai Plains, which covers the  valleys between the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe rivers in part of  Anhui, Hebei and Shandong provinces. In the past this area was  frequently hit by natural disasters. By introducing the overall  agricultural development measures, farmers have transformed  3.368 million hectares of low-yield fields into high-yield  farmland, improved water irrigation facilities and introduced  new farm varieties and scientific farming through five years of  hard efforts.    The grain output in the plains area of Shandong and Hebei  Provinces now accounts for 33 percent of the provinces' total  and that in Anhui for 65 percent.    Known as a granary, the Northeast China Plain has increased  its grain output between 2,250 kilograms and 3,000 kilograms per  hectare as a result of employing scientific farming methods and  transformation of the lower-yield land.    Liaoning Province in northeast China is a key industrial  centre, which used to buy at least 1.5 billion kilograms of  grain every year from other parts of the country to feed its  population.    The overall agricultural development has helped this  province  to become self-sufficient in grain and non-staple food over the  past five years.    East China has more people with less farmland.    With farmland averaging only 0.04 hectares per capita, the  coastal Zhejiang Province has dammed tidal land to use as  farmland to boost its grain output over the past five years.    Western China, which has adverse natural conditions, has  built a number of farm capital projects to improve the  ecological environment.    Sichuan Province has improved and expanded irrigation  facilities; Guizhou and Yunnan provinces built terraced fields;  the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region constructed water pumping  projects to help transform its poor land; and the Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Region upgraded its grassland.    In addition, all the areas involved have studied  agro-techniques.    One example is the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which  has earned 7.5 million U.S. dollars by exporting a new variety  of grape.    Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces in the middle and  lower  reaches of the Chang Jiang River, have applied more than 3,000  new techniques and fine varieties to farming in recent years.    Training courses and technical schools for farmers are  mushrooming across the country.    A survey shows that China still has 60 million hectares of  low- yield farmland, 300 million hectares of low-yield  grassland, 828,000 hectares of low-lying coastal land and 67  million hectares of sandy wasteland, which are ripe for  transformation.</p>

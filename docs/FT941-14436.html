			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Barbour Index warns on full year Shares in Barbour Index declined 15p to 218p yesterday on news from the Windsor-based specialist information services group that its results for the 12 months to end-April would 'be somewhat below those of last year'. The news accompanied the interim results which showed a 25 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.03m for the period to end-October. Turnover fell 8.5 per cent to Pounds 6.4m. Mr Jack Dunn, chief executive, said he was disappointed in the results, but added that he was not surprised by them given the group's reliance on the construction industry. Some 70 per cent of Barbour's income derives from that source, with the balance from its health and safety information. The second half was expected to 'show some growth'. To underline both the group's confidence in the long-term future and its 'sound financial position' - it has Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 4.4m) cash balances  -the interim dividend is lifted to 2.7p (2.55p). Barbour supplies information of all kinds, though not advice, to niche markets like architects and engineers. It also produces and supplies a directory of building products to 21,000 registered specifiers. Mr Dunn said that Barbour's soon to be launched expert information systems would extend the group's markets, stressing that many professionals needed to have large amounts of wide-ranging information at their fingertips. Mr Dunn said that on the construction side, renewal rates improved a little over last year, but that there was still a 15 per cent fall-off for lapsed subscriptions or failed businesses. New sales remain-ed at a low level. It was the same for health and safety, though here renewal rates were held at a 'very good' 90 per cent. Earnings declined to 8.1p (10.9p) per share.</p>

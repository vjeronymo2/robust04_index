			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (7): New tiger will pace the east bank - Pudong development zone THERE are the right and the wrong places to be in Shanghai. People regard Puxi, on the west bank of the Huangpu river which bisects the city, as the real Shanghai; the centre of industry, commerce and culture. Pudong, on the Huangpu's east bank, is the poor relation. In the old days it was Shanghai's slum area, infamous for its criminals and triad gangs. Du Yuesheng, the Al Capone of Shanghai in the 1920s who ran the city's opium dens, gambling rackets and brothels, is Pudong's most famous son. But Pudong has now been granted a very different identity. The old housing, the acres of flat farming land, are being transformed into a 350 sq km special economic zone. If the ambitions of Shanghai's planners are realised, Pudong will not only become the centre of the city's commerce and industry: it will be the locomotive which will pull the cities and industries of the nearby Yangtze river into the international arena. Mr Huang Ju, Shanghai's mayor, says that Pudong will become one of the new tigers of Asia, the focal point of China's new open-door policy. 'It will be the outlet to the world for China's industrial heartland.' Pudong new area was officially established in early 1990. Work is now underway on a financial and trade zone, an export processing zone and a free trade zone. There has been substantial progress: Mr Gong Jian Bo of the Pudong development authority says that so far more than 1,000 joint ventures between local and foreign companies with total investments of more than Dollars 2bn have been approved for Pudong. By 1995 the Shanghai Securities Exchange, the city's foreign exchange transaction centre and other financial institutions will have all moved to new premises in Pudong. Several joint ventures have already started operations. A conglomerate from Thailand is behind a Dollars 2bn real estate development which local officials describe as an Oriental Manhattan. The development of Pudong is central to Shanghai's aim to regain its pre-1949 position as China's leading trading and financial centre. The majority of Shanghai's population of more than 15m live on the west side of the Huangpu river. Much of the city's infrastructure, neglected for years, is in a state of near collapse. Many factories are industrial dinosaurs. The only solution, say Shanghai's officials, is to move across the river and build anew. Pudong has some powerful backers. Mr Deng Xiaoping visited the area last spring and gave the project his blessing. Mr Zhu Rongji, the highly influential senior vice-premier and leading economic reformist, was a key figure in planning Pudong when he served as Shanghai's mayor in the late 1980s. Mr Zhu is largely responsible for encouraging foreign investors to set up shop in Pudong. As Mayor, Mr Zhu revamped the application process for foreign ventures, which in one infamous case had involved a total of 136 bureaucratic steps. Mr Zhu has also helped push through central government funding to finance large scale infrastructure projects in Pudong. More than Dollars 2.7bn is now being spent on building a gas works, a water plant, port developments, a new bridge and road and rail networks. About half the funds come from central government, the rest are being raised out of Shanghai's own revenues or from loans, bond issues and foreign development aid. A much-needed new airport for Shanghai is also planned south of the Pudong zone: when completed officials say it will be the largest in Asia. Other projects in the pipeline include a Chinese Disneyworld, the biggest department store complex in Asia and, the symbol of executive presence, an international standard golf course. Pudong's development is at an early stage and much of the area is still a dust-blown building site. There are those who worry that Shanghai's planners have been too ambitious. They point to several problems: Pudong's development comes 10 years after the formation of Shenzhen economic zone in Guangdong province in the south. Pudong has a lot of catching up to do if it is to emulate Shenzhen's fly-away growth. Recently central government has expressed concern about the spiral of loans being taken out by provinces and municipal authorities. Any tightening of regulations governing bond issues and other finance raising exercises could seriously effect Pudong's development. While foreign investment figures are impressive, many of the joint ventures are believed to involve so-called 'fake foreign partners'. These are local companies who go to Hong Kong, register as foreign enterprises, and then move in to Pudong, taking advantage of the area's preferential tax regime. Shanghai accounts for nearly 10 per cent of central government revenue each year: any dramatic fall-off in the city's tax contributions could mean retaliatory action by Beijing. There are also indications that many of these joint venture enterprises are merely using Pudong as a brass plate staging post: having gained the special tax concessions they then go on to set up their operations across the river.</p>

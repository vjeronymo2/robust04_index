			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sculley awarded options worth Dollars 72m by Spectrum MR JOHN Sculley, the former chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, who last month shocked the computer industry by joining Spectrum Information Technologies, a small technology development company, was granted stock warrants now worth Dollars 72m, the company said yesterday. Mr Sculley's 18m warrants were issued at a price of Dollars 6 1/8 . Yesterday, the stock was trading at Dollars 10 1/8 . Mr Sculley is precluded from exercising more than 3m warrants this year and the remainder can be exercised over a four-year period. 'We believe that the arrangement reflects Mr Sculley's long-term commitment to Spectrum,' the company said. 'The warrants were issued at the market price when he joined the company, last month. He will benefit, along with all Spectrum shareholders, only when the company performs well.' Separately, Spectrum announced that its founder and two other executives have resigned and that it has settled an outstanding shareholders lawsuit. Spectrum said it has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5n in cash and issue 750,000 warrants at or above the current market price to settle the action. The company admitted no wrong-doing. The lawsuit was filed by shareholders in May when Spectrum's stock price dropped sharply after AT&amp;T challenged the company's claim that a technology licensing agreement could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties. Mr Sculley also announced yesterday that he plans to cut back loss-making operations and refocus the company's communications services operations on contract engineering and consulting services. He said that Spectrum plans to acquire a small contract engineering and consulting services firm with annual revenues of about Dollars 12m.</p>

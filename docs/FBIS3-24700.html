Aidid will stay in Nairobi for "a few more days" to continue  consultations with other factions about the possible formation  of an interim government in Somalia before the end of March,  Aidid's spokesman Mohamed Hassan Awale said. [passage omitted]    He emphasized that the provisional administration would only  be set up after a consensus had been reached with other  factions. Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction will  not impose a government in Somalia, he added. [passage omitted]    Aidid is expected to meet representatives from the Somali  Salvation Democratic Front, the Somalia National Democratic  Union and the Somali National Front later this week before  returning to Mogadishu. General Aidid has repeatedly called for  UNOSOM's departure accusing the force of killing thousands of  Somalis. [passage omitted]    Aidid travelled to Uganda from Nairobi on Thursday.    He arrived in Kenya late last month after the collapse of  United Nations-sponsored peace negotiations in Addis Ababa.</p>

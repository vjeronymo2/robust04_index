			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Gukasyan, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic </F> foreign minister, by Igor Lenskiy; date, place not given:  "Safety Fuse of the Unrecognized"]    [Text] [Lenskiy] How is Karabakh, with its 150,000-strong  population, opposing 7 million-strong Azerbaijan?    [Gukasyan] Have you seen the movie "300 Spartans"? Then you  will understand. There are several factors which explain the  Karabakh phenomenon. The main thing is that we know what we are  fighting for. We have nowhere to retreat to, we have no other  land. Every inhabitant of Karabakh understands that if he loses  heart, tomorrow he will not have either a home or a family. We  are being confronted by Azerbaijanis who are being brought by  force to the front from Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad. They  personally do not need Karabakh at all, they are waiting for a  suitable moment to desert from the army...    So you should not put our successes down to Armenia's  support.    [Lenskiy] Where are you getting your weapons from?    [Gukasyan] We are grateful to Azerbaijan for punctilious  "supplies." Eighty percent are trophies. We buy the rest.  Where, from whom, and how much for -- these are just details.    [Lenskiy] Arkadiy, are you received by officials in Moscow?  After all, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is not recognized by  Russia....    [Gukasyan] Allow me to make no comment. If I answer, they  will immediately stop receiving me.    [Lenskiy] Last fall direct Azerbaijani-Karabakh talks began  in Moscow. How long did they last?    [Gukasyan] Yes, I conducted a dialogue with A. Dzhalilov,  deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet.  Unfortunately after H. Aliyev was officially elected president,  direct contacts came to an end.    [Lenskiy] You have just come back from Prague, where talks  are going on within the framework of the CSCE. Has any progress  been made?    [Gukasyan] To be honest, progress has been insignificant.  We reached agreement on confidence-building measures toward a  cease-fire.    [Lenskiy] And what about the actual cease-fire? After all,  this was envisaged in the February agreements at the  quadrilateral talks at the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense. Even the date was named -- as of 1 March....    [Gukasyan] The agreements were not implemented. Primarily  because Azerbaijan does not agree to the plan proposed by Russia  to bring peacekeeping forces into the dividing zone.    [Lenskiy] Let us suppose that Azerbaijan agrees to this  plan. In that eventuality, are you prepared to give up the  seized territories beyond Nagorno-Karabakh?    [Gukasyan] We do not claim Azerbaijani land. However, we  will not retreat from the occupied positions until the  irreversibility of the peace process is guaranteed. We must be  sure that we will not be subjected to a blockade again and that  communications will be opened. Our principle is: "No" to a  cease-fire without the presence of independent observers, and  "no" to the withdrawal of troops without the stationing of  peacekeeping forces.    [Lenskiy] Is the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic a democratic  state?    [Gukasyan] We have all the attributes of power. We have a  Supreme Council elected by the people, a government, and laws,  and a draft Constitution is being prepared. However, while war  continues, all the strands of administration are concentrated in  the State Defense Committee, as was the case in the USSR during  the Great Patriotic War.... Kolkhozes and sovkhozes have even  been preserved in Karabakh. We think that these forms are  optimum.    [Lenskiy] What currency do you have?    [Gukasyan] We are open to all currencies. The ruble,  dirham, dollar.... We are not even opposed to the Azerbaijani  manat.    [Lenskiy] Are there any non-Armenian inhabitants left in  Karabakh?    [Gukasyan] Yes, there are Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Jews  -- altogether they make up around 7,000-8,000 people. It must  be borne in mind that when part of Karabakh was controlled by  Azerbaijan, a lot of Russians were deported.    [Lenskiy] What is your attitude to the national liberation  struggle of the Abkhazian people?    [Gukasyan] You may see this as a joke or else as something  serious, but an original idea once came into my head: To create  a Union of Unrecognized States. After all, by and large we have  one aim -- to live as we want. So that the states into which  attempts are being made to incorporate us by force should not  impose their will on us. Of course, we sympathize with the  sentiments of Abkhazia, the Dniester Region, and Crimea. We  have the appropriate contacts. If the occasion arises we can  advance in a single diplomatic front.    [Lenskiy] Is Karabakh's future within Armenia?    [Gukasyan] I see the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as an  independent state. Although I do not rule out a situation  whereby Karabakh may become part of Armenia.  <H5>  Meanwhile... </H5>   The CIS heads of state have adopted a protocol decision at a  meeting in Moscow, which, on behalf of the CIS, transfers to the  Russian peacekeeping initiative the mandate for the settlement  of the conflict over Karabakh.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28  January carry articles and editorials on the pending U.S.-ROK  plan to deploy Patriot missiles and other new weapons on the  peninsula.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 400-word report  from Washingon in connection with a U.S. plan to replace the  existing Cobra helicopters deployed in South Korea with new  Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to South  Korea in addition to deploying Patriot missiles. The report,  quoting THE WASHINGTON POST dated 27 January, notes the Clinton  administration's plan to replace the existing Cobra helicopter  unit deployed in South Korea with two new-type Apache helicopter  battalions.    The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON POST as reporting that  "the Clinton administration is ready to approve the plan to  deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea requested by General Gary  E. Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, but it is now  waiting for the ROK Government's final approval." The article  continues to quote the U.S. paper as reporting that the ROK  Government worries that the deployment of Patriot missiles  "would irritate North Korea."    The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting  that  "the U.S. Defense Department is considering deploying an  aircraft carrier in the waters near the Korean peninsula." The  article quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that General  Gary E. Luck requested one Patriot missile battalion which  consists of "64 launching platforms, 256 Patriot missiles, and  special radar devices which are capable of tracing several  targts simultaneously."    HANGUK ILBO also carries on page 5 a 500-word article by  Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa on performance data  of the Patriot missile and a 500-word article by reporter Yi  Sang-won on that of North Korea's Nodong-1 long-range missile.  Noting in detail the formidable performance of the Patriot  missile as demonstrated during the Gulf war, the article by  correspondent Chong Il-hwa describes the process of the  upgrading of the Patriot system.    The article by reporter Yi Sang-won notes that North Korea's  Nodong-1 missile was reportedly developed from the former Soviet  Union's surface-to-surface Scud missile developed in the 1980's  and that it is reportedly now deployed for use in an actual war.  The article notes the performance of the Nodong-1 missile,  including its size and range, adding that North Korea is  reported "to possess 12 to 18 Nodong-1 missiles at present." The  article also cites that the Nodong-2 missile is now in the  developmental stage.    HANGUK ILBO carries on page 7 an 800-word article by  Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the reasons for  the pending U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK.  Noting the recent "hardline" moves by the U.S. Government in  connection with the North Korean nuclear issue such as the  pending U.S. plan to deploy the Patriot missile to the ROK, the  CIA director's secret visit to Seoul, and U.S. Government  officials' strong-worded remarks on the North Korean nuclear  issue, the article says: "People hold that these moves are  "probably either a sort of nuclear negotiation card to apply  pressure on North Korea or a political card for U.S. domestic  purposes." The article says, however, the fact that the  hardline moves against North Korea have been led by the  Department of Defense and the CIA suggests that they are aimed  at warning North Korea.    The article notes different approaches between the U.S.  Department of Defense and the CIA and the Department of State in  dealing with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue. The  article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles  to South Korea can be interpreted as a result of the hawkish  line led by the Department of Defense and the CIA.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 600-word  editorial on the pending plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the  ROK under the title "New Arrangement of the Situation on the  Korean Peninsula." Saying that the plan to deploy the Patriot  missile can be considered prior preparations taken in  consideration of the start of the UN sanctions against North  Korea, the article notes North Korea's protracted delaying  tactics in the negotiations with the International Atomic Energy  Agency and the United States. The article also notes the recent  reports by Russian nuclear experts about the possibility of  North Korea possessing one to two nuclear bombs, the CIA  director's secret visit to Seoul, and the deployment of a "U.S.  national intelligence support team" in the ROK, and says that  these moves show that "a new move for arranging the situation on  the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean nuclear  issue is in progress."    The editorial continues: "In particular, the deployment of  Patriot missiles to South Korea will bring a big change to the  military situation of the Korean peninsula, regardless of  whether it is intended to cope with the North Korean troops  concentrated along the DMZ, whether it is a prior step in taking  sanctions against North Korea, or whether it is 'a sophisticated  tactic to sell' Patriot missles to the ROK." The article  concludes by stressing the need for our government to properly  deal with the changing situation of the Korean peninsula.    TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by  reporter Kim Chae-hong. The article notes that "the U.S. plan to  deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK can be considered to be an  expression of the strong will of the United States to cope with  possible North Korean provocation, but the ROK worries that the  presence of Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula would  irritate North Korea and have a serious effect on the nuclear  negotiations with North Korea."    The article is followed by a long explanation of the  technological aspect of the Patriot missile, including its  performance demonstrated during the Gulf war.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word  editorial entitled "The Merit of Patriot Deployment." The  editorial notes North Korea's persistent refusal to comply with  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] demands for the  inspection of its nuclear sites, increasing the likelihood of UN  military and economic sanctions on North Korea, and says, "The  U.S. plan to transfer to and deploy the anti-missile Patriot  missiles to the ROK shows that the U.S. warning to North Korea  in connection with the nuclear issue is becoming a reality. The  ROK Government is inclined to accept the U.S. plan." The  editorial then notes the deployment of Patriot missiles to the  ROK has been considered for some time to augment the defense  capability of the U.S. ground forces in the ROK to effectively  counter the North's surprise attack, irrespective of the nuclear  issue, in view of the difficulty of U.S. reinforcement forces in  arriving in the ROK swiftly enough in case of a North Korean  surprise attack. The editorial then notes the doubts about the  performance of the Patriot missile which was used during the  Gulf war, citing the U.S. accounting audit personnel's  revelation that the Patriot's capability of destroying the  enemy's missile warheads was only nine percent. The editorial  goes on to note the insufficient performance of the Patriot,  namely, its fragments falling out up to one kilometer diameter,  increasing danger for civilian casualties, and shrinking  performance in mountainous areas like the Korean peninsula. The  editorial concludes by noting, "It is, therefore, effective for  combat purposes to deploy the much-improved second stage Patriot  missiles. The deployment of the type which was used during the  Gulf war could give an impression that the United States is  disposing of old stock. The deployment of the Patriot should  not be viewed only from the perspective of creating tension  between the North and the South."    KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 carries a 900-word article by  New  York-based correspondent Pak Su-man and reporter Song Yong-sung  entitled "What Was the Background for the Deployment of the  Patriot in the ROK?--Pros And Cons in the ROK and the United  States." The article notes, "The U.S. Government plan to deploy  Patriot missiles to the ROK implies that the United States is  preparing for the potential circumstances where not only  economic but also military sanctions will have to be taken in  case of a failure to bring about the settlement of the North  Korean nuclear issue." The article notes the view of U.S.  intelligence agencies that the Patriot will be capable of  protecting the targets of a preemptive North Korean missile  attack on the ROK. The article notes some ROK Government  officials show an unwelcome reaction to the U.S. plan but  refrain from explicitly commenting on it under the weight of the  cause of building up the combat capability of the ROK-U.S.  combined forces. The article also notes, "Some are of the  opinion that if the nuclear inspection negotiation fails and the  situation aggravates leading to sanctions on the North, North  Korea may well be angered by it, and that it will then be  necessary for the U.S. Forces in the ROK to be equipped with an  augmented combat capability to cope with such a situation." The  article then notes insufficient performance of the Patriot and  some ROK Government officials' view that the deployment of the  Patriot is ill-timed for the North Korea-U.S. negotiation on the  nuclear issue.    KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries an 800-word article  by reporter Choe Chung-ung on the performance of the Patriot  missile which notes that the Patriot intercepted and shot down  50 to 60 percent of the Scud missiles during the Gulf war and  the "shortcomings" of the Patriot, namely, "its enormous price,  namely $120 million per unit; the extensive fallout of its  fragments which can cause heavy human casualties and material  loss; and the helpless situation in case the enemy fires the  missile with a chemical warhead."    KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries a 200-word article  by ?eporter Pak Hun-sin in the column "Reporter's Bench." The  article notes the opposition Democratic Party's [DP] position  concerning the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK,  and refers to remarks by DPR CHairman Yi Ki-taek: "The  deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK at this critical  juncture when negotiations for nuclear inspection is underway  can adversely affect the inter-Korean dialogue although it is  said to be for defensive purposes."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on pag? 4 carries a  1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi  Kyong-hyong entitled "The Meaning of the U.S. Plan To Deploy  Patriot Missiles--To Provide a Shield for the ROK Defenseless to  Scud Gttack." The article says, "The U.S. plan to deploy  Patriot missiles to the ROK seems to be prompted by the sheer  defensive purposes in preparation for a North Korean Scud  missile attack." The article stresses that the Patriot  deployment is far from designed to pose a new threat to North  Korea, and notes, "Nevertheless, the prevailing view about the  plan to deploy =atriot missiles is that it will serve as  important leverage to pressure North Korea into an early  acceptance of nuclear inspection." The article goes on to note,  "The deployment of the Patriot missiles in he ROK seems to be  the U.S. measure to demonstrate its resolute will to defend the  ROK."    SEOUL SINMUN on page 7 carries an 800-word report compiled  from AP, YONHAP reports from Washington entitled "Patriot's  Interception Capability `Unsatisfactory.'" The report says,  "The Patriot intercept missile, which the United States is  planning to deploy to the ROK, is a little improved from the  type used in the Gulf war but is reported to have only a limited  capability against North Korean missile attack. The PAC II-type  Patriot, which is expected to be deployed in the ROK, was used  by Saudi Arabia and Israel in 1991, and there is controversy  over its capability to hit the target. Political analyst (Baker  Spring) of the Heritage Foundation said that the United States  is now developing the PAC III, and the missile to be deployed in  the ROK will be the PAC II." The article concludes by quoting a  remark by a U.S. military strategist that the U.S. plan to  deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK is made more from political  considerations than from military considerations.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 650-word  article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing  the 27 January WASHINGTON TIMES article which said that "To cope  with the possibility of North Korea's missile attack, the  Clinton Administration plans to deploy 256 Patriot missiles (64  launching pads) and special radar equipment capable of chasing  and intercepting several targets at the same time to the ROK."  The article also quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that  "the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles in the ROK is an  important sign that the United States is concerned about the  failure of negotiations over nuclear inspections of North  Korea's facilities." The article also quotes THE WASHINGTON  POST report on the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in major  ports and airports of the ROK and on U.S. plans to sell the  Patriot missiles to the ROK. The article concludes by citing  WASHINGTON POST as saying that "the U.S. Government is promoting  the plan to station two Apache helicopter battalions in the ROK  which will replace the existing Cobra helicopter battalion."    The CHOSON ILBO also carries an 800-word article by reporter  Pak Tu-sik on page 5 about the ROK Government's reaction to the  deployment of the Patriot missiles in Korea, and notes that all  along, the ROK and U.S. Governments have stressed "deployment of  the Patriot missiles only in consideration of security and  technology." The article says that "such an explanation by both  the ROK and U.S. Governments is aimed at preventing the  introduction of Patriot missiles from having a bad effect on  negotiations on North Korea's nuclear issue." Then the article  points out the possibility that "the deployment of the Patriot  missiles may give North Korea, which has currently been driven  to a corner, a pretext for frustrating negotiations with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]." The article notes  the unfavorable reaction of our government's working-level  officials involved in negotiations with North Korea. The article  then notes prevailing opinion that "beginning with the  deployment of the Patriot missiles, the United States-led  regional missile defense system--`TMD-Theater Missile  Defense'--should be more systematically reviewed," and also  notes that "under the present circumstances with North Korea's  missile threat, the introduction of weapons should be reviewed  in terms of a middle and long-term plan, rather than a  short-term plan."    CHOSON ILBO also carries on page 5 an 800-word article by  Kyong Yong-won analyzing the efficiency of the deployment of  Patriot missiles to the ROK, in which he notes the Patriot  missiles' defects the low accuracy rate of 50-60 percent and the  nine-percent destruction rate. Then the article says that "even  if the Patriot missile's defects are remedied, it is doubtful  whether the Patriot missiles will be efficient considering the  many stumbling blocks, including high mountains, that exist on  Korean terrain." Comparing Korean terrain with the Gulf war  example, the article points out that although it took 20-30  minutes for a Scud missile launched in Iraq to reach a target,  "the early-warning time is no less than three or five minutes"  on the Korean peninsula because the battlefield depth is only 40  km. The article says that assuming that the Patriot missiles  take three to five minutes to chase and intercept a target, "the  Patriot missiles have almost no time to intercept a Scud missile  once it is launched in North Korea."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 4 a  1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong  Yon-chu which cites NEW YORK TIMES and AP news agency reports on  U.S. plans to deploy the Patriot missile system to the ROK.  Quoting U.S. officials as saying that "because the Patriot  missiles are purely defensive, their deployment in the ROK will  not aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula," the article says  that "even though the Patriot missiles are defensive, their  deployment is sure to strengthen the military power of the ROK  Army and the U.S. forces in Korea. It is difficult to predict  what reaction North Korea will show and what effect the  deployment of the Patriot missiles will have on negotiations  over the nuclear issue." After noting that some U.S. State  Department officials were concerned over the bad effect the  Patriot missiles might have on nuclear negotiations with North  Korea, the article says that "considering the situation of the  Korean peninsula, the weapons for `defense' may be turned into  weapons of `political offensive' which cause crises and  tension." The article concludes: "Generally speaking, the  deployment of Patriot missiles will have a bad effect on the  solution of North Korea's nuclear issue and on reconciliation  trends on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, some  analysts point out that North Korea should also be to blame for  dallying too long in the political game of negotiations with the  United States and the IAEA. If there had been more rapid  progress in nuclear negotiations and a foundation for resolving  the nuclear issue had been laid, the military hard liners within  the U.S. Administration would not have had an excuse for a  hard-line policy."    The HANGYORE SINMUN also carries on page 4 a 600-word  article  by Yi Sang-ki detailing the capabilities of the Patriot missiles  which he says are commonly known as the "missile that catches  missiles." After noting that hundreds of Patriot missiles have  been deployed in the U.S. Continent, Germany, Netherlands,  Italy, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the article says "the supreme  speed of the Patriot Missiles is Mach 6 and their firing range  is known to be over 150 km. Their effective range is 70 km and  it takes the Patriot missiles three minutes to launch and  intercept the enemy's target." The article notes that Patriot  missiles were on display at the U.S. Suwon Base during the Ulchi  Focus exercise in 1992 and during the Team Spirit exercise last  year, and points out that: "There are some that say that the  Patriot missiles are not suitable for Korean terrain because,  for starters, the Patriot missiles are too expensive with the  price of each launching pad amounting to $150 million; second,  considering that Korean terrain has short battlefield depth, the  efficiency of Patriot missiles is doubted." The article says:  "Unlike the depth of the battlefield in the Gulf War, Seoul is  less than 40 km away from the Armistice Line, so the accuracy of  the missile's air interception rate will not reach that of the  Gulf War. In addition, contrary to U.S. press reports of the  Patriot missile's 80-90 percent target-hitting rate, its  target-hitting rate is in fact only about 50-60 percent." The  article concludes by quoting general opinion within the army  that "considering economic and accuracy conditions, the Patriot  missiles will provide nothing more than mental stability when  facing a southward attack."    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a  500-word article by Washington-based reporter Chin Chang-ho  noting the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles and a new-type  Apache helicopter unit to South Korea and to send an aircraft  carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula, reporting that  these moves suggest that the U.S. policy toward North Korea is  moving in a hard-line direction. The article quotes THE  WASHINGTON POST and THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that the  United States will replace the Cobra helicopters with new-type  Apache helicopters and send an aircraft carrier to the waters  near the Korean peninsula in an effort to strengthen the combat  capabilities of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. The article  also reports a Defense Department spokesman described the  performance of the Patriot missiles at a briefing session.    CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word  article by reporter Kang Yong-chin on the meaning and background  of the U.S. plan to strengthen U.S. Forces stationed in South  Korea. Noting the background of the recent hard-line attitude  toward North Korea by the hawkish group led by the Department of  Defense and CIA in connection with the negotiations with North  Korea the article cites: "After all, the U.S. State Department,  which has insisted on the need to continue nuclear negotiations  with North Korea has become to realize that its concessions to  North Korea have been fruitless."    Noting the position of the ROK Government, which has assumed  a prudent attitude toward the hard-line group led by the U.S.  Department of Defense and CIA, the article concludes that the  United States will continue to maintain a hard-line attitude  toward North Korea "through the strengthening of its defense  capability in South Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North  Korea."    CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word  article by reporter Pak Ui-chun describing in detail the  background of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the  ROK. The article reports that deployment of Patriot missiles,  though it will contribute to strengthening the combat  capabilities of the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea, will  have a serious effect on alleviating tensions on the Korean  peninsula.    The article also quotes leaders of the opposition DP,  including Chairman Yi Ki-taek, as expressing worries over the  possible negative effect of the deployment of Patriot missiles  on North-South dialogue and on easing tension on the Korean  peninsula.    The article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot  missiles to the ROK should be prudently reviewed, not only  because it would dampen the negotiations of the North Korean  nuclear issue, but also because it would create an arms race on  the Korean peninsula.</p>

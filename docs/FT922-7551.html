			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Toyota set to seek Dollars 1bn in record bond issue TOYOTA, the Japanese motor manufacturer, plans to raise Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in the biggest-ever offer by a company in the international bond market. The transaction, expected this week, marks the most prominent step by a major Japanese company to refinance its part in the 1980s equity warrant boom. While Japanese share prices soared in the last part of the decade, companies like Toyota raised money at virtually no cost by issuing bonds with warrants. These warrants, giving the holder the right to buy a companies' shares at a set price in the future, were stripped from the bonds and traded separately. Toyota issued Dollars 800m of warrant bonds with an interest rate of 1 1/4 per cent a year. In theory, the cash from selling Toyota shares to the warrant holders would repay the bondholders. In practice, the warrants will not be exercised, since the company's shares have fallen below the price at which the warrants can be exercised. In all, Dollars 36bn of warrants and convertible bonds issued by Japanese companies come up for repayment this year, with a further Dollars 83.9bn due next year. The collapse of Japanese share prices means most will have to be refinanced, a fact expected to cause congestion in some capital markets, particularly the domestic Japanese corporate bond market. Toyota is unusual in having a top triple-A credit rating and an internationally recognised name which together make it possible to contemplate such a big money-raising exercise in the international market, or Euromarket. However, the size of the issue is likely to force it to pay more for the cash than for a typical Euromarket bond issue. 'There won't be many Japanese companies which can refinance warrants in the dollar market like this,' said one banker with a close knowledge of the Toyota transaction. The rest of the Dollars 1bn will meet research and development costs. The Euromarket faces a glut of dollar bond issues. Last week Canada's province of Ontario, one of the international bond market's most active borrowers, said it planned 'global' issues with an offer of more than Dollars 1bn of bonds. These allow borrowers to issue bonds simultaneously in the main domestic centres, creating a single large issue.</p>

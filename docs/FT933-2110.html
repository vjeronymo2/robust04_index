			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Union blocks BT move to part-time work THE MAIN union in British Telecommunications has blocked an initiative to allow full-time engineering workers to convert to part-time working as a conflict grows between the union and the company over pay and jobs. The proposal, with a scheme to allow engineers to transfer to clerical jobs, has been introduced to help BT restructure and reach its goal of 15,000 voluntary redundancies in this financial year. Although BT and the union expect the total will be reached this year both sides predict a much tougher battle over the same figure for 1994-95. Mr Peter Archer, BT's head of personnel, said yesterday: 'It does look as if it could be a lot more difficult next year.' The National Communications Union, which since June has been controlled by a new, more leftwing executive, has opposed the part-time proposal because, it said, the plan was floated without consultation with the union. The union, which already has a part-time working agreement for its predominantly female clerical members, said it believed BT was using the proposal to undermine the earnings and conditions of the whole workforce. Fewer than 100 engineering workers have expressed interest, partly because of union opposition. The union has rejected a 1.9 per cent pay offer and is recommending strike action in a ballot of its 140,000 members, with the result expected on November 9. The union said the average private-sector rise in the three months to July was 2.5 per cent. The union argued that, excluding redundancy costs, pre-tax profit per employee increased by 90 per cent in 1992-93. It also said a 1.9 per cent rise would cost the company only Pounds 38m compared with Pounds 79m spent on the dividend in the last financial year. Mr Archer said: 'It is not a very generous offer but we are already a good payer - if we pay more we will have to cut even more jobs. I do not believe there will be support . . . for strike action.' Mr Archer said that there were no plans to end national bargaining at BT but more regionalised bargaining was being reviewed. The transfer of staff from engineering grades to clerical work has attracted about 4,000 volunteers, which will make it easier to reach the goal of 12,900 voluntary redundancies this year on top of natural wastage of about 2,000. Little progress is reported in the customer services improvement programme, BT's plan to increase working time flexibility so that more staff work when customers are at home.</p>

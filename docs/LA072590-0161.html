			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPIDERS GET BAD NAME IN MOVIE, EXPERT SAYS  </P> <P> "Arachnophobia" is bugging Dr. Michael H. Robinson, a spider expert who accuses  Hollywood of spinning a web of deceit about his favorite creepy-crawly.  </P> <P> "It's a pity to give spiders a bad name," says Robinson, director of the  National Zoo and former director of the American Arachnological Society.  </P> <P> "This bloody movie is making horrific allegations about spiders, and they are  so important to the ecology of the world and so incredibly beneficial to  mankind that I decided they need some good press," he said.  </P> <P> Robinson hailed spiders as nature's pest exterminator, ridding the Earth of  billions of houseflies, roaches, mosquitoes and other insects every year.  </P> <P> Without spiders, he said, humans would be overwhelmed by winged creatures that  would destroy crops and threaten to leave the planet uninhabitable.  </P></p>

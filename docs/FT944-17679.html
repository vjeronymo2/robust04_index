			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / OECD lifts growth forecast The OECD nudged up its forecasts for economic growth in the developed world yesterday to 3 per cent both next year and in 1996 but warned its member governments against a resurgence of inflation and widening budget deficits. In its last semi-annual Economic Outlook, published in June, the think-tank for rich nations forecast expansion of 2.9 per cent in 1995. It had also projected growth of 2.6 per cent for this year. but sources close to the forum said it was now counting on a slightly higher figure. The OECD sees growth in the US slowing to a more sustainable rate following its brisk pace over the past couple of years. For Europe, the OECD now predicts growth of just over 2 per cent before a quickening to 3 per cent in 1995. In June its forecasts had been 1.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent, respectively. The International Monetary Fund last week projected global growth of 3 per cent this year and 3.5 per cent in 1995.</p>

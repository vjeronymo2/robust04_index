			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Beijing Political Situation" column by </F> Jen Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "The Chinese-U.S. Strategic Trial  of Strength on the Korean Peninsula"]    [Text] Beijing, 6 Apr--The tense situation on the Korean  peninsula resulting from the North Korean nuclear issue  escalated in late March and led to a military confrontation at  the end of that month. This has received international  attention. Under these circumstances, on 1 April the UN  Security Council adopted a moderately worded statement proposed  by China asking North Korea to allow international inspectors to  complete their nuclear inspections and urging North and South  Korea to resume dialogue with the UN Security Council members so  as to implement the declaration on the Korean peninsula being a  nuclear-free zone, thus temporarily easing the tension on the  peninsula.    How has the present situation on the Korean peninsula taken  shape? An informed source in Beijing has revealed that a  Beijing expert on international conflicts was of the opinion  that primarily human factors were behind the military  confrontation on the Korean peninsula. Over the past year, the  situation on the Korean peninsula has been tense one moment and  relaxed the next. On 12 March last year, North Korea suddenly  announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation  of Nuclear Weapons, to oppose the U.S.-South Korean "team spirit  1993" joint military exercises. Not long afterward, South and  North Korea were in a "state of quasi war." Subsequently, the  United States took the initiative in holding a dialogue with  North Korea, and good results were achieved. In February this  year, North Korea reached agreements respectively with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United States,  expressing its willingness to allow IAEA personnel to carry out  an "inspection aimed at ensuring continuity in nuclear safety."  Apart from this, South and North Korea held talks in Panmunjom  from 3 to 6 March to discuss mutual visits by both sides'  special envoys. Logically, this should have helped improve the  atmosphere on the Korean peninsula, but a six-member  international nuclear inspection team complained that North  Korea had prevented them from taking samples from a chemical  research agency after inspecting seven nuclear facilities in  North Korea. North Korea asserted that these nuclear facilities  had passed IAEA inspections, had been sealed, and monitoring  equipment had been installed at the sites; there was no reason  for the inspection team to remove the seals and take samples  again. Logically, it was possible to resolve this difference of  opinion. Unfortunately, however, South and North Korea  viciously abused one another during the Panmunjom talks, and the  United States asserted that, if North Korea refused to yield,  the UN Security Council would impose sanctions on it.  <H5>  China Persuaded the Three Parties To Have a Dialogue </H5>   The international community, however, did not agree with the  idea of the Security Council taking economic sanctions against  North Korea or the United States punishing it with force.  Instead, it hoped that China could influence North Korea  through their friendly relations so that the crisis on the  Korean peninsula could be alleviated. During their visits to  China in late March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher,  Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, and South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam respectively expressed the same view. It was against  this background that China submitted the above-mentioned  proposal.    The informed source further pointed out that, because China  had always abided by the international norm of not interfering  in other countries' internal affairs, it indicated that "it can  only play a limited role and do little" on the North Korean  nuclear issue, apart from expressing its stand of favoring  dialogue and opposing the use of pressure. To ease the tense  situation on the Korean peninsula and remove the war crisis  there, China continued to actively persuade the United States  and South and North Korea to patiently resolve their disputes  through dialogue.    China indicated to the United States: After the Cold War,  the United States should no longer adopt a hostile attitude  toward North Korea, and this is an important factor preventing  North Korea from manufacturing nuclear weapons; North Korea does  not constitute any threat to world peace, and the United States  should cancel its military exercises with South Korea; the  United States should give up its policy of politically isolating  North Korea, economically containing it, and diplomatically  slandering it and should restore talks with it so that their  bilateral relations will develop toward normalization.    China indicated to South Korea: North Korea lacks the  technological and economic capacity to manufacture nuclear  weapons, so South Korea should not be oversensitive about this  issue; as there is no proof, South Korea should not act rashly;  even though North Korea has the intention of manufacturing  nuclear weapons, this problem can be resolved through  negotiations; the shipment of U.S. Patriot missiles to South  Korea and U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises have  unquestionably added fuel to the fire; South and North Korea  should hold direct summit talks to create a relaxed atmosphere.  China indicated to North Korea: North Korea should be more  flexible on the question of nuclear inspections; it should  withdraw its troops a little from the military demarcation line  to avoid clashes; and it should take the initiative in proposing  talks with South Korea.    The Beijing expert on international conflicts pointed out  that China's active persuasion to the United States and South  and North Korea suggested its sincerity for alleviating the  tense situation on the Korean peninsula. The alleviation of  this tension primarily relies on the patient dialogue between  North Korea, South Korea, the IAEA, and the United States.    The informed source said that the Beijing international  conflicts expert was of the opinion that the United States  should undertake a major responsibility for the tense situation  on the Korean peninsula, because this superpower practices  hegemonism and power politics abroad and always wants to foist  its value concepts on others. For example, the United States  used the method of peaceful evolution on the former Soviet Union  and is applying the same method to China, and it is using  military methods to bring about a change in North Korea, Iraq,  and Libya. The United States deeply regretted not being able to  conquer Iraq with one stroke during the Gulf war. Remembering  this lesson, it will practice a strategy of destruction against  North Korea--the last Stalinist regime in the world--with the  aim of enabling South Korea to gobble up North Korea, like West  Germany gobbling up East Germany. A South Korean radio station  said that "Seoul and Washington already have a plan to overthrow  the Kim Il-song regime." This is a specific example of an  attempt to change North Korea through military means.  <H5>  The United States Is Using Two Methods </H5>   Apart from this, aiming to undermine China's foreign policy  of establishing good-neighborly relations with its surrounding  countries, the United States is trying every possible means to  set these countries against China, with a view to encircling it.    When discussing the international situation recently, an  authoritative person from the CPC pointed out that the Korean  peninsula, India, and Pakistan might be on fire [qi huo 6386  3499], and Vietnam and Russia might see winds rising [qi feng  6386 7364]. Partially speaking, this refers to the U.S.  strategy of encircling China.    This international conflicts expert said that China is quite  certain that the United States is aiming at China in pressuring  North Korea, and therefore China is quite concerned about the  situation on the Korean peninsula. Strategically speaking,  China regards the Korean region as an important buffer [huan  chong 4883 0394] zone between China and the United States.  Should North Korea fall under U.S.-South Korean joint military  occupation, China could face U.S. Naval, Army, and Air Force  threats. If war breaks out again on the Korean peninsula, and  the United States supports South Korea in attacking North Korea,  the Chinese Army, which "resisted U.S. aggression and aided  Korea to defend the motherland" in the early 1950's will not sit  idly by. If it did, the people throughout the country would  condemn it.    This expert continued: Of course, China's stand is very  explicit at present; it will do its best to prevent war on the  Korean peninsula. Therefore, as the United States highly values  U.S.- Chinese cooperation, China also sets great store by  improving Chinese-U.S. relations. The further development of  Chinese-U.S. relations will be good for easing the North Korean  nuclear crisis, for preventing Japan from becoming a nuclear  country, and for stopping the "Taiwan independence" movement and  the Vietnamese demand for "sovereignty" over the Nansha Islands  [Spratlys]. More importantly, it will provide China with a 10  to 20 year opportunity for peaceful construction. The sustained  development of China's economy and the constant growth of its  comprehensive national strength will prevent the United States  and other Western countries from belittling China's  international role.    This expert stressed: The Korean peninsula issue is no  longer a simple dispute between South and North Korea; the  different attitudes of China and the United States on the North  Korean nuclear issue is, essentially speaking, a strategic trial  of strength between the two countries on the Korean peninsula.</p>

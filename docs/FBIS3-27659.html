			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Sheer Fraud"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday morning, the Legislative Council passed  the partial constitutional package submitted to it by Governor  Chris Patten. Patten also spoke personally to the Legislative  Council yesterday afternoon in order to continue to cheat Hong  Kong people. After that, the British Government and the British  Hong Kong authorities flagrantly violated the principle of  keeping the talks confidential and unilaterally published the  White Paper "Representative Government in Hong Kong" to reveal  the contents of the Sino-British talks, in which they  deliberately distorted and covered up the fact that the British  side, especially Chris Patten, undermined the Sino-British talks  in an attempt to shirk the historical responsibilities that they  should bear.    Chris Patten came to Hong Kong to take office as governor in  1992, and he brought with him a sinister intention. At home, he  was discarded by a British constituency, and lost his  opportunity to play tricks in British political circles. He  thus accepted the appointment to the Hong Kong governorship.  Before the British policymakers decided to send Patten to Hong  Kong, they spied out the land and made their own judgment on the  international situation and China's future prospects. The  British press has revealed this many times. The reunification  of Germany, the political changes in some East European  countries, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union made the  gentlemen in London feel that they might again hold high their  colonialist banner, or at least play the game of election  politics, which they thought that they were good at, in Hong  Kong against China in order to create a political structure  similar to that in Britain before 1997 by changing Hong Kong's  existing system. They also planned to put an "elite" they had  painstakingly fostered for their colony inside Hong Kong's  political structure, thus turning Hong Kong into an independent  or semi-independent political entity and prolonging de facto  British rule in Hong Kong so that they might continue to gain  political and economic interests from Hong Kong. They even had  a very fantastic idea, being blinded by lust for gain, and  thought that the Chinese Government would soon collapse and  China would become divided, so they did not scruple to violate  the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the seven diplomatic  letters exchanged by the two foreign ministers on the Hong Kong  political structure, challenge the Basic Law that they hated to  the very marrow of their bones, and set various obstacles to the  future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR].    As soon as he took office in Hong Kong, Patten began to  prepare for making major changes in Hong Kong's political  structure according to the plan he had brought from London. His  action was one taken by London as the spearhead of the new China  policy. In order to change Hong Kong's existing system, Patten  wantonly damaged the consultation mechanism specified by the  Joint Declaration, and unilaterally dished out a so-called  constitutional reform package, the impact of which he tried to  make extend beyond 1997, without consulting the Chinese side.  It was certain that the package would encounter the Chinese  side's criticism and rejection. For the sake of Hong Kong's  smooth transition, and also in order to observe the deeds of the  British side while listening to its words and to give the  British Government an opportunity to change course, the Chinese  side agreed to hold talks with the British side on the 1994-95  election arrangements for Hong Kong. However, for the British  side, the talks were just a fraud. They took the talks as a  means of playing tricks, and tried by every possible means to  achieve the purpose of putting Patten's package into practice.  Therefore, they called for holding talks one day, and refused  to talk another. On the one hand, they pretended to be willing  to reach a compromise with the Chinese side; on the other hand,  they actively made arrangements for forcing the Legislative  Council to pass Patten's package and put it into practice while  the talks were going on. In their plan, the talks only served  the purpose of implementing Patten's package, so they were only  willing to talk about what was favorable to the implementation  of Patten's package, and refused to talk about what was not  favorable to the implementation of Patten's package. This was  exactly what they wanted to do in the talks. In the 17 rounds  of talks, Patten did his utmost to deceive public opinion, and  this was also a fact witnessed by all. Patten's show in the  last two days was just the epilogue to the fraud, because their  real features had been completely laid bare and they would not  be able to deceive people any longer. In Hong Kong and  overseas, Patten is now bogged down in an increasingly isolated  position, just like the British cabinet led by John Major, which  is now besieged on all sides.    The British side and Patten tried to describe the dispute  between China and Britain as a difference over whether there  should be democracy for Hong Kong or not. This was the point  expressed by the white paper published by them yesterday. In  fact, this was just an out-and-out lie. In reality, the dispute  just reflected the sharp confrontation between the Chinese  side's "three conformities" and the British side's "three  violations" and the serious difference between the Chinese  side's adherence to abiding by diplomatic agreements and the  British side's behavior of ignoring its international  commitments. To put it more clearly, this was the contradiction  between the Chinese side's determination to resume the exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the British side's attempt to  hinder and undermine the process of China's resuming the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. No matter what  blandishments the British side and Patten offered, and no matter  how the authors of the British white paper engaged in  phrase-mongering, the facts could never be obliterated. Of  course, they would just be working to no avail if they tried to  shirk the British side's responsibility for undermining the  talks.    The biggest mistake Patten and his like have made is that  they still think like their ancestors in the 19th century  although they are living in last decade of the 20th century.  They think that they are still facing the decadent Qing  government and that the Western system and values must be  imposed on Asia. Such conceit and such an arrogant attitude has  been scathingly denounced by many leaders of Asian countries.  Patten and his like absolutely have no right to talk about  democracy and freedom in Hong Kong, because it is China's  territory. The British colonial authorities will have to quit  in just 40 months. The three-tier councils they are going to  rig up in Hong Kong will certainly be disbanded and reorganized  after they leave. Patten's fraud will bring no benefit to  Britain. People who originally conceived illusions about Patten  have also seen clearly that it is the British side that will  eventually incur losses as it refuses to cooperate with the  Chinese side. Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  of the State Council and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry  separately issued statements on the fact that Patten's  constitutional package had been passed in part by the  Legislative Council, and pointed out that the practice of the  British side had tightly closed the door to the resumption of  talks. The behavior of the British side has damaged the  foundation for Sino-British cooperation, and will inevitably  sour the atmosphere for the settlement of the new airport  problems and other problems. As Patten and his like perversely  stick to their course, they will certainly eat their own bitter  fruit. People may wait and see if they do not believe this will  come true.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: New MGM chairman named CREDIT Lyonnais, the French bank which owns Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has brought in a new chairman and strengthened finances at the Hollywood film studio in preparation for MGM's eventual sale. The new chairman and chief executive is Mr Frank Mancuso, former chairman of Paramount Pictures. He takes the place of Mr Alan Ladd Jr, who was ousted on Sunday after more than two years running MGM. Mr Mancuso, 60, is a heavyweight member of the Hollywood establishment who spent 30 years at Paramount but quit in acrimonious circumstances in 1991 when a new president was given effective control over the studio. Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM in 1992 after foreclosing on loans it made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian entrepreneur, who bought the company in 1990 for Dollars 1.3bn. It has also announced three steps to improve the studio's finances and support an expanded programme of film and television production. MGM Holdings Inc, the holding company that the bank set up to own MGM, will assume some Dollars 800m of the studio's Dollars 1.1bn of bank debt. The studio will cut its interest expenses by redeeming Dollars 221m of debentures held by MGM Holdings, and will fund this substantially by selling its cinema assets to the holding company. The cinema chain is one of the largest in Europe, with more than 400 outlets. The bank is also increasing the studio's credit line to Dollars 400m from Dollars 190m. Mr Francois Gille, director general of Credit Lyonnais, said the financial moves would give MGM a debt-to-equity ratio of about 1:2 and the flexibility to 'pursue a full business agenda'. This includes revival of the film company, United Artists, to give MGM two production arms. The deal was largely put together by Mr Michael Ovitz, head of Hollywood's powerful Creative Artists Agency. US law forbids banks to hold equity stakes in companies except in exceptional circumstances, and Credit Lyonnais has until 1997 to dispose of the studio.</p>

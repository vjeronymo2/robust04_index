			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: BT to convert Pounds 1.69bn loan stock into Eurobonds BRITISH Telecom is to convert Pounds 1.69bn (Dollars 2.75bn) of its registered loan stock into Eurobonds. This is the latest development in the government's auction of privatised companies' debt to raise around Pounds 1bn this fiscal year. Baring Brothers and the Treasury first announced the auction of BT and electricity sector debt in August. The BT debt to be converted into Eurobonds carries coupons of 12 1/4 to 12 1/2 per cent and matures between 1997 and 2006. BT and the Treasury have agreed to amend the terms of the stock so that it conforms with the terms and conditions of those on the company's existing Eurosterling bonds. The coupons and payment dates of the debt to be auctioned will remain unchanged. Baring Brothers said the move would enhance significantly the marketability of BT's debt and widen its third party investor base. The existing stock pays interest net of withholding tax, while the Eurobonds will pay interest gross. However, traders said yesterday that while marketability would be improved, the high coupons and likely pricing well above par value would be limiting factors on distribution into the international market. Parties wishing to bid must pre-register their interest with Baring Brothers by November 3. Pre-registration implies no commitment to bid. Barings expects to send out particulars of the auction in the first week of November.</p>

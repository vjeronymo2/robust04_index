			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / MoD criticised for 'overpayments' The Ministry of Defence is paying suppliers between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m a year more than necessary by failing to follow its own guidelines for inflation-adjusted contracts, a National Audit Office report says. The public spending watchdog says arrangements to deal with the effect of inflation on long-term defence contracts have 'not worked as intended'. It finds that the ministry often departs from its own ground rules, laid out in conjunction with the Treasury almost 20 years ago. In one case - the procurement of EH101 helicopters for the Royal Navy - the result is an estimated extra cost of Pounds 72m over 10 years. This is about 4.5 per cent of the value of the contract, awarded in 1991 to IBM of the US as project manager. The helicopters are made jointly by Westland and the Italian company Agusta. The audit office says the question of variation of price arrangements arose late in negotiations, when there was pressure to get a contract signed quickly. Under the guidelines at least 10 per cent of a contract should be non-variable. In the case of the EH101 the figure agreed was only 1 per cent. The average for large contracts examined by the audit office was 5.45 per cent. The guidelines also require a deduction to be made for productivity improvements, but this was not done in most of the cases examined. In many cases, the audit office says in its report, the ministry accepted 'without discussion' contractors' proposals as to which indices should be used to calculate inflation. About Pounds 200m is paid out each year under variation of price arrangements. The contracts involved account for about 20 per cent of the ministry's Pounds 9bn annual procurement budget. The MoD said yesterday it had accepted less stringent terms to gain better basic prices. But revised guidance had been issued and new arrangements would be discussed. Meanwhile, defence officials denied that shell fuses bought four years ago were defective, even though they could not be used in rain, hail or snow. The fuses, made by Fratelli Borletti, were being phased out. Experts said that in rain there was a risk that a shell might explode 150m from the gun. This did not pose a danger to soldiers since the fragments would be projected forwards. 'It would dim their outlook, though,' they added. The RAF is to scrap advanced jet training at Chivenor in Devon and mothball the base. The training will be based at RAF Valley on Anglesey in north Wales. The government said 119 civilian and 779 service posts would be affected. Accounting for Inflation in Defence Procurement, Comptroller and Auditor General. HMSO. Pounds 7.40.</p>

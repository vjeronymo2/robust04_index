			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In a move that could further delay the production of a scarce gas needed for  nuclear warheads, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered additional testing  of the government's tritium reactors before they are restarted. Watkins said  all three tritium-producing reactors at the Savannah River plant near Aiken,  S.C., would undergo ultrasonic testing for cracks. He provided no details. His  spokeswoman, Christina Sankey, said it was "too early to tell" whether the  additional testing would mean a further delay in restarting the first reactor,  designated K reactor. Watkins had announced Sept. 7 that low-power testing of  the reactor would begin next summer.  </P></p>

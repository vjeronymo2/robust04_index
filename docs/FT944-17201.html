			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / This Week: Sport Soccer: October 12. Friendly: England v Romania. Matthew Le Tissier is hotly tipped to make his full England debut in this match. Southampton's gifted forward has so far been limited to substitute appearances for his country. But injuries to England internationals Darren Anderton (Tottenham) and David Platt (Sampdoria) mean Le Tissier is likely to start the game. 'Darren and David have been influential figures since I took over,' England's manager Terry Venables said last week. 'But he (Le Tissier) has started the season superbly; he is more impressive than ever.' The evening also sees European championship games in which Scotland are at home to the Faroe Islands and Wales away to Moldova. Other European championship games on October 12: Austria v Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland v Liechtenstein, Denmark v Belgium, Macedonia v Spain, Turkey v Iceland, Switzerland v Sweden, Ukraine v Slovenia, Greece v Finland, Russia v San Marino, Malta v Czech Republic, Belarus v Luxembourg, Norway v Netherlands, Bulgaria v Georgia, Poland v Azerbaijan, Israel v Slovakia, Netherlands v Germany.                         *      *      * Rugby union: October 12, Wales v Italy (World Cup ranking game), Cardiff. October 15, South Africa v Argentina, Johannesburg. Italy, an improving rugby nation, takes on one whose recent revival seems to have faltered. The Italians beat Romania easily in an earlier match in the group, while Wales only scraped by in Bucharest - a win which was typical of recent victories, encouraging but narrow. Since then Wales have lost skipper Ieuan Evans, the match winner against Romania, to injury, and Scott Quinnell, their energetic back-row forward, to rugby league.                         *      *      * Golf: October 13-16, World Matchplay, Wentworth. Severiano Ballesteros, who has won the event five times, was spurned when invitations were first handed out. The insult seems to have inspired a return to form. He is in as a replacement for John Daly and the weekend promises the entertaining sight of Ballesteros trying to extract revenge for the slight by humiliating everyone concerned.                         *      *      * Motor racing: October 16, European Grand Prix, Jerez, Spain. Two more slighted heroes return. Michael Schumacher (Benetton), banned for the last two races, holds only a one-point lead over Damon Hill, even though Hill has not beaten Schumacher this season in any race in which both have finished. And Nigel Mansell returns from IndyCar racing in the US for the last three grands prix of the season. Mansell, the 1992 world champion, will join Hill in the Williams team, and will want to show he is still competitive in a Formula One car.</p>

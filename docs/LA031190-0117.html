			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING ON AGENTS  </P> <P> What a way to start March, with the front-page article, "Court Slashes  Constitutional Curbs on U.S. Agents Abroad" (March 1). It is amazing to see how  our government has used its power to try and control the world.  </P> <P> We start to see peace everywhere and what happens? Our judiciary guts our  Constitution.  </P> <P> Is this how we want other countries to act? What do we do when foreign nations  turn the tables on us? If the Constitution and its Bill of Rights were good  enough for Jefferson, Madison, et al, what gives William Rehnquist, Antonin  Scalia, and company (the current U.S. Supreme Court) the right to change it  now?  </P> <P> I find the recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court to be deplorable and  can't believe that the people of this country find relief in the decisions our  Supreme Court has been making. In my opinion, we need to rethink the competence  of these people who are appointed to interpret the law for us. I do not support  expanded freedom for the DEA and other federal agencies in other countries. We  are not God and I detest our government thinking we are.  </P> <P> It is amazing to me that as the builders of the Berlin Wall are dismantling it  in favor of greater freedoms, the custodians of our own Wall of Freedom (the  U.S. Constitution) are also dismantling it piece by piece, in favor of lesser  freedoms.  </P> <P> TRAVIS R. NEWELL  </P> <P> Clovis  </P></p>

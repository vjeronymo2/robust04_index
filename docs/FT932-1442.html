			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Manchester and the Olympics (8): Heart of a powerful economic force - Greater Manchester has emerged as the capital of the north / The Region WHEN the results of the 1991 British census were published this year, they were something of a shock for the city of Manchester. Its population was down to 397,400, a drop of 11 per cent on the 1981 number of 449,200. Technically, this may well make it one of the smallest cities to bid for a summer Olympic Games, but the Games have to be awarded to an individual city. In fact, Manchester is bidding on behalf of north-west England, the second biggest economic region in Britain with a population of 6.12m. Only south-east England, dominated by London, is bigger, with 16.71m people. This means the north-west is bigger than Scotland, which has 4.96m people, and Wales, with 2.79m. The north-west's size is comparable with that of Greater London, where 6.38m live. It is made up of Greater Manchester - a conurbation of 2.45m people surrounding Manchester city centre - Merseyside, where 1.38m people live, and Lancashire and Cheshire, counties with populations of 1.36m and nearly 1m respectively. The size of the Greater Manchester conurbation and the development of its airport has seen its emergence as the capital, not only of north-west England, but of northern England as a whole. Although Leeds is always disputing this because it is bigger than Manchester as a single city, it is the sheer critical mass of continuous conurbation that counts - and Greater Manchester is three-and-a-half times bigger than Leeds and more than twice as large as Leeds and its neighbour Bradford combined. Greater Manchester's strength is its location in the middle of an economically powerful belt running from Liverpool to Leeds. The M62 has put either city about 45 minutes away from Manchester. The economic strength in depth of this transpennine belt can be judged when Yorkshire and Humberside's statistics are added to the north-west's. The combined population of the two regions is 10.9m and between them they contribute more than 18 per cent of the UK's gross domestic product. Apart from numbers of people who live in the north-west, the region is economically Britain's second biggest. It contributes more than 10 per cent of UK gross domestic product on its own, which makes it economically bigger than several individual European countries, such as Greece, Portugal, Denmark, and Ireland. There is therefore no local shortage of economic clout. Manchester itself is a self-standing city, with a complete range of financial and professional services to offer the region, which is no longer dependent on going to London for them, as in the past. Merseyside, in spite of a decades-long struggle to reconstruct its local economy following changing patterns of world trade and the development of the EC, remains the UK's principal west coast deep sea port. New industries are slowly emerging and financial and professional service providers are being sent back from Manchester - where several had retreated in 1970s and 1980s - to provide local access to advice. Lancashire, which is heavily dependent on defence industries, is worried by the end of the cold war, but has an enviable depth of redeployable skilled labour as a result of high-technology defence work. Cheshire, in spite of large concentrations of oil and chemicals industry, mainly alongside the Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal, remains the nearest county in the north to the south, not only physically, but in the character of its terrain and villages. Chester, the county seat, is its tourism jewel. The north-west's main problem over the years, however, has been internal rivalry. Liverpool and Manchester supported different sides in the US civil war; Manchester cotton workers were praised by Abraham Lincoln for their fortitude when raw material supplies were cut off, while Merseyside shipwrights built the blockade-running ship, the Alabama. A century ago, Manchester traders built their own Ship Canal so that ocean-going vessels could sail into the heart of the conurbation and bypass Liverpool docks and shippers, who were using a monopoly position to overcharge. This rivalry still shows itself on the football field, but Greater Manchester's growing economic hegemony and bigger size has eventually told. Merseyside would prefer to have Liverpool airport developed as an alternative to a second runway at Manchester's, but, in the main, the four north-west counties now have a coherent view of how they develop together as a region. The Olympic bid has been a considerable unifying force and, if it succeeds, the Games will be spread around to bring fair shares in benefits throughout the region. This growing coherence is nowhere so important as in the private sector. Four years ago, leaders of some of the biggest companies in the region set a regional business leadership team, the only one of its kind in Britain, where such teams are usually much more localised. The originator was Mr John Ashcroft, whose company Coloroll was one of the more spectacular casualties of the recession. But his idea was big enough to assume a life of its own. The Duke of Westminster - a key figure in the Olympic bid - took over as chairman and has welded together a team drawn from some of the most influential businesses in Britain. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, which has its headquarters in Cheshire, says: 'Most of us felt that unless it was regional in scale, there was no point. Its scale had to be consistent with the level of input we could provide. Time was the main thing we were all going to give, so everything had to be big enough to match this. 'You have to have a vision of what this region can become. That vision is shared now by many people. The team is a group of good people pulling together. We always meet in the evening. At a personal level, it's amazing what opportunities and business flow from just knowing what we each do. Most of us had never met before.' When unifying projects which might produce economic synergy were first discussed, a national stadium based in the north-west was an early objective. The Olympic bid fitted the vision. The existence of the business leadership team as a peer group of very senior industrialists has ensured private sector support for it flows from the top. Moreover, their personal contacts and networks go to the top of British life and politics and have played their part in getting the bid for the Games taken seriously by national leaders.</p>

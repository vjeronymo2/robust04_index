			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] General Humberto Ortega declared, following a  "frank, cordial, and open" meeting with Alexander Watson, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs, that  the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] "will never" accept a military  law approved "under U.S. pressure or by capricious positions."    Gen. Ortega added that he will "not retire under anyone's  pressure, nor will the EPS tolerate another situation similar to  what took place on 2 September 1993" when President Violeta  Chamorro announced that the current Army commander in chief  would retire in 1994.    Before departing Nicaragua, Watson commented that what  happened on 2 September 1993 "was not the result of U.S.  pressure; she said it was for her own reasons." Watson, who is  the first U.S. official of his position to meet with the EPS  general staff, refused to say whether Gen. Ortega should retire  this year, like Chamorro said in 1993. "The Army and government  are talking about this very delicate topic," Watson said.    In a news conference Gen. Ortega reiterated the EPS  rejection  of the human rights report prepared by the U.S. State  Department. "This report is not objective and does not fall  within the framework of the relationship that should exist  between two sovereign countries," Ortega told Watson.  <H5>  Watson's Promise </H5>   Presidency Minister Engineer Antonio Lacayo also expressed  rejection of this document at the Augusto Cesar Sandino Airport,  where he arrived to bid Watson farewell. Minister Lacayo  reiterated that the military law draft bill will be in the hands  of the National Assembly in two weeks at the latest and that the  U.S. State Department report "is rather old" and is loaded with  "[word indistinct] language."    According to Gen. Ortega, Mr. Watson promised to take into  account "other Nicaraguan points of view" when drafting the next  report on the topic. He also insisted that the military law  "will be a law on which most Nicaraguans agree."    Watson stressed that one of the basic topics dealt with  during his first visit to Nicaragua was human rights and  reiterated how important it is for the United States "that all  human rights violators are taken to justice."    On the other hand, Ortega, who refused to tell reporters  whether he would retire or not from the EPS this year, stressed  to Watson the "deep crisis" that Nicaragua is going through due  to the high incidence of violence and lack of citizens' security  and the opportunity the United States has to contribute to  national stability. "It is useless to move ahead in other fields  if the country is going to crumble due to problems such as state  corruption, drug trafficking, etc.," Ortega ended.</p>

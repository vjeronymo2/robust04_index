			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NURSE'S ENGLISH-ONLY SUIT  </P> <P> I read "U.S. Supports Nurse in English-Only Suit" (Part B, April 3). I have  been a nurse for 25 years, served in Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines while  in the Air Force.  </P> <P> If I were to have worked as a nurse in any of these countries, I would indeed  have been expected to speak the language of the country while at work. On my  breaks off the floor and at home, I would speak whatever language was native to  me.  </P> <P> I work with a predominately English-speaking geriatric patient population, and  have hired many foreign-born nurses, who when hired understand that while  preforming patient care and working with the supportive staff they must speak  English, so as not to confuse either the patients or staff. If the patient is  foreign speaking, his own language would be preferred to help him understand  and cooperate with nursing care. Unfortunately, many nurses tend to forget and  start speaking their native language on the nursing floor. Occasionally some  nurses are very critical of other staff or administration right in front of  them.  </P> <P> I have no problem with nurses speaking their own languages on breaks off the  nursing floor. But out of respect for the patient population, speak the  language that the patient speaks (while working).  </P> <P> JOHN KIMBALL  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

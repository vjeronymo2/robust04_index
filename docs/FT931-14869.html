			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Zale agrees reorganisation scheme ZALE Corporation, the largest jewellery retailer in the US but operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January 1992, is believed to have reached agreement on a reorganisation plan with all its leading creditors. The company's efforts to haul itself out of Chapter 11 had run into problems with the creditors of its credit unit, Zale Credit Corporation. Under bankruptcy procedure, the reorganisation scheme must be approved by the courts. Full details of the plan were not available immediately, but it is understood to involve a debt-for-equity swap by creditors. One party involved in the matter suggested that Zale could emerge from Chapter 11 by the second quarter of 1993. Zale's equity is largely owned by Peoples Jewellers, based in Toronto, and Swarovski International Holding, a vehicle for the wealthy Austrian family. It was unclear if existing shareholders would get anything in the reorganisation.</p>

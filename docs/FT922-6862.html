			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Housing may be cut from RPI HOUSING costs may disappear from the retail prices index if Britain is to bring its measure of inflation more closely into harmony with other European Community countries. Half the EC's member states make no allowance for housing costs in their calculations of the main inflation rate - only the UK and Ireland include mortgage interest payments. Other countries, such as Germany, measure home-owning housing costs with an 'imputed rent' system - the cost is treated as if the properties had been rented. That approach was used in Britain until 1975 but dropped because the private rented sector was too small and unrepresentative a market on which to base the housing costs of most of the population. At the International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1987, the International Labour Organisation recommended that countries should provide an all-items index that excludes shelter in order to ease international comparisons. The ILO said that although the exclusion of shelter from the all-items index would not eliminate all the differences encountered when making such comparisons, it would make rates of price change more comparable across countries. The recommendation stemmed partly from concerns about the different methodologies used to calculate housing costs, but another concern was that housing markets were distinctive to different countries. Whether because of rental controls or tax incentives, markets did not behave in an identical manner. Although Eurostat, the EC's statistical office, has looked at the issue of the harmonisation of inflation measures across the EC, little has yet been heard of any definite proposals. A report published by Eurostat in 1989 suggested that imputed rents could be used as the yardstick for measuring owner-occupiers' housing costs. The Confederation of British Industry, which criticises the inclusion of mortgage interest payments in the calculation of the RPI, says that would not be difficult to implement in the UK, since imputed rents are already used in the UK's national accounts for measuring owner-occupiers' housing costs.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Tots have a tax allowance, too - Financing the Family / Children's savings / But a pitfall awaits parents. If one of them gives the capital, and income from it exceeds Pounds 100 a year, it is taxed as the parent's income Children are big business. Every year they receive more than Pounds 600m in gifts, earnings and pocket money, which makes them a popular target for financial institutions. Special accounts and savings schemes for children are now actively promoted by banks, building societies, friendly societies, investment houses and the government's own National Savings. But parents or relatives must first decide how best to channel a young person's enthusiasm for saving. Is the objective, simply to teach them the rudiments of budgeting through a bank or building society account, with instant access to their money, the bonus of a small amount of interest and, in some cases, freebies such as stickers, magazines and money boxes? Or are they to be encouraged to think of longer-term investments, which could go towards buying a first car? Whatever the circumstances, the most important consideration is the tax position of children. Each is entitled to the general personal tax allowance of Pounds 3,445. That means a child can earn a weekly income of up to Pounds 66.25 without notifying the taxman. But, as Inland Revenue spokeswoman Eleanor Graham points out, there is a pitfall for unwary parents: 'If it is one of the parents who has given the capital, and the income produced from that capital is more than Pounds 100 a year, then the whole of that income is taxed as the parent's income.' There is another essential part of the tax equation which is still not always appreciated. Many non-taxpayers - including children - have still not been registered with the tax authorities to receive bank and building society interest without having tax automatically deducted at source. The Revenue is not clairvoyant, so parents, guardians or relatives should ensure that they complete the Revenue's R85 form to receive interest payments gross. The form is available at banks, building societies and local tax inquiry offices. Mark Hemingway, a spokesman for the Halifax, the UK's largest society, says: 'We have three children's accounts - Little Xtra, Quest and Maxim - for different age groups. But of our 1.8m childrens' accounts, only about 55 per cent have so far registered to receive gross interest. It is very disappointing.' Tax-breaks aside - and their importance should not be underestimated - the choice of a particular bank or building society could boil down to high-street branch accessibility or, where parents bank. According to the latest Moneyfacts guide to investment rates, which is available in a number of larger public libraries, there are nearly 50 societies and 12 banks with special childrens' accounts. Interest rates range from the Alliance &amp; Leicester's 0.25 per cent gross on sums of Pounds 1 in the Cash Plus account, to the Norwich &amp; Peterborough's 6.3 per cent gross for minimum deposits of Pounds 250 in its Head Start Bond. Somewhere in between is the Chelsea Building Society's Kids account, paying 3.55 per cent gross. The Hertfordshire-based Harpenden Building Society's 18 Club account pays 7 per cent gross on Pounds 5 or more, but the money cannot be touched until the account holder is 18. Generally speaking, children can access their own bank and building society accounts from the age of seven. Among the banks, Lloyds' Young Savers account, for children up to the age of 11, pays gross interest of 1 per cent up to Pounds 50 and 1.5 per cent on Pounds 50 to Pounds 100. The bank's Headway account, which is for 12- to 18-year-olds, pays the same interest. Generally speaking, building societies pay better interest rates than the banks. On the other hand, if young savers are also concerned about freebies, the banks are a better bet. Lloyds' Headway, for example, offers a free camera, while Midland's LIVE]Cash will offer a free driving lesson where appropriate. Barclays gives free membership of the Our Price Music Club, with Pounds 10 vouchers; and Bank of Scotland gives its Express account holders, aged 12 to 17, half-yearly newsletters and audio cassette tapes. For longer-term investors, the first port of call is National Savings. Issue F of the NS Children's Bonus Bond, for example, pays a tax-free and guaranteed return of 7.35 per cent a year, provided it is held for five years. The minimum purchase is Pounds 25 and the maximum Pounds 1,000, but, under a new concession, that is in addition to any investment in previous issues. Other National Savings accounts which could be suitable for children include the one-month-notice Investment Account, which pays 5.25 per cent gross on up to Pounds 499. The instant access NS Ordinary Account pays 2 per cent gross on deposits of Pounds 10, and the first Pounds 70 of annual interest is tax-free. For the racier-minded parent, grandparent or even great-grandparent - the child must be a direct descendant - Pounds 100 in Pounds 1 Premium Bonds bought this month gives a 100 chances of winning the new Pounds 1m NS jackpot. After gross-paying NS accounts, the next step to maximise tax advantages could be a 10-year tax-exempt Friendly Society Bond, such as Family Assurance's Junior bond or Homeowners' Children's Cash Builder bond. Up to Pounds 18 a month can be invested in such schemes. Friendly society bonds are based on stock market investments with a tax sweetener. There are, however, no such breaks for children through personal equity plans, as these cannot be held by anyone aged under 18. That does not mean that straightforward long-term investments cannot be made in the stock market through a unit or investment trust, regardless of tax incentives. Invesco MIM has for some years managed the Rupert Children's unit trust, which invests in top UK companies, and has a monthly savings level of just Pounds 10. And last month the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif) published a free one-page guide on suitable investment gifts for children. Homeowners' Friendly Society offers a free booklet, 'Your Guide to Savings for Children' (Tel 0800 591137). Autif's free 'How to Do It' guide is available from Children's Savings Guide, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B 6TD.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHILDREN'S CHOICE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Telephone                           Notice                                number             Account      or term  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGH STREET SELECTION: Halifax BS                0422 333333   Little Xtra/Quest      Instant Leeds Permanent BS        0532 438181         Liquid Gold      Instant N&amp;P BS                    0274 733444     Instant Reserve      Instant Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS 0733 371371     Head Start Bond      Instant Skipton BS                0756 700511     Young Sovereign      Instant  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OTHERS: Cambridge BS              0223 315440               First**    Instant Chorley &amp; District BS     0257 279373       Young Chorlean**   Instant Monmouthshire BS          0633 840454         Young Savers     Instant Scarborough BS            0723 368155    Young Super Saver     Instant Universal BS             091 232 0973            Childrens     Instant NATIONAL SAVINGS:                                                 Investment     1 month                                    Children's Bond Issue F 5-year bond  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Minimum        Rate       Interest                       deposit (Pounds)          %           paid  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGH STREET SELECTION: Halifax BS                         10        3.75     1/2-yearly Leeds Permanent BS                  1        3.75         Yearly N&amp;P BS                              1        3.60         Yearly Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS         250        6.30     1/2-yearly Skipton BS                         25        6.50*        Yearly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OTHERS: Cambridge BS                        1        6.00         Yearly Chorley &amp; District BS               5        7.45         Yearly Monmouthshire BS                   10        4.50     1/2-yearly Scarborough BS                     10        4.75         Yearly Universal BS                        1        6.00         Yearly NATIONAL SAVINGS:                  20        5.25         Yearly                                    25        7.35             On                                                       encashment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * 2% bonus if no withdrawals to December 1, 1994.  ** Available to local residents only.

In regard  to the Security Council resolution, Israel hopes it will pave  the way for the resumption of these talks. Israel was first to  condemn the horrendous massacre in Hebron and will continue to  take decisive action against extremists and dangerous elements.  Israel will encourage any measures to restore stability in the  territories -- as far as they are in conformity with the DOP --  and do its utmost to carry out its responsibility for the  security of all Arabs and Israelis in the territories. Finally,  Israel's position on Jerusalem is well known: Jerusalem is and  will be the united capital of Israel. Any reference to it as  part of the territories is unacceptable.</p>

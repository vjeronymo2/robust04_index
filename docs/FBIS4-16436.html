			<p>BFN     [Text] ITAR-TASS has learned that Russia's procurator  general has reopened the so-called Rutskoy trust case, in  connection with the incompleteness of the investigation  conducted earlier. Among other things, Rutskoy, the notary who  verified the documents, and other persons were not questioned on  all the circumstances of the trust agreement. Furthermore, a  number of expert investigations need to be carried out,  including one into the trust agreement itself.</p>

"The  thin thread that connected the Chernomyrdin Government and  reformers over the past months," the IZVESTIYA newspaper writes,  "snapped after Viktor Chernomyrdin left the Kremlin following a  six-hour tete-a-tete conversation with the president on January  18.    "The premier broke this thread, vitally important for  Russia's revival, with his own hand, dismissing Gaydar as if a  servant and predetermining the same lot for Boris Fedorov (eds:  finance minister). Thus, the reformist wing in the government  has been virtually cut off.    "The reformer president is forced to agree with the premier  due to the fact that he has no right to ignore the results of  the parliamentary elections. From now on, the government of  reforms ceased to exist in Russia."    In an interview with the same newspaper, Gaydar said that he  had only one alternative: "Either to stay, using possibilities  offered by the post of first vice-premier and at the same time  to serve as a cover for a policy with which he disagrees, or to  achieve complete political clarity, losing the post.    "Real political space for me in the cabinet considerably  shrank over the past few weeks." According to Gaydar, "our state  now cannot be regarded as democratic. Bureaucracy again starts  ossifying. The departure of the state with its apparatus from  the people again sharply intensified".    "After Gaydar's resignation," the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  newspaper  writes, "another vice-premier, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov  turned to be in the political limelight. No matter who and what  is said, but the country's line in the credit and monetary  policy and the fight against inflation is linked (in Russia and  abroad) to actions of the `iron' finance minister.    "The appearance of a new notion in Russian political life --  the joining of a government in the process of reorganisation  under definite conditions -- is linked with the name of Fedorov.    "These facts can be treated in different ways, but they  cannot be dismissed. This means work in a federal body on  conditions of a political and moral contract."    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper tries to examine reasons  for a sharp fall of the rouble against the U.S. dollar. "The  resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov do not exactly coincide with  the start of the dollar's vigorous growth," the newspaper writes.    "However, Gaydar's resignation is nearly nothing for the  artificially pent-up dollar. Fedorov is another pair of shoes.  Rumours about his resignation started circulating from January  10 when the rouble nosedived."    The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper features an interview  with  former Russian Security Council Secretary Yuriy Skokov who  writes: "There are no clear-cut rules of game in the field of  economic reforms, as before. Rules are being changed every day  without agreeing them with those who directly participate in  these reforms.    "There is no reasonable programme either. If we are to speak  about the efficiency of moves made spontaneously, we are  skidding downward all the time, spending what was created by  others." Skokov says that he has no aim of becoming Russian  president "at present".    The same newspaper writes in anotehr article that "a turn  for  the better evidently set in in relations between Moscow and  Tbilisi. This is at least the opinion of Russian Ambassador to  Georgia Vladimir Zemskiy.    He says in an interview with the newspaper that the sides  managed to turn to a dialogue and mutual tolerance from tension  and even confrontation caused by the events at first in South  Ossetia and then in Abkhazia.    According to the ambassador, the improvement of relations  will be crowned with a visit to Tbilisi by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin scheduled for February 3-4 and the long-awaited  signing of a treaty of friendship, good-neighbourly relations  and cooperation.    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with  Lieutenant-General Viktor Yesin from the Chief Staff of Russian  Strategic Forces who writes: "The reached mutually acceptable  understanding on non-targeting of missiles (eds: of Russia and  the United States at each other) means for us that they will  have `zero' flight assignment.    "Every-day control over nuclear vehicles of delivery will be  exercised, proceeding from the fact that Russia, as it is  recorded in its military doctrine, does not regard any state as  its enemy.    "We shall not threaten anybody, but this does not preclude  in  any way a possibility under a contingency to set targets in the  missile control systems on orders from the Russian president who  is supreme commander-in-chief."    The PRAVDA newspaper runs an article by lower house member  Viktor Shevelukha who says that the reason for the decline of  the Russian countryside lies "in the long-standing economic  pillage of peasants and agriculture as a whole and in the  exaction of nearly all added value of the Gross National Product  without its return, at least partially, to agriculture".    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper features "statement by the  Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party", "warning of a  new round of `witch-hunt', a drive against dissidents in some  former Soviet republics".    "Former Soviet republics carry out anticommunist actions  with  surprising orchestration and consistency," the document says.  "The trial of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is  followed by trials of party members and leaders of its  organisations."</p>

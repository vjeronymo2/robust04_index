			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN, VAN DE KAMP FOCUS ON CRIME, BUDGET;  </P> <P> DEBATE: SHE ASSAILS HIM ON THE DEATH PENALTY. HE QUESTIONS HER FISCAL  MANAGEMENT ABILITIES.  </P> <P> Scrambling to harness momentum for their down-to-the-wire campaigns, the  Democratic candidates for governor zeroed in on their opponent's perceived  vulnerabilities during Sunday evening's hourlong debate -- Dianne Feinstein  persistently questioning John K. Van de Kamp's dedication to the death penalty  and Van de Kamp challenging her fitness to be the state's fiscal manager.  </P> <P> In the second of two hard-fought debates, probably their last before the June 5  primary, the Democrats reinforced the messages they have sought to drive home  during the long months of the campaign -- Van de Kamp the lawyerly, even stodgy  public servant with a specific agenda; Feinstein, the personification of  progressive change in her quest to become the state's first woman governor.  </P> <P> "I think in this election you have a choice between a lawyer and someone who  wants to be a leader," Feinstein told questioners at KCBS-TV studios in Los  Angeles and viewers throughout the state. "I want to represent women. I want to  open the door. I want to see that minorities take their place in this society  in a meaningful way."  </P> <P> But Van de Kamp tried to underscore his contention that Feinstein is heavy on  style and light on substance.  </P> <P> "The fact is you can't govern California with generalities. You can't rely on  image and 30-second commercials," he said. "What major proposal is Dianne  fighting for? . . . Commissions are no substitute for commitment."  </P> <P> Touting the three initiatives that he has pressed to get on the November  ballot, Van de Kamp labeled Feinstein as "pretty weak" in comparison. But  Feinstein tartly compared her executive experience as San Francisco's mayor to  Van de Kamp's tenure as attorney general. "You know, John, you demean your  opponent and puff yourself up," she said. "The fact is, you've never really put  together a budget, you've never really grappled with a shortfall. I have --  nine years in a row. You've never had to put together an AIDS program. . . .  Yet you're so willing to sit back and criticize me."  </P> <P> As did last week's debate in San Francisco, the Los Angeles debate focused  largely on crime and budgets, the emotional and pocketbook concerns of voters.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp was repeatedly called to task on the death penalty, which he  personally opposes but has vowed to carry out. Criticized in recent months for  maintaining a high profile as convicted murderer Robert Alton Harris neared the  gas chamber, the attorney general said he opposed the televising of executions  because they should not be "a public circus event." He also said he opposes  changing California law so that juveniles could be sent to the gas chamber.  </P> <P> But Feinstein took issue with the distinction Van de Kamp has tried to draw  regarding his public and private views.  </P> <P> "I think this is one of those issues you've got to be for what you are for. . .  . I know you've called the death penalty both barbaric and a blot," Feinstein  said. "I also know that if you had your way, the Hillside Strangler today would  be on the street."  </P> <P> While Los Angeles County district attorney in 1981, Van de Kamp decided against  filing murder charges against Angelo Buono, one of two men convicted in the  notorious series of hillside killings. The case was turned over to the attorney  general's office, which won the murder convictions.  </P> <P> During the debate Van de Kamp refused to say how he would handle the governor's  clemency privilege, despite suggestions by Feinstein that he would feel morally  compelled to commute death sentences. And he declined to say how he would react  if, during his tenure as governor, the question of the death penalty were to  appear on a state ballot.  </P> <P> But Van de Kamp took the offensive on the issue of the state budget, announcing  that he would release after the debate a comprehensive list of budget cuts and  tax increases that would balance the state's budget, which is currently running  at a $3.6 billion deficit. He challenged Feinstein to follow suit.  </P> <P> The plan calls for $1.3 billion in budget cuts -- the biggest reductions from a  5% cut in administrative costs -- and $2.3 billion in tax increases. Feinstein  declined to comment on the plan.  </P> <P> In Sunday's debate, Van de Kamp struck at Feinstein -- as he did at the first  debate -- for her willingness to negotiate the cost-of-living adjustments for  the blind, disabled and elderly to balance the budget.  </P> <P> " . . . Mrs. Feinstein would put cost-of-living adjustments on the table for  the needy, blind and disabled. . . . I will not," he said.  </P> <P> On the touchy subject of abortion -- which was raised repeatedly last Sunday  and during the week because of Feinstein's characterization of sex-selection  abortions as a "misuse" of abortion rights -- it was Van de Kamp who was on the  hot seat Sunday.  </P> <P> Asked how he would counsel his daughter if she were a pregnant teen-ager, Van  de Kamp underscored his personal opposition to abortion, which runs counter to  his political support of abortion rights.  </P> <P> "I'm sure I'd have a heart-to-heart with her and talk about the future of that  potential life," he said. "I'd counsel her to carry the child and let her know  that she was going to have a grandmother and a grandfather who really cared  about her and make sure she grew up with a real future."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp acknowledged that he would feel "less comfortable" in offering the  same advice to a stranger, and he said he believes minors have the right to  decide for themselves whether to have an abortion.  </P> <P> He did not address, despite being asked, why his office has defended in court  the state law requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortions.  </P> <P> On the subject of malathion spraying to eradicate the Medfly, both candidates  agreed they would halt -- and not resume -- the aerial spraying of the  pesticide in urban areas. Feinstein said she would rely on a ground war, using  the young people from the Conservation Corps and "the National Guard, if  necessary" to strip trees and spray locally.  </P> <P> "You would do it by ground with the knowledge and permission of the property  owner rather than through this massive invasion of spraying like 'Apocalypse  Now,' which I think is very bothersome to people," she said.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp attacked one of Feinstein's recently proposed ideas -- to inspect  first-class mail for fruit that might carry the pest -- calling it a "crazy"  invasion of privacy.  </P> <P> A discussion of the state's continuing wrestling match with the cost and  availability of automobile insurance drew the first brusque retort, after Van  de Kamp said Feinstein had allied herself with elements of the insurance  industry.  </P> <P> "John, why don't you let me tell people what I believe rather than you telling  people what I believe?" Feinstein said sharply. "I think it would be far more  accurate."  </P> <P> Both said they favored rate rollbacks for California drivers.  </P> <P> On a smattering of other issues, there was occasional agreement. Both said they  opposed construction of a Peripheral Canal that would bring water from Northern  California to the arid south. Both used a tragedy from the past to press for  strict controls on weapons -- Van de Kamp the Stockton schoolyard massacre and  Feinstein the assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone, whose death  elevated her to the mayor's office.  </P> <P> "I think we have to know where the guns are," she said.  </P> <P> Right off the bat, Van de Kamp continued using the debate format to put his  opponent on the spot, frequently using his rebuttal period to ask questions  that, because of the format, she could not answer.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp also seemed more able to work within the confines of the format in  answering questions, timing his responses to fit nicely within the strictures.  Feinstein, in contrast, regularly ran over her time limit and had to be quieted  by the moderator, who said her warning light was not working properly.  </P> <P> Feinstein and Van de Kamp stood six feet apart at the same podiums before which  they had debated in San Francisco -- the props were trucked down for Sunday's  rematch. She wore a navy blue suit and white blouse, he a navy blue suit and  red tie.  </P> <P> The debate was preceded and followed on KCBS-TV by commercials touting the man  the two Democrats are fighting for the right to face in November -- U.S. Sen.  Pete Wilson. The Republican has no substantial opposition for his party's  nomination.  </P> <P> By the wishes of the candidate, there was no audience in the studio except for  the moderator, KCBS anchorman Jim Lampley, and the questioners -- Los Angeles  Daily News reporter Rick Orlov, San Diego Union reporter Gerry Braun, KCBS  reporter Terry Anzur and Frank del Olmo, deputy editor of the Los Angeles  Times' editorial pages.  </P> <P> Times staff writers John Balzar, Doug Shuit and George Skelton contributed to  this report.  </P> <P> DEBATE EXCERPTS: A21  </P></p>

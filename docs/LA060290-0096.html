			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 10% INCREASE SOUGHT FOR POLLUTION FEES  </P> <P> The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District has proposed to hike the cost  of permits by 10% to businesses that add pollutants to the air, county  officials said.  </P> <P> The increase, subject to approval by the County Board of Supervisors, will  increase fees for oil companies, power companies, gas stations and other  businesses emitting pollutants and is expected to raise $119,000 annually, said  Mike Villegas, a district spokesman.  </P> <P> "We're increasing fees and we're changing how we weight some of the  pollutants," Villegas said.  </P> <P> Fees are being restructured to penalize companies more severely for emitting  certain pollutants, such as those known to harm the ozone layer, and less for  others.  </P> <P> Villegas said fees are charged on the basis of the number of pounds per hour of  pollutants emitted, with different fees being assessed for different  pollutants. He said most pollutants are assessed at the rate of $43 per pound  per hour.  </P> <P> The increased revenues will be used to pay the salaries of seven new staff  members and to finance new programs mandated by the California Clean Air Act of  1988.  </P> <P> There are now nearly 1,000 businesses with permits. Villegas said he expects  that number to increase as more businesses move into the area and as county  pollution standards become stricter.  </P></p>

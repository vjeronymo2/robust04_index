			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--Ahmad Murtada Ahmad, minister  of transportation and communications, has stressed Iraq's  readiness to discuss and study the signing and implementation of  contracts with Italian firms and institutions in the fields of  transportation and communications.    During a meeting today with Italian members of parliament  Antonio Catika and Joseph Sarta [names as received], the  minister said that such contracts would include railroads,  communications, aviation, airlines, maritime transportation,  trucks, and buses, and could be worth billions of dollars.    He said Italian firms had benefited from the extensive  commercial ties that once existed between Iraq and Italy. He  said such firms suffered grave losses as a result of the unfair  embargo imposed on Iraq by the U.S. Administration.    The two Italian parliament members stressed that they will  brief the Italian parliament during its next session on their  impressions of the situation in Iraq and the suffering of the  Iraqi people as a result of the blockade. They will also brief  the Italian parliament on the extensive business prospects  available for Italian firms in Iraq.</p>

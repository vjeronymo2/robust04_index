			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (5): First, assess your attitude to risk - Providers and their funds The market for personal pensions is dominated by the life offices, which account for about 97 per cent of sales to date. The only threat to this near-monopoly comes from the unit- and investment-trust groups. Gartmore, Invesco, Rothschild Asset Management, Framlington, Foreign &amp; Colonial and Dunedin all offer plans. Most large banks and building societies sell their own life office products through their branch networks (a process known as 'bancassurance'), while the smaller banks and societies act as appointed representatives and sell the products of the life office to which they are tied. An ever-decreasing minority act as independent advisers. Within providers' product ranges there are several investment options to consider. Unit-linked and unit trust plans are relatively easy to understand. Conventional with-profits plans and 'unitised' with-profits are not. The following summary may help you decide which is most suitable for your age, financial circumstances, and attitude to risk. It also explains how the charges are expressed. Unit-linked plans are sold by life offices, including the life-office arm of several unit trust groups (Save &amp; Prosper and Mercury, for example). Your contributions buy units in a fund, and the value of these units fluctuates in line with the market value of the underlying assets. Funds on offer cover the entire risk spectrum, but most people opt for the managed fund, which usually invests in a range of the provider's other main funds and in this way offers a balanced spread of investments. Unit-linked charges include an initial charge of about 5 per cent (known as the bid/offer spread) and an annual management charge of between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent. On top of this there are monthly administration and/or policy charges. If commission is paid to the adviser or salesman, this will form part of the initial charge and may also account for some of the strange terminology associated with unit-linked plans such as 'initial periods' and 'initial' or 'capital' units These terms imply high charges. Unit trust plans offer a similar investment choice to unit-linked plans, and again the value of your units will fluctuate in line with the performance of the underlying assets. The choice of unit trust personal pensions is still very limited, but more groups are likely to enter the market over the next 12 months. The same goes for investment trust personal pensions. You can also invest in the entire range of both types of trust through a self-invested personal pension (see page 4 of this survey). As a rule, the charges on unit and investment trust plans are simple and transparent, but not necessarily cheaper than unit-linked plans, although the latest entrants - Framlington and Dunedin - claim to offer a low-cost version. Typical unit trust charges include an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual fund-management charge of between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent depending on the fund. However, the trust plans impose level charges on each premium - they do not weight charges to the early years, so there should be no penalties for stopping and reducing contributions. Until recently, 'conventional' with-profits formed the backbone of the individual pensions market, because these funds provided a high degree of security together with good potential for capital growth. The with-profits fund (which is the fund of the life office itself) invests mainly in UK and international equities, gilts and other fixed-interest securities, and property. The investor is guaranteed a certain basic amount at the end of the term. To this, interest or bonuses are added each year, with a final discretionary bonus at the end. Like interest on a building society account, once these bonuses are allocated they cannot be taken away. The bonuses are 'smoothed' in order to provide a relatively consistent return. To do this, the life office holds back some of the profits in good years to boost returns in lean years. There are no explicit charges on a with-profits plan, apart from a monthly policy fee. Other charges are deducted from the fund itself before the bonuses are declared - again, rather like a building society account. Conventional with-profits plans are rare these days, following the introduction of a unitised version in the 1980s which has a similar charging structure to unit-linked plans. Unfortunately, this new version is even more complex than the original, particularly in the way profit is distributed. There is no basic sum guaranteed at retirement, and the bonus system varies from provider to provider, which makes comparison difficult. However, unitised plans allow you to switch more easily to other funds, or from a unit-linked to a unitised fund - a common pattern in the run-up to retirement, when you might wish to consolidate gains and reduce risk. Unitisation heralded the arrival of the controversial 'market value adjuster' (MVA). These adjusters, which are used as a safety net for life offices in the event of a mass exodus of clients following a drop in the markets, allow providers to reduce the value of units whenever, and by however much, they wish. In this respect, the guaranteed nature of the annual bonuses is less than rock-solid.</p>

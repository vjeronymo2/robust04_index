			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology: Holograms in a new light Somewhere in Britain a man has removed the security hologram from his credit card and replaced it with a three-dimensional image of Bugs Bunny. In the two years since he made the exchange, retailers and shop assistants have chortled, but none has ever questioned the validity of the holographic rabbit. The exercise, to demonstrate how ineffective holograms are as a security measure, also shows how widely they have become accepted by consumers. Holograms are made of light-sensitive plastic film that reflects and transmits light in different ways. They appear on bonds, currency and drivers' licences, as well as on video recordings and pharmaceutical packaging. But some applications offer greater benefits for industry. At a recent seminar on advances in the manufacture of holographic materials at Loughborough University, a British Gas researcher expressed interest in capturing transient events, such as laboratory explosions, on holograms. Unlike the wire-frame models of car bodies commonly modelled on computers, explosions and shocks to the flow of gas through a pipeline cannot be captured in this way. Holograms will allow them to be reproduced, analysed and measured in controlled conditions. Holograms can also be made like semi-silvered mirrors, reflecting images and data from a hidden instrument panel, but remaining transparent. Japanese car manufacturers are among many investigating the possibility of using a pop-up holographic screen in front of the driver to highlight dashboard data such as speed and petrol consumption. Other research is aimed at projecting the data or maps on the inside of the curved windscreen. A similar technique could be used to provide instrument panels in aircraft. British Aerospace, GEC Avionics and Crosfield Electronics have all expressed interest in the use of holograms for instrumentation such as altimeters, for example. The most significant step forward in holographic research, however, will come when moving holograms can be displayed; television screens offer potentially the most demanding application. Sharp Electronics and Loughborough University are among many organisations working on three-dimensional television. One idea is to create an array of tiny holographic lenses in the photosensitive screen. These, using two television projectors behind the screen, will give the illusion of depth by creating a moving stereoscopic image. Initially, however, special glasses will need to be worn by the viewer. True three-dimensional television, or holograms in real time and not just in instrumental panels, are still years away, says Jeremy Coupland, co-ordinator for the Institute of Optical Engineering at Loughborough University of Technology. For the immediate future, it seems the only practical use for holograms is likely to be on credit cards. Keep an eye out for Bugs Bunny.</p>

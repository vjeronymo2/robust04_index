			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Australia compensates for sell-off THE state government of New South Wales (NSW) yesterday announced a tax compensation agreement with the Australian federal government paving the way for several proposed privatisations. Mr George Souris, privatisation minister in the state's conservative government, said Canberra had agreed to write off ADollars 430m (Pounds 187m) of NSW debt to allow privatisation of the NSW Government Insurance Office (GIO). The debt write-off is intended to compensate the state government for the loss of corporate income tax from the GIO. Under a long-standing arrangement between the federal and state governments, state-owned businesses are exempt from federal income tax, but are required to pay an equivalent sum to the state. The agreement, which is the first of its kind, overcomes a significant obstacle to the privatisation of state government assets by compensating for the loss of tax revenue. It is likely to pave the way for similar compensation for other state government assets listed for privatisation - notably the State Bank and electricity generation industry in NSW. Mr Souris said the agreement was 'vital' to the successful privatisation of the GIO, Australia's fifth largest domestic insurance company, which is expected to raise up to ADollars 1.8bn in a flotation later this year. He said the bulk of the debt write-off would comprise ADollars 360m reflecting the estimated net present value of GIO's projected tax payments to the state over the next five years. The remaining ADollars 70m would compensate the state government for deferred tax liability accumulated by the GIO Life Fund. The debt write-off is equivalent to about 5.7 per cent of the state government's total debt of ADollars 7.6bn. The federal government confirmed that a deal had been reached in principle between Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, and Mr Nick Greiner, the NSW premier.</p>

The disadvantages for some groups, for instance in  agriculture and in the foodstuffs industry, are far surpassed by  the advantages of EU membership for the overall economy,  Felderer said. Just the abolition of waiting times at the  borders and of customs administration will produce annual  savings of 8 to 20 billion schillings for the companies.    If one adds the abolition of certificates of origin, the end  of the discrimination in the processing trade and the  no-longer-necessary import turnover tax, this results in a  massive growth of 30 to 60 billion schillings or 2 to 3 percent,  the IHS head said.    These are only the advantages that can be calculated  relatively easily; one also has to take the dynamism of the  single market into account. However, it is difficult to put the  specific effects into figures.    Felderer thinks that a common European currency will "not"  be  introduced "in this century." The dates set down in the  Maastricht Treaty will be negotiated once again because of the  difficulties of individual member countries, the IHS chief  believes.  <H5>  End of Anonymity </H5>   Felderer said that the abolition of anonymous savings  accounts and securities accounts is already "decided" -- which  was, however, rejected by the Finance Ministry yesterday.  Because of the "extremely attractive" final taxation within the  framework of the tax on capital gains, one no longer needs  anonymity; in case of the abolition of anonymity, he does not  expect any negative effects on Austria as a financial location  and on the savings quota.</p>

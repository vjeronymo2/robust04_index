			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "At Baghdad Embassy Suggestion, </F> Jordanian Parties Invite Iraqi Ba'th Party To Send Delegation  From Its Leadership To Visit Amman"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed sources  announced yesterday that Jordanian parties have invited the  Iraqi Ba'th Party Regional Command [BPRC] to visit Jordan at the  nearest opportunity to hold party, political, and mass dialogues  and rallies in Jordan.    The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Islamic Action  Front [IAF] party, the Pan-Arab Action Front [PAAF] party, and  the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] handed the  invitation to Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan Nuri al-Wayyis.    The sources confirm that a meeting was held at the Iraqi  Embassy in Amman last week between the Iraqi ambassador and  representatives of the three parties. The Iraqi ambassador  expressed during the meeting his wish that the parties'  representatives make a gesture and invite the Iraqi BPRC to  visit Jordan.    In the light of that, the Iraqi Ba'th Party is expected to  accept the invitation. The three parties express clear sympathy  with Iraq's political stances. The Iraqi Embassy has been eager  to develop cooperation between these parties and the leadership  of the Ba'th Party in Iraq.    The IAF party and the PAAF party announced in the past the  establishment of a joint coordination command between them, and  they now take unified political and party positions on all  issues raised. The Jordanian ASBP joined them later.</p>

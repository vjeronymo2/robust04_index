			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Private-sector machinery  orders in March rose a sharp 10.3 percent from February to  provide an indicator that the downtrend in capital spending is  coming to an end, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said  Tuesday [17 May].    March machinery orders, excluding volatile orders for ships  and from electric power firms, came to 946.8 billion yen, after  falling a month-on-month 6.3 percent in February.    On a year-on-year basis, the figure marks a 0.2 percent dip,  compared with an 8.9 percent yearly drop reported the previous  month.    Private machinery orders are regarded as the key indicator  of  corporate investment in plant and equipment for the months ahead.    An EPA official said the March figure underscores that the  downward cycle in machinery orders is coming to completion.    Thanks to the boost in March orders, orders for the  January-March quarter marked a 6.6 percent increase from the  previous three-month period, which is far above the government's  target of a 9.6 percent decline.    The official, however, quickly added the agency wants to  keep  a close watch on the data for the time being rather than making  its own prediction on machinery orders in the coming months.    His caution apparently reflects poor forecasts for the  April-June period simultaneously released, which projected a  13.0 percent plunge in private machinery orders excluding  volatile ones.    He said the forecast, based on the agency's hearings  conducted in late March on 280 firms, seems partly dampened by a  negative reaction to the buoyant results in the January-March  quarter.    In the latest reporting month, private orders including  those  for ships and from power firms, at 1,158.6 billion yen, were  flat from February and down 5.1 percent from the year before.    Orders from the public sector totaled 334.3 billion yen, a  25.3 percent surge from the prior month and up 6.4 percent from  a year earlier.    Foreigners placed orders totaling 542.4 billion yen, also up  a steep 24.2 percent from February and an 8.8 percent rise from  the same month last year.    All included, overall machinery orders in March amounted to  2,231.6 billion yen, 9.1 percent larger than February and 0.2  percent more than a year earlier, the agency said.    The EPA also said private machinery orders, free of volatile  factors, for fiscal 1993 which ended March 31 totaled 10,568.4  billion yen, down 9.4 percent from the previous year.    Overall orders also dropped 3.3 percent to 24,679.8 billion  yen for the third straight year of decline, but the EPA official  noted the fall was less sharp than a 9.8 percent drop the  previous year.</p>

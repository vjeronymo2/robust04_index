			<p>BFN     [Text] National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk has  announced that he has introduced a motion before the president  regarding taking legal proceedings against the budget law before  the Constitutional Tribunal.    The head of the Defense Ministry objects to the duty imposed  by the budget law to buy Polish Iryda planes for the Army.    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] The verdict of the  Constitutional Tribunal--should it be favorable to the Ministry  of National Defense--will eliminate a dangerous precedent. This  would be the first point. The second is that I foresee no  problems, since the government draft budget would then be  restored, and all the orders placed in the remaining 30  enterprises of the armaments industry would then be implemented  in full.    At the moment, this money must be found somewhere. It must  either be removed from orders already processed by the industry  in other enterprises that provide equipment needed by the Army  and that fulfill all specifications, or training will have to be  cut. This is a matter that is dangerous to the defense  capabilities of the country. [end recording]    Minister Kolodziejczyk gave an interview for the "Sygnaly  Dnia" program.    Presidential spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski has said that it  is  not impossible that Lech Walesa will bring action against the  budget regarding that part that refers to the Ministry of  National Defense.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yun Ho-jin, DPRK deputy chief of mission at </F> the International Atomic Energy Agency, by Brigitte Voykowitsch  in Vienna; date not given: "`The United States Wants To  Suffocate North Korea'"]    [Text] "We agreed to inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- and permitted them as well --  that are required to find out whether fissionable material has  been put aside from our nuclear installations." Yun, the DPRK  deputy head of mission in Vienna, conducts his country's  negotiations with the IAEA. He rejects accusations that his  country has not met its obligations toward the IAEA.    "The latest dispute with the IAEA centers around the radio  chemical laboratory, a dispute we had a year ago. At that time,  the IAEA test results differed from ours. This technical  problem has to be solved. Then they can take new samples.    "Since the installation is sealed, it is clear that it  cannot  have been in operation since it was last inspected."    [Voykowitsch] In this case, taking samples would be  harmless.    [Yun] There is no reason for this, just as there is no  reason  for the special inspections demanded by the IAEA because of  satellite photographs from the United States. The inspection  agreement prohibits such photos.    [Voykowitsch] The agreement does not even mention them.    [Yun] Since the United States is hostile toward us, we  cannot  accept inspections based on such photos. We have presented all  information on our nuclear installations to the IAEA. Now they  are citing photographs and intelligence reports saying that  North Korea has unregistered nuclear installations.    [Voykowitsch] Does this mean that the two mysterious  installations in Yongbyon....    [Yun] They are military installations.    [Voykowitsch] What makes the United States say that  Pyongyang  already has two atomic bombs?    [Yun] That is not true. We have stressed again and again  that we do not have the capacity, nor the intention, nor the  necessity for this.    [Voykowitsch] How far has your nuclear program got? The  United States says that your country has weapons-grade plutonium.    [Yun] Our program is for electricity supply.    [Voykowitsch] You do not produce any plutonium for military  purposes?    [Yun] Not yet.    [Voykowitsch] Not yet?    [Yun] No, no. The radio chemical laboratory studies  reprocessing. And once, in 1989, we had an experiment with old  fuel rods.    [Voykowitsch] You produced plutonium?    [Yun] Less than 100 grams. But we have not produced anything  since then. We were only testing whether production is going  all right. The installation is not finished yet.    [Voykowitsch] Will it produce plutonium?    [Yun] No.    [Voykowitsch] If nothing unusual is going on, why then would  you not let your installations be inspected? Why are you  threatening war?    [Yun] It is the U.S. aim to suffocate North Korea. What  would your reaction be if someone tried to kill you? ...Self  defense.    [Voykowitsch] Suffocate? How can an isolated country such  as North Korea be suffocated?    [Yun] What do you mean by isolated? We have the necessary  foreign relations, but our philosophy is self-sufficiency.    [Voykowitsch] How could your relationship with the IAEA and  the United States be normalized?    [Yun] Pyongyang is always in favor of talking. Pressure only  does harm.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Hebron security pact could be sealed today: Resumption of withdrawal talks likely Israeli and Palestinian officials could seal agreement by today on security measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, they said yesterday. This should lead to the immediate resumption of suspended talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israeli officials are due to meet in Cairo to resume talks on security in Hebron interrupted last Friday for the Jewish Passover. Both sides indicated they were near agreement on implementing UN Resolution 904 which calls for international observers in Hebron and early deployment of Palestinian police in the West Bank town. Mr Nabill Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the two sides had 'gone a long and important way' in the talks and only 'some points' remained at issue. PLO officials in Tunis said the differences were over the precise number of international observers and Palestinian police to be deployed in Hebron, and some details of their jurisdiction and rules of deployment. The Israelis want to limit the observer force to 60 officers, to be supplied by Norway, and the Palestinian force to a few dozen. The PLO is seeking 150 observers and 400 police. Mr Shaath said the PLO was awaiting responses to its demands from Israel. 'We are not going to discuss anything else until we finish this agreement,' he added. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he expected agreement on the outstanding issues to be reached today; the two delegations could as soon as tomorrow resume full talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. These talks were suspended by the PLO after the massacre in Hebron of more than 30 Palestinian worshippers on February 25. Both sides are eager to return to full peace talks as soon as possible, and conclude implementation talks on the deal agreed last year in Washington. While PLO officials in Tunis said they still hoped Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho could begin as scheduled on April 13, Israeli officials have suggested the talks might need 'a few weeks' to conclude agreement. Mr Mustapha Natsche, Hebron's former mayor, reiterated Palestinian demands for the removal of 400 Jewish settlers from the town-centre, calling their withdrawal the 'ideal solution'. Other Palestinian leaders in the town sent a message to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, urging him to refrain from resuming talks with the Israelis until and unless the settlers were removed. Mr Peres and most of his cabinet colleagues have indicated they would back such a removal. Mr Peres said on Sunday night that 'co-existence in Hebron is an impossibility'. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, remains implacably opposed to any such action. Hebron was relatively quiet yesterday, two days after the army lifted a curfew in the town. Only minor clashes were reported between Palestinians and Israeli troops.</p>

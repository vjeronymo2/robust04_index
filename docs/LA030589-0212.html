			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SAN PEDRO GETS 2ND CHANCE, WINS CITY BOYS' SOCCER TITLE  </P> <P> For the San Pedro High boys' soccer team, anything is possible.  </P> <P> The Pirates, after being defeated, 4-3, on penalty kicks by Palisades during a  City Section semifinal match Tuesday, received a bid to play in the final  against top-ranked Belmont after officials discovered that seven Palisades  players participated in an American Youth Soccer Organization invitational in  Tucson, Ariz., the weekend prior to their game with San Pedro.  </P> <P> California Interscholastic Federation rules say high school athletes may not  play in outside games while the high school season is in progress.  </P> <P> "Our loss was due to a shootout, so I don't feel bad," San Pedro Coach Hank  Nozaki said. "Its like the Lakers tying the Celtics and picking the five best  free-throw shooters. "I feel we should be here."  </P> <P> As if making it to the championship game wasn't enough, the second-ranked  Pirates stunned Belmont, 4-3, in overtime to win their 11th consecutive game  and second City title in three years.  </P> <P> San Pedro defeated the Sentinels, 1-0, for the championship in 1987, then lost  to Reseda, 4-1, last year.  </P> <P> Midfielder Jack Holt scored the game-winning goal with 11 minutes to play in  overtime when his 40-yard shot hit the ground and bounced over the head of  Belmont goalkeeper Roberto Campos into the middle of the net.  </P> <P> "That was a shot," Holt said after the game. "I was trying for a corner (kick)  but I guess I lucked out."  </P> <P> "That was the worst time and worst place for that to happen," said Belmont  Coach Nancy Carr-Swaim.  </P> <P> Belmont halfback Jose Moran had evened the score, 3-3, with a 25-yard shot into  the middle of the net after seven minutes had elapsed in the second half.  </P> <P> The Sentinels (15-2-0) got on the scoreboard early with halfback Jose  Barahona's shot from five yards at the two-minute mark. However, San Pedro  (14-0-1) chalked up three straight goals and took a 3-1 lead with six minutes  remaining in the half. Before intermission, though, moran narrowed the lead to  3-2.  </P></p>

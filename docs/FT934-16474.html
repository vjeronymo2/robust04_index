			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount Despite its denials, Viacom's recruitment of a star-studded cast of investors clearly suggests the entertainment group is preparing to boldly go where no bidder has gone before in its quest for Paramount Communications. With the rival QVC Network now trying to prove the colour of its money to the Paramount board, the need has become more urgent. The near-Dollars 2bn contributions from Blockbuster and Nynex - as well as the share price-boosting impact of their involvement - should at least enable Viacom to match QVC's higher Dollars 9.5bn offer. But although the help of additional investors greatly strengthens Viacom's financial cause, it will considerably complicate the managerial challenge should its preferred bid succeed. Both Blockbuster and Nynex will have strong views about what to do with Paramount. A similar worry also besets QVC following its recruitment of allies. Given the strained finances and fuzzy industrial logic of both bids, it is tempting to think a more strongly capitalised media giant will enter the fray and sweep up the prize. It is, however, hard to identify just who this might be.</p>

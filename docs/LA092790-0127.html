			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGERS' START IS ONLY THE BEGINNING FOR RANGERS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: TEXAS LEFT-HANDER SHUTS DOWN THE ANGELS, 6-2, FOR HIS 10TH VICTORY  AND WILL PROBABLY STAY IN THE ROTATION NEXT SEASON.  </P> <P> Starter Kenny Rogers is a relief to the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> Rogers (10-5) made his second major league start Wednesday night and beat the  Angels, 6-2, to stop a the Rangers' four-game losing streak. He held the Angels  to three hits and an unearned run in six innings -- his longest outing ever.  </P> <P> He'd better get used to it. Texas Manager Bobby Valentine said Rogers will get  another start Tuesday at Toronto and probably move into the rotation in 1991.  </P> <P> "It's our intention to get him ready to be a starter in the off-season,"  Valentine said.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping to get the chance because that's what they need -- a fifth  starter," Rogers said. "I hope I can do it for a full year. I think I can make  us a better team."  </P> <P> It was Rogers' fifth victory this month but only the fifth this year by a  Rangers' left-handed starter.  </P> <P> "Tonight was the best I've pitched all year," Rogers said. "I'm usually more of  a thrower, but I was ahead in the count with my fastball and breaking ball, and  throwing my breaking ball for strikes helped me a lot."  </P> <P> The Angels had won five in a row against the Rangers, but Texas scored three  runs before Kirk McCaskill (12-11) got an out. The Angel starter gave up six  runs on six hits in 3 2/3innings.  </P> <P> "His velocity was not bad; his location was not good," Angel Manager Doug Rader  said.  </P> <P> Gary Pettis and Julio Franco singled to start the first inning, and both scored  when Rafael Palmeiro tripled high off the center-field wall. Palmeiro scored on  Ruben Sierra's groundout.  </P> <P> Palmeiro was two for three and raised his average to .323, seven points behind  Kansas City's George Brett, in the AL batting race.  </P> <P> Texas finished McCaskill with three runs in the fourth. Pete Incaviglia led off  with a walk,went to third on Geno Petralli's single, then scored on a squeeze  bunt by Steve Buechele. Gary Green singled in Petralli, stole second and scored  on Pettis' single.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Chili Davis reaggravated a lower back injury and was replaced by Luis Polonia  in the fifth inning. . . . Ranger rookie shortstop Gary Green stole the first  base of his major league career.  </P> <P> Kenny Rogers' 10th victory of the season marks only the second time in club  history that five Ranger pitchers have won 10 or more games. The last time five  Rangers won 10 or more games was in 1977. . . . The only other club in the  majors with five pitchers winning 10 or more games this season is the Chicago  White Sox.  </P></p>

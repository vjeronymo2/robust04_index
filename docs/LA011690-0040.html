			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN-AM HIGHWAY  </P> <P> With regard to the map which appeared on Page A5 (Dec. 31) I wish to point out  that the Pan-American Highway does not pass all the way through eastern Panama  (Darien Province) and into Colombia but, in fact, stops well short of the  Panama-Colombian border. Nor is there any likelihood that the road will be  completed and for an interesting reason.  </P> <P> At present there is a fairly extensive stand of tropical moist forest in the  eastern-most part of Panama and this has been designated a national park  (although given very limited protection during the Noriega years).  </P> <P> The principal purpose of the park is to provide a barrier between Colombia  where foot-and-mouth disease is known to occur and Panama and Central America  where the disease does not occur. This disease, caused by a virus, is highly  destructive of cattle and other ruminant mammals. Were it to get into Panama  and Central America the export of beef to the United States would be stopped,  thus causing considerable economic loss -- although it might also result in a  cessation of forest-to-pasture conversion in the region.  </P> <P> CHARLES F.

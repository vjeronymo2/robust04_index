			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Carr Kitcat slims broking of UK stocks CARR, Kitcat &amp; Aitken, one of the oldest names in British stockbroking, will announce today that it is to radically cut back its broking of UK stocks. The company, part of Banque Indosuez's WI Carr Group, will continue its private client stockbroking business, under the name of Carr Sheppards. It will also maintain its research and broking of foreign stocks, particularly Asian securities, to UK institutional clients, under the WI Carr name. The announcement will be made today, according to an Indosuez executive. Banque Indosuez acquired WI Carr from British Commonwealth's Exco in 1987. When Kitcat &amp; Aitken was shut by its parent, Royal Bank of Canada, in 1990, WI Carr took on 24 salesmen, dealers and analysts (13 of them Kitcat directors), and acquired the name. Indosuez, one of the largest subsidiaries of Suez, the French industrial and financial group, suffered an 87 per cent drop in net profits in 1992, to FFr101m (Pounds 12.2m) because of economic slowdown and the property slump in Paris. Indosuez is floating 51 per cent of its holding in Gartmore, the UK fund management company. In early 1991, Banque Indosuez injected up to Pounds 20m of extra capital into Carr Kitcat to satisfy UK regulators that the broker could withstand potential losses from Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International.</p>

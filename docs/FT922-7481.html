			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Unemployment revisited MASS UNEMPLOYMENT is a scar across the face of the developed world. It results from a wound repeatedly inflicted by decades of neglect during which the skills, education and opportunities of a significant minority within almost every industrialised country have atrophied. But the wound has not properly healed; as with all open and ugly wounds, the risks of infection are great. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, whose ministers meet today to discuss the subject, has recognised the threat to social cohesion and stability from persistently high joblessness and the associated rise in poverty and crime. Yet it is questionable whether the developed countries have in recent years satisfactorily diagnosed this growing problem, let alone devised a cure. The prominence that the OECD gives to measures of unemployment based on people who are both out of work and actively seeking work has predisposed it towards US models for dealing with unemployment, even though America has had fewer prime-age men in jobs than in any other important OECD country in the last 20 years. The purist economist may be content to know that the US does not have armies of job-hungry unemployed workers searching inefficiently for jobs; but the average US citizen would probably be more interested to know what the people who are neither employed nor unemployed are doing. The fact that so many American men have no jobs, and that large numbers of them are instead turning to illegal sources of income, is what matters for policy. Technological advances Once identified, the disease is not easily cured. Over the past two decades the demand for unskilled labour has declined across the OECD, in the face of technological advances and fierce competition from the developing world. The real wages at which companies would be prepared to employ the unskilled and the uneducated have plummeted. In the US, where the minimum wage is low and unemployment benefits are sparse, this has meant a fall in actual wages too. For many US men, though not for women, the alternative sources of income available outside the system mean that the available jobs are just not worthwhile. European governments have intervened more actively to prevent wages from falling, but the underlying economic forces are the same. Companies do not want to hire at these real wages and slow employment growth and open unemployment has been the result. Small government The OECD's support for restricted unemployment benefits, deregulated labour markets and small government are all part of its taste for the American approach. On economic efficiency grounds this may be right, though the US record on productivity growth does not make the case. But there is no reason to believe that cutting the benefits and wages of European men would make them more willing to take low paying jobs than US men. Sweden is the only high employment and low unemployment country in the western developed world; but it has not solved the problem, merely concealed it a greater expense than electorates elsewhere have been willing to pay. The OECD has, in fact, advised Sweden to cut the size of its public sector, while praising Sweden's programmes of 'active' measures to help the unemployed to re-train and find jobs. Yet Sweden has found jobs for the potential unemployed in the public sector, at wages the private sector would not be willing to pay and at a cost that the Swedish electorate is now unwilling to meet. Effective policy is bound, to some extent, to be an amalgam of all these approaches. But even under a policy which combined Swedish willingness to provide the unemployed and the young with marketable skills through better education and training with an American emphasis upon creating jobs in the private sector, an uncomfortably large number of people will remain chronically without work. In developed economies, this group will always attract subsidy, either through the benefits system or some other means. It is better in principle to subsidise people to work and to gain marketable skills, whether in the public or private sector, than to provide incentives for them to seek illegal alternatives to work.</p>

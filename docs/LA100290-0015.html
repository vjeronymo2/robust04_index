			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: ART'S CRITICAL EYE UNLEASHES A WILD BEAST LURKING INSIDE  </P> <P> Acritic's life is a lonely one; his ethics prohibit him from keeping close  company with those he criticizes, yet his intellectual being is in their world.  </P> <P> Since their pens can destroy reputations and careers, critics are feared and  despised. They are loved only when they praise.  </P> <P> Sometimes the briefest review can be devastating. As Dorothy Parker wrote of a  New York play, " 'The House Beautiful' is the play lousy."  </P> <P> The actor Geoffrey Steyne is remembered only because critic Heywood Broun once  described him as "the worst actor on the American stage." Steyne sued, but the  case was dismissed. In his next review, Broun did not mention Steyne until the  last sentence, which read: "Mr. Steyne's performance was not up to his usual  standards."  </P> <P> Critics, in turn, have often felt the scorn of their victims. Most often, they  are accused of criticizing what they cannot do. The 17th-Century poet John  Dryden wrote:  </P> <P>  They who write ill, and they who never durst write,  </P> <P>  Turn critics out of mere revenge and spite.  </P> <P> Though he himself was an astute critic of manners and morals, Mark Twain  dismissed criticism as "the most degraded of all trades."  </P> <P> Nelson Algren called criticism "the avocation of assessing the failures of  better men."  </P> <P> The French wit Tristan Bernard compared critics with "a virgin who wants to  teach Don Juan how to make love." And the mischievous Irish playwright Brendan  Behan said: "Critics are like eunuchs in a harem. They're there every night,  they see it done every night, they see how it should be done every night, but  they can't do it themselves."  </P> <P> Today, when paintings of the Impressionist, post-Impressionist and Fauves  periods bring many millions of dollars at auction, it is interesting to  discover how critics appraised these works earlier in the century.  </P> <P> Roy Fenstermaker of Lakewood has sent me copies of two reviews from the Art  World of April and May, 1917. One could hardly hope to find more vivid examples  of the vituperative critic's style.  </P> <P> Oddly, neither of the reviews is signed. The first considers a turbulent  landscape by Gauguin, which the critic calls "a degenerate work of art." He  accuses the artist of pursuing an obsession to be different "until the most  idiotic singularity is mistaken by him for originality.  </P> <P> "Gauguin was one of these possessed persons," he goes on. "His life was a  continuous movement from mild peculiarity to practical dementia. . . . He was  simply stupidly different, intellectually degenerate and artistically vulgar.  The reader need only examine carefully this 'Landscape' to see how far away  from nature the forms were made in order to reach a 'style' that should be  sufficiently 'different' from everything any one else ever dreamt of, to  satisfy the egomaniacal hunger of Gauguin for notoriety. . . . "  </P> <P> The critic lets himself off easy by concluding: "We will not dignify this work  by making even a superficial analysis of its stupidity."  </P> <P> Van Gogh's self-portrait is also called a "degenerate work of art," perhaps by  the same critic. He excuses himself at the outset: "Here we have a work of art  which is so self-evidently a degenerate work by a degenerate artist that we  need scarcely say anything about the inept creation."  </P> <P> He does not want to let Van Gogh escape that easily, however: "It is safe to  say that if we were to meet in our dreams such a villainous looking jailbird  with such a deformed Neanderthal skull, degenerate ears . . . hobo beard and  insane glare, it would certainly give us a nightmare."  </P> <P> Evidently the critics' opinions of these two paintings were not based on  observation of the paintings themselves, but on photographs in "a sumptuously  published" book of their work. Oddly, the two reviews appeared in the art  magazine in 1917, years after both Van Gogh and Gauguin had exhibited their  work in Paris to enthusiastic acclaim, at least by other artists.  </P> <P> The Van Gogh critic charges that the book of photographs is being "hawked about  by dealers in ultra-modernistic art for the purpose of showing what these  modernistic 'masters' are doing to glorify life and art and who call themselves  'Les Fauves' -- 'The Wild Beasts!' "  </P> <P> While Gauguin and Van Gogh influenced the Fauves (Matisse, Braque, Dufy and  others) with their brilliant use of pure color, they did not call themselves  Fauves. Both were dead when Fauvism burst on the Paris scene in 1905 and a  critic dubbed the painters Les Fauves. (By the way Fauves paintings will be on  exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art later this month.)  </P> <P> Degenerate or not, Gauguin's and Van Gogh's paintings are now worth millions of  dollars. The Getty Museum is said to have paid something more than $50 million  for Van Gogh's "Irises." Ironically, though he painted hundreds of pictures,  Van Gogh sold only one in his lifetime. In despair, he shot himself to death at  the age of 37.  </P> <P> Of course there is something degenerate about Van Gogh's self-portrait. Maybe  that's what makes it a masterpiece.  </P></p>

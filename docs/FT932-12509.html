			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Arts: The glories of Rome shine anew - Exhibitions Two current exhibitions in Rome prove once again how much that city owes to the worldly talents of the Catholic church. Both 'The Borghese Gallery' at St Michele a Ripa and 'Sixtus V' centre on the Papacy; both relate to the late Renaissance and early Baroque. The first marks the re-appearance of 300 paintings from the magnificent Borghese collection which have been in storage for nine years while the villa has been restored. Given the pace of Italian restoration these could be in San Michele for two years. The second looks at the radical changes made to the city during the short reign of a remarkable Pope, Sixtus V. Cardinal Scipione Borghese was the favourite nephew of Pope Paul V (1605-1621). A passionate collector, he brought the nucleus of his grand collection with him when the family moved to Rome from Siena. There, he built one of the world's finest patrician art collections. Scipione showed particular acumen in his enthusiasm for Caravaggio: a passion not shared by his fellow cardinals at St Peter's, who commissioned and then, shocked at the nakedness of the boy Christ, refused his masterpiece, the 'Madonna of the Palafrenieri' (also known as the 'Madonna of the serpent'). The painting was removed from the Palafrenieri chapel in St Peter's and sold to Scipione. Even though only about half the 566 paintings in the collection are here, fitting them into the small de-consecrated church posed many problems. The organisers found a clever solution - but somewhat shocking for those who remember their original luxurious setting. The paintings are crowded together, almost touching, in lines four deep, in the casually cluttered manner used by collectors in the late 1600s. However, one important detail has been forgotten. The pictures at the top (rarely the masterpieces) are difficult to see. Early collectors got round this by tilting the top row downwards towards the visitors below, but this has not been done here. All six of Scipione's Caravaggio's are on show, as is Domenichino's splendid, newly-restored 'Caccia di Diana'. There are several works by the Ferrarese Dosso Dossi, including his mysterious 'Apollo and Daphne' and the 'Maga Circe'; Cranach's magnificent Venus with Cupid and his honeycomb; Carpaccio's enigmatic 'Courtesan'; and two of the Cardinal's Titians. Not, sadly, the gem of the collection, 'Sacred and Profane Love', nor his 'Venus blindfolding Cupid', both being restored. Another famous omission is Raphael's 'Deposition', considered too delicate to move. 'The Rome of Sixtus V' at Palazzo Venezia celebrates (a little late) the fourth centenary of the Pope's death. The exhibition gives some idea of what an absolute monarch with vision and a well-lined purse can make of an insalubrious mediaeval town. But the organisers' determination to show us every aspect of Sixtus's frenetic activity, from coins and commemorative medallions to sections on books and music, detracts a little from the excitement of his central achievement. One gets a better idea of the grandeur of his plans by standing at the Quattro Fontane crossroads on the hill in the centre of Rome. Here, Sixtus's brainchild, the Via Felice, crosses the road designed by his predecessor Pius V (now known as the Via XX Settembre) 20 years earlier. Domenico Fontana's four fountains were carved into each corner of the crossroads to disguise the imperfect right-angles of the small square. Standing with one's back to Borromini's church of St Carlo, there is a breathtaking view down each of the four roads. The grandeur of Sixtus's design does not come out clearly in the exhibition, as no contemporary plans exist to show what Sixtus and his architects thought they were doing. Contrary to some of the contemporary interpretations, Sixtus's plans were dictated only partly by ecclesiastical considerations. It made sense that the seven main basilicas providing indulgences (which the faithful flocking to Rome were required to visit on a single day's pilgrimage) should be linked - to many churchmen the point of Sixtus's development seemed just that. But Sixtus's plan went far beyond the practical religious exigencies of the moment. He was concerned with laying the basis for the city's future social and commercial development, with a cross-system of wide thoroughfares 'indifferent to expense, and ruthless in the face of obstacles', as Domenico Fontana pointed out admiringly, opening out piazzas, both in front of the building he had had constructed, the Lateran and Quirinal Palaces, and at the intersections of his roads. In spite of his imaginative and organisational abilities, Sixtus was a cruel and impatient man. These latter qualities come out in the fine portrait, attributed to Filippo Bellini, with which the exhibition opens. His relationship with his architect, Domenico Fontana, however, was highly successful: they shared a passion for detail and an interest in solving engineering problems. A handsome wooden model and numerous engravings in the central part of the exhibition give some idea of the charms of the Villa Montalto at Termini (pulled down in 1925 to make way for the railway station). Sixtus designed this charming country villa, again with Fontana, to soothe his spirits when enduring semi-exile under the reign of Gregorius III, who disliked him profoundly. Another fine model is Vanvitelli's handsome wooden section of the cupola of St Peter's. Without Sixtus's energy and determination, Michelangelo's project might never have been completed. Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana did it in 22 months, using 800 builders. The last section is devoted to contemporary painting, mostly culled from Roman churches. There is a splendid Eros and Psyche from the Borghese collection, a 'Visitation' by Federico Barocci from St Maria in Valicella, and two fine works by Paul Brill from the Louvre and the Ca D'Oro in Venice. The Borghese Gallery at St Michele a Ripa, Via di St. Michele a Ripa. Closed Monday. Ends December 31. The Rome of Sixtus V, Palazzo Venezia. Ends April 30.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Staying on at work becomes an old fashion in the west WORKING PAST the age of 55 is going out of fashion in the industrialised world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In Italy, only 10.9 per cent of men of that age work, compared with 33 per cent in Britain, 28 per cent in France and 37 per cent in the US, the OECD's latest Employment Outlook reports. The exception is Japan, where 60 per cent of men aged 55 and over work. The figures for women in this age group in the UK and Japan are about half of the men's - at 15.7 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. In France, it is 17.6 per cent. The OECD does not approve of this waste of resources. It says that 20 years ago in most industrial countries between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of men aged 55 and over worked. The figure now is on average between 20 per cent and 35 per cent. This is one reason for the high levels of what the OECD calls 'non-employment' - referring to people of working age who are either unemployed or not taking part in the labour market. The OECD blames government social security rules, occupational pension schemes and a big increase in people covered by sickness and invalidity schemes for the drift away from the labour market by older workers. To minimise conflict with employees and unions, the OECD says, companies have designed redundancy packages which allow people to retire at 53 or 54 with almost the same benefits as if they were to work until 60. The OECD complains that this is throwing away valuable skills and calls for more flexible retirement ages. But a senior official at the Department of Employment said attempts to lure older workers back into jobs in the late 1980s had been unsuccessful. 'We had a furious reaction when we suggested to older people that they might take jobs rather than just stay at home receiving benefit,' he said. Concern, the UK charity, maintains that the OECD figures are further evidence of discrimination against older people. OECD jobless total heads for 10-year high, Page 4</p>

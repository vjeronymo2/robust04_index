			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>   [Text] Differences between conservative central planners  and reformist officials within China's leadership have widened  over the pace of controversial tax reforms in the runup to a  full meeting of the national legislature later this week.  Chinese sources said the issue was expected to be a major  subject of debate among 3,000 deputies to the second plenary  session of the 8th National People's Congress (NPC), to open on  Thursday. The sources in the economic sector said yesterday the  disagreement focused on whether the ongoing tax reforms would  spark a new round of price spirals and whether anti-inflation  measures or tax reforms should be given priority in policy.    Central planners, headed by Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier  and former planning minister Zou Jiahua, have gained the upper  hand in the in-fighting by taking advantage of disputes in the  reformist camp and widespread discontent in the regions over the  new taxation package initiated by reformist officials led by  economic czar Zhu Rongji. Executive Vice-Premier Zhu argued  that it was good timing to push ahead with the tax restructuring  which, if proven successful in implementation, could build an  effective mechanism for micro- control. And the mechanism in  turn would help government efforts to combat inflation. Mr Zhu,  also governor of China's central bank, said he preferred  tightening monetary controls in order to ease inflationary  pressures rather than using administrative means to reimpose  price capping across the board or slap ping bans on investment.    But central planners believe that the ongoing package would  inevitably spur a new round of price hikes and that the policy  should be implemented cautiously and step by step. They said  market stability and price control should be the priority in  implementing reform policies. Beijing sources said that with  wider support both in the central and regional authorities  central planners had launched a series of measures to block the  current reform package. Their latest and toughest move was a  central circular that for the first time stated clearly that any  tax reform measures should take second place to guaranteeing  stable market prices.    On Friday, the State Planning Commission, the State Price  Administration and the State Taxation Administration said in the  circular to the regions that local governments must ensure  stable market prices before they could implement the taxation  package. The document, worked out by central planners led by Mr  Zou, also gives local governments and regional planning and  price departments extensive power to reimpose price capping on  various commodities and services, many of which had been dropped  in recent years following swift reforms to liberalise the  economy. It also says that the central government would  consider some regions' applications to suspend or stretch the  time table for implementing tax reforms if inflation had got out  of hand in their regions following too-rapid restructuring.    The State Planning Com mission is also set to call a  national  telephone conference on price inspection to day to be attended  by senior regional economics and price administration officials.  The meeting is to review the market situation two months after  the implement tation of the first tax reform package in more  than four decades.    Chinese economists said moves in the past few weeks had  apparently set back the reform packages worked out by liberal  officials led by Mr Zhu. They said the debate between the  factions would escalate at the NPC meeting.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Sport: The voice of point blank opinion - Cricket A LIFE in Cricket is a well titled book, touching on every aspect of Trevor Bailey's cricketing childhood and years at Cambridge University, no fewer than 21 years of playing and administering for Essex, a decade of trenchant resistance for England in the 1950s and 1960s, then since 1966 his writing in The Observer and Financial Times, his cricket books, work for public relations companies and, above all, his Test Match commentaries on the radio. I am one of many people, including some not particularly interested in cricket, who like and admire Bailey on the radio, where he is the voice of point blank opinion clearly expressed. One of this book's themes is Bailey's confident pursuit of his own line and it was as lucky for England as it was unlucky for spectators that the obvious line for him to take as a player was usually a refusal to be out. He became a model of steady bowling and defiant batting that drove opposing teams to distraction and sent some fans to sleep. However, his innings of 71, in partnership with Willie Watson's 109, to save England from the ferocious bowling of Australia's Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller in the second innings of the 1953 Lords Test instantly became a symbol of national pride. One of the things this book does well is conjure up the atmosphere of the 1950s. Accurate, calm and dogged, Bailey and his fellow saviours go from one work of rescue, if not triumph, to the next in 1950s Tests. The morning after the 1953 Lords Test, Neville Cardus's headline in The Manchester Guardian 'Miracle of Faith at Lords' nicely complements the author's description of national tension as evening fell on the fifth day, offices in north London emptied and Bailey stayed at the crease, earning himself his lifelong nicknames 'The Boil' and 'The Barnacle'. It is not exciting reading but if you want to know the details of Bailey's cricketing life, including many he does not include in his early autobiography, Playing to Win, it is interesting. If you want to know about his personal or emotional life, you are wasting your time. It is a cricketing biography and it is exhaustive. There is only one set of pictures, which is a pity. Surely there could have been a few more of the young Bailey, blazered and Brylcreemed, oozing self-assurance. Perhaps too there could have been a little more about the problems. The vexed question of amateur / professional relations is touched on repeatedly, in the light of Bailey's amateur status and Len Hutton's position as England's first professional captain, but not fully examined. Bailey's unsuccessful captaincy of Essex 1961-66, his failure to win the captaincy of England when Hutton retired and the unhappy departure from English cricket of his protege Barry Knight are among the problems that get away lightly. The book is a bit bland, sometimes a bit dull. But Jack Bailey has written it clearly and, like his namesake's batting, it is well worth having.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Johnson Matthey A cursory glance at Johnson Matthey's share price suggests the company has successfully detached itself from swings in metals prices. But with Charter Consolidated's stake now in friendly hands, progress from here on will have to come without the benefit of bid speculation. Johnson has also exhausted big restructuring provisions taken in 1990. Although cost savings of Pounds 25m a year suggest the money has been well spent, profits growth must be found elsewhere. Strong metals prices cannot be counted on for assistance. The platinum price is healthy enough, but rhodium remains painfully weak. Bargain basement prices should eventually lead to a new round of stock-building, but there is no sign of that yet. Meanwhile, Johnson's precious metals division remains in the doldrums. Promising positions in electronics materials and medicine are being built, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that demand for its catalytic converters is getting a timely boost from European legislation on vehicle emissions. Thanks to the new rules Johnson expects to produce more converters in Europe this year, even allowing for a slide in new car sales. Tougher environmental standards in the US are also good for business. Assuming margins can be defended against the tough new breed of purchasing managers at Volkswagen and elsewhere, at least modest profits growth from converters looks assured. But it will take a rising trend in car sales before Johnson is really insulated from the metals cycle.</p>

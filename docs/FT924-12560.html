			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Bonds: CDollars Eurobond launched despite volatility THE European Investment Bank yesterday braved adverse market conditions to launch a CDollars 200m Eurobond, via Hambros Bank, but an aggressive pricing and fee structure deterred many London-based banks from underwriting the transaction. 'It was a punchy deal in the wrong market, and the cut in commissions just pushed it a shade too far,' said one banker. However, Hambros Bank defended the deal, saying it had met keen interest from continental European retail investors. The Canadian bond market has been extremely volatile in the run up to the country's referendum on constitutional reform next Monday. Last week's downgrade of Canada's foreign debt by Standard &amp; Poor's proved a further blow to confidence. Nevertheless, some bankers felt that the market could have been receptive to the right deal. 'The market has virtually discounted a No vote in the referendum, so there is a lot of upside in the event of a Yes vote,' said one Canadian banker. The triple-A rated European Investment Bank was certainly the right quality of name to access the market. However, the pricing of the the 5 1/4 -year transaction, to yield 30 basis points above the comparable Canadian government bond yield, was felt to be on the tight side, at least for institutional investors. 'If the market had rallied, people would have looked the other way,' one banker said. But market conditions did not prove favourable. However, the final straw for potential underwriters was the cutting of fees from a standard 25 basis points for five-year fixed-price reoffer transactions, to 22 1/2 basis points. 'Underwriters felt they had to draw the line somewhere,' explained one banker. London-based banks declined to participate in the deal, which was syndicated among a group of continental European retail-targeted banks, which will try to sell the bonds at issue price - so earning a full 1 7/8 points fees - rather than at the fixed reoffer price. Hambros took the bulk of the issue on its own books, allotting only CDollars 2m of bonds to co-leads and CDollars 1m to co-managers. The deal closed at 98.70 bid, below its fixed reoffer price of 98.90. Elsewhere, Credit Foncier de France launched a FF1.5bn offering of 10-year bonds, fungible with an existing FF3.5bn issue, making it one of the largest in the market. The deal was considered fairly priced at a spread of 45 basis points over the 10-year OAT yield, and benefited from a buoyant French government bond market. In the dollar market, J P Morgan brought a Dollars 150m issue of 10-year subordinated floating-rate notes, with minimum and maximum interest rates.</p>

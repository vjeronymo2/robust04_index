			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises sharply as bond prices rebound Wall Street US stocks finished with solid gains yesterday after a rally in the bond market was followed by a burst of program buying in the session's final hour, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 27.30 ahead at 3,783.90, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.45 higher at 466.89. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged up 0.12 to 477.36 and the Nasdaq composite was 3.52 stronger at 774.28. Volume on the New York SE was heavy, with 326.6m shares traded. Advancing issues led declines by 1,208 to 914. With no first-tier economic reports due out, stocks had some leeway ahead of Friday's important data on December employment. The Labor Department's report, if it comes in at the high end of expectations, could trigger a fresh round of selling in the fixed-income markets. Stocks would be likely to suffer as a result. Yesterday, however, inflationary fears were eased a bit by weaker than expected car sales data for late-December and a somewhat disappointing Johnson Redbook report on retail sales. In response, the benchmark 30-year bond climbed  3/4 to 98 1/2 in a late afternoon rally. After a shaky start, equities followed suit and closed well ahead in a late flurry of buying by institutions reinvesting funds raised from stocks sales at the year-end. Among the blue chips, Caterpillar climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 91, Eastman Kodak Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 7/8 and Walt Disney Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44, but Allied Signal fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 76 1/4 . Automobile issues were buoyant in spite of data showing sales running at an annual rate of about 7m units in the last 10 days of the year, against 7.4m in the previous period. Chrysler led the Big Three with a Dollars 2 3/4 gain to Dollars 56. General Motors was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 56 1/2 and Ford Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 63 7/8 . Some retailing shares were strong despite the industry's modest 8.5 per cent year-on-year increase in December sales. Sears Roebuck snapped back from a big loss registered in the previous session, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 . JC Penney put on Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 53. Del Webb, a Phoenix-based property developer, was marked up Dollars 1 to Dollars 16 3/4 on a year-end surge in orders. On the Nasdaq, technology stocks bounced back from Monday's bout of profit-taking. Apple Computer advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 and Intel Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 63 3/4 . MCI Communications shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 on the announcement that the company and its partners would invest more than Dollars 20bn to create a transcontinental information superhighway. Canada The Toronto market started the new year strongly, hitting a record high for the third time in the past four sessions. Gold stocks led the surge, gaining 6.31 per cent. The bullion price has risen about USDollars 3 an ounce in the past two days. The TSE 300 index closed at 4,368.5, up 47.1, while rises outscored declines by 477 to 321 after volume of 63.05m shares.</p>

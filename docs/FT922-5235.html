			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Observer: Price puzzle Expatriates working for distant multinationals might do well to check which living-cost survey head office uses in setting their pay. A check on one such survey, just published by the Geneva-based Corporate Resources Group, shows some marked differences from similar studies done by other organisations. Take for instance the CRG cost indices as compared with those produced by the P-E International consultancy by averaging the findings of surveys done by the United Nations, the US government and other official bodies. Admittedly, the two sets of results - neither of which takes account of housing costs - are largely agreed about other expenses in Japan. Taking London as a base-line, CRG puts Tokyo at 46 per cent higher as against P-E's 43. But elsewhere, they are at odds. For example P-E rates Geneva at 10 per cent more costly than London whereas CRG rates it the same. Paris is marked at 2 per cent higher by P-E and 5 per cent lower by CRG. Both rate New York lower, but CRG by 16 per cent and P-E by only 8 per cent. Would globe-trotting readers care to advise Observer which of the estimates, if either, reflects reality?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, January 31 (CNS)--"The Taiwan Mainland  Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan" said that Taiwan capital  invested in the mainland was estimated to be between US$25  billion and US$30 billion as of late last year.    A report by this Taiwan group pointed out that such a vast  amount of capital was projected to have flowed into the mainland  by the end last year in spite of a previous estimate by the  council that Mainland-bound investment was expected to be  US$19.4 billion as of November last year.    As for trade across the straits involving Hong Kong for this  year, the report said that following a sharp devaluation of the  renminbi early this year and the continuous opening of the  Taiwan market to mainland raw materials as well as a relaxation  of restrictions on mainland imports, a change in the pattern of  trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong this year was expected, that  is, a great rise in imports and a slow down of growth in  exports. Products exported from Taiwan to the mainland will  increase in volume rather than decline.    As for the investment sector, the report said that Hong Kong  ranked fourth in terms of Taiwan investment abroad but Hong Kong  investment in Taiwan and in the mainland showed a growing gap.  Investment made by the territory in the mainland in 1992 was 200  times that made in Taiwan during the same period while Taiwan  became the second greatest investor in the mainland.</p>

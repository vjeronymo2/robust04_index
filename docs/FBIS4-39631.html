			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Bausin report: "Anniversary: Are We Outsiders at </F> These Celebrations?"]    [Text] Russia was not invited to the celebrations of the  50th anniversary of the Allied forces' landing in Normandy.  That is, a Russian delegation is nonetheless staying in one of  the towns where the celebrations will be held. But the Russian  president did not turn up at the "summit meeting" to mark 6 June  1944.    Many commentators believe that whereas the Normandy landing  was for Britain and the United States a belated attempt to start  having some kind of real effect on the course of the war, the  Red Army offensive was in essence not only a crusade of  liberation but also the expansion of communism. Admittedly,  this does not take into consideration the fact that Russia now  seems to be a democratic country. But it seems that the  destruction of communism alone is not enough to join the  amicable family of European peoples.... However, as President  Yeltsin remarked, the fact that we are not invited is no reason  to take umbrage and perceive this as evidence of mistrust of  Russia on the part of its former allies in the anti-Hitler  coalition.    A situation where "you have your celebrations and we will  have ours" would have been more appropriate during the previous  Berlin Wall era. But you increasingly get the impression that  the destruction of this notorious wall has not made Europe truly  united. We can argue at length that Russia is a European  country and that we should finally take up a proper position on  the continent. However, just as nothing came of the idea of a  "common European home," so nothing is coming of Russia's stately  "entry" into Europe. Our partners periodically hint that Russia  can be described as a European power only in the geographical  context. But not in the political context. The celebration of  the Allied forces' Normandy landings -- like, moreover the  ceremony marking the withdrawal of the Allies' troops from  German territory -- has shown us that once again....</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Schlesinger faces a year at hard labour: Bundesbank chief's extra term will be tough IF HISTORY had not dictated otherwise, Mr Helmut Schlesinger would now be within a few weeks of graceful retirement after four decades of honourable achievement at the German Bundesbank. In fact, Mr Schlesinger, unexpectedly made the bank's president last summer after the resignation of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, will be staying on for another 12 months beyond the normal retirement age of 68, which he reaches in September. It is likely to be a year not of grace, but of the central banker's equivalent of a night out on the wrong side of Mount Eiger. Mr Schlesinger faces the toughest decision of his long career when he and the rest of the Bundesbank's policy-making council decide on Thursday what to do about this year's runaway money supply growth. Some form of credit tightening is expected as a signal that the Bundesbank is taking seriously the 9 per cent increase in the M3 money supply for 1992  -double the central bank's 3.5-5.5 per cent target. Under the unprecedented strains provoked by German unification - the real reason for Mr Pohl's exit - Germany's financial machinery is running haywire. The worries are compounded by the Bundesbank's analysis that there is 'no recognisable weakening' of inflation, which is running at 4.3 per cent, against the central bank's longer-term target of 2 per cent. Thursday's decision will have an important influence on the prospect of a realignment of exchange rates within the European Monetary System - an option thought increasingly plausible within the Bundesbank. Tightening action would not simply send disruptive ripples around Europe, where nearly every other country - led by Britain and France - wants to cut interest rates to bolster sluggish domestic economies. The outcome of the council's deliberations will also spill over to the US and Japan, where the central banks have been cutting interest rates to try to speed up emergence from recession. Mr Schlesinger himself does not know exactly what the central bank will do. The outcome of Thursday morning's meeting will depend on several hours of tense debate within the 18-man council and, at the end, a show of hands. The Bundesbank's statutorily independent policy-making body, which sets interest rates not just for Germany, but, effectively, for the rest of Europe, is accountable to no one but itself. But, in its internal deliberations, the council is very democratic. It takes decisions on the basis of 'one man, one vote'. The psychology of the council, mixing men of very different character, ability and political leanings, is highly complex. Several leading denizens on the council have a strong streak of rebelliousness - and some have no particular affection for Mr Schlesinger. The president is uncomfortably aware that, if he makes any public statement prejudging the outcome of the council meeting, he may end up producing a result opposite to the one he intends. For fear of adding to speculation, the Bundesbank does not even want to announce yet whether a press conference will be held after the meeting. Whatever course of action the Bundesbank takes, Mr Schlesinger knows he will be criticised. For several reasons, the bank is at a watershed. For the first time since it brought in monetary targets 18 years ago, it faces a drastic overshooting of its objectives for both inflation and the money supply. In previous periods when the Bundesbank has significantly exceeded its monetary goals (1977-78 and 1986-87) inflation was well under control and the current account (unlike in post-unity Germany) in healthy surplus. The overshooting marks the first time that serious doubts have arisen about the significance of the Bundesbank's monetary aggregates. Unification - above all the huge public subsidies flowing from west to east Germany - have blunted the cutting edge of monetary policy. M3 has been artificially inflated by high short-term interest rates attracting savings from longer-term investments, as well as by the build-up of D-Mark assets in eastern Europe. But the threat to the Bundesbank's credibility is all the greater because Mr Schlesinger, architect of the monetary targets introduced in 1974, has for years been the main protagonist of the bank's anti-inflation policy. During its years of anti-inflation battling, the Bundesbank has never faced such a difficult international environment. In the Bundesbank's two previous main bouts of credit tightening (1972-73 and 1979-81) the central bank was often unpopular, above all, at home, but was acting within a broad international consensus. This time round, however, because of the extraordinary post-unification position of the German economy, the Bundesbank is out on a limb. Each of its interest rate increases last year - in January, August and December - provoked progressively greater impatience from Germany's foreign partners. Most delicate of all is the effect that Bundesbank tightening could have on the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu). The decision in December, just a week after the Maastricht summit, to raise discount and Lombard rates to their highest since the 1930s was already widely conceived as a sign of the central bank's hostility to the treaty. Outside Germany, action on Thursday would be construed similarly. In a deliberate change of role from his previous hawkishness, Mr Schlesinger has been doing his best, both in public speeches and private conversations with central bankers, to show emollience over Emu. On the international central bankers' circuit, he rates as a much more patient figure than Mr Pohl. However, there is no doubt of his fundamental hostility to a premature abandonment of the D-Mark. Following the Danish 'no' to Maastricht in June, Bundesbank officials have been talking more openly of the possibility that Emu may not come into effect. Mr Schlesinger is no stranger to criticism of the bank's monetary policies. He regards some of it simply as proof that he is doing his duty. The barbs which wound him most, however, are those from domestic German monetarists suggesting that the Bundesbank has consistently acted too late during the past few years in tightening money to combat growing signs of inflation. As he seeks a path through the competing pressures, Mr Schlesinger will instinctively head towards the road which will provide the best chances for low German inflation. All other considerations - from the future of Maastricht to the re-election of President George Bush - will loom less large. His inner convictions, however, are unlikely to guarantee Mr Schlesinger undisturbed sleep during the next few nights. And, with still a year of his presidency left, he may find after Thursday that the steepest part of his uphill march is only just beginning. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, yesterday warned Europe to redirect spending priorities because of the need to overcome eastern Europe's economic difficulties. Mr Biedenkopf, a powerful spokesman for the German states' attempts to wield influence over the Maastricht treaty, also voiced misgivings about whether European monetary union (Emu) would come into effect at the time foreseen by the Maastricht treaty. During a visit to London, Mr Biedenkopf said the German states would ratify the treaty only if the government fulfilled certain conditions on transfers of powers to the EC. Among these conditions, the states were looking closely at resource transfers to poorer EC countries as well as at the 'automatic' timetable for Emu. Lower-income countries like Spain would have to accept a longer period in which to catch up economically with more prosperous EC states. 'If you overdo (income) equalisation in Europe you're going to kill Europe. It won't work,' he said.</p>

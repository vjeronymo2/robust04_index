			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, May 31 (TANJUG) -- The massive mobilization  of civilians for the Muslim forces is underway in the territory  of the U.N.-designated safe area of Tuzla in northeastern  Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb military  sources on Tuesday [31 May]. Muslim military authorities are  again forcibly mobilizing Serbs, escorting them under armed  guard to mobilization sites, says the Bosnian Serb army  statement which warns that representatives of the United Nations  Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) and foreign reporters in Tuzla are  not reacting to these activities.    All six Muslim safe areas in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina should have been demilitarized in spring last  year. Meanwhile, Muslims continue artillery attacks on Serb  villages and army positions on Tuesday, Bosnian Serb military  sources have said. Muslims are firing at Serb villages and  positions in the area of Doboj in the north and in the area of  Sokolac, Han Pijesak, Vlasenica, Sekovici and Zvornik in the  east, the statement says.    In the area of Mt. Ozren, the Bosnian Serb army has thwarted  an attempt by a Muslim terrorist-scouting group to infiltrate  the area, says the statement. In the area of Velika Kladusa in  western Bosnia, forces loyal to Muslim fundamentalist leader  Alija Izetbegovic are building up their hardware and rallying  terrorist groups in the area of Velika Kladusa, preparing a  decisive attack on this town which is the center of the newly  proclaimed Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia, the local  Muslim radio in Velika Kladusa said on Tuesday.    Muslims in western Bosnia-Herzegovina, who were against the  war-mongering policy of Izetbegovic, proclaimed autonomy in  September last year, distancing themselves from the decisions of  Sarajevo's Bosnian Muslim leadership. Heavy inter-Muslim  conflicts have been underway in western Bosnia since that time,  because Izetbegovic sent his army to stifle the new autonomy  `using all available means.'</p>

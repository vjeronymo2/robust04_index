			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Bermuda link for new fund at Lloyd's Indemnity Insurance Services, a London-based insurance broker, is combining forces with one of Bermuda's largest reinsurance companies in an effort to form a new Lloyd's investment company. Indemnity wants to raise some Pounds 20m through a stock market flotation of the new vehicle - Euclidean Investment Company - later this year. Centre Re, now owned by Switzerland's Zurich Insurance, will underwrite an innovative long-term reinsurance contract for the company, which should allow Euclidean to accept up to Pounds 80m in premium income, twice as much as it would otherwise be able to underwrite, increasing potential profitability. Corporate Names can accept annual premiums equal to twice the amount of their funds held at Lloyd's, according to rules introduced last year by the market. Euclidean will spend several million pounds annually on a multi-year reinsurance policy from Centre Re. The Bermuda company will make available a letter of credit for some Pounds 28m, which it is thought Lloyd's regulators will regard as an acceptable asset for solvency purposes. In this way Euclidean will increase its deposits with Lloyd's to some Pounds 40m. The reinsurance policy will also cushion investors against large losses. Indemnity specialises in stop-loss insurance - a kind of personal reinsurance for Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally backed the market. This activity has allowed it to obtain unusually comprehensive information about the market. By backing no more than 86 of the most profitable syndicates and by closely monitoring future activity it hopes to be able to obtain above-average underwriting results. Mr James Stuart, Indemnity's joint managing director, says he expects the increased gearing will allow Euclidean to make a return on capital of some 25 per cent. Net dividends are to be limited to 20 per cent of capital. Lloyd's raised some Pounds 800m in corporate capital last year and expects to raise between Pounds 125m and Pounds 250m in extra funds for 1995. Most is expected to come from private sources. Venton, another Lloyd's agency, has linked up with Butterfield Securities of Bermuda to raise money for a corporate capital vehicle.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Faux Pas: Art thieves who thought they swiped a museum-quality collection last  week in Cannes, France, are probably mourning the one that got away, police  said Wednesday. Collector Jacques Schwarz-Fuchs told authorities that at least  eight of the stolen works are copies of paintings by Pablo Picasso, Pierre  Auguste Renoir and other 19th- and 20th-Century artists. But the thieves left  an original Camille Pissarro that probably was worth more than all the stolen  items together, police said. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

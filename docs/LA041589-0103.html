			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'Not Since Casanova'  </P> <P> United States, 1988, 80 minutes  </P> <P>  Noon  </P> <P>  Discouraging debut feature from Brett Thompson about a shallow young man and  his search for the perfect woman. This is student level film-making at its most  off-putting and has no business being in a film festival. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Jordanian Ambassador Fakhri Abu-Talib after </F> meeting Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij in Beirut today,  followed by remarks in response to questions by unidentified  correspondents--recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Such incidents will not affect  Jordan or Lebanon. They can happen anywhere. I don't believe  this incident will deflect the Jordanians from the correct  course and the wise policy pursued by the king. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Is it true there was a political message to  the Jordanian regime behind the incident?    [Abu-Talib] According to my own analysis, the motives for  the  incident were political and were intended to harm both Jordan  and Lebanon. The perpetrators were criminals supported by agent  regimes, which still resort to such incidents.    [Correspondent] Who are these agent regimes?    [Abu-Talib] I cannot identify them. As I told you, those who  committed this criminal act did not serve the interest of  Lebanon or the Arab nation.    [Correspondent] Are they Arab or non-Arab regimes?    [Abu-Talib] Soon you will start interrogating me.    [Correspondent] Today's reports say the culprits are  Palestinians, do they not?    [Abu-Talib] I heard what you heard.    [Correspondent] Have you confirmed this?    [Abu-Talib] We have not.    [Correspondent] Do you suspect any particular quarter?    [Abu-Talib] We hold nearly all the main leads. But we cannot  tell the press because we do not want to infringe upon Lebanese  security or the judicial authorities in Lebanon and play a role  that is not ours to play.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON MANIFEST DESTINY  </P> <P> Is Buchanan insane, or is he just blind and arrogant? I thought the concept of  Manifest Destiny was long dead and buried next to its primary victims -- Native  Americans, Hispanics, Hawaiians and Filipinos.  </P> <P> What Buchanan suggests contradicts Canadian popular opinion and would amount to  a shotgun wedding. The best way to antagonize otherwise friendly Canadians is  to suggest, like an insensitive boob, that "pieces" of Canada ought to be part  of the United States.  </P> <P> FRED H.

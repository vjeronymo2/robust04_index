			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Strike doubles loss at GM Firth A STRIKE at its steel rolling mill, Spartan Redheugh, was principally blamed by GM Firth (Holdings) for a doubling of its pre-tax loss, from Pounds 712,000 to Pounds 1.5m, in the half year to September 30. The knock-on effect on its steel stockholding subsidiary, one of the mill's principal customers, together with high interest charges and 'what was probably the worst market for steel since the 1930s', all contributed to the loss. Mr Michael Wilkinson, the chairman, said that accordingly the group's principal aim in recent months had been to resolve the strike and significantly reduce borrowings. In October, as part of restructured banking arrangements, it was agreed to sell Spartan but the directors have since decided to keep it within the group. In December the strike was resolved and Mr Wilkinson said there had been no erosion of its customer base, particularly for the higher quality products. Although Spartan's ability to expand was restricted by a shortage of working capital, that position would be eased when the new bank facilities were in place, he said. Borrowings had fallen from Pounds 14.6m on April 1 1992 to about Pounds 6.6m at present. Mr Wilkinson added that trading losses had continued into the second half and the company had pruned its steel stockholding activities in line with the reduced market. Turnover in the period dropped to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 23.4m). Losses per share worked through at 4.46p (1.85p) and again there is no dividend. The Pounds 1.87m loss on the sale of Arthur Lee shares in October and November coupled with costs relating to the restructured banking arrangements would be shown in the figures for the second half, the chairman said. Last week it was disclosed that Mr Roger Shute, president of BM, the industrial holding company, had bought a 4.4 per cent stake in Firth.</p>

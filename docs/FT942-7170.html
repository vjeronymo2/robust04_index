			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Bonds: GrandMet braves unease to launch Dollars 1.2bn offering Several companies issued dollar-denominated debt yesterday, braving a choppy international bond market. Grand Metropolitan, the large UK food and drink group, returned for the second time within a week to issue Dollars 1.2bn of zero-coupon 10-year paper in the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. The offer is GrandMet's first zero-coupon funding and one of the largest such offerings in the market. It is part of the company's strategy to develop a longer-term portfolio of debt. Bookrunner Goldman Sachs, which controlled about three-quarters of the allocation, said its own quota had been nearly two times subscribed. The bonds were priced at 46.55 with an effective yield of 8.1 per cent. They are expected to raise some Dollars 600m for GrandMet, and were targeted at US insurance and pension groups which are required to hold a certain amount of zero-coupon paper in their portfolios. Short-dated dollar paper was also in vogue. AT&amp;T, the double-A rated US telecommunications company, offered Dollars 400m of two-year paper priced to yield 18 basis points above US Treasuries. When CS First Boston broke syndicate, the yield spread on the bonds narrowed  -an unusual situation in the current market. By the end of trading in London, the spread had come down to around 10 basis points. Ford Motor Credit offered Dollars 150m of three-year debt priced to yield 45 basis points above Treasuries. The deal was announced before lead manager Deutsche Bank had formed a syndicate, and dealers said that the pricing was too aggressive. One commented: 'It equates to Libor plus 20 (basis points) and you can already buy all the Ford paper you want at Libor plus 25.' Toyota Motor Credit Corp was rumoured to be planning a short-dated dollar issue. Dealers said the Japanese car company was expected to offer some Dollars 200m of three-year paper through a Swiss bank. The World Bank chose the Eurolira sector to launch its structured medium-term note programme, announced in February. It achieved sub-Libor funding by swapping the proceeds of the L 150bn offering of seven-year reverse floating-rate notes. The issuer has the option to exchange the notes into a straight FRN at the end of the second year. The bonds, via BNL, traded at 99.43, 10 basis points within fees, despite the slump in Italian government bond futures yesterday afternoon. Moody's Investors Service upgraded the long-term foreign currency debt of the Czech Republic, to Baa2 from Baa3. Moody's said the Republic was making progress towards becoming a full market economy and had integrated quickly into the world trade system.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Finnish News Service correspondent in Goteborg: </F> "Volvo Factory for Vyborg?"]    [Text] The Swedish carmaker Volvo may be forced to start  assembling automobiles in Russia. Though this has been under  examination by the company, high import duties have given the  issue new impetus.    A possible location is the harbor of Vysotsk in Vyborg;  another is St. Petersburg, where cutbacks in the military  industry have left many vacant facilities.    "We are looking at many conceivable locations for an  assembly  plant in Russia, but no decision has been made on production,"  says Olle Odsell, public relations chief of Volvo Cars  International.    What has spurred Volvo's interest in assembling cars in  Russia are the high import duties and other taxes that that  country has recently imposed on imported cars.    "Import duties and other fees now total 146 percent of the  invoiced price of the car," says Odsell. "In this situation it  will be interesting to see if it would be possible to avoid at  least some of these by putting cars together in Russia."    Volvo's decision is dependent on how tax and import  regulations are going to look in Russia over the foreseeable  future. Rumors are circulating that they are going to be lowered  again.    "Only if the import duties stay at the present high level  will it be profitable for Volvo to establish itself there," says  Odsell. "It is more expensive to assemble them in Goteborg.  Shipping and assembling are associated costs, plus the  investments that would have to be made."  <H5>  Many Aspects </H5>   Volvo must also take other aspects into account. There are  no  plants in Vyborg, so everything would have to be constructed  from the ground up. In St. Petersburg, already a year ago, Mayor  Sobchak offered to let Volvo start production in the city's  military plants. Labor force availability is also an important  consideration.    The car model being looked at is the 940 series, and a  diagram on capacity was presented in the [business] daily DAGENS  INDUSTRI some time ago suggesting 10,000 units annually.    Volvo equipped and trained 28 authorized dealers last year  in  Russia, and they sold around 7,000 cars. The high import duties,  which have more than doubled the price for a new Volvo since the  beginning of this year, have meant that many dealers are having  big problems in selling any cars at all.    Pekka Perttiniemi, chief of Volvo Cars International in  Russia, said to DAGENS INDUSTRI: "For logical reasons we will  locate near the border with Finland, and therefore the harbor  Vysotsk is a better alternative. Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak wanted  to attract us there a year ago. At that time we had no plans for  starting up assembly operations, since we could import cars and  sell them. St. Petersburg is still one of the alternatives we  are studying," said Perttiniemi.</p>

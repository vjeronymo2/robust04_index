			<p>Republic'   <F P=102>   94AF0152A Algiers ALGER REPUBLICAIN in French 18-19 Mar 94 p  3 </F>  <F P=103> 94AF0152A </F> <F P=104>  Algiers ALGER REPUBLICAIN </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.G.: "Republic Organizes To Combat </F> Fundamentalist `Hydra'"]    [Text] The idea of the need to establish a citizens'  committee for the defense of the republic has gathered more  momentum since the big popular demonstration that followed the  assassination of dramatist Abdelkader Alloula. The citizens'  group that was formed at the meeting last Thursday was a  committee to prepare for the day-long regional rally scheduled  for 22 March at T.R.O. Square.    Various work groups have been set up to this end, to make  contact with well-known personalities, associations, and union  leaders and raise funds to support the event.    At a preliminary meeting marked by lively discussion, the  platform adopted could be summed up as defending the republic  against the threat of a fundamentalist "parallel state" and  pressuring state institutions to meet their responsibility to  defend the citizenry.    "Before we are forced to the dreadful point of taking up  arms," one participant emphasized.    Their actions will be aimed at building bridges between the  elites, prominent defenders of republicanism, and the mass of  ordinary citizens.    There were many proposals to issue calls for international  action. In that context, the role of the press and intellectuals  was underscored.    Some participants undertook to make contacts with a view to  reestablishing the committee of intellectuals.    To stop the killings, which have become increasingly  commonplace, to combat attitudes of denial, and to alleviate  citizen fears, the committee decided at this meeting to make  contact with numerous leaders of voluntary associations--UNEP  [National Union of Public Entrepreneurs], UGTA [General Union of  Algerian Workers], etc.--with a view to collective action and  mobilizing maximum support from the republican sector. Attention  was drawn to the fact that many ordinary citizens are demanding  reprisals for the actions of the fundamentalists.    In that regard, several people in attendance proposed a  national strike, to give republican forces the chance to make  their voices heard and demand action from the state.    On another front, speakers proposed 26 March, when schools  reopen around the country, as a day for protest against  mandatory wearing of the hijab, and denunciation of certain  headmasters and school administrators who acting out of fear  have forced students to wear the hijab.    A working group was created to follow through on the  necessary actions. Underlined was the need for teachers in  cooperation with parents of students to take charge of their own  lives.    Finally, the citizens' committee will urge people to start  preparing for the 22 March regional demonstration in Oran.    The idea of a news release is also being developed.    The birth of this committee is one contribution from the  ranks of the republicans. There will doubtless be others in the  coming days.</p>

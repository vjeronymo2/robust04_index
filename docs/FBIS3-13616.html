Peres has already made many unfulfilled  promises.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH [no date as heard], Qaddumi  revealed that the Palestinian leadership has rejected an Israeli  request to hold a meeting between Peres and 'Arafat in  Washington.    Responding to Israeli press reports yesterday that U.S.  President Bill Clinton wants to announce that Jerusalem is the  capital of Israel, Qaddumi said: If this happens, we say the  peace process is over. He added: If this is confirmed, we will  withdraw from the negotiations, because Washington would be  violating the basis on which these negotiations were started.  Qaddumi said he expects things to drag on before the  negotiations are resumed, because Israel is procrastinating,  playing for time.</p>

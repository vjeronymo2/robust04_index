			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR MOST OF US, THE NO. 1 ISSUE IS NO BIG DEAL;  </P> <P> CRIME: IT'S DOWN IN CALIFORNIA, BUT THE POLITICIANS STILL FIND IT AN EASY  ATTENTION-GETTER.  </P> <P> A monumental paradox has surfaced in this election season: While polls and  other measures of public sentiment indicate ever-rising levels of concern about  crime -- and coincidental levels of support for more laws and more cops and  prisons -- Californians' actual chances of being victims of crime have been  declining rather markedly.  </P> <P> A month ago, the Department of Justice issued, with little official fanfare and  equally scant media interest, a thick report on crime in California during the  1980s. During the decade, the California Crime Index -- the number of serious  crimes per 100,000 population -- decreased sharply from nearly 4,000 in 1980 to  less than 3,500 in 1989, even counting an upward bump in the last two years of  the period.  </P> <P> While the actual number of crimes may have increased, that has been offset by  the state's huge population growth during the period, roughly 6 million. In  other words, crime grew more slowly than population; or, to say it still  another way, one's statistical chances of becoming a crime victim decreased.  </P> <P> During that same period, moreover, the "clearance rate" for crimes increased by  14%, although only about 22% of all major crimes were being cleared by arrest  or other actions. And, as everyone knows, the number of criminals being locked  up has escalated sharply.  </P> <P> If relatively fewer crimes are being committed, more are being solved and more  felons are going to jail, that should be cause for great celebration. We should  be congratulating ourselves that all of those additional laws and billions of  tax dollars are having a major impact.  </P> <P> Why, then, are Californians more, not less, concerned about crime?  </P> <P> For one thing, the decrease in crime is a big secret, one that the crime  industry wants to keep locked away. Think of the hundreds of thousands of cops,  lawyers, judges, prison guards, prison builders, gun and lock merchants,  insurance agents, burglar alarm installers and others whose incomes depend on  crime. Even the military wants to get in on the crime-fighting trade these days  as its main reason for being, the Soviet Union, becomes a pussycat.  </P> <P> Chief among those who engage in the conspiracy of silence about crime are  politicians. Contemporary political campaigns consist of identifying supposed  threats to the welfare of voters and then promising to oppose them effectively.  </P> <P> Bombarded by real and fictional crimes daily through the media, we become more  acutely sensitive to incidents from our own lives and thus become utterly  convinced that waves of crime are threatening to inundate us.  </P> <P> Crime is, in fact, a very serious matter in some inner-city neighborhoods. But  for most Californians, it is a minor annoyance at most, certainly not something  that should preoccupy their lives.  </P> <P> The danger is that politicians will continue to dwell on crime for tactical  reasons, not only contributing to the irrational climate of fear, but also  neglecting policy issues that are fundamentally more important to the state's  future.  </P></p>

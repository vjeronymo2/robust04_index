The Chief of the  Provincial Electric Power Bureau and President of the Zhejiang  Electric Power Development Corporation, Zhang Weiwen, and Chief  Executive of the Singapore (Shengbaowang) Group represented the  two sides in signing the agreement.    Singapore Cabinet Advisor, Lee Kuan Yew; Ministry of  Information Minister, Yang Rongwen; Ambassador to China, Zheng  Dongfa; Former Deputy Secretary of the CPPCC, Gu Mu; Director of  the State Council Special Economic Zones Office, Hu Ping; Former  Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission and Ningbo  Economic Promotion Committee Chairman, Chen Xian; Vice Minister  of the Ministry of Construction, Tan Qinglian; Governor of  Zhejiang Province, Wan Xueyuan; Vice Governor and Secretary of  the Ningbo Municipal Committee, Xu Yunhong; and Mayor of Ningbo,  Chen Tonghai, attended the signing ceremony.    The Ningbo Yinghua power plant is the first large-scale  electric power project to be built by joint venture between  China and Singapore. It will be a coal-fired power plant with an  installed capacity of 2,400MW. The first phase of construction  will include two 600MW units and transformer facilities for an  estimated investment of 5.5 billion yuan.    This large-scale power plant will be built near Xiangshan  Wan at Xianyang in Yin County by the Zhejiang Province Electric  Power Bureau (Zhejiang Province Electric Power Development  Corporation) and the Singapore Group's subsidiary (Shengbaowang)  Engineering Development (Private) Corporation, who will be  working together in a construction, ownership, operation, and  transfer type of arrangement. Both sides invested 50 percent,  forming the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Ninglong Power Corporation,  which will build and run the power plant. After 20 years of  operation, it will be turned over to the Zhejiang Electric Power  Bureau.    The feasibility study for the Yinghua Power Plant Project  has  been completed, and the project proposal document has been  delivered to the national authorities. The authorities say that  if development goes smoothly the first phase of this project can  be formally up and running in 1999.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FARRAKHAN APPEAL USES KORAN -- AND BIBLE;  </P> <P> MINISTRY: THE MUSLIM LEADER TAILORED HIS RECENT SPEECHES FOR NON-NATION OF  ISLAM FOLLOWERS. BUT HIS RACIAL DOCTRINES PUT OFF SOME IN HIS AUDIENCES.  </P> <P> When Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan thunders his message of pride,  independence and equality for black America, he evokes the fiery tones and  images of a revival preacher.  </P> <P> And the Muslim minister's associates accent his religious role, referring to  him as "the champion of the cause of redemption," and a man "backed with the  might of almighty God."  </P> <P> In two recent Los Angeles appearances, Farrakhan studded his talks with  religious language and references to Allah, Jesus, Moses, Mohammed and Satan.  </P> <P> At the funeral of Oliver Beasley, shot on Jan. 23 by a sheriff's deputy trainee  during a scuffle in South-Central Los Angeles, Farrakhan eulogized the young  black Muslim, who was reared as a Christian. Beasley was the "first martyr in  the new dispensation of the rise of the Nation" of Islam, Farrakhan said. "It  shall be recalled that not a Muslim died, but a Muslim-Christian. A  Christian-Muslim. . . .  </P> <P> "His tragedy becomes the beginning of our touching each other as Muslims and  Christians -- Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses. . . . "  </P> <P> And, continuing his cross-over appeal to Christians in the capacity crowd of  16,000 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena last weekend, Farrakhan deftly drew from  passages in the Bible and the Koran, speaking about "God's sacred gift of life"  given to each individual. "God made Adam from black mud," he said, paraphrasing  the Genesis account of Creation. "But . . . we are not animals, brothers and  sisters; we have been raised in dignity."  </P> <P> A theme Farrakhan weaved through much of his 90-minute message was taken from  the New Testament Book of Revelation, Chapter 6, which describes the Four  Horsemen of the Apocalypse.  </P> <P> The rider of the "pale horse," he observed, was "death; and hell followed close  behind."  </P> <P> "Death is riding the neighborhood," he added, interpreting the text to mean  that wherever "Caucasians have gone . . . you brought death to the (black)  people . . . and hell."  </P> <P> But, despite Farrakhan's reputation for speaking long and loud on religion,  most people didn't come out to hear him preach a religious message, judging  from a sampling of interviews at the Sports Arena. Rather, people came because  they thought Farrakhan could help stem the violence that has racked the city's  streets.  </P> <P> "I want to stop the killing," said Dr. Clarence Littlejohn, a Los Angeles  pediatrician, referring to the theme of Farrakhan's speech. "If a little bit of  religion will help that, that's fine."  </P> <P> "Deep down," added Rosa Toulon, a member of the Baha'i faith who was visiting  from Hawaii, "I think he's trying to bring people together rather than separate  them. But he (Farrakhan) leans toward blacks being superior. Baha'is believe in  being loving to everyone."  </P> <P> The Chicago-based Farrakhan leads a branch of Islam that was founded in Detroit  in the 1930s, and he follows the black supremacy teachings of the late Elijah  Muhammad. According to the Final Call, the Nation of Islam newspaper,  Farrakhan's group believes that Allah (God) appeared in the person of Master W.  Fard Muhammad in 1930, "the long-awaited 'messiah' of the Christians and the  'mahdi' of the Muslims."  </P> <P> Farrakhan has increasingly garnered support from black Christian clergy. He met  privately with 70 of them in Los Angeles before his speech in the Sports Arena  on the night of Feb. 2.  </P> <P> And he gained a show of support from the orthodox Muslim organization, the  Islamic Center of Southern California. The center gave $5,000 for Farrakhan's  ministry at the meeting.  </P> <P> But some black members of orthodox Islamic mosques in Los Angeles are cool  toward Farrakhan's version of the world religion.  </P> <P> Abdul Askia, 35, a Los Angeles youth worker, had been a follower of the Nation  of Islam for 15 years but left recently. Farrakhan's teaching "is radical . . .  and very selective in its presentation," Askia said, adding that, in his  opinion, Farrakhan's doctrine of racial superiority inflames young blacks and  sets the stage for their confrontation with law officers.  </P> <P> "Being told that the black man is a god -- no wonder they are standing up,"  Askia said in an interview. "This is what the people are responding to. . . .  There is Islam and there is 'Hislam,' . . . Farrakhan is doing his thing . . .  claiming to be a Muslim and not living (it). Excluding Caucasians is not the  Islamic way of life."  </P> <P> Saddiq Saafir, the imam, or spiritual leader, of Ibaadillah Mosque on Jefferson  Boulevard, said there are basic differences between Nation of Islam and  orthodox Muslim doctrine, particularly in understanding the roles of Fard  Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad.  </P> <P> "The Nation is based on some Koran, some Bible and the belief that Elijah  Muhammad is a messenger of God," he said.  </P> <P> "God-consciousness," or taqwa in Islam, is not based on skin color, according  to Saafir, who is an African-American. "But they (the Nation of Islam) see it  as being so."  </P> <P> "The differences are there, but we don't argue or discuss them," Saafir  continued. "We have to live within the context of the Koran and the teachings  of the Prophet Mohammed. . . . We cannot innovate, change or alter that  content."  </P> <P> At the Sports Arena, Farrakhan made no apology for his scriptural recitations,  and the audience appeared familiar with the style of delivery and content of  black preaching that Farrakhan emulated.  </P> <P> "No man can be hip without a knowledge of the Scripture," he declared. "If we  could read . . . the Bible and the Koran and understand what it says, we'd  become wiser than the newscaster, because we'd know the news before it  happens."  </P> <P> And referring to a conversation in the Koran between Allah and the devil,  Farrakhan challenged the rival Crips and Bloods gangs -- groups of each sat in  separate sections in the arena -- to be "one family. . . . They are not natural  enemies. . . . The enemy (Satan) has intervened between brothers."  </P> <P> Perhaps a fourth of the audience responded at the end of Farrakhan's message  when he invited people to raise their hands if "you want to unite with me and  become part of the Nation of Islam . . . and 1 billion Muslims all over the  Earth."  </P> <P> "Visit the local mosque," he said before launching into a lengthy prayer of  dismissal in Arabic and English.  </P></p>

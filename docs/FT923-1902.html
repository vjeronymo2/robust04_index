			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Time's up for long office breaks THE AVERAGE British office worker now spends just 21 minutes a day having lunch, 11 minutes drinking tea or coffee, and six minutes going to the toilet, according to a survey by Interlink Express Parcels. The survey attributes such indices of pressure to the recession. A total of 74 per cent of those interviewed in the sample say that greater demands are being made on their time than two years ago. The survey also finds that office workers spend 42 minutes a day on the telephone, 38 minutes chatting face-to-face, 21 minutes reading or writing letters, 15 minutes attending meetings, and 50 minutes commuting to work. Nearly 90 per cent complain of their time regularly being wasted - 53 per cent blame interruptions from unscheduled telephone calls or visits and 15 per cent blame the waste of time on reading junk mail. Workers based in London complain most about unscheduled interruptions and those based in Manchester complain least. The survey is based on a small sample of only 100 workers but Interlink says the sample included secretaries, clerical workers, consultants and senior executives from London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Bristol. More than 64 per cent report being equally busy throughout the day, with a third saying there are peaks and troughs. London-based workers are most likely to be busy through the day while those in Edinburgh are most likely to have peaks and troughs. Workers report that Tuesday is the quietest day of the week and Monday and Friday are the most frantic. A third of office workers say time pressures have 'greatly increased' in the past two years and nearly half (49 per cent) blame the pressures on increased business without any increase in staff. An almost equal proportion attribute their troubles to greater competition caused by the recession.</p>

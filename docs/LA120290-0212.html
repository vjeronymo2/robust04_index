			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLAY HOUSE BUILDER IN HARMONY WITH EARTH  </P> <P> Thanks so much for "Feat of Clay" (by Barbara Moran, Nov. 11) about Joseph  (Diliberti) and his fired clay home. His uncomplicated way of living and  ecological awareness is one hopeful vision of the future that does not include  the doom and gloom projected by many who are witnessing the transforming of our  techno-society.  </P> <P> Although his life choices will not appeal to everyone, certainly his evident  ease of spirit, peace and contentment (though by no means complacency) can be  envied by many. Comfort, as Joseph demonstrates so well, is something quite  outside Holiday Inn-type conveniences. Living in harmony with nature is a  process we should look forward to rediscovering.  </P> <P> Our society's widespread feelings of isolation, fear, frustration and malaise  may find a balm in Joseph's idea of self-sustaining, self-affirming  communities. And if we can do all this and not have to meet mortgage payments  too, what more can we ask?  </P> <P> CATHERINE R. LEACH  </P> <P> Pine Mountain Club, Calif.  </P></p>

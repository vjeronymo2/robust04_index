			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Nato offers warplanes to defend UN troops in Bosnia NATO is to offer warplanes to defend United Nations troops in Bosnia, although the allies appeared yesterday to disagree over the circumstances in which they would be deployed. Croatian gunmen, meanwhile, held up a relief convoy taking supplies to Moslems in Bosnia and shot dead at least eight civilian drivers. The gunmen then looted the lorries before UN peacekeeping troops could intervene. The Nato offer of warplanes came in response to a suggestion by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that Nato should be given the task of providing such protective air power on the UN's behalf. It was made public at the beginning of a two-day Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Athens. It was also announced that a Nato summit, proposed by US president Bill Clinton, would be held in December to give member countries an opportunity to adapt the alliance's agenda to the post-cold war world. Significantly, the communique issued after yesterday's Nato meeting does not restrict air protection in Bosnia to the six Moslem enclaves within the republic. 'We offer our protective air power in case of attack against Unprofor (UN Protection Forces) in the performance of its overall mandate,' the document stated. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, indicated that this meant air power could be used to protect UN forces anywhere in Bosnia, if called on to do so. What it did not mean was that air strikes would be used to protect the civilian population from attack. This interpretation was supported by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, though Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, was of the view that air power would be used only to protect Unprofor troops in the officially designated safe areas. The need to work out a common position on former Yugoslavia, together with the closely related issue of co-operation on world peacekeeping operations, is likely to figure prominently at the Nato summit, to be held at a venue in Europe to be decided. Mr Christopher also announced that the US had offered to contribute 300 troops to the UN peacekeeping contingent in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. This now numbers about 700 and is intended to prevent the Yugoslav conflict spilling over into Macedonia. 'This offer of US troops to the UN has both symbolic and tangible significance. These troops underscore the seriousness of our warning to Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs,' Mr Christopher told the Nato council. He stressed at a news conference, however, that Washington would not provide ground troops for the protection of Moslem 'safe areas' in Bosnia. The relief convoy attacked in Bosnia was heading for the mainly Moslem town of Tuzla, when it was halted near the disputed town of Novi Travnik. UN officials said Croat gunmen ransacked some of the 170 lorries. 'I saw drivers being dragged from their vehicles,' said a British corporal attached to the UN peacekeeping troops trying to protect the convoy. 'I then heard a series of shots and a little later I saw a number of bodies being dragged away.' Fragile ceasefire, Page 2</p>

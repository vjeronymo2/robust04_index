			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Signing of Partnership </F> Agreement with European Union Probably Being Postponed"]    [Text] The signing of a large-scale document between  Russia and the European Union [EU] -- the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation, which took 18 months to elaborate  and was already largely completed by the end of last year -- is  being postponed again and, for the moment, indefinitely. This  situation emerged in the negotiating process in the past few  days despite the objective desire of Brussels and Moscow for an  accord.    I would remind you that in Brussels on 9 December President  Boris Yeltsin and EU leaders signed the "Joint Political  Declaration on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the European Union." The point of this document,  both sides believed, was that at that moment the Partnership  Agreement was not completely ready -- a whole series of  technical points had to be cleared up. So, in order to enshrine  at a high political level the joint will and readiness to sign  the main document, the leaders of Russia and the EU decided to  formulate a declaration of intent which would reflect the main  points of the Agreement.    Without going into the details of the Partnership Agreement  itself, I should merely like to note that this is the first  legally significant international document in which Russia is  regarded not as a state with a centralized economy but as a  country with an economic system in transition to the market.  This gives us a whole series of trade advantages, both  immediate and long-term, and makes it possible to shift our  relations with the EU countries to the level that exists between  the EU and the United States or the EU and Japan.    However, the aforementioned "technical difficulties" in the  text of the document consequently developed, contrary to the  sides' expectations, into difficult obstacles to the signing of  the Agreement. One of them emerged over the appearance in  November last year of Yeltsin's well-known edict on Western  banks; another is connected with the trade in nuclear materials  and affects the interests of France, an EU member.    The optimism shown by Moscow and Brussels last December  during Yeltsin's visit to Belgium was well founded -- Vice  Premier Aleksandr Shokhin and Sir Leon Brittan, deputy chairman  of the EU Commissioner, the chief participants in the talks, had  managed at that time to find a solution to the tangle of  contradictions that had developed. This solution is a most  complex sequence of mutual compromises and concessions in  various economic sectors where a snag at one level would ruin  all the rest.    At the start of May Shokhin and Brittan met again for the  same reason -- their previous accord had not worked. The second  solution seemed to have opened the way if not to the signing of  the Agreement then at least to its initialing in June. However,  at the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Monday  France's Alain Juppe unexpectedly stated that the draft  Agreement on Partnership with the Russian Federation was  unacceptable. For the same reason as before: Paris is  concerned that Russian exports of uranium will harm its trade in  nuclear materials in the EU.    "We are very worried about the recent development of events  over the agreement with the EU," Georgiy Gabuniya, leader of the  Russian Government delegation to the talks with the EU on the  economic section of the Agreement, said in an exclusive  interview for IZVESTIYA. "The French position puzzles us, to  put it mildly, because it has no economic foundation. That is  not simply our objective assessment -- during the talks we did  not hear one convincing argument from the French in defense of  their position. And the general fears that Russia might dump its  uranium in the EU in the future have no concrete substance.    "We have already made a concession in the solution that we  found: If the uranium agreement is completely unacceptable to  the French, let us live within the old regime which has existed  since 1989 as part of the previous trade and economic agreement  between the USSR and the EC, so as to preserve everything that  has been achieved through the most complex negotiations. But  even that does not suit Paris. Meanwhile no one has yet  complained that we are disrupting the market or creating  complications for Western industry."    I would add to what Georgiy Gabuniya said that the uranium  sector in France is concentrated in the interests of the Cogema  firm, which employs thousands of people and which in recent  years has recorded a sharp increase in profits (around $10  million in 1993).    For the time being Paris' position remains really unclear.  If a purely sectoral interest (uranium) is being pursued here,  why has that not been backed up with documents? Or is this just  a pretext for wrecking the whole agreement -- in which case the  arguments are indeed difficult to formulate.    In the present situation Moscow is quite willing to continue  trying to break the deadlock on this problem. However, the ball  is now in the court of the EU, with which we are officially  holding negotiations. Perhaps some light will be shed by the  expected arrival of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in  Moscow today.</p>

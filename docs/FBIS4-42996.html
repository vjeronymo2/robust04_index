			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said that  the elections to the European Parliament and the upcoming  European Union [EU] summit on the Greek island of Corfu are  important milestones on the road to the unity of the continent.  About four months before the Bundestag election, the European  election is also a particularly important domestic policy event,  the chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] said in a DPA interview in Bonn three days before the  voting.    "After centuries of bitter wars between neighbors in Europe,  the fact that elections will be held in 12 countries on Sunday  [12 June] is a fantastic thing. We Germans need Europe more than  all others," Kohl said. He announced that the Federal  Government will make further attempts to considerably increase  the rights and opportunities of influence of the parliament in  Strasbourg in the near future. Since the Maastricht Treaty came  into force, the 581 European representatives of the people have  had the right of codetermination regarding the appointment of  the European Commission members, including their president. The  parliament also has to agree to international treaties and  decide on the admission of the states that want to become  members, he said.    It is Kohl's objective to discuss how internationally  organized crime can be more effectively combated and a joint  European asylum law be agreed upon in cooperation between the  council, the parliament, and the commission at the conference  reviewing the Maastricht Treaty in 1996. In the chancellor's  opinion, the previous regulations are not enough.    Meanwhile, Kohl, French head of state Francois Mitterrand,  and Spanish head of government Felipe Gonzalez have also set the  course for the council presidency that will be consecutively  performed by these three countries from 1 July on until the end  of 1995 for six months each. "In these one-and-a-half years, we  want to jointly initiate important things, for example, in the  field of internal security," Kohl said.    Among other things, the formulation of a joint foreign and  security policy is also at issue. "The war in the former  Yugoslavia stresses the need for increased EU efforts." In  Kohl's opinion, it is particularly important that, at the EU  summit on 24 and 25 June in Corfu, attempts at reducing  unemployment in the EU will be made. One has to focus on  economic policy questions, for example, an adequate strategy in  view of the challenge from Asian competitors and the integration  of the reform states in East and southeast Europe.    "It cannot be unimportant to us whether these states are  successful or not. If they relapse into old structures, this  would have disastrous effects on all of us," Kohl said. As a  troika, Kohl, Mitterrand, and Gonzalez also want to initiate a  trans-European infrastructure, for example, in rail traffic.  "It must be possible in the future to board a train in London  and to leave it in Moscow after a trip across Europe. This is a  first-rate offer of peace," the chancellor said.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Lohengrin as a parable As Wagnerian debuts go, Robert Carsen has done rather well. The prolific young Canadian has spent most of his career scoring successes in French and Italian repertoire. Given his ability to tap singers' acting skills and his refusal to over-conceptualise, he was ripe for the wider spaces of Wagner. Lohengrin at Geneva's Grand Theatre fulfils most expectations, while suggesting he still has something to learn. Carsen sees Lohengrin as a parable of man's political and social condition. Like the people of Brabant, we all seek a better world - preferably one in which problems are solved in a twinkle by some miraculous swan-knight - but are brought back to earth by the self-destructive tendencies of human nature. Brabant, in Paul Steinberg's designs, is a bombed-out concrete shell of a building, not unlike a modern theatre or military hangar. Its drab, easily-manipulated inhabitants are all too ready to share Elsa's dream of a saviour to deliver them from internal strife and external threat. That the dream bears no relation to reality is clear when Lohengrin arrives like a romantic crusader stepping out of a 19th century painting. Dressed in a business suit for Act two, Lohengrin imparts confidence like a politician or merchant banker. After 'In fernem Land', he withdraws as he arrived - leaving young Gottfried to plant a tree of hope for the future. The moral? Don't count on Messiahs, there is no quick fix; humanity must learn to solve its problems the hard way. Within this late-20th century allegorical framework, Carsen allows words and music to speak with uncommon freedom. His handling of Telramund and Ortrud - Wagner's Macbeths - is psychologically acute, while the subtle variety of lighting (Dominique Bruguiere) is alone worth the ticket. On the debit side, the choral processions find Carsen floundering for ideas. There is a touch of bathos in the way Lohengrin's swan bows its head like a mechanical toy, and the bed-making routine in the bridal chamber is a comic lapse of taste. On this evidence, Thomas Moser is probably the finest Lohengrin since James King. The voice has a sweet lyrical ring rather than clarion power, and he shows exemplary control and musicality. With his tall, bearded appearance, he is every inch the part. His Elsa is Eva Johansson, a blonde bombshell who sings radiantly and makes a playful bride. Hartmut Welker is the stentorian Telramund, Marilyn Zschau a two-faced Ortrud who could be auditioning for Dynasty. Eike Wilm Schulte repeats his fine Herold from Bayreuth, while Hans Tschammer's King Henry - dressed like a general - is a model of dignity. No reservations about the cast - nor about Christian Thielemann's conducting. His speeds are spacious but powerfully sustained, so that Wagner's long crescendos develop a crowning inevitability. He elicits string playing of extraordinary finesse at the crux of Act two, and the work's melodic poetry comes over strongly. Thielemann's Lohengrin has the stamp of authority usually associated with an older, near-extinct breed of German conductor. Nothing could be more reassuring. Final performances June 20, 24, 27 and 30.</p>

Natural gas reserves rose from 136.7 billion to 137  billion cubic meters, an increase of only 0.2 percent.    By reaching the level of 3.8 billion barrels (a figure  representing what it will be possible to produce), Brazil is  guaranteed a petroleum supply for 16 years if no more is  discovered and if it continues to extract an average of 700,000  barrels per day, as it is doing today.    If that conservative scenario holds up, the figures are  quite  comfortable compared to those in other countries. Although  worldwide reserves (1 trillion barrels) are sufficient for 43  years, their distribution is less comfortable for some  countries. The United Kingdom has enough petroleum for 5.9  years' worth of consumption, and the United States has enough  for 9.8 years, according to Dimas Jose Simoes, deputy  superintendent of operations in the Petrobras Department of  Exploration.    The fact is that petroleum reserves are concentrated in a  small group of countries. Ninety percent of the world's  petroleum reserves are owned by only 12 countries (most of them  in the Middle East). Brazil, which possesses 0.4 percent of the  total, is in 20th place. And 54.1 percent of the world's natural  gas reserves, which total 138 trillion cubic meters, is in the  Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and  Iran. In this case, Brazil occupies a modest 40th place.    Petrobras's plans for increasing Brazilian petroleum  reserves  call for investments on the order of $700 million annually in  1994 and 1995, according to Celso Lucchesi, the firm's  superintendent of exploration. Petrobras expects to add 350  million barrels per year through 1997.    In 1992, for example, when the proven reserves in 234  countries rose by 2 billion barrels, Brazil added 830 million,  or over half the worldwide volume [as published]. This was  achieved thanks mainly to Petrobras investments beginning in the  mid-1980's in the deep waters of the Campos Basin, where the  company discovered the giant Marlim, Albacora, and Barracuda  fields. In 1992, when worldwide investments in exploration  totaled $11.6 billion, Petrobras invested $680 million, the  equivalent of about 6 percent of that total.  <H5>  Potential </H5>   According to Simoes, the 3.8 billion barrels of proven  reserves may increase to 8.8 billion. The difference between the  two figures (5 billion barrels) represents petroleum that has  been discovered but whose volume has not been verified, a  process that will require additional exploration investments  beyond those already made.    Petrobras also has a third figure reflecting "petroleum  potential": 18 billion barrels of oil equivalent (including, in  this case, petroleum and natural gas).</p>

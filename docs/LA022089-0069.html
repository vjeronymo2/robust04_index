			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: DARK ANGEL OFFERS LESSON IN ENDURANCE  </P> <P> Thrash and speed metal, like any other musical form, has its lesser gods --  bands that don't have the brutal artistry of Metallica or the fire and sarcasm  of Slayer, but who have enough power to give their fans a hefty dose of  sweating and slamming. Dark Angel is one such group. The L.A. quintet goes for  pure heaviness, and its show Saturday at Fender's gave the packed audience a  lesson in endurance. The hour-plus speedfest went on relentlessly until the  club's glass doors were fogged over by the oppressive heat.  </P> <P> With its machine-gun drumming, cacophony of guitars and vocals that sounded  like a 78 r.p.m. rap, Dark Angel will probably never find mass appeal. But that  seems to matter little to the group, whose latest album, "Leave Scars,"  willingly sacrifices melody to crushing rhythms.  </P> <P> Second-slotted Dr. Know, on the other hand, emphasized its melodic  sensibilities, which at times diminished its power. The band's time changes  lacked the dynamics that make thrash's left-hook punch so effective. Some tunes  had a good, bluesy feel, but this group isn't yet strong enough to blend its  multiple elements. JANISS GARZA  </P></p>

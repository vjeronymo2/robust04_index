			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting bears fruit as Renold returns to black COST CUTTING and productivity gains helped Renold, the chain and gear maker, return to profit last year, even though trading conditions remained difficult in its important western European markets. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m in the year to April 3, compared to a loss of Pounds 3m, on turnover increased by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 125.1m (Pounds 121.5m). The Pounds 4.2m turnround reflected gains in efficiency and margins rather than any overall increase in volume. The results came after charging Pounds 1.4m for redundancy costs, against Pounds 1.6m last year. Following a lengthy period of reorganisation, the group's chain operations had settled down and were beginning to deliver 'steadily improving results.' Productivity at the Bredbury chain factory had increased markedly, the French business returned to profit, benefiting from growth in automotive chain volumes and greater manufacturing efficiency and, despite lower domestic orders, German results also improved. In the Milnrow gears operation profitability was affected by weak demand and intense competition for standard gearboxes, while the couplings business at Cardiff produced 'an excellent performance.' The US operations, where significant cost reductions were made the previous year, returned to profit, and by the final quarter the devaluation of sterling began to benefit profit margins on products exported from the UK. Mr Peter Frost, chairman, said trading conditions had strengthened in some of the group's worldwide markets, particularly Australia and New Zealand, but prospects in western Europe remained uncertain. He added that the full effect of the devaluation of sterling would benefit the current year, 'as will actions which have been taken, and continue to be taken, to strengthen the business.' Interest charges increased to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.8m) while net borrowings at the year-end declined slightly to Pounds 12.1 (Pounds 12.8m) and gearing fell by 2 percentage points to 23 per cent. Earnings per share were 0.9p (losses 5.6p). The dividend is unchanged at 1p.</p>

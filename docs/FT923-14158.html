			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' currencies head for knacker's yard THE MOST labyrinthine corpus of European Community law - the 'green' currency system - is on its way to the knacker's yard. The European Commission yesterday approved the abolition of monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs), the system of export subsidies and taxes used to iron out irregularities arising from the divergence of foreign exchange rates from the fixed 'green' rates used to translate the EC's guaranteed farm prices, which are denominated in European currency units, into national currencies. This system requires border checks on produce moving across EC borders and so cannot continue when the barrier-free single market comes into operation next year. Commision officials believe the 12 will approve the plan virtually unmodified. There will still be 'green' currencies, until a single EC currency arrives, in principle by 1999 at the latest. But green rates will now be set at the central rate for the seven currencies operating within the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, and at close to average market rate for the rest. The latter 'floating' currencies are those of the UK, Spain, Portugal and Greece. The first three are in the wider band of the exchange rate mechanism while the Greek drachma is outside it. The stability of the EMS, which has seen no major realignment for five years, thereby theoretically guarantees a stable green rate, eliminating MCAs. The proposal still provides for realignments and would reintroduce monetary compensation whenever exchange rate gaps widened beyond five percentage points. This, however, is wider than the present provision for a 4 point gap, under which the MCA mechanism, once a crucial instrument for EC agri-traders, had almost withered away. The MCA system for the UK has been dismantled and the system now operates mostly for the benefit of Greece. But the agrimonetarist profession built up over 25 years of a system of ever-increasing complexity will not be put out of business entirely until the advent of monetary union. Traders will still have to master the rules governing even much tighter fluctuations, though their task, especially in the virtually fixed currency countries, will be much simpler.</p>

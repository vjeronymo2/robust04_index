During the elections, six CSCE teams visited more than 50  polling stations in Almaty, Kapchagai, Issyk and other cities to  supervise their opening and closing and the counting of votes.    Winship's conclusion that the elections were undemocratic is  based on the fact that political parties and movements and  individual candidates did not have enough time to organize their  election campaigns, while an entangled candidate registration  procedure provoked offenses on the part of constituency  electoral commissions.    In addition, the national roll compiled by President  Nursultan Nazarbayev ensured 20 percent of seats in the future  parliament for government officials, according to the CSCE  experts.    There were registered cases where one person voted for  several candidates. CSCE experts revealed instances where  electoral commission members forged or replaced ballots. The  Central Electoral Commission also withdrew independent  candidates under unconvincing pretexts. There were cases when  local authorities put pressure on electoral commissions, Winship  said.    But the main flaw of the elections was that "many electors  did not understand the system of voting and voted simultaneously  for several candidates," the CSCE experts said. In some towns,  such as Kapchagai, located only 60 km from Almaty, some pollling  stations were closed, which prevented about 5,000 people from  voting.    Besides, the independent media had limited access to  information on the elections, Winship said.</p>

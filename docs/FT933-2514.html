			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / BT seeks to relocate most London staff BRITISH Telecommunications may move as many as 18,000 office jobs out of central London under a relocation strategy being considered by an internal review team. The jobs would be moved out to the M25 ring, with only about 2,000 office posts left in central London. The relocation would enable BT to rationalise its substantial office holdings and could save the company up to Pounds 44m in London weighting payments. The scale of the relocation will not be decided until January. A feasibility study was begun in July. 'The feasibility study is to determine whether it is actually possible to transfer the posts,' BT said yesterday. The company said the relocation plan was separate from its ambitions to cut 30,000 jobs across the country over the next two years. 'The two are not directly linked and if (the relocation) goes ahead, most of the jobs would simply be transferred,' it said. The prospect of more job cuts was strongly attacked yesterday by the NCU communications union. The 15,000 job losses projected for each of the next two years come on top of deep cuts over the past three years. BT's aim is mainly to reduce its engineering workforce, which is excessive for the requirements of new technology. Clerical workers have not been permitted to seek redundancy under the same terms as the engineers. However, under a scheme introduced this year, engineers will be allowed to apply to transfer to clerical posts. If enough of them do so, some clerical workers will be eligible for the redundancy package. Last year's redundancy package, Release 92, provided for payments as high as Pounds 100,000 plus pension entitlement, although the average sum was much lower. About 20,000 employees were refused the package last year because of oversubscription. BT said it was too early to say whether this year's package would be fully subscribed. BT will test a service later this month allowing customers to return their last telephone call even if they do not know the calling number. The six-month trial will be conducted in Perth, Scotland.</p>

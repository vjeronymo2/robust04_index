			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares soar on BAe deal The market spotlight inevitably fell on British Aerospace yesterday, with the surprise announcement that the company is to sell its 80 per cent stake in Rover cars to German group BMW. BAe shares initially jumped 30 to 474p as dealers appreciated the Pounds 800m cash boost to the accounts. The stock shot further ahead to end 55 up at 499p on heavy trading of 18m shares after the realisation that the deal included Pounds 200m of debt and the freeing off of Pounds 700m of balance sheet borrowing for BAe. Analysts moved quickly to upgrade current year profits expectations, ahead of BAe's results scheduled for later this month. With the range having been around Pounds 170m, James Capel was said to be now forecasting Pounds 189m, while Hoare Govett, BAe's broker, was reported to be predicting Pounds 180m. At the top end of the range, Smith New Court raised its estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 210m, while Strauss Turnbull is predicting Pounds 250m. Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said the sale 'removes the financial worries on reorganisation and gives the company scope to tackle the problems in the turbo props and regional jets'. There was talk that Arlington, the group's property division, may also be put up for sale. Other speculation included the resumption of interest from GEC in BAe. GEC added 3 1/2 at 340p.</p>

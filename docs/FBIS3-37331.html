According to the opinion the diplomat expressed in an  interview with ITAR-TASS, talk on sanctions is premature while  appropriate negotiations are under way, and possibilities of the  negotiating process have not been exhausted. Besides, this  issue will be discussed by the forthcoming session of the  International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors.    The international community should display flexibility on  this question and should use all available possibilities, he  stressed.</p>

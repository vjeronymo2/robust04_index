			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Observer: Flutters over Emu Like the famous fog in the Channel, the election campaign has somewhat isolated Europe from current British politics. In particular, the demands of the hustings leave Premier Major and colleagues little time to reflect on the implications of the flutters in German parliamentary opinion about the march towards European monetary union, given the go-ahead in Maastricht three months ago. Even so, there are distinct signs of Schadenfreude in the British government that the idea of relinquishing monetary sovereignty has begun to provoke the same sort of questioning in Germany as it has done in Britain during the past few years. At the European Community summit in December, the UK won a hard-fought right to decide afresh in 1996 whether it wanted to be part of Emu. Now, foreign secretary Douglas Hurd believes that the Germans will request the right for a similar form of reconsideration before progressing to the final stage of Emu. He also believes that the target date for a decision on moving to a single currency may be delayed from the objective of 1996. Should economic difficulties in Germany place obstacles across the route to Emu, a future Conservative government would evidently not be that much displeased. The same can surely be said - in spite of John Smith's pro-Emu rhetoric - of any future Labour administration.</p>

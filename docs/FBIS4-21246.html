			<p>Bank   Reported   <F P=102> AU1804145694 Zurich NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG in German 15 Apr  94 p 15 </F>  <F P=103> AU1804145694 </F> <F P=104>  Zurich NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``$150 Million Confiscated at SBG''] </F>   [Excerpts] In the biggest Swiss case of money-laundering so  far, about $150 million were seized at the Swiss Banking Society  (SBG). Criminal proceedings have been initiated against a  long-standing deputy director of the biggest Swiss bank in  Zurich, as the responsible authorities have announced.    According to information released by Jacques Antenen, deputy  investigating judge of Waadt canton, the seizing of $150 million  at the SBG took place in connection with investigations against  suspected money-launderers of the Colombian Medellin drug  cartel. The responsible Zurich district prosecutor's office is  convinced that the approximately $150 million is dirty money, as  District Prosecutor Dieter Jann-Corrodi said upon inquiry. ``I  have not heard of any bigger case anywhere in the world so  far,'' he said.  <H5>  Investigations Since June 1993 </H5>   Since June 1993 the Waadt judiciary has been investigating  Colombian citizens who belong to a criminal organization located  in the Colombian town of Barranquilla and are linked with the  Medellin cartel. They are suspected of having violated the  regulations concerning money-laundering in the cantons of Waadt,  Neuenburg, and Geneva. According to Antenen, they invested  money in, among other things, a restaurant and other real estate  properties, but that was less than 1 million Swiss francs.  According to the Waadt investigating judge, investigations are  being carried out together with the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration and the authorities in Zurich and are also spread  to the cantons of Neuenburg and Geneva. On 23 February a  Colombian woman was arrested; she is still in detention pending  trial. Within the framework of the investigations, the Waadt  judicial authorities applied to the authorities in Zurich for  legal aid to seize the more than $150 million at the SBG.  <H5>  SBG Deputy Director Claims He Knows Nothing </H5>   In Zurich criminal investigations have been initiated  against  the SBG deputy director, who acted as a trustee. The Zurich  district prosecutor's office accused the deputy director of  having long known about the dirty origin of the money but not  having reacted when the penal law on money-laundering came into  force in August 1990. His temporary arrest was announced on 27  February.

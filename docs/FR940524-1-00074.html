(250 pounds) for 30 minutes without failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Belts, rings, and attachments for life lines must withstand a pull of 136 kg. (300 pounds) for 30 minutes without failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The hose shall be firmly attached to the harness so as to withstand a pull of 113 kg. (250 pounds) for 30 minutes without separating, and the hose attachments shall be arranged so that the pull or drag of the hose behind an advancing wearer does not disarrange the harness or exert pull upon the facepiece.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The arrangement and suitability of all harness accessories and fittings will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) The harness employed on Type B supplied-air respirators shall not be uncomfortable, disturbing, or interfere with the movements of the wearer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The harness shall be easily adjustable to various sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The hose shall be attached to the harness in a manner that will withstand a pull of 45 kg. (100 pounds) for 30 minutes without separating or showing signs of failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The design of the harness and attachment of the line shall permit dragging the maximum length of hose considered for approval over a concrete floor without disarranging the harness or exerting a pull on the facepiece.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The arrangement and suitability of all harness accessories and fittings will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The harness employed on Type C respirators shall be similar to that required on the Type B respirator, or, it may consist of a simple arrangement for attaching the hose to a part of the wearer's clothing in a practical manner that prevents a pull equivalent to dragging the maximum length of the hose over a concrete floor from exerting pull upon the respiratory-inlet covering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Where supplied-air respirators have a rigid or partly rigid head covering, a suitable harness shall be required to assist in holding this covering in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.152  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Breathing tube test; minimum requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) Type A and Type B supplied-air respirators shall employ one or two flexible breathing tubes of the nonkinking type which extend from the facepiece to a connecting hose coupling attached to the belt or harness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The breathing tubes employed shall permit free head movement, insure against closing off by kinking or by chin or arm pressure, and they shall not create a pull that will loosen the facepiece or disturb the wearer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Breathing tubes employed on Type C supplied-air respirators of the continuous flow class shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, however, an extension of the connecting hose may be employed in lieu of the breathing tubes required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(1) A flexible, nonkinking type breathing tube shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Be employed on Type C supplied-air respirators of the demand and pressure-demand class; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Extend from the facepiece to the demand or pressure-demand valve, except where the valve is attached directly to the facepiece.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The breathing tube shall permit free head movement, insure against closing off by kinking or by chin or arm pressure, and shall not create a pull that will loosen the facepiece or disturb the wearer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.153  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Airflow resistance test, Type A and Type AE supplied-air respirators; minimum requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Airflow resistance will be determined when the respirator is completely assembled with the respiratory-inlet covering, the air-supply device, and the maximum length of air-supply hose coiled for one-half its length in loops 1.5 to 2.1 m. (5 to 7 feet) in diameter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

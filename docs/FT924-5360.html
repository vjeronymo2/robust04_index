			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Mongolia aims to put economy in new hands: Stalinism has been crushed in rush to privatise MONGOLIA is pressing ahead with a privatisation scheme which it claims to be the fastest in history. The country's conversion to free market economics is being overseen by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. The party ran a Stalinist regime for nearly 60 years but is now pursuing a policy of reforms including price liberalisation and banking and private property laws - though it is also having to re-draft previous legislation which was pushed through too fast. Privatisation is central to its policies. Between February and October, 121 companies were floated on the Mongolian Stock Exchange, and the target is 500 by the end of the year. All companies are being considered for privatisation except those which are bankrupt or considered too important to the country; among the latter are significant earners of hard currency. The country is using a voucher scheme similar to that under way in Russia. Each Mongolian citizen receives a free voucher worth 10,000 tugriks (Pounds 167 at the official rate), of which 7,000 tugriks can be use to subscribe to larger privatisations and 3,000 tugriks to buy small businesses or livestock. Says Mr Naidansurengiin Zolzhargal, 27-year-old chairman of the stock exchange in Ulan Bator, the capital: 'This is mass give-away privatisation for its own sake. The goal is not raising capital, but changing the ownership structure of the economy.' Mr Zolzhargal, a self-assured man educated in Germany and the US, heads an exchange with 29 stockbroking firms employing 700 traders - though as yet there is no formal secondary market in shares. The brokers, operating on what Mr Zolzhargal says are the only dedicated telephone lines in the country, concentrate on channelling the new share issues to investors through an auction system. There is a flourishing trade in the vouchers themselves. Many Mongolians prefer to sell their 7,000 tugrik vouchers for as little as 200 tugriks in cash. The gleaming white interior of the stock exchange, situated in a former children's cinema built by Japanese prisoners of war in 1946, contrasts with the crumbling plaster of most government buildings. The Austrian contractors who refitted it last year for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 985,000) are awaiting payment from a government which can barely afford such symbols. Not all Mongolians share Mr Zolzhargal's enthusiasm. 'There simply are not enough viable factories for everyone to buy,' says Mr Gongorjavin Boshigt, a leading architect of the democratic movement, who has turned businessman. He believes profitable concerns will fall into the hands of rich individuals. He himself has taken advantage of the government's 'small' privatisation scheme, paying 15m tugriks and 3.4m tugriks for two shops sold at a state-run auction last year. Around 90 per cent of small shops and 60 per cent of the country's 25m head of livestock are now in private hands. But few Mongolians are as well off as Mr Boshigt. The average urban wage is around 4,000 tugriks a month, with the tourist exchange rate standing at 250 tugriks to the dollar. Inflation is rampant. The price of bread, which was freed in September, rose from 3 tugriks to 13 in one day. Inflation in 1991 was 120 per cent, and in the first seven months of this year it averaged 14 per cent per month, partly because of the liberalisation of prices. Gross domestic product fell by 9.2 per cent in 1991, and a further contraction of 5 per cent is expected this year. Exports tumbled by 22 per cent and imports by 43 per cent in 1991; in the first seven months of 1992 exports rose by 6.6 per cent and imports fell by 15.7 per cent. Mongolia did 97 per cent of its trade with Comecon countries before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and lack of hard currency on both sides has limited trade and caused severe shortages of essential goods in Mongolia. An acute shortage of oil, formerly supplied by the Soviet Union, has pushed the Mongolian transport system to the brink of collapse. In the first quarter of this year, imports of petroleum virtually ceased amid confusion in negotiations with Russia. A new agreement was struck in June and supplies resumed. Mongolia is dependent on foreign aid to pay for imports of food, energy and spare parts. A meeting of donor countries and organisations in Tokyo last May pledged Dollars 409m of assistance until the end of 1993. Japan is the largest bilateral donor of aid to Mongolia, having granted Y3.8bn (Pounds 20m) so far this year. 'If balance of payments support was not forthcoming this would be a country without heating and supplies, disconnected from the rest of the world,' says Mr Johannes Swietering, resident representative of the United Nations Development Programme in Mongolia. However, he notes an encouraging shift from emergency aid towards project finance. Mongolia, despite its vast size, has a population of only 2m, of whom two-thirds still live in traditional nomadic tents, called yurts. It claims a literacy rate of 98 per cent. Most of its hopes for prosperity are based on unexploited natural resources. British Petroleum and Exploration Associates International, a US company, have carried out feasibility studies for oil development in the eastern Gobi desert. Morrison Knudsen, a US mining concern, has signed an agreement with the Mongolian Bureau of Mines to produce three tonnes of gold annually. Some heights of the Mongolian economy are considered too important to privatise. Among them is the Gobi cashmere factory, which exports 98 per cent of its produce to 14 countries and has annual revenues of Dollars 13m. Unlike much of Mongolian industry, the factory's machines, many of which were donated by the Japanese government in 1977, are not brought to a halt by shortages of energy or spare parts. By contrast, the Mongolian felt industry, which is currently working half-time, is slated for privatisation. The breakdown of a barter arrangement with Poland means the factory no longer has the spare parts and man-made fibres it needs to make felt of export quality. Its product is sold on the domestic market as material for yurts. According to one manager at the felt factory, 'Ordinary people are not interested in the privatisation process. They do not have enough information to judge which factories will make a profit.'</p>

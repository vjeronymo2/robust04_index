			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ECKERSLEY DOESN'T LET STEWART DOWN IN A'S 5-3 VICTORY  </P> <P> The last two times Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland Athletics tried to save a  win for Dave Stewart, he blew the lead and wound up having to save himself.  </P> <P> Eckersley once again was called on to protect a victory for Stewart Thursday  and shut the door on the Texas Rangers for his 33rd save as the A's scored a  5-3 win at Oakland.  </P> <P> "I came out of the shower and heard the score was 5-3," said Stewart (21-9),  who pitched five innings and left with Oakland ahead, 5-0. "I said, 'Oh no!  What happened?' "  </P> <P> Stewart gave up four hits before being relieved in the sixth by Todd Burns, who  pitched two innings and gave way to Matt Young.  </P> <P> Eckersley was called on after Young, who pitched a scoreless eighth inning,  failed to retire a batter in the ninth and Texas scored three times.  </P> <P> Ruben Sierra started the inning for Texas with his 29th homer and got his  club-record 119th run batted in. Pete Incaviglia walked, Mike Stanley tripled  and Eckersley relieved. Scott Coolbaugh hit a sacrifice fly for the final run  before Eckersley retired the side.  </P> <P> Stewart, who will start next Tuesday night in Oakland when the A's open the  playoffs against either Baltimore or Toronto, matched his career high in  victories. His 62 wins over the last three seasons are the most by any pitcher  in the majors.  </P> <P> Dave Parker hit his 22nd homer and singled home a run for the A's, giving him  97 RBIs. The second-inning homer came off Texas starter Brad Arnsberg (2-1).  </P> <P> Boston 12, Milwaukee 6 -- Nick Esasky hit his 30th homer and Rick Cerone added  a two-run shot at Boston as the Red Sox took a one-game lead over the Brewers  in the opening game of their series to determine third place in the AL East.  </P> <P> Boston's Mike Boddicker (15-11) allowed nine hits, including a two-run homer by  Robin Yount, and four runs in five innings. His 15 victories are the most since  he won 20 games for Baltimore in 1983.  </P> <P> The Red Sox pounded Milwaukee starter Don August (12-12) for seven runs on five  hits and four walks in less than three innings.  </P> <P> Seattle 6, Cleveland 2 -- Pinch-hitter Alvin Davis greeted Indian reliever  Jesse Orosco with a tiebreaking two-run double in the eighth inning, and Dave  Valle also doubled home two runs as the Mariners came from behind to win at  Seattle.  </P> <P> Brian Holman (8-10) pitched a six-hitter for his sixth complete game but fell  behind, 2-0, when he allowed home runs to Cleveland's Joel Skinner and Joe  Carter, his 35th.  </P></p>

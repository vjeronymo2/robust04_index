			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 20 (CTK) -- Without a decision by the  U.S. Congress and the U.S. Administration, the Czech Government  cannot make any decisions concerning a lease of the former  federal parliament building to the Radio Free Europe (RFE)  station on a noncommercial basis, Czech Minister Igor Nemec told  reporters today after a government session. Nemec said the U.S.  authorities would have to give their consent to move the radio  station from Munich to Prague and to fund it. Nothing is  changed by the fact that on April 15 the RFE's Board of  Directors and the Liberty radio station recommended the station  to be moved to Prague, Nemec said. He added that RFE will be  moved to Prague only after Congress's decision has been made and  providing it is funded exclusively from the U.S. state budget.    "If RFE were financed from several sources and on a  commercial basis, the Czech Government could not lease the  federal parliament building on a non-commercial basis," Nemec  said.    At present, the building is financed from the state budget.  It costs annually 45 million crowns (about 1.5 million USD).  The Czech Government recently decided that if Congress does not  approve the RFE's move to Prague by the end of April the  parliament building will be leased on a commercial basis.    Nemec said the government had postponed decision-making on  the building three times, as it wanted to comply with RFE's  wishes. The Prague Stock Exchange, the National Museum and  several art institutions have shown interest in using the  building, Nemec said.</p>

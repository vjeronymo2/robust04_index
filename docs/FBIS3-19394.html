			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nevenka Mitrevska report: "Europe Must Not By-Pass the </F> Balkans"]    [Text] Bonn, 15 Mar -- "The Balkans today is a European  anachronism, burdened with the consequences of postcommunism,  with the war problem in the region, but also with repetitions of  the Cold War. A part of the relations among the Balkan  countries is far from today's European reality, burdened with  historical motives, frustrations, and striving to be the top  state. Because of all that it is necessary to Europeanize the  Balkans with a specific European project. By contrast, the  threat of the Balkanization of the other European regions is not  to be underestimated."  <H5>  A Working Visit With All Official Elements </H5>   This is what, among other things, President Kiro Gligorov of  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] stated in his  address to about a hundred politicians, ambassadors, and  journalists, at the rally called "Europe-Dialogue" that is being  held in Bonn for the third time. The subject of this year's  meeting was "The road to Europe -- too many conflicts." Its  participants, among whom were President Gligorov and Slovene  President Milan Kucan, tried to contribute by explaining their  own perspectives, geopolitical positions, and the development of  their own states, to find the roads leading to further  development of Europe, which has been meandering about in the  effort to shape its role, and place, after the fall of the  Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the bloc division.    President Kiro Gligorov arrived in Germany last night, at  the  invitation of the Europe-Dialogue Association, chaired by Madame  Rita Suessmuth, president of the German Bundestag. By its  nature, the visit is in the category of so-called working  visits. However the hosts did their best to give it all the  elements of an official state visit. This afternoon President  Gligorov had a 45-minute talk with German President Richard von  Weizsaecker. For tomorrow morning, meetings and discussions  with Minister-President Johannes Rau and Wolfgang Clement, head  of the State Office of the Federal State of North  Rhine-Westphalia, to which Bonn belongs, are planned. On  Thursday [17 March], the last day of the visit, President  Gligorov will have a meeting with Klaus Kinkel, federal vice  chancellor, in charge of all the foreign political activities in  this preelection period in Germany, since Chancellor Helmut Kohl  is fully engaged in domestic affairs.    Aside from these three central meetings, the program for  President Gligorov comprises a series of contacts with the  leaders of the more important parties in the country, with the  Macedonians living and working in Germany, as well as a tour of  the sights in Bonn, and so on.  <H5>  Danger of a New European Division </H5>   The subject of today's rally only seemingly limited the  issues under debate. The conflict in Bosnia and the danger of  its spreading to the southern Balkans is definitely the most  difficult conflict, but not the only one faced by Europe on the  eve of the new millennium. Freed from the old balance resulting  from the fear generated by the blocs, Europe does not have a  clear vision of how to harmonize and neutralize the other  conflicts that are erupting or threatening to erupt: the ethnic  resurgence and desire for emancipation; the unequal degree to  which the new states are developed economically, democratically,  and judicially; the incongruous spiritual and cultural values  that more or less endanger the civilized achievements of the  European Union. Does the European Union have to transform  itself and be selective and cautious in opening itself only to  the most successful? Do the countries of Central and southern  Europe have to organize themselves into a second Europe, and  Russia into a third -- para-Europe, because the European Union  is closed? In other words, do the old divisions have to be  replaced by new ones, and can Europe embark on the new century  with three or more gears, without it having an impact on the  stabilization and prosperity of the whole continent, including  its most developed part? The hosts wanted to hear the opinions  of their guests, President Kiro Gligorov and President Milan  Kucan, from the south of Europe. The Slovene President hastened  to say that Slovenia was not the Balkans, that it was  geographically, culturally, and spiritually attached to Central  Europe. Therefore, its wish to be integrated in the European  Union was legitimate. President Gligorov replied that,  "contrary to Slovenia, FYROM is in the Balkans, like Greece,  which is already a member of the European Union, and the Balkans  is a part of Europe. The geographical position cannot be a  criterion for including or leaving a country out of the European  integrating movements. There certainly should be criteria, but  they should be sought in the degree of true European orientation  of each country, in its democratic development, in the  promptness with which it applies the principles of civilization  acceptable for Europe. In doing so, some countries will  certainly enter Europe sooner, but others, like FYROM, will  perhaps need 10 to 15 years. Nevertheless it is important to  keep the road to Europe open to all countries."  <H5>  How Can Europe Help </H5>   How can developed Europe, that is the European Union, help  in  the settlement of conflicts like the war in Bosnia, or the  FYROM-Greek dispute, which are direct or indirect threats to its  stability and prosperity? "Europe has clear-cut principles in  the Helsinki documents, and it will do its best to implement  them," President Kiro Gligorov said. "Those principles, for  instance the regulation on not changing borders by force, cannot  be taken pragmatically, as has been the case with Bosnia,  starting from the wrong premise that Bosnia and Herzegovina is  an artificial creation. The territories of this republic never  belonged to the Serbian or the Croat state. Bosnia existed as a  separate entity during the Turkish Empire and also later on,  under Austria and Hungary. Only after the promotion of the  thesis `all Serbs in one state,' or `all Croats in one state,'  did the Muslim population living there turn to a goal it never  sought in the past -- to the formation of its own Muslim state.    ``The division of Bosnia and Herzegovina will lead nowhere  and solve nothing. It will just represent a precedent in which  Europe will open up the possibility for the Balkanization of new  European regions, that is, for changing borders by force, for  new ethnic cleansing and bloodshed.    ``Europe can also solve the FYROM-Greek dispute by a  consistent implementation of its principles. Thus, it will  encourage both sides to implement the same principles in their  mutual relations. This means all problems should be brought to  the negotiating table and an attempt be made to try and solve  them through civilized dialogue. I am convinced we can find  solutions for all the questions burdening our relations through  dialogue. However, those solutions must come as a result of  discussion, of an agreement, of mutual compromises -- without  ultimatums and pressures, without previous conditions.''</p>

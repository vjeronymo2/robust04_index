			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Horsham earnings advance to Dollars 61m HORSHAM Corp, the gold, petroleum and real estate holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk, lifted net earnings to USDollars 61.4m, or 68 cents a share, last year, from Dollars 58.2m, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. The increase was due to a 53 per cent jump in the contribution of American Barrick, the gold producer in which Horsham has a 20 per cent stake. Barrick contributed Dollars 18.4m in earnings as well as a fourth-quarter dilution gain of Dollars 15.5m stemming from a public issue of shares at a price above Horsham's carrying value. A similar dilution gain of Dollars 17.6m was posted during 1990. Horsham also has a 60 per cent stake in Clark Oil &amp; Refining, a St Louis-based petroleum refiner and distributor. Clark contributed Dollars 23m to Horsham last year, down from Dollars 27.7m in 1990. The fall was due to a maintenance programme at one refinery as well as slimmer retail margins. Horsham bought 195 hectares of undeveloped land on the outskirts of Berlin last September, which it plans to develop into a commercial and shopping centre. A company official said yesterday that the project was still in the planning stage, but that the aim was to start construction by the end of the year. The spokesman added that Horsham was also looking at other properties in the Berlin area. DONOHUE, the Quebec newsprint producer, had a final fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 38.5m, or CDollars 1.20 a share, including special charges, compared with a profit of CDollars 7.9m, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Sales fell to CDollars 110m from CDollars 155m last time because of lower pulp and newsprint shipments and weak prices. For all 1991, Donohue's loss was CDollars 58m, or CDollars 1.82 a share, against a profit of CDollars 29.1m, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 470m against CDollars 611m.</p>

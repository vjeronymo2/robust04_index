Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee and governor; and Vice Governors  Zhang Ruifeng, Wang Jiangong, Chen Jianguo and Wu Aiying,  attended the meeting. Zhao Zhihao put forward specific demands  on how to guarantee the fulfillment of various work tasks this  year.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The enterprise, financial,  taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade, pricing, housing  reform and organizational reform measures issued this year have  involved many levels and sectors, with many uncertainties. Only  by going deeply to the reality to conduct investigations and  studies, trying to find out the new situation and thoroughly  grasping the new problems, can we be able to definitely guide  the smooth implementation of reform.    Zhao Zhihao stressed: This year is one for laying a good  foundation for the establishment of the socialist market  economic system. To guarantee the fulfillment of all tasks, we  must give prominence to priorities and grasp the key aspects.  Increasing the income of peasants is the central aspect in  rural work to which we must give a prominent place. We should  grasp the readjustment of internal agricultural structure and  develop high-yield, fine-quality and highly efficient farming  and township enterprises with one hand while grasping the work  of reducing peasants' burdens with the other hand, and guarantee  a great rise in the average per-capita income of peasants this  year. The industrial sector should act in close connection with  the product strategy and regard conducting structural  readjustment, carrying out technological transformation and  increasing efficiency as a priority, guarantee that the  technological transformation tasks defined by the provincial  party committee and government be carried out in places where  needed, and strive to greatly raise our province's product  quality grade, technological content and ratio of products in  the market. In foreign economic and trade work, we should have  new ideas and measures of developing export-oriented economy  under the new situation, expand the scale and sphere of using  foreign capital and guarantee that the creation of foreign  exchange through export will be higher than the whole province's  economic growth rate. The planning and banking work must be  coordinated with the new situation of the country's reform of  the investment and banking systems, grasp the strengthening of  economic development momentum as the major aspect and guarantee  the needs of funds for accelerating development. After the  implementation of the revenue-sharing system, the financial  departments should strive to cultivate financial resources, do a  good job in increasing revenue and reducing expenditures and  increasing investments in some weak aspects, including  agriculture, science, technology, education and social security.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The deeper we have conducted reform  and the more we have developed the market eocnomy, the more we  need to strengthen idological and political work and to  persistently grasp the building of clean politics. In  conducting anticorruption struggle and strengthening the  building of clean politics, on the basis of consolidating the  work achievements of the previous stage, we should make  unremitting efforts to grasp it until good results are achieved.    Vice Governor Chen Jianguo gave a speech on the whole  province's technological transformation.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Swedish spy returns home There was an unexpected twist to Sweden's most notorious cold war spy scandal yesterday when Stig Bergling, who served as a double agent for the Soviet Union in the 1970s, returned home and gave himself up. Bergling was convicted of spying for Moscow and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 but escaped to Finland in 1987 during an unsupervised conjugal visit to his wife. He had been recruited to the security police despite warnings from colleagues that he was unreliable. He was caught after Israeli intelligence services arrested him during a visit to Tel Aviv in 1979. He and his wife were said yesterday to have returned chiefly to resume contact with their children. Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said Bergling would serve out his prison sentence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Hainan, an island  province with a fledgling industrial foundation, is stepping up  its efforts in the construction of industrial parks so as to  inject new vitality into this largest special economic zone in  China.    So far, Hainan has built over 40 industrial parks with a  planned investment of 16.8 billion yuan (about 1.9 billion U.S.  dollars) since it was established as a province six years ago.    At present, some 200 construction projects are underway in  these industrial parks.    Under construction are projects involving machine building,  electronics, light and textile industry, and pharmaceuticals.  These projects are expected to add two billion yuan in output  value and 100 million U.S. dollars in export earnings.    In 1993 the province's industrial output value surpassed  that  of agriculture for the first time in history, turning out 10  billion yuan-worth of products. Industrial parks have played  important roles in this respect.    Drawing experience from Singapore, the Republic of Korea,  Japan and Hong Kong, Hainan is concentrating on large-scale  industrial production, especially by making use of its rich  offshore resources, said Wang Xiaofeng, deputy governor of the  province.    Tourism, processing and transportation as well as  high-value-added tropical agriculture will form the backbone of  Hainan's industry, he added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Honda's Acura Legend introduced a new 3.2L 24-valve V&hyph;6 engine. The difference in this engine over its predecessor is that the intake and exhaust timing, valve lift, and valve diameter are changed to achieve a 30-hp increase to 230 hp at 6,200 rpm, but with peak torque reduced to 206 ft.-lbs. at 5,000 rpm. Fuel economy is virtually unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota's Land Cruiser received a new 4.5L DOHC 24-valve 1FZ&hyph;FE in-line 6-cylinder engine rated at 212 hp at 4,600 rpm and 275 ft.-lbs. of torque at 3,200 rpm. This is a 37 percent increase in horsepower over its MY 1992 counterpart, and the fuel economy improved by 0.5 mpg. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Miller Cycle engine offers a 50-percent gain in torque over conventional engines and gets 10 percent to 15 percent better fuel economy. Mazda announced that it is ready to install a version of the Miller-cycle engine in a near-future high-compression, lean-system piston engine that combines lean burn and the M-Miller cycle. (The M denotes Mazda.) Mazda says the engine, which has a compression ratio of 12:1, will produce 50 percent greater torque than a standard engine. The M-Miller cycle uses a Lysholm compressor jointly developed by Mazda and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (IHI) to boost initial intake pressure, but releases excess air as the piston begins its compression stroke. Mazda plans to introduce this technology in the United States on the Millenia model in the spring of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interest in the 2-stroke engine is declining while interest in direct-injected (DI) gasoline 4-strokes is on the rise. With DI engines, the fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber rather than the intake manifold, which is the general practice on fuel-injected gasoline engines. Reports of poor performance in early 2-stroke Ford Motor Company/Orbital field-test Fiesta models in Europe (Ward's Engine and Vehicle Technology Update, December 15, 1991, p.6) appear to be a factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota indicates that the first DI gasoline engines_termed ``incylinder injection'' by Toyota_will reach the market in late 1993 and will account for over 25 percent of the Japanese manufacturer's gasoline automobile engines by the year 2012. Hyundai developed the company's first internally designed engine, a 1.5L 4-cylinder engine delivering 92 hp at 5,500 rpm and 97 ft.-lbs. of torque at 4,000 rpm. The compression ratio is 10:1. Hyundai's turbocharged version produces 115 hp at 5,500 rpm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

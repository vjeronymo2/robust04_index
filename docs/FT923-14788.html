			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Italy lifts discount rate to stabilise currency THE BANK OF ITALY yesterday raised the discount rate by a full percentage point to 13 per cent to stabilise the lira and fend off devaluation rumours, which triggered heavy speculative selling of the currency late on Friday. The decision came just as an emergency cabinet meeting convened by Italy's new prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, proposed a series of cost-cutting and revenue-raising measures worth L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) to tackle the huge budget deficit. Details of the package, aimed at plugging this year's expected overshoot in government spending which is likely to send the deficit soaring to at least L160,000bn, will be finalised on Mr Amato's return from the Group of Seven summit in Munich later this week. Central bank and government leaders will be waiting to see whether the steps are enough to convince foreign exchange and bond dealers that the new government is determed to maintain the lira's current parity and fight inflation. Speaking on his arrival in Munich, Mr Amato said 'the measures are sure to have positive effects and get us back on the track from which we have strayed.' Mr Amato's government received a boost on Saturday after surviving a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament. Although failing to draw support from beyond the four parties in the previous coalition, the vote removed one of the many uncertainties surrounding the new government. Among the range of measures proposed by the cabinet yesterday were a freeze on public sector prices and a plan to limit public sector wage rises. The government also called for more competition for public sector contracts. Other moves to be taken after Mr Amato's return from Germany could include a sharp increase in petrol duties and rises in other indirect taxes. The Bank of Italy also widened from 1 to 1.5 percentage points the margin between the discount rate and the rate at which it makes fixed-term advances to the banking system. The new rate for advances, which was raised from 12.5 to 13 per cent last month as a first step to help the lira, has now been pushed up to 14.5 per cent. The decision to raise the discount rate, which was last lifted to 12 per cent in December, followed heavy speculative attacks on the lira late on Friday. The lira and the Italian government bond market, which has proved increasingly appealing to foreign investors in recent years, first came under pressure following Denmark's 'no' vote in its referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The outcome cast the European integration process into doubt. Italian bond market, Page 20</p>

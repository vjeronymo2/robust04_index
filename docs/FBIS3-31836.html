			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hajrudin Sermic from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] Maglaj has been going through hell today. The town  is definitely disappearing under the onslaught of several  thousand artillery shells. This afternoon two Luna missiles  were fired at Maglaj, killing and wounding several civilians.  The Maglaj defense lines are also ablaze under the unabated  attacks by masses of equipment, weapons, and manpower coming in  waves. The enemy has been intensifying his attempts to break  through with infantry at Lijesnica, and has been using tanks in  frontal attacks on Plane on the northern part of the front. The  fighters of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade have been resisting  these attacks. It was said here a long time ago that even a  retreat of just one meter would mean deserting the people of  this town to a horrible massacre. That is why the morale, the  will, and the heroism of the Golden Lilies [Bosnia-Herzegovina  flag] are superhuman.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The secretary  general of the new renewal party (Shinseito) of Japan, Ichiro  Ozawa, spoke ill of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in  his recent Fuji TV appearance, openly revealing Japan's design  of reinvasion. This comes under fire in MINJU CHOSON today.    He maliciously slandered the DPRK's political system and  spun  out a string of trash, contending that the DPRK "might take a  military action" and Japan's "countermeasure should be examined"  to cope with [word indistinct] of contingency" on the Korean  peninsula, the analyst says, and goes on:    His remarks are an undisguised provocation aimed at  impairing  the prestige and dignity of the DPRK and stifling Korean-style  socialism centred on the popular masses.    The Japanese reactionaries' nuclear armament has practically  reached a danger line.    It is not without reason that Japanese scholars themselves  admit "Japan is fully prepared to possess nuclear weapons."    It is clear to everybody that if Japan possessed many  nuclear  weapons, it would bring a grave disaster to the Korean people  and other Asian people.    What Ozawa said fully shows what an extent the Japanese  ruling circles' aggressive design on the DPRK has reached.    The Japanese reactionaries are desperately trying to stifle  our socialist system in league with the United States and South  Korea. But it is a foolish act.    They would be well advised to clearly see the situation,  give  up the scheme to [word indistinct] Japanese military power armed  with nuclear weapons and act with discretion.</p>

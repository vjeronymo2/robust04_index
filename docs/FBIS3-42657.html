			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, Doctor of Historical </F> Sciences: "Hurting for the State: Patriotism or Imperial  Ambitions?"]    [Text] As the results of the elections to the Federal  Assembly showed, appearing in the part of the second most  important factor influencing Russians' consciousness--after the  crisis state of the country's economy--was the foreign policy  question. Namely, concerning Russia's present impaired  international position.    The large-scale dismantling of the Russian Federation's  international positions is connected primarily with the collapse  of the Soviet Union. Even as the continuer-state, which has  preserved three-fourths of the territory of the former USSR, but  which has lost 40 percent of its economic potential and half its  population, Russia is not now in a position to lay claim to this  role. In addition, it has found itself without allies and with a  mass of problems on borders dotted like shagreen leather. The  realities are harsh: As a century ago, Russia has been pushed  northeastward and pressed back to the Polar Circle.    The question of the ways of ensuring the country's security  under such unfamiliar conditions simply could not have failed to  have come front stage in domestic policy. But it has been lent  particular seriousness by a number of far from obligatory  derivatives of the process of the "'shrinkage' of Russia's  influence."    Thus, it was difficult from the very outset to explain the  absence of attempts to preserve the tried-and-tested relations  with the former Union republics. It was disheartening that  countries designated new allies permitted themselves to treat us  as the poor relation. They insistently put out flags indicating  the limit of Russia's influence. The absence of its real defense  of the rights of 25 million brothers who speak the same language  and who have come, through no fault of their own, to be outside  its boundaries was disturbing also.    The spontaneous explosion of civil feeling, which had been  hurt to the quick, was a natural human reaction to the  infringement of national dignity. It may be called patriotism,  as do some, or nationalism, as do others, but the main thing  here was the idea of the preservation and affirmation of Russia  as an independent factor in the world system of states--shaped  over centuries, distinctive, and with its own rights and  interests.    It is time for everyone, evidently, the radical democrats  included, to recognize the ponderability of these, it may now  confidently be said, national aspirations. Healthy patriotism is  a natural feeling of any normal citizen who does not have an  urge to unfailingly remake Russia as something else or chop off  its historical roots.    A most important constituent of the international climate  with reference to the Russian Federation on the threshold of the  21st century are primarily its close surroundings. These are now  the countries of the CIS and also traditional neighbors,  primarily in East Europe. Another such most important reality of  the external situation is the circle of industrially developed  countries of the West, primarily the Seven. Its geographical  remoteness does not diminish its influence, particularly when it  acts jointly. All the other force vectors of international life  are for Russia ultimately merely of a secondary, background  nature.    For this reason, the country's cardinal task for the years  ahead should be the encouragement of the lapping and mating of  two most important factors--the close surroundings and the West.  In other words, assurance that they operate in a mode of general  stabilization and consolidation, not follow different courses.  Were Russia to be confronted with an "either-or" choice, and  were it to agree to this, such a development would be for it  tantamount to a major strategic loss.    Russia, if it wishes to remain itself, cannot renounce its  geopolitical and civilizational essence as a power pulling  together the two most populous continents. This uniquely  propitious Eurasian format, which was its cradle and which gave  birth to its greatness, is critically important for it in the  future also, as the link with mother earth for Antaeus. On the  other hand, the end to the confrontation with the West, which  has for the first time in many decades freed up colossal  development potential and which presupposes broad mutually  advantageous cooperation, could be promising as another, new  constant of Russian policy.    Unfortunately, the possibility of firmly establishing such a  stable movement in the future with a foothold in both factors is  not for the Russian Federation today easy. Through, most likely,  no fault of its own.    Does the West need a united and strong Russia? Eschewing a  starry-eyed "yes," there is as yet no simple answer to this  question. There is a dual attitude toward it, regardless of any  ideology which it has, what is more. This was best expressed by  Henry Kissinger. "On the one hand," he wrote in the  INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE after the disintegration of the  USSR, "the tsarist and Soviet empires grew into a constant  threat to the balance of forces along their entire vast  perimeter in Europe, the Far East, and Asia. On the other, these  empires twice saved the independence of the European countries,  inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would  have gained the upper hand."    Thanks for the kind words, as they say, but why, then, the  other theme--"constant threat." Is this not double-dealing? Why  should Russia alone be approached with such prejudiced  yardsticks? The British Empire, which was earlier called such  officially, has now been transformed into a commonwealth headed  by Britain, which is endeavoring to maintain special relations  among its members. But no one is rushing to take a stab at the  imperial ambitions of the British. France similarly grouped its  former colonies in a community of Francophone countries, and no  one reproaches it for this. Finally, the United States, which  back in 1823 declared the Western Hemisphere to be the sphere of  its special interests (the Monroe Doctrine), adheres today to  the same policy, although, let us be plain, far from everyone  agrees with this.    Yet in all three cases it is a question of great powers  considering it useful to unite around them countries located  here thousands and even tens of thousands of kilometers away, as  a rule. It would seem that people would like to deny Russia, on  the other hand, the right to have immediate surroundings that  are favorable to it--a viable Commonwealth of Independent  States. But this is a double standard. Whoever wishes to be our  dependable partner must recognize that the Russian Federation  seeks not exceptional but equal and commensurate conditions of  development. Russians would not understand anything else.    In order to avoid unacceptable discrimination, it is  essential that Russia cleave properly but firmly to a course  whose essence is that it is not an inferior object, but a  ponderable subject of international policy. This means that it  also may--by political methods and a basis that is voluntary for  the other participants--form external surroundings, close  surroundings even more, which are friendly toward it and which  are developing constructively. As, for example, is being done by  the United States, which has formed together with Mexico and  Canada the common North American free trade zone.    Of course, Russia's actions in this plane must be  comprehensible to its partners near and far and instill trust in  them. But Russia also is entitled to expect the understanding  and trust of others. It is in the achievement of such a  two-in-one goal that the art of the foreign policy and diplomacy  of a truly great power lies. Here also lies the difference  between patriotism and imperial ambitions.</p>

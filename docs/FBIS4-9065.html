			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- Czech  President Vaclav Havel today refuted journalists' speculations  that the absence of Premier Vaclav Klaus at a joint dinner of  the seven Central European presidents on Friday [15 April] was  caused by the tension allegedly existing between him and Klaus.    Havel told CTK at a press conference at the close of the  summit that, in a telephone call with him on Thursday, Klaus  excused himself, arguing that he was not quite well and had to  prepare for a trip to South America.    "I have no reason whatsoever to look for a different  background to this," Havel said, adding that none of the  presidents commented on Klaus' absence because none of them were  accompanied by a premier.    Journalists present considered Klaus' absence to be one of  the most interesting aspects of the summit. Speculations were  being spread whether a mere personal problem, probably  concerning the division of powers, was behind Klaus's gestures  or whether another, deeper meaning should be searched for.    First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra and Parliament  Chairman Milan Uhde were also invited to attend the meeting.  Uhde excused himself because of a very important meeting in  Velka Bites, south Moravia, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek  said.</p>

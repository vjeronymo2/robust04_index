			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto received Golkar party participants  at a technical workshop sponsored by the Fisheries and  Agriculture Department in Tapos, Bogor yesterday. He said  Indonesia should work hard during the upcoming Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation, APEC, summit so Indonesia and the other  developing nations will benefit from decisions reached by the  developed nations at that summit.    He also stated that Indonesia will not make superfluous  requests during the upcoming APEC summit because Indonesia and  the other developing nations have never suffered any losses as a  result of the decisions taken by the developed nations.  President Suharto, however, cited an example where the recent  decisions taken by the developed nations caused the appreciation  of the Japanese yen. Indonesia did not benefit from that  decision because it now has to eke out an additional U.S.$2  billion for its loan repayments as a result of the yen  appreciation.    The upcoming APEC summit, which is scheduled to be held in  Bogor in the middle of November, is considered appropriate for  Indonesia because it will involve developed industrial countries  and their developing counterparts.    Speaking during a dialogue session with Golkar party  participants to the workshop session, the head of state said  that Golkar need not make any request for added funds for  state-owned agencies. According to President Suharto, the party  has sufficient funds in state-owned agencies, which range from  one to 15 percent, meant for small-scale entrepreneurs.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / MPs give Soley bill on press second reading THE PRIVATE member's bill introduced by Labour MP Mr Clive Soley which seeks to establish an independent press authority for newspapers and periodicals was given a second reading by 119 votes to 15 in the Commons yesterday. The bill, which aims to secure 'due accuracy', has only a remote chance of reaching the statute book because of the number and scope of amendments that have to be considered during the line-by-line committee stage. In response to questions at a press conference Mr Soley, MP for Hammersmith, warned newspaper editors that unless they co-operated in getting 'something like my bill' on the statute book they risked legislation on privacy without any counter-balancing measure on press freedom. Mr Soley also underlined his willingness to accept amendments supporting press freedom. The bill was described as 'premature and misconceived' by Mr Robert Key, the junior heritage minister. He nevertheless reaffirmed the government's dissatisfaction with the existing Press Complaints Commission. Mr Key made clear that ministerial reluctance to establish a statutory regulatory body, as recommended by Sir David Calcutt in his recent report, did not mean that it had been ruled out. The government will take into account press response to Sir David's criticisms and the views expressed in the debate on the bill and in the forthcoming report by the Commons heritage committee on privacy and media intrusion before reaching conclusions about a statutory regulatory body. Earlier Mr John Major, the prime minister, said his decision to issue writs for libel against two magazines concerning reports about his private life had not affected his decision not to support the bill.</p>

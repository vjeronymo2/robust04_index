			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Money worries The Bundesbank was never likely to cut interest rates yesterday, with December M3 money supply growing at an annualised rate of 8.1 per cent. It matters little that the figure was badly distorted, or that the underlying news on inflation and wages is good, or even that the D-mark has been more stable in exchange markets recently. The bank could not announce a money supply figure so far above target and then cut rates without serious loss of credibility. What is less clear is whether money supply was the only factor holding it back. The international interest rate trend has become difficult to read as market rumours intensify of a possible Federal Reserve tightening. Talk yesterday that such action was imminent damped US financial markets. It also unsettled others, including the UK, which had run up earlier in anticipation of another round of European interest rate cuts. The Fed's intentions are, of course, by no means certain and the current US inflation picture does not suggest a need for urgent action. When it does come, though, the exchange market impact of a Fed tightening will inevitably make the Bundesbank more circumspect. Even if the Bundesbank is simply worried about the money supply, nothing is likely to happen before the next council meeting that would make it change its mind on rates. Its cautious pace may thus continue to disappoint. A UK rate cut looks even more remote, especially since the latest reserve figures suggest the authorities prefer to counter sterling strength by intervention.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / EC seeks closer policy ties with eastern Europe THE European Commission is proposing to involve the EC's central European allies in common European foreign policy-making. It also wants to hold enlarged meetings of the EC Council of Ministers with them on trans-European collaboration in energy, environment, transport and telecommunications policy. The proposal, in a confidential Commission report discussed by EC foreign ministers over lunch on Tuesday, will be put to the 12 heads of government at tomorrow's Edinburgh summit. It goes further than before in trying to draw the Community's eastern neighbours into European integration, and is clearly intended to signal that the EC remains outward-looking despite the crisis over the Maastricht treaty. The root idea in the new Commission paper on eastern Europe retrieves EC external affairs commissioner Frans Andriessen's 1991 proposal on associate membership of the Community for east and central European states intending to join the EC. The idea is to offer these countries a stake in the European union foreseen by Maastricht, in advance of full membership. The front-running EC candidates in central Europe - the Czechs, Hungarians and Poles - are thought to need a decade more to restructure their economies before they could assume the competition obligations of the EC's single market. In the meantime, the Commission paper argues that the EC must speed up their access to its market for goods such as food, steel and textiles, in which eastern Europe has a comparative advantage. The Commission says the EC should formally accept the east Europeans as applicants, arguing that this would stimulate economic reform and investment, and 'discourage excessive nationalism'. The so-called 'Europe accords' the EC has with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and which it is exploring with Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, only state that these countries see moves towards a free trade zone with the EC as a stepping stone to membership. The Commission advocates that the first three countries should be involved in working groups and as observers at certain meetings of the 12 on foreign policy. It suggests that this relationship could deepen as the EC develops a fully-fledged common foreign and security policy as prescribed by Maastricht. The second main proposal is to let east European ministers sit in EC councils discussing environment, transport and infrastructure policy of common interest - though it hedges on whether they would be allowed to vote. Mr Andriessen said on Tuesday these ideas were 'very well-received' by EC foreign ministers.</p>

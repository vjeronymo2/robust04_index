			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Divisions ease path in France for EC treaty DEEP divisions in the ranks of France's opposition conservative parties yesterday seemed to promise the government a comfortable majority on its bill to revise the French constitution, as the prelude to ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The leadership of the right-wing Gaullist party put forward four amendments to the bill in the hope of presenting a united front with the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping. But former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, swung the prospects for the vote by breaking ranks with his ostensible Gaullist allies and advocated a Yes vote in Parliament. Ultimately, almost all of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's party, and all of the Centrists, were likely to vote with the government because they are in favour of European integration and the Maastricht treaty. Mr Giscard d'Estaing cut through the Gaullists' procedural manoeuvering, which was set to delay a vote until late last night or today, by dissociating himself from two of their four amendments. The Folketing yesterday approved the Maastricht treaty on European union by 120 votes in favour to 25 against with one abstention, Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen. The treaty will be submitted for approval to a popular referendum on June 2. The referendum result will be binding on the Folketing.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CALDERON SEATED IN COSTA RICA  </P> <P> A 41-year-old lawyer from a prominent political family took over as president  today in the long shadow of Oscar Arias Sanchez, who thrust this country into  the global spotlight with his regional peace efforts.  </P> <P> Incoming President Rafael Calderon Fournier acknowledged his predecessor's  international renown but said he will concentrate on internal affairs --  without giving short shrift to foreign policy.  </P> <P> Arias spearheaded Central American peace efforts that promoted democracy and  sought an end to civil wars. He won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting a  regional peace plan.  </P> <P> Although originally thrilled with Arias' fame, many Costa Ricans have now come  to feel that he gained it at their expense -- by ignoring domestic problems.  Even so, he leaves office with an approval rating of 90%.  </P></p>

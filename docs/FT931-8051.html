			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Dead pop lives] NOW THAT contemporary pop music is dead, killed off by boredom, raves and a healthy teenage rejection of the established, we can enjoy ourselves indulging in the best of pop's past. After all, other art forms have long feasted off dead poets, dead artists, dead composers. So a warm welcome for the B-52s, a transitory star which flashed across the pop firmament around 1980. They have been London's rave from the grave this week at the Hammersmith Apollo. The B-52s' specialised in arty trash. Everything about them was designed mildly to titillate the style set. They were from Athens - Athens, Georgia, wouldn't you know. Their name has nothing to do with bombers (although it enables them to swoop around the stage arms akimbo playing planes) but with the beehive hair style de rigueur in the late 1970s. Their music was new wave disco but secondary to their on-stage antics. These were built around two girl singers with competing bouffants, come-on gestures, and clothes grabbed from a fancy dress chest, prized apart by the decidely camp Fred Schneider. The B-52s enjoyed their brief flutter of fame but then resurfaced in the late 1980s. They are a cult, but a big one. If anything they have now over-dosed on the kitsch. The ultimate B-52s' movie would be Hairspray out of Twin Peaks. So no surprise that hair styles feature prominently in the new stage show and that they have recruited Julee Cruise, the breathy singer from Twin Peaks, to be one of the bimbos. In a black bunny suit, peroxide hair, she grinds and pouts and postures like a try-out for the Kit Kat Club. In contrast veteran Kate Pierson looks like a sedate Barbie Doll. Most mesmerising of all is Schneider. Weighed down by silver chains, he is the lawyer who has decided to come out of the closet at the firm's Christmas party. There is a 'I know this is ridiculous but this is the real me' expression on his po-face as he runs through the B-52s repertoire of very silly songs, from 'Hot Pants Explosion' to 'Loveshack'. The appeal of the B-52s is that they know it is tacky but they are not going to crack up. Pretending to be lobsters with their one smash hit 'Rock Lobster', or Wilson, Keppell and Betty in 'Mesopotamia', is a serious business, and it is their integrity which makes it wholly enjoyable. Above all the B-52s are fun.</p>

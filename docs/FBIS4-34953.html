			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "The End of the Occupation of Diplomatic </F> Buildings"]    [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (PL) -- The recent departure from the  Chilean Consulate of all the Cubans who had been occupying it  and the departure of some of the people who had been occupying a  Belgian diplomatic building here are apparently serving to  expedite a conclusion to an episode that was more the result of  manipulation than desperation.    According to official sources, the incidents during which  more than 100 citizens forcefully entered the residence of the  Belgian ambassador, approximately 20 other persons entered the  German Embassy, and 10 persons entered the Chilean Consulate  some weeks ago were the products of a "clumsy political  manipulation" by enemies of the revolution.    The forcible entries into those missions took place just  before and during the celebration of the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and one occurred on the  day Mexican President Carlos Salinas was to arrive in Cuba.  Local authorities viewed this forcible entry as a calculated  provocation.    The incidents at the Chilean Consulate took place on 15  June,  the day before President Fidel Castro's scheduled meeting with  Chilean President Eduardo Frei in the Colombia city.    Considering the need to guarantee the security of the  missions accredited to the island and to keep these methods from  being systematically used as a way of leaving the country, the  Cuban Government has declared that it will not grant a departure  permit to anyone who enters a diplomatic installation by force,  even if that person later leaves the facility.    The Foreign Ministry announced this position, which allows  for no exceptions, and reiterated that such actions are promoted  from abroad for political propaganda reasons. The ministry  added that the people who carry out such actions suffer no  political persecution but are motivated by familial, individual,  and economic considerations, and some by a spirit of adventure.    PRENSA LATINA has interviewed people who have permits to  travel to the United States but who are awaiting U.S. visas.  They complain about unjustified visa refusals, which, in their  opinion, leads some people, especially the young, to resort to  illegal departures or to forceful entries at diplomatic missions.    The Foreign Ministry declaration states that the local  authorities have adopted a position which has been backed by  persuasive actions aimed at making the occupants leave the  buildings. These persuasive actions have been adopted jointly  with the involved diplomats. The local authorities' position  was adopted as an expression of Cuba's goodwill toward the  governments negatively affected by the situation and to  facilitate a quick solution to the problem.    Government sources have reported that there are 72 persons  in  the Belgian Embassy (53 have already left and resumed their  daily lives without difficulties) and 21 in the German Embassy,  who have stubbornly refused to abandon their stance, which has  been described as illegal and irresponsible.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitold Pavlovych Fokin, president of the </F> Ukrainian International Fund of Humanitarian and Economic  Relations With the Russian Federation, by Lyudmila Menzhulina;  place and date not given; names as transliterated: "Vitold  Fokin: `It Is Useless To Try To Pull the Scanty Blanket of  Social Protection Over Everyone. There Is Only One Way Not To  Freeze--Get Moving'"]    [Text] The announcement concerning the establishment  in Ukraine of the International Fund of Humanitarian and  Economic Relations With the Russian Federation has already made  the rounds of practically all radio, television, and newspaper  editorial offices. The restraint of the commentaries on the fact  was absolutely amazingly offset by the tone of voice of the  announcers, or by the style of exposition of the journalists. So  one heard or read a suppressed: "Well, at last!"    It goes without saying that, although the unnatural  confrontation of our countries and peoples is brief in an  historical space of time, it has frayed nerves, and it has very  strongly dampened spirits.    Now people are continually calling up and are asking  with what and how they can assist the development of the new  fund, and they are placing great hopes on it.    But, apparently, not only hopes. Some are also  tormented by doubts. Has not its ex-prime minister conceived of  returning Ukraine to the old times? Vitold Pavlovich himself  explained during the meeting how during the presentation of the  fund he had received a note (the only one of its kind) whose  author--a people's deputy--was amazed by everything: From the  number of stars in the emblem to the title. He was almost ready  to accuse the founders of the new formation of espionage in  favor of Russia, and he did not at all share the happiness of  those in attendance.    In general, our extensive conversation today with the  ideological inspirer, creator, and president of the fund, Vitold  Pavlovich Fokin, was prompted both by good wishes and harsh  necessity. We will also construct it in the same key,  alternating the free and easy interview "with a line of  protocol," that is to say, a document that is a report on the  triumph of the presentation.    But, then, whatever one sees in this--nostalgia or very  sound and timely thoughts--let it be a matter that is left to  the readers. Thus....  <H5>  "Has Life Really Improved Because We Destroyed the Bastille?" </H5>   [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, first of all, accept the  sincerest greetings that arrive at the editorial office for you  as the head of the fund, and wishes for its prosperity. Now  allow me to ask, with what kind of wonderful forces were you  able in such a short period of time (on 16 November, we reported  on the constituent meeting, and already the registration and  presentation have taken place) to start such a grandiose  undertaking--the International Fund for Humanitarian and  Economic Relations With the Russian Federation?"    [Fokin] You know, it would be biased to say that this idea  arose just now and was instantly implemented. The story here is  not simple, like everything else that has occurred here in  recent times.    When the first government of an independent Ukraine was  replaced, the relations between the structures of the executive  authority of Ukraine and Russia were noticeably "strained." I do  not want to blame anyone personally, but statements of  gentlemen--who got into key positions in the Cabinet of  Ministers on the "general list"--began to be leaked more and  more frequently to the press. I do not think that this was being  done, as they say, out of stupidity. They were guided more  frequently by a desire to do what was in vogue and to curry  favor with influential politicians, who by virtue of clear  reasons were unable to comprehend the complicated interweaving  of the mutual production ties that had developed over dozens of  years between the subjects of Ukraine and Russia.    Some of the mass media organs of both countries also  prospered in this unseemly matter.    And then at that time, the end of last year, the thought  occurred: Voluntary self-isolation and the policy of  autonomization of production do not respond to the national  interests of the state. You must not, as Englishmen say, throw  stones at your neighbor if you yourself live in a glass house.  By curtailing the export of products to Russia and violating an  already strained payments balance with that country, it is  impossible to count on the stable delivery to Ukraine of oil,  gas, lumber materials, and other products. Such actions make an  energy crisis inevitable. Cooperative ties must not be  disrupted--this will lead only to a complete shutdown of  enterprises. Is it really possible not to take a real fact into  consideration: Only 20 percent of the total number of industrial  enterprises of Ukraine have a closed production cycle?    And further. The entire world is fighting for sales markets.  But we pass off as a great achievement the reduction of exports  to Russia of such types of products that are traditional for  Russia as, for example, sugar. The world market is oversaturated  with favorite commodities, and Russia, having overcome some  bewilderment, has renewed contracts and begun to receive sugar  from other importers. What did Ukraine win from this?  Discussions about the fact that Russia allegedly switched to  mutual settlements at world prices in a unilateral procedure  also seem to be idle talk. It is enough to look over the  protocols of the summit meeting in Dagomys to become convinced  of the opposite.    In short, it became clear as early as in December of last  year that without close cooperation with enterprises and  organizations of Russia, and without an honest and businesslike  partnership on a principally new and mutually beneficial basis,  the newly constituted government (like, moreover, any other)  will not be able to lead the state out of the crisis.  <H5>  From V. Fokin's Report at the Presentation of the Fund </H5>   To our great regret, the political and economic differences  between Ukraine and Russia are becoming more noticeable of late.  The states are literally drifting in opposite directions. This  is equally unsafe for the people of both countries and is  equally negatively perceived by the people. Therefore, it is  necessary to adopt the most decisive measures so that what is  still a small crack does not become an abyss.    That which we have today--cooled-down blast furnaces, idle  rolling mills, stalled motor vehicles, curtailed television  programs--all of this will also turn into a misfortune for  Russian enterprises as well.    I believe in the courage and selflessness of our people, and  in their ability to overcome difficulties and to defend their  statehood. But is it moral to rely only on the infinite patience  of the people? Let us recall history.    "You have achieved what you wanted," the Parisians told the  leaders of the great French Revolution, "but what did we get out  of it? Has life really gotten better because we destroyed the  Bastille?"    Substitute the word "Commonwealth" for the word "Bastille,"  and this question will sound quite pressing. However, it is not  a question of reviving old ties, and it is not about  resurrecting the former state structures and the "fraternal  embrace" imposed from above. It is impossible to restore them.  It is necessary to establish principally new relations whose  basis will be economic expediency, mutual gains, reciprocal  trust, and an honest partnership.    Not one government is capable of achieving this without  public support. The unity and goodwill of the entire society is  necessary for this.  <H5>  There Are Questions.... </H5>   [Menzhulina] A great number of all kinds of treaties and  agreements were adopted during the period of the creation of the  CIS. What was the problem, and why did they not work for unity  and mutually advantageous contacts?    [Fokin] Initially, the treaty on cooperation of the  independent states provided for the creation of a kind of  coordination center, with its quarters in the capital of  Belarus--Minsk. After a certain time, this was rejected for  well-known reasons. Therefore, the state agreements and treaties  that were being concluded on a bilateral and multilateral basis  lost even a minimum capability of functioning, inasmuch as there  was a lack not only of a mechanism of responsibility, but even  control over its fulfillment. In addition, Russia, while  conducting a policy of rapid destatization and privatization,  more than two years ago abandoned the practice of the state  order, thereby losing (in contrast to Ukraine) the right to  conclude a treaty concerning mutual deliveries, inasmuch as it  stopped being the de facto owner of produced products. In  general, this also led to this kind of conclusion: Cooperation  between two states, basically, should move to the plane of  business partnership of enterprises and organizations.    This is what was done in practice. After the elimination of  the central planning and distribution organs, economic life  continued only where production ties between enterprises were  preserved.    By creating the fund, its founders were not thinking of  replacing the government, and especially of operating counter to  its decisions. Our task is to assume functions that are not  peculiar to the state under the new economic conditions. First  and foremost, to assist the producer irrespective of the form of  ownership. Retaining for itself the right of legislative  initiative, we will submit appropriate drafts to the government  for examination.  <H5>  From the Report at the Presentation </H5>   It is becoming more and more difficult to link up our  production, financial, and state interests. We are already at  different levels. Russia, in spite of serious political and  social shocks, has moved much farther along the path of reform.    A majority of the large enterprises have been converted to  joint-stock companies. Practically the entire population has  been involved in this. The securities market is working  energetically, and this is one of the most important indices of  the market economy. The actual convertibility of the ruble is  stimulating small and average business.    Important changes are occurring in the psychology of the  people. Russia's public is already thinking in new categories.  Therefore, it is becoming more and more difficult for a  director, for example, of a Ukrainian state plant to conduct  negotiations with his own Russian partner--the head of a  joint-stock company.    But it is necessary and possible to overcome difficulties.  Labor collectives of former subcontractors remain, and directors  are left who know their colleagues from what now already are  neighboring countries, and they maintain friendly relations with  them. They have all felt the effects of the artificially  violated cooperation on their own problems.    That is why the idea of the creation of a nongovernmental  organization that would speak in support of the intensification,  coordination, and development of Ukrainian-Russian relations  immediately found an enormous number of supporters.    Organizing business relations and close partnership with the  Russian Federation in the most diverse spheres of human endeavor  is an objectively recognized necessity.  <H5>  "Every Fruit Should Ripen" </H5>   [Menzhulina] Did you not have problems with registering the  fund? I wonder what response the idea on its creation had "at  the top?"    [Fokin] From time to time, I did not want to disclose my  intention. I was not confident that I would be supported if I  came out in March or April. At that time, everyone was going  around with raised spirits and satisfied that they had got  through the winter and finished the sowing. They could have  said: Why do we need this fund, which directs its own activity  at the creation of production and economic relations with  Russia, when we also were not born yesterday?    Now, this will not be said. And not only because a real  threat hangs over millions of socially unprotected citizens of  Ukraine.    I hope that there will be no starvation. The state does have  grain. But it is impossible to live day by day. It is necessary  to think about the coming year, about work under winter  conditions, and to organize a normal, decent life. Under these  conditions, I think, with the help of the fund, it will be  possible to arrive at a resolution of many problems.    When I acquainted the president with my desire, I  immediately  met with his approval, and I felt support. Leonid Makarovich  read the first variant of the charter and appended his  resolution: The matter is very interesting, worth doing, and it  is necessary to implement it as rapidly as possible. Specialists  of the Ministry of Justice and Minister V.V. Onopenko himself  gave us good support. Despite substantial remarks, corrections,  and additions, there was no barrier against registration. The  constituent assembly was conducted just as quickly and  effectively.    [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, could you outline the circle  of friends of the fund from the Ukrainian and Russian sides?    [Fokin] Clearly, the leaders of the most competent and  largest organizations and enterprises had the final say. I am  extremely grateful to Boris Yevgenyevich Paton, Larisa Ivanovna  Khorolets....    We were supported by the metallurgists and machine builders  and, moreover, by the workers and leadership of such flagships  of industry as Yuzhmash, the Malyshev Plant, Luganskteplovoz,  the Dnepropetrovsk electric locomotive building plant, the NPO  [scientific production association] imeni Korolev, the Kiev  radio plant, and many others.    All at once, a circle of like-thinkers took shape: Gennadiy  Petrovich Levchenko, Vladimir Ilich Kassov, Yuriy Sergeyevich  Alekseyev, Bogdan Nikolayevich Lishchin, Dmitriy Gavrilovich  Topchiy.... Well, I cannot name all of them.    The founders of the fund from Russia were: The Russian  Lumber  Producers Corporation, the Izhevsk joint-stock company Bummash  and the joint-stock company Investles, the Krasnoyarsk machine  building plant, the Kotlass pulp and paper combine, and others.  <H5>  "If There Is Grain, There Will Be Singing" </H5>   [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, the founding documents assign  first place to humanitarian relations, but life's realities are  such that the economy, nevertheless, comes first. Does this mean  that economic relations will have priority?    [Fokin] There is a saying among the people: If there is  grain, there will be singing. Of course, a nation cannot exist  without spirituality and culture. But the economy really comes  first, because society, as long as it exists, is compelled to  consume. But this also means, to produce. As soon as this chain  is broken, catastrophe is inevitable.    [Menzhulina] If you were the head of government today and  someone established such a fund, how would you perceive this?    [Fokin] But of course, I would support such an idea and  would  bring the initiators closer, and I would grant them broad  powers. I also expect the same attitude from the present  government. I am glad that the Cabinet of Ministers has already  demonstrated its goodwill, at least by the fact that it was  almost fully represented at the presentation.    But we are only at the start of a long path. There is a sea  of difficulties.    For the time being, we have no material base, we have no  place to quarter ourselves, and we have not established a  charter fund. But, as the saying goes, there is a time for  everything. It is important now to understand and to adopt  objectively: The fund is created, it exists, and it has begun to  work.  <H5>  From the Report at the Presentation </H5>   One of the reasons for the critical condition of many  enterprises and organizations is the artificially created  barriers for ways to process payment documents. One of our tasks  is to be a reliable helper of the commodity producers in the  resolution of this problem. I think that we are capable of  removing this tension, at least partially, from the members of  the fund.    For this purpose, a specially designated bank credit system  will be established jointly with Russian partners.    The fund intends to offer material and methodical assistance  to state organizations and representatives of the private sector  of the economy engaged in the creation of new capacities and  increasing the existing capacities of functioning industries  that produce industrial and household and cultural commodities.    We will conduct a purposeful search for partners for the  development of projects of destatization, privatization, and  conversion to joint-stock companies. Appropriate proposals will  be submitted to government structures. The fund is preparing to  finance the work of expert groups whose members will be leading  specialists of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries.    We also have one extraordinary function--to perform as the  guarantor of the founders. The fund has already today united the  enormous scientific-intellectual and financial-material  potential that its founders possess. With time, they will be  joined by new social and scientific organizations, industrial,  construction, and transport enterprises, and by the agrarian  economy. I do not doubt that this will be of interest not only  to domestic, but also to foreign investors.    The fund will also be able to assist in the resolution of  such a complicated problem as providing consumers with  electricity.    We are not relying very much on the effectiveness of  interstate relations on this question. It seems that a program  of investment of the energy complex of Russia on joint ownership  rights is significantly more effective.    We are also setting ourselves the task of collecting and  disseminating truthful and objective information about the  condition of social life in Ukraine. It is no secret that of  late both the Ukrainian and Russian mass media seem to be  competing in prejudices. And for this, it is not at all  mandatory to misinterpret or distort facts. It is enough to  permit only those reports on the air or in newspaper columns  that carry in themselves a frankly negative charge. The  constituent conference discussed the question of publishing  Ukrainian newspapers in Russia. With time, proposals will be  studied regarding the establishment of general Ukrainian-Russian  information agencies--television and radio channels.    Several words regarding the liberalization of foreign  economic relations. It is not a great honor to be a dependent.  Therefore, in directing the activity of the fund, we will  acquire the understanding and support of world opinion, close  cooperation with all international states, and public,  religious, and of other organizations that are considering  overcoming the crisis situation in Ukraine, raising the standard  of living, and creating conditions for the democratic  transformation of our society as a problem of international  significance, and as a guarantee of peace and security in Europe.    Our fund also has a humanitarian direction. The difficulties  of the transition period are hitting first and foremost public  education and health services specifically. Therefore, among the  main tasks of the fund is real support of the social and  cultural sphere.  <H5>  In Place of an Epilogue </H5>   [Menzhulina] Vitold Pavlovich, our readers would not  understand us if we passed over the question in our interview  with you about today's alarming situation. Ukraine and its  people are literally feverish from inescapable problems. In your  opinion, as a former head of the government, where is the error,  and wherein lies a possible solution?    [Fokin] The main thing is to preserve peace and unity, and  to  work for the future. That which we now hear from various  sides--protests, warnings about possible strikes, reproaches  directed at the leadership of the country--all of this,  unfortunately, is not groundless. But it is necessary to display  self-restraint and lawfulness, and we must support the new  elections to parliament. Of course, the situation is very  difficult for the leaders of trade unions and the workers'  movement. Their sacred duty is to defend the interests and to  achieve the social protection of all elements of society, but,  first and foremost, of the workers. And nevertheless, while  insisting on an increase in wages, they must understand that it  is impossible to pull a very short blanket over everyone. The  state is not in a condition to protect all members of society  equally. I, in principle, support the plan of the Cabinet of  Ministers to develop a program of national salvation, if it only  determines who specifically the state should take under its  guardianship. I am convinced that this is pensioners, invalids,  children in large families, servicemen, and student youth.  Scientific, cultural, health servicing, and educational  organizations retain a special status. Only they have a right to  enjoy subsidies from the budget. And even the super-important  branches of production should not receive any kind of subsidy.  At the same time, the focus should be placed on the regional  organs of administration. And the budget should be developed  from below, taking into account the local requirements and  capabilities for social protection. The national salvation  budget can be developed in half a year with a breakdown into  quarters.    As for able-bodied citizens, let them not be offended by me,  they will have to work with blood and sweat--apparently there is  not enough "blanket" for them. They will have to work like the  people worked in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and other  countries. No one there measured the duration of a work week.  There was no other way out. As it is here now.    [Begin boxed item] From the Congratulatory Letters of  the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia to the Fund Founders    "Ukraine attaches exceptional significance to the  development  of multilateral and equal relations with all countries of the  world and at all levels: interstate, interdepartmental, and  between individual people, organizations, and enterprises. But  it is my profound conviction that we should have special  partnership relations with Russia. Therefore, achievement of the  objectives that the fund has set for itself--to promote the  improvement and development of Ukrainian-Russian ties on a  nongovernmental level and in the humanitarian, economic, and  ecological spheres--will, undoubtedly, be very useful for the  strengthening of mutual understanding, friendship, and  all-around cooperation between Ukraine and the Russian  Federation.    "I sincerely congratulate your founders on the initiation of  activity.    [Signed] Leonid KRAVCHUK"  <H5>  * * * </H5>   "I think that your fund, by uniting its efforts with the  Fund  of Humanitarian and Economic Cooperation With Ukraine that is  now being formed in Russia, can bring many benefits.  Communications between the citizens of our countries and the  development of Russian-Ukrainian economic contacts and ties are  really capable of bettering the life of the people.    "I sincerely congratulate you and all of the participants in  the fund with its presentation, and I wish you great success.  With a profound belief in friendship between Russia and Ukraine.    [Signed] Boris Yeltsin"[End boxed item]</p>

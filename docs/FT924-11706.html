			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Receivers in at Harland Simon as talks fail HARLAND Simon, the control systems company suspended on the stock exchange since last month, has been placed in receivership by its bankers. The joint administrative receivers are Mr Nick Lyle and Mr Roger Powdrill of Touche Ross, writes Angus Foster. Harland has been negotiating a restructuring and financing levels with its bankers, mainly Barclays, since the share suspension, but the company's proposals have been turned down. The receivership will hit 20 jobs in the holding company with 800 jobs at stake in the operating subsidiaries. Harland's problems began in February when it issued a profits warning, leading to a slump in the share price. Following the resignation of chairman Mr Roy Ashman and a decision to sell several subsidiaries, Harland announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m in the year to March 31. Losses included exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.1m to cover bad debts and loss making subsidiaries. The shares, which traded at 585p in February, had collapsed to 20p when they were suspended.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Focus on sterling There was little sign of the pressure on sterling within the European monetary system abating last week and currency analysts are not expecting any relief this week, writes Simon London. Having opened on Monday morning at DM2.8550, the UK currency declined inexorably to a low of DM2.83 on Thursday night. On Friday, sterling closed higher at DM2.84 but was soon dragged back to DM2.8350 in New York trading. Significantly, the weakness of sterling took place both when the dollar was falling and surging later in the week. Analysts noted that a rally in the dollar is no longer sure to benefit the pound against other European currencies. The woes of the UK currency could potentially increase with the release this week of the first serious UK economic statistics of 1992. On Tuesday, producer price inflation figures for December are due, followed by unemployment figures on Thursday and retail price inflation on Friday. A nasty surprise from any one of these figures could potentially deepen the gloom for the UK economy, government and currency. On a more optimistic view, bad news is already factored into sterling's price. Figures brighter than expected could relieve some of the pressure. In addition, there were signs on Friday that the D-Mark was weakening following calls for lower rates from distinguished German economists. This week, retail sales and inflation figures will be released in Germany. These could be crucial in determining the future of sterling, potentially more than the UK economic statistics, by giving a pointer to how long German interest rates must remain at current high levels - in conflict with the economic cycle in most of the rest of Europe.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Re-enter the dragon of controversy: The latest allegations to swirl around the Welsh Development Agency This is the Welsh Development Agency. The office is now closed,' began the recorded telephone message yesterday morning at the agency's Pearl House headquarters, a landmark 18-storey building in central Cardiff. An extended bank holiday might have come as a relief to the beleaguered staff at the government-funded agency, as it faces yet another brouhaha over the way it is run. On the other hand, its answerphone message might be symbolic of its clouded future - even if closure itself is not on the agenda. Morale at the agency, responsible to the Welsh Office for promoting economic development in Wales and improving the physical environment, is low. 'Everyone is confused,' said one insider. 'Every time there is something positive, there is then another knocking story.' The latest allegations centre on a BBC Wales television investigation. The broadcast last night claimed that the Welsh Office had unlawfully used the agency to channel Pounds 7m in grants to mid-Wales, with the presumed purpose of bolstering Conservative prospects in marginal constituencies after the region had lost assisted area status in 1982. This, the programme claimed, was outside the agency's legal powers. As the Labour party called for the resignation of Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, he retorted by denouncing the BBC for what he called 'scandalous allegations' and a 'put-up job'. He said the grants had been legally disbursed and parliament had been told of the scheme in 1982. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the latest claims - and Mr Redwood put the calls for his resignation in the context of campaigning for next week's European Parliament elections - the government's embarrassment over Welsh quangos in general, and the WDA in particular, remains considerable. Since Mr Redwood succeeded Mr David Hunt as Welsh secretary in May last year, he has confronted a seemingly unending series of disclosures concerning the quangos - the unofficial name for non-departmental unelected public bodies. At present, the Conservatives only hold four of the 38 parliamentary seats in Wales, and the growth in the principality of quangos since the Tories came to office in 1979 is seen by many government critics as a way of bypassing the electorate. Professor Kevin Morgan, of the department of city and regional planning at the University of Wales, last autumn published a study of quangos pointedly called The Democratic Deficit, which called for more account-ability. The WDA, as the biggest Welsh quango with a total budget of Pounds 167m for this year, is at the centre of the argument about the role of such bodies. Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, appointed chairman by Mr Redwood last summer to rid the agency of its aura of unacceptable behaviour, was found to have been a former Conservative party fund-raiser overseas. While Mr Redwood denied having known this when he appointed Mr Rowe-Beddoe, the incident served to reinforce claims that Welsh Office appointees to quangos have not always been politically neutral. The WDA itself was set up by act of parliament in 1975 (under a Labour government) and has played the leading role in dealing with Wales's legacy of old heavy industries - coal, iron and steel. Its efforts at land reclamation, urban regeneration and winning overseas investment have been widely praised. What has not been admired is the way in which it failed to reconcile its responsibilities as an agency of government, accountable to parliament, with its attempts to play an entrepreneurial role more appropriate to the private sector. Its entrepreneurial culture stems from the days of Mr Peter Walker, now Lord Walker. As Welsh secretary in 1988 he chose Dr Gwyn Jones to be chairman of the WDA. Although the post is sometimes called 'the second most important in Wales', Mr Walker did not have it advertised, nor did he seek personal references from Dr Jones, then a little-known Swansea businessman in his late thirties. Dr Jones, described as 'dynamic' by advocates and 'flamboyant' by critics, successfully promoted Wales and the agency on an international stage. Mr Walker gave Dr Jones the brief of recasting the WDA's strategy to make it more commercially aggressive and, in particular, to devote time to winning inward investment. The agency's achievements in that latter aim have been significant. But Mr Walker's bullishness that the Welsh economy could be rapidly transformed, with the WDA acting as a catalyst, has proved to be misplaced, even though unemployment was brought down to the UK national average. While Mr Walker and Dr Jones were selling Wales around the world, however, the agency's managers failed to stop the kind of internal practices which last year were criticised by the Commons public accounts committee. While there was no evidence of corruption, these included a loss of Pounds 1.4m on an unapproved agency redundancy scheme, the provision of free private motoring for senior agency executives, expenditure of more than Pounds 300,000 on consultancy fees to consider partial privatisation, which was not identified separately in accounts, and the appointment of a convicted fraudster as marketing director. Another board member until recently was Sir Donald Walters, a prominent Conservative supporter in Wales. Dr Jones ended his chairmanship early last year. Mr Philip Head resigned as chief executive last October after the public accounts committee's criticisms, and other heads rolled, including that of Mr Mike Henry, director of corporate services, who is bringing a case of unfair dismissal, and who contributed to last night's BBC programme. A wholesale restructuring of the agency, which entails the loss of about 70 of its 420 jobs, is under way under Mr Rowe-Beddoe, and a new chief executive, Mr Barry Hartop. The board has been strengthened by the appointment of Professor Garyl Rhys, an automotive industry expert, and Rhiannon Chapman, former director of the Industrial Society. One ex-officio vacancy on the WDA board is that of the chairmanship of another quango, the Development Board for Rural Wales. The awkward reason for the vacancy is that Mr Glyn Davies, the rural board's chairman, resigned last month in the wake of another blistering report by the Commons public accounts committee over an illegal housing allocation scheme. No successor has yet been appointed because Mr Redwood is reviewing the rural board's entire future. The Welsh Office itself has not managed to divorce itself from criticisms of the quangos. Earlier this year, Mr Michael Scholar, permanent secretary, found himself taken to task by the public accounts committee for the Welsh Office's failure to demand disciplinary action at the quangos, and only last month the committee described the department's monitoring of public accounts as 'unacceptable'. While Mr Redwood may feel he is unfairly bearing the brunt of allegations relating to events that took place before his time, after his first year in office the quangos continue to provide ammunition for his opponents. Board members are on the defensive and regard much of the criticism as politically motivated. Yesterday, one commented: 'There are axes being ground. If the power base were reversed, would it be very different?' Prof Morgan counters by saying that the common thread in the scandals is the culpability of the Welsh Office in its monitoring of the quangos. 'The key issue is to try to restore some credibility to the appointment process - it is far from being transparent and certainly not fair,' he says. 'It needs to be far more impartial. The second issue is the way they are regulated.' This leaves the task of raising the credibility of 'quangoland', as Mr Redwood himself has described it, firmly at the Welsh secretary's door.</p>

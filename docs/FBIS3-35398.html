Dr.  Rima Khalaf, Jordanian minister of industry and trade, and the  Egyptian ambassador in Amman attended the meeting. Talks dealt  with ways to boost and upgrade cooperation between the two  sisterly countries in the commercial and economic fields.    Mahmud told reporters he conveyed to the prime minister  Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi's greetings, adding that the  meeting was extremely cordial and fruitful. He said talks dealt  with bilateral trade relations in particular and  Egyptian-Jordanian ties in general. He added they discussed  ways to bolster trade exchange and enhance the march of  rapprochement between the two fraternal peoples--a march that  needs no confirmation.

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Authorities in Newark, N. J., agreed to scale back drastically the amount of  public housing to be demolished under a slum clearance plan and committed  themselves to replacing the razed apartments. The agreement between the Newark  Housing Authority and housing activists provides for the demolition of eight  apartment buildings containing about 1,900 units, with 1,500 new apartments to  be built and hundreds of others renovated. Tenants in buildings being  demolished will be given a place immediately in a new building or a renovated  apartment. The program is the biggest demolition of public housing by an  American city. It is aimed at getting rid of what critics call "high-rise  slums."  </P></p>

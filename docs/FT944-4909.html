			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody liquidates Japanese operations Tokyo's becalmed financial markets suffered a further setback yesterday when Kidder Peabody, the US securities company, announced that it was liquidating its Japanese operations with the loss of up to 100 jobs. The company said that it was closing its Tokyo and Osaka branches and selling its memberships of the two cities' stock exchanges. The withdrawal follows Kidder's takeover earlier this year by fellow US broker PaineWebber. PaineWebber is not a member of the Japanese exchanges, and General Electric, Kidder's parent company, had hoped to effect a smooth transfer by selling its memberships to PaineWebber, but it appears that the new owners of Kidder turned down the offer. 'In the end Kidder Peabody and PaineWebber simply had different strategies,' said Mr Takao Sakuma, Kidder general manager in Tokyo. Kidder now hopes to sell its memberships to a third party. Of the company's approximately 140 employees in Japan, about 40 are expected to be transferred to PaineWebber and the company will attempt to persuade the buyer of its memberships to hire as many as possible, Mr Sakuma said. 'But in the worst case, about 100 people will have to seek employment,' he added. Redundancies on this scale have been rare in Japan, even in the recent recession. Staff had known since the takeover by PaineWebber two months ago that their future was uncertain, but there was still dismay when they were told yesterday. 'Obviously most people were expecting something like this, but it's a big disappointment to them,' said one employee. Mr Sakuma said that the company's Japanese operations had been profitable in the six months to the end of September. However, reports of its imminent demise, which began circulating shortly after the takeover, brought business to a near standstill. As a result, the company would probably record a loss for the year for the first time since it opened a Japanese branch in 1983, he said. The staff transferring to PaineWebber are mainly on the bond-trading side. PaineWebber is understood to be keen to build up its fixed interest business in Tokyo, but not to be interested in equity trading. Stock trading volumes have been depressed for several years on the TSE and most domestic stockbrokers are operating at below break-even levels. Foreign institutions have fared little better. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said non-members would be invited to apply directly to Kidder for the purchase of the exchange membership by no later than December 19. Financial sources indicated yesterday that two companies, the UK brokers Smith New Court and the French company Paribas Capital Markets, had shown interest in TSE membership. But Kidder is understood to be keen to sell the TSE membership as a package with membership of the Osaka Stock Exchange. The liquidation is the first of a TSE member company since 1968, and it is the third case of a foreign broker giving up its membership in the past two years. The UK's County NatWest and the US company Prudential Securities, the two previous cases, cited poor trading conditions as the reason for their departure. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Reich; intellectual ballast for candidate Clinton: Clinton appointee Robert Reich MR Robert Reich, 46, a lecturer in political economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government named yesterday as US labour secretary, is a lawyer by training who has known Mr Clinton since both attended Oxford University as Rhodes scholars in the late 1960s. In recent weeks he has served as director of Mr Clinton's economics transition team. Mr Reich provided much of the intellectual firepower for Mr Clinton's economic plan Putting People First. His latest book, The Work of Nations, argues that the government could best promote living standards by investing heavily in education, training and infrastructure. Mr Reich bubbles with ideas and good humour. A frequent contributor to radio and TV programmes, he has published a stream of books and articles in the past decade, earning him the kind of guru status enjoyed in France by Mr Jacques Attali, now head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Reich, however, has been criticised for changing his mind on issues: his current view that the ownership of companies is irrelevant in a globally integrated economy contrasts with his advocacy of traditional industrial policies, favouring US business, in the early 1980s. He is no stranger to Washington, having served from 1976 to 1981 as director of policy and planning at the Federal Trade Commission. At the Labour Department he will be able to put some of his ideas into practice by developing new forms of skill training for the US workforce. His nomination was welcomed by labour unions but many business groups would have preferred a more conservative appointee.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The early strength in the derivatives sector faded as talk of a big rights issue returned to dominate trading, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the favourable overnight performance on Wall Street and firmness in the some of the European markets led to a strong opening in the March contract on the FT-SE. It started trading at 2,859, some 17 points above Monday's close. But with no follow through buying, the early strength in March faded and the contract went into reverse mid-morning as talk of a big rights issue gathered strength. Increased selling of March led to its continued decline in the afternoon and the contract reached the day's low of 2,810 at 3.15pm. Bargain hunters then moved in and the contract finished at 2,818, down 24 on its previous close and at a 6 point discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover at 12,568 was good. The volume in the traded options improved on Monday's meagre levels reaching 33,045 lots by the close. Around 5,610 lots were dealt in the FT-SE100 index option, and the Euro FT-SE index saw business of 1,852 lots. Among the stock options, the expiry of the February options today in BTR led to active business in its stock option and it traded 4,727 lots. It was followed by BAT at 2,479, and by BP at 2,310. Hanson and Land Securities were also busy.</p>

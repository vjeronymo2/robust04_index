			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Petroleum minister of </F> the Islamic Republic of Iran, by unidentified Voice of the  Islamic Republic of Iran correspondent in Tehran, date not  given; from the "Work, Life" feature--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, good morning and  greetings for the new year. God willing, may it be a year full  of success. Could you tell our listening friends what important  projects were implemented by the Petroleum Ministry in 1372  [year beginning 21 March 1993]?    [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful.    I reciprocate new year's greetings to all our dear people  and  I hope that it will be a wonderful and constructive year for our  country and people, God willing. Regarding the last (?two)  years, we attained considerable success in 1372, which can be  presented in the form of a list:    --The exploration of the Darkhovin reserves, which has  approximately 9 billion barrels of very superior quality light  oil.    --The discovery of a new gas reserve with 20 trillion cubic  feet [as heard] of gas with very rich deposits.    --Regarding drilling, fortunately we have attained a  wonderful drilling record since the Revolution: 300,000 meters  on the nationally.    --In the field of crude oil production, we have raised  Iran's  production capacity to over 4 million barrels. The war caused  extensive damage to the crude oil production industry.  Fortunately, we were able to carry out repairs and  reconstruction and raise our production from 2.5 million barrels  at that time to 4 million.    --Regarding infrastructural projects, one of our most  remarkable achievements was the inauguration -- in the presence  of the esteemed president -- of the Arak Refinery with a  capacity of 150,000 barrels and of one of the greatest  petrochemical units of the country, namely the Arak  petrochemical complex with a capacity of approximately 250,000  petrochemicals, including light and heavy polyethylene, and  propylene.    --In the field of gas piping, in 1372 we were able to  install  250,000 gauges in the houses of the people, and by activating a  new phase of the Kangan Refinery we were able to raise its  output to more than 55 million cubic meters.    --Fortunately, we were successful in expanding our gas  piping  activities in various cities, and in 1372 200 cities had been  covered by piped gas or activities for expanding the gas piping  network had been initiated, which was a massive and valuable  project performed by the National Gas company.    --With all the deficiencies and shortcomings, it was an  appropriate performance compared to other years for the National  Distribution Company [NDC]. Fortunately, we did not experience  any fuel shortages in the colder areas of the country, such as  in East and West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Kermanshah, and Kordestan  Provinces. The situation was most satisfactory throughout the  country, compared to all the years since the Revolution. This  made it possible to have a very rare situation countrywide, and  except for some temporary shortages in some cities, the  situation was most satisfactory.    Fortunately, with the signatures of most of the deputies and  their appreciation of its services, the NDC was able to plan its  activities for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] in such a  manner that we can resolve the problem of transporting fuel  permanently, God willing.    These activities are a brief account of our projects in  1372.  Regarding the sale of crude oil and our presence in  international markets, the situation in the first six months of  this year regarding prices and sales were favorable and in  accordance with what had been envisaged in the budget. However,  in the second half of the year, with a slump in oil prices, our  income decreased. In general, we had an oil income of $13.5  billion, which was $3 billion less than the forecasts. In view  of the situation in the international market, this level of  income was quite appropriate and we were able to adhere to the  production ceilings stipulated by OPEC, as well as to organize  our exports within that framework in an excellent manner without  any retail problems.    [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, could you tell us what  programs you envision for 1373? If, God willing, you have any  glad tidings for our compatriots, do let us know.    [Aqazadeh] I may state that since the development and  distribution of oil and gas, the expansion of the petrochemical  complexes is the priority of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We  are optimistic that new oil derricks that have been set up for  exploration in the Caspian Sea will become operational next  year. In addition, we will begin drilling wells in the eastern  Mazandaran Sea region, which is one of the most suitable sites  in the country, even though it has not been explored in the past  years.    Our prospecting activities will continue in the Persian Gulf  and [words indistinct] fortunately, we have decided that the  planning and construction of this refinery will be done  completely by Iranians. This work will begin in 1373 and it is  hoped it will be operational in 1375 [year beginning 21 March  1996].    A very important piece of news for our people is the  value-added [arzesh-afzudeh] importance of this unit, as well as  the magnitude of the production of the vast Bandar-e Imam  complex. The glad tidings I have for the people are that this  massive complex, which is the largest petrochemical production  unit in our country and covers all branches, such as light and  heavy polyethylene, propylene, EDC, PVC [preceding acronyms in  English], as well as all other petrochemical products, is  expected to begin full operation in Khordad [22 May-21 June]  this year.    With these complexes going into operation, we will not only  be able to attain self-sufficiency in most petrochemical  departments but will also be able to export $300 million worth  of these products this year. This is also good news for the  factories that provide the raw materials for the petrochemical  complexes, and they should not have any doubts regarding the  sale of their products because we will ensure high-quality  production at an international standard and will thus  permanently eliminate the problems that they have experienced  for so many years regarding petrochemical imports and  fluctuations in foreign exchange income.    On the gas piping situation, as in the past years, we will  expand these activities in various cities of the country, which  is our priority. We hope that this year more cities in the  colder areas of our country will join the gas piping network.    With the functioning of the Sarkhun Refinery in Bandar-e  'Abbas, which has a capacity of approximately 15 million cubic  meters of gas per day, we will be able to cater to the needs of  the Hormozgan, especially of the Kerman Province, its power  station, the peripheral copper industries, the Sarcheshmeh  copper complex, and the cities on this route right up to Kerman.  This will open a new chapter in the piping of gas. With the  development of the refinery and its operation, especially of the  (Karkehraker) unit in Abadan that distills furnace oil and its  products such as gasoline, gas oil, and kerosene, we are  extremely optimistic that 1373 will be a wonderful year for our  people regarding the provision of their fuel product  requirements.    I predict that in the oil industry 1373 will be a grand year  for production, foreign exchange earnings, and the increase in  the efficiency of this great industry of the country. Once  again, I wish to convey my greetings for this new year to the  people, especially to my colleagues in the petroleum industry  who have behind them a successful year, and I hope that this  year they will make the same sublime efforts so that the country  is steered toward economic and political self-sufficiency.    [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, I am extremely grateful that  you have given some of your time for us, despite your  engagements. We hope you will be successful and that in the  course of the year 1373 we will be able to be at your service  again.    [Aqazadeh] Likewise, I am grateful for your efforts and  those of your colleagues at the radio [station] for preparing  and presenting such joyful, wonderful, and useful programs.    [Correspondent] May you be successful, God willing.</p>

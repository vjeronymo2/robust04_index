Russian Intelligence Service spokesman Aleksandr Mikhailov  told ITAR-TASS that these reports need to be checked and  verified.    A German press and information department official told  ITAR-TASS in Bonn that he did not receive any such information  and therefore could not confirm or comment on the fact of the  arrest of the German intelligence agent in Moscow who was said  to have worked for the Bundesnachrichtendienst, Germany's  intelligence service.</p>

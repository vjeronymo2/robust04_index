			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (14): Big is no longer beautiful - Fuel and power monopolies are under scrutiny There is a consensus in Germany that the country's energy sector needs sweeping reform to sweep away outdated practices. But there is no consensus about how the sector can be prised open to outside competition in a which would lead to de-regulation and liberalisation. It will be the task of the new coalition government to try and attain that consensus. Across Germany's energy sectors - electricity, gas, and coal - decades-old practices continue to exist. Take electricity. The large utilities, led by RWE, Bayernwerk and PreussenElektra, function within the demarcation and concession system whereby they have exclusive rights to supply the municipalities. The gas industry enjoys a similar monopolistic position. This has the effect of guaranteeing security of energy supply, but at the same time, it restricts choice, including price, for the municipalities and the consumer. A challenge against this system has now been mounted by Kleve, a small town on the Dutch border, which wants to end its exclusive contract with RWE in a bid for cheaper, alternative and independent energy, from across the Dutch border if necessary. The case has been referred to the European Commission. The outcome will be watched closely by the industry. But the structure and price of German electricity - among the highest in Europe - are also influenced by the practice of allowing electricity companies are permitted to collect a levy - the so-called Kohlepfennig - from the consumer to help finance the use of the high cost German coal. The Kohlepfennig is tied to the Jahrhundert Vertrag, an agreement between the coal and electricity industries in Germany covering the amount of domestic coal the utilities undertake to burn for the remainder of this century. German coal prices are higher than world coal prices - at current exchange rates, world coal prices are about DM80 per tonne but the German electricity companies pay DM280 per tonne for German coal to make up for the cost of imported coal. More than 40m tonnes of coal are subsidised by the Kohlepfennig. Phasing out of the Kohlepfennig would have social political consequences: it would affect domestic coal production output and eventually drain support from the opposition Social Democrats, whose constituencies are rooted in the coal regions. Yet the SPD also realises that it is facing pressure from industry for lower electricity prices, and is aware that the annual DM8bn required to subsidise coal continues to put a strain on the budget deficit which is over DM68bn. It is not only the coal industry which is under pressure to become competitive. There is growing pressure on the electricity and gas utilities to consider how far they are prepared to introduce Third Party Access (TPA) which would allow outsiders access to their distribution grids. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, has proposed a comprehensive reform of the energy sector envisaging some form of TPA. In October 1993, he unveiled a draft energy law intended to replace the 1935 Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, or energy law. The draft legislation proposed that operators of the electricity or gas grid, upon whom third parties are dependent for transportation, must not unreasonably hinder those seeking contracts for TPA. However, refusal to grant such TPA is not considered unreasonable in several situations: if the capacity of the line for TPA is insufficient; if no appropriate compensation for TPA is offered; if the secure supply to other customers of the operator of the line for reasonable conditions is rendered impossible through TPA; and if, in the case of gas, a curtailment of supply on international markets occurs. So far, Mr Rexrodt has been unsuccessful in pushing this legislation through because of opposition from within the government itself, and from the utilities and other related institutions. For example, the Federal Association for Gas and Water (BGW), supports in principle the idea of TPA, but only if it is reciprocal. 'Germany cannot go it alone,' argues Mr Martin Weyand, an energy expert at the BGW. However, Mr Weyand and the BGW believe that the consequences of TPA and the abolition of the principle of exclusive service areas would have the following results: inequality of opportunity. Foreign gas companies would be able to supply the German market while foreign markets - particularly France - would remain inaccessible to German gas companies; threat to security of supply. The system of long-term supply contracts used throughout Europe, which consists of long-term supply contracts with high take-or-pay obligations, could no longer be applied. However, short-term contracts would not be a suitable alternative and would not guarantee secure, area-wide supplies to customers; small consumers and medium-sized businesses and rural areas would be hit; the obligation to connect and guarantee supply could no longer be met; expropriation of private investment. Those companies which have undertaken long-term investments could lose the right to dispose of their own property and it is unclear if there would be a compensating mechanism. The Verband der Industriellen Energie-und Kraftwirtschaft, the association for industrial energy, wants greater competition because it believes it would lead to lower prices. The VIK, headed by Mr Max Dietrich Kley, a board member of BASF, the giant chemicals group and one of the largest consumers of energy, wants third party access. Indeed, BASF, through Wintershall, its gas subsidiary, is building a network of gas pipe lines across Germany precisely to break the monopoly held by Ruhrgas, the country's largest gas supplier, and introduce cheaper gas prices and more competition. But the VIK does not have the support of the Arbeitgemeinschaft Regionaler Energieversorgungs-Unternehmen (ARE), the organisation which groups together the regional utility companies. Sandwiched between the municipalities and the large utility companies, ARE can live without the strict concession and demarcation systems, since it would give them greater opportunities to compete and supply on the local level. Yet they do not want TPA because they would be smothered by outside competitors. The German government is under some pressure from the EU to deregulate. For the moment, however, there is no consensus in Brussels about how far TPA within the EU should go - while the UK staunchly defends wide liberalisation, France favours the single-buyer model which would allow one utility to import, sell, and distribute electricity in the national market. 'This would mean that the national market in France would be blocked by its own companies,' a BGW official said. Thus, without consensus either in Brussels or within Germany, it will be up to the incoming Bonn coalition to force the pace.</p>

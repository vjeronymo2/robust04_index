			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM 'was unaware' of Matrix probe MR John Major emphasised yesterday that he had been unaware of the government's investigation into exports of machine tools to Iraq by Matrix Churchill until after the invasion of Kuwait, Philip Stephens writes. In a parliamentary answer to Mr George Robertson, the Labour foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Major said he was first told of the investigation in October 1990. The prime minister also revealed that Mr Richard Ryder, now the chief whip, had been the Treasury's representative at a ministerial meeting in July 1990 that decided to relax the guidelines restricting defence-related sales to Iraq. Mr Major said his preoccupation at that time as chancellor was with the annual public-spending negotiations. His answer said he had seen a minute in August 1990 referring to Matrix Churchill but he had 'no recollection' of seeing earlier papers copied to the Treasury referring to the company's activities. The implication of the answer - although it was not spelt out in the reply - was that as foreign secretary during 1989 he had not seen any papers relating to the exports.</p>

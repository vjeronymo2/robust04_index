If one were to believe the  chiefs of governments, the visit's most important goal was  achieved: Problems that are obstacles to economic cooperation  were defined with precision, while individual ministers were  obliged to come up with proposals for solutions by May of this  year. The prime ministers for both countries will meet again in  two months--it is very likely that this time the meeting will  take place in Warsaw--in order to sign the necessary  agreements.    It seems that both politicians were interested in breaking  the impediments that have been in effect for many months now, in  economic relations between Poland and Russia. According to  Viktor Chernomyrdin, the situation requires a speeding up of  work on putting financial problems in order, on working out new  payment mechanisms, and on regulating the issue of mutual  indebtedness.    Prime Minister Pawlak was also full of optimism. In his  view, thanks to the cooperation between the two governments, a  prospect for signing trade agreements for years to come is  realistic, including signing a trade protocol before the end of  this year. The most important issue, said the Polish  government's chief during a short meeting with journalists, is  that the declarations and agreements signed earlier actually be  implemented. That is indeed the essence of a "Partnership for  Development" concept proposed by the Polish Government. The  point is to create conditions that would make it possible to  establish practical cooperation among countries and nations.    While responding to a question pertaining to the resolution  of a key issue within Polish-Russian economic cooperation--that  is, the issue of indebtedness--Prime Minister Pawlak said the  issue will be further debated by experts. Old debts should in  no way be an obstacle to current cooperation. Viktor  Chernomyrdin shared that view. Economy Minister Aleksandr  Shokhin was more skeptical. According to him, solving the  problem of mutual indebtedness requires a political decision at  the level of prime ministers or perhaps even at the level of  presidents. After negotiations with the two previous Polish  cabinets, which lasted years, a few more compromise solutions  must be worked out, to be able to eventually "finalize the  issue." Henryk Chmielak, secretary of state in the Finance  Ministry, said that both sides have agreed to apply the payment  mechanism used in talks with the Paris Club.    At the end of the Polish-Russian talks, which were conducted  in the rebuilt wing of the "White House" (old headquarters of  the Supreme Council), where Chernomyrdin's Cabinet has moved,  both prime ministers signed two agreements: regarding employing  Russians in Poland and employing Poles in Russia, and an  agreement on cooperation regarding antitrust policies. An  agreement on agriculture was also signed.    During the meeting between the prime ministers in May, the  following agreements may be signed: regarding military and  technical cooperation (this allegedly is supposed to be on  cooperation among arms factories, with third markets in mind),  on joint transportation ventures (Berlin-Warsaw-Moscow highway  and railway), and on a Russia-Europe natural gas pipeline.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   After his return from Moscow, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  said that President Lech Walesa will be the first to hear from  him regarding the results of Pawlak's conversations with Russian  politicians. According to the government's chief, the most  important part of the visit was about determining a time frame  for subsequent contacts aimed at signing an agreement on  supplies of strategic raw materials that would last for many  years. According to Marek Pol, minister of industry and trade,  there is a chance for signing an agreement concerning pipeline  construction. That venture would be financed exclusively by  Polish and Russian companies.    --by M. W.</p>

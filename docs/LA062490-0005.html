			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: THE DARK AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL;  </P> <P> THE INNOCENT BY IAN MCEWAN (DOUBLEDAY: $18.95; 270 PP.)  </P> <P> Something there is that does not like a tunnel. It is the theme of Ian McEwan's  provocative though erratic novel of espionage, set in Berlin during the early  intensity of the Cold War.  </P> <P> A novel of espionage, that is, with spying as metaphor for a larger type of  human isolation. Graham Greene used the thriller genre in a similar way, and  although there are one or two aspects of "The Innocent" that may suggest John  Le Carre, a closer comparison is to such Greene entertainments as "Brighton  Rock" and "The Confidential Agent."  </P> <P> In his non-entertainments, such as "The Child in Time" and "The Cement Garden,"  McEwan, who is English, wrote about people living tightly on the verge of  disintegration. The verge is society's, too; McEwan's human and social textures  have the translucence of skin stretched over infection. The skin rips  unpredictably, but the rips are tiny and the poison leaks without really  draining.  </P> <P> "The Innocent" is more spectacular; its rips are volcanic eruptions, though the  result is not purgation but parody. It is not as serious as its predecessors,  though it is more fun and likely to be more popular. It stretches the nerves.  It does not stretch the mind so much as pluck at it.  </P> <P> McEwan bases his story upon a real event. In 1955, the American and British  intelligence services built a tunnel into East Berlin to tap the main  East-German and Soviet telephone cable. The tap worked for a year until the  Russians discovered it. In fact, they seem to have known about it all along,  thanks to the work of a British mole, George Blake.  </P> <P> McEwan brings in Blake as a peripheral figure, though significant to the plot;  he mentions one or two other real people, and he uses a lot of real detail. The  story and its main characters are fictional, though. The fiction is a tight  weave of spy story, love story and parable; along with black comedy that goes  from wild as an adjective, to wild as a verb; as New York's Central Park  muggers used it: as Doomsday assault.  </P> <P> Using a classic device, McEwan introduces Leonard Marnham, his innocent, into  an infinitely non-innocent world. By the end, this human tabula rasa will not  only have registered every kink and whorl in this world, but go on to out-kink  and out-whorl it.  </P> <P> Leonard is diffident, polite and virginal. He lives with his parents in a  semi-detached London house, and works as a technician in the research  laboratories of the British telephone system. Suddenly he finds himself  transferred to Berlin, awestruck at having a two-bedroom apartment, a job  assembling and servicing taping equipment in the tunnel project, and the  patronage of Glass, a hard-charging CIA operative who is his boss and mentor.  </P> <P> One kind of virginity is ruptured as Leonard revels -- though shyly -- in being  a secret agent and a "conqueror" in a Berlin that is still war-shattered and  subservient. Another kind goes when he meets Maria, a young German woman who  works for the British occupation forces.  </P> <P> Maria is not as innocent as Leonard. She suffered under the Russian invasion  and under a brutal husband whom she divorced, but who still turns up to abuse  her. She has an edge of hard-won practicality, but she is gentle, as well, and  Leonard is a lover with whom she can take the initiative and not be frightened.  Burrowing under layers of blankets in her tiny, freezing apartment, they are  two furry moles, tender, passionate and snug.  </P> <P> It is a tunnel, though, as well: hidden, cut-off and generating its own  peculiar passions. If Leonard's secret identity allows him to imagine himself  as Berlin's conqueror, his seclusion with Maria brings out a spark of sadism.  It is brief and tentative -- Maria walks out for awhile, reaching the tunnel,  in effect -- and he is utterly ashamed of himself.  </P> <P> As for the spy tunnel, it nourishes other kinds of baleful fantasies. Glass  personifies the illusion of a secret allied advantage over the Russians; though  at the end, he emerges as oddly sympathetic. And Leonard is recruited by the  senior British agent to spy upon the Americans, who are the abrasive senior  partners in the project.  </P> <P> In a wonderful introductory scene, Glass initiates Leonard into the world of  clearance levels. Level 1 -- the public level: The building from which the  tunnel operation starts is ostensibly a military warehouse. Level 2 -- for the  building contractors: It is really a radar installation. Level 3 -- for the  true initiates, the technicians digging the tunnel and operating the equipment:  It is the telephone tap.  </P> <P> Glass is immensely proud of these layers of knowledge -- a tunnel within a  tunnel within a tunnel. Is there a Level 4? If there is, Glass says, he doesn't  know about it. But of course, there is; it is the British subplot. And this  subplot will eventually allow Leonard to outwit all four levels when his tunnel  life with Maria goes grotesquely wrong, and in a fashion, save them both.  </P> <P> McEwan's account of the building and installation of the communications tap is  taut and exciting. Much more remarkable is his skill in using the tunnels --  real and metaphorical -- as instruments of both moral suspense and black humor.  His tunnels, in fact, are like the doors in French farce; they switch us  comically between revelation and mystification.  </P> <P> Other things are less successful. The story of Leonard and Maria, darkening  steadily, gets out of hand when her husband appears. There is a brutal fight, a  killing, and 12 unsparingly detailed pages about the dismemberment of a body.  It is brilliantly done, in its own way, but it is all but unbearable to read.  </P> <P> More seriously, it is like a power surge that blows out the wiring. The  morality farce takes over again, but we may be too jangled to appreciate it.  Furthermore, after so much tension, the ending seems lackadaisical and routine.  An epilogue, set years later, turns this routine ending into a "happy" ending  that is utterly banal. It is as if McEwan, having set up his complex and  powerful device, had lost both control and interest.  </P> <P> "The Innocent" provides a series of strong and often subtle sensations. But  there is something about them that resembles not so much the experience of a  story as the kind of pseudo-experience administered by electrodes attached to  nerve receptors. The taste is indistinguishable from the real thing, but the  aftertaste is flat. "The Innocent" evokes a dark moral world in a highly  entertaining fashion. Unlike Greene's entertainments, however, McEwan's leaves  not even the trace of a feeling behind it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UCSD FOUNDER REVELLE IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER HEART SURGERY  </P> <P> UC San Diego founder Roger Revelle was listed in critical but stable condition  Tuesday after undergoing triple-bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement at  UCSD Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. The surgery was performed  Monday.  </P> <P> Revelle was "not feeling very well" when he was admitted Thursday for  monitoring and testing, said Leslie Franz, a hospital spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Revelle, who will be 81 on March 7, had a pacemaker implanted last year, Franz  said.  </P> <P> The bypass and valve surgery were performed by Dr. Stuart W. Jamieson, who  joined the UCSD medical staff in July, 1989, from the University of Minnesota.  </P> <P> Franz said that Revelle's wife, Ellen, has been "spending a lot of time with  him."  </P> <P> Revelle's research in geology, oceanography and atmospherics has brought him  global reknown. He laid the groundwork for the theory of plate tectonics and  was one of the first scientists to recognize the danger posed to the atmosphere  by the burning of fossil fuels.  </P> <P> For his research on the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Revelle  won the Balzan Prize in oceanography and climatology in October, 1986. The  little known but prestigious prize -- a medal and $165,000 cash -- is awarded  yearly in fields not represented by the Nobel Prize by the International Balzan  Foundation of Milan, Italy.  </P> <P> While serving as director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Revelle  envisioned a university dedicated to scientific research. That institution,  sitting on 50 acres of public land donated by the city of San Diego and next to  the Scripps Institution, was dedicated in November, 1960, as the University of  California, San Diego.  </P> <P> Revelle served as director of the Scripps Institution from 1950 to 1964 and  then as head of Harvard University's Center for Population Studies until June,  1975.  </P> <P> Revelle is now a professor of science and public policy at UCSD, a position he  has held since 1975.  </P></p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Interest income helps ML halve loss A sharp rise in interest income helped ML Laboratories, the pharmaceutical research company which recently won UK approval for its kidney drug Icodextrin, to halve pre-tax losses from Pounds 887,000 to Pounds 453,000 in the year to September 30. Interest earnings on its Pounds 13.6m cash balances, the product of a Pounds 15.8m rights issue in 1992, pushed investment income up from Pounds 420,000 to Pounds 1.3m. Interest payable fell to Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 118,000). The group said yesterday that it was at an advanced stage in negotiations with international companies over marketing and distributing the renal dialysis drug which was approved in January. Mr Stuart Sim, finance director, said that in the event the negotiations failed, ML was running its own parallel distribution programme to about 100 renal units in the UK. ML was prepared to 'go it alone' if it could not reach satisfactory arrangements with other companies, he said. ML, which has not made an annual profit since its 1987 flotation, is expected to receive an income for the first time this year from sales of the drug. It has applied for approval of Icodextrin in the rest of Europe and expects licensing by the middle of the year. Mr Sim said the group would then seek licences in the US and Japan. ML estimates that there are about 500,000 dialysis patients worldwide, and that the market would grow by a compound annual rate of 9 per cent. In the past Mr Sim has estimated the market for Icodextrin - which makes it possible for patients to go longer between fluid changes and has fewer side effects than other drugs - is about Pounds 487m a year. ML said it planned to apply for approval of its respiratory drug this year, and expected approval in 1995. However, discussions were already under way on a commercial distribution agreement and it was possible that an advance payment might be made as part of an agreement. ML's sales, the result of consultancy work, rose from Pounds 604,000 to Pounds 823,000. Losses per share fell from 3.5p to 0.3p. There is no dividend. ML spent about Pounds 2.2m on research and development, similar to last year.</p>

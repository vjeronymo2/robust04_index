			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GLITCHES SLOW CENSUS TAKERS SEARCHING FOR THE HOMELESS;  </P> <P> POVERTY: A LACK OF TRANSLATORS AND SPANISH-LANGUAGE FORMS HURTS THEIR EFFORTS.  AN ANGRY COUNTY SUPERVISOR HELPS THEM COUNT HEADS.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's first light, weary teams of census takers plunged into the  thicket of Ventura's Hobo Jungle, searching for the hard-core homeless who live  in makeshift quarters along the dry bed of the Ventura River.  </P> <P> It was the final step in a balky and often awkward effort to tally the county's  homeless as part of the 1990 U.S. Census. The sweep had begun nearly 12 hours  earlier when census takers descended on the county's homeless shelters.  </P> <P> More than once, census workers showed up without badly needed bilingual  translators and Spanish-language census forms to count homeless Latinos.  </P> <P> On two occasions, the census effort struck county Supervisor Madge Schaefer as  so badly organized that she helped count people at homeless shelters in Oxnard.  </P> <P> By the time the widely publicized project was over, some of the county's  homeless remained uncounted. But the census teams had managed to count others,  and the long night of interviewing had touched some of the census workers  personally.  </P> <P> "These people are really just like us," said John Pence, after interviewing a  painfully shy 60-year-old man who had built his home out of wooden pallets  wedged underneath the Main Street Bridge.  </P> <P> "Some of us live in houses; others end up in a shack in the river bottom," said  Pence, 68, a retiree who decided to help with the homeless count.  </P> <P> Although the dusk-to-dawn sweep rarely went smoothly, it came off without a  single violent incident, said Geary-Ellen Williams, manager of the local census  office.  </P> <P> Some homeless advocates had worried that a pre-dawn arrival of census takers  might anger some of the more antisocial people who live in the stretch of  Ventura River bottom known as Hobo Jungle.  </P> <P> "It's kind of freaky to see all these strangers," said John White, 42, who has  lived in the river bottom for six months. "What's next, the SWAT team?"  </P> <P> At another encampment, Michael Baird, a census taker, asked two homeless men  about another man who was sleeping in a nearby tent. "Can I wake him up?" Baird  asked.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't do that," one of the men responded. "He's the unsociable kind."  </P> <P> As a result, many shanties and makeshift tents went unexplored. And while  census takers were tromping through the homeless camp, a number of homeless  people scampered up the river's levee and into town.  </P> <P> "There's no way they could find them all," said Patrick Driskell, executive  director of Project Understanding, a nonprofit group that provides food,  clothing and a variety of services to the homeless in Ventura. "Some just won't  want to be counted."  </P> <P> Census takers met virtually no resistance from the homeless they had met  earlier at the county's shelters. A census team was warmly greeted by many who  had congregated inside the Ventura County Rescue Mission, a 50-bed home for  single homeless men in Oxnard.  </P> <P> "Some people may be a little distrustful of the government, but I don't think  there should be any objections," said Michael Blodgett, 40, who added that he  has been homeless for five years. He suggested that the census could bring the  homeless and other needy people a bigger share of federal money, especially  after expected reductions in the defense budget.  </P> <P> "As long as they are American citizens, they should stand up and be counted,"  Blodgett said.  </P> <P> Two dozen Latinos, huddled outside the mission, voiced no fears about  cooperating with U.S. authorities. Filomone Basquez, who has been in the United  States for two months, said he was not worried that the Census Bureau would  breach its promise of confidentiality to turn over information to immigration  authorities.  </P> <P> Yet when the team of census workers arrived at the mission, all but a few of  those congregated outside slipped into the night.  </P> <P> The most embarrassing problems came inside the Ventura County Mission. Latino  men comprised the vast majority of those waiting for a hot meal and a bed. Few  spoke English.  </P> <P> Not one of the census team's three members could speak Spanish. The two elderly  white men and one elderly white woman arrived without an interpreter and short  of Spanish-language census forms.  </P> <P> As the mission's pastor led the congregation in hymns, census workers threaded  through the pews, asking if anyone spoke English. Time after time, they were  waved away by a wagging finger.  </P> <P> "This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen," said Schaefer, who had donned a  white Census Bureau smock to supervise the count. "They were supposed to call  for a translator."  </P> <P> It was too much for Schaefer. For months, she has promoted a full census count  as crucial for the county to receive its fair share of federal dollars, which  are distributed by population.  </P> <P> Between hymns, she nudged a bilingual mission employee to make an announcement  in Spanish about the census. Then she scolded a Census Bureau supervisor, who  was accompanying her, until he agreed to telephone for more Spanish-language  forms.  </P> <P> At the county's Armory in Oxnard, another census team arrived without  Spanish-speaking or bilingual workers. The Armory was reopened Tuesday night by  a special order of the governor in an effort to attract homeless people to a  central location for easy counting.  </P> <P> Seventy-eight homeless people showed up for a free chili dinner and a canvas  cot; however, census workers had collected only 28 of the 78 listed on the  shelter's roster as many began to settle into bed.  </P> <P> Worried that they might not be counted, Schaefer demanded that bureau officials  call in a translator. Within a few minutes, two bilingual census employees  appeared, making announcements and passing out Spanish-language forms.  </P> <P> Schaefer picked up some forms and began to assist Latino men in filling them  out. "I filled out seven forms in five minutes," she said. "And they didn't  speak any English and I don't speak any Spanish."  </P> <P> Schaefer said she was told that if any homeless people in the shelters were not  counted by midnight, they would not be counted at all.  </P> <P> But Randy Metcalf, a regional census supervisor accompanying Schaefer, later  said she was misinformed. He said that if any of the homeless in the shelter  were not interviewed, their numbers would be picked up from the shelter's  roster.  </P> <P> "Everything is going very smoothly," Metcalf assured reporters during the  all-night sweep. "We've had no problems."  </P> <P> Steve Alnwick, a Los Angeles-based Census Bureau researcher who wanted to  unofficially witness the homeless count firsthand, appeared exasperated at the  never-ending glitches.  </P> <P> "This is controlled chaos," he said, rolling his eyes.  </P> <P> On Wednesday afternoon, with the long night's work behind them, census  officials conceded that there had been some problems in finding Spanish  translators for the head count but proclaimed that the project had been  successful overall.  </P> <P> Williams, the manager for the Ventura County district office of the Census  Bureau, said that only seven of the 59 census takers who showed up to count the  homeless spoke Spanish.  </P> <P> She said the district office and the city of Oxnard had sponsored Spanish  language ads on local radio and television stations, but failed to attract  enough Spanish speakers.  </P> <P> "We thought we'd have enough people who spoke Spanish, but we didn't realize  there were that many homeless people who don't speak English," Williams said.  </P> <P> Williams said she sent out four translators when Schaefer called during the  count Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. One was a receptionist and the  others were managers and supervisors, she said.  </P> <P> But Williams denied that the lack of Spanish speakers affected the accuracy of  the count.  </P> <P> "I think it went really well," she said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tracey Kaplan contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: DAVIS TELLS SACRAMENTO TO NOT HOLD ITS BREATH  </P> <P> Sacramento's chances of bringing the Raiders to the state capital suffered a  major setback Monday.  </P> <P> Mayor Anne Rudin told reporters that Al Davis, Raider managing general partner,  told her by phone that he is not going to reach a decision by the Wednesday  deadline set by the Sacramento City Council. Davis will receive a  city-financed, $50 million franchise fee if he announces a move to Sacramento  by then.  </P> <P> "He will probably not make a decision by Wednesday," Rudin said. "He wanted  more time to think about it."  </P> <P> Rudin said she doubted there would be any attempt by City Council members to  extend the deadline. "I don't think anybody's going to propose it," she said.  "The votes aren't there."  </P></p>

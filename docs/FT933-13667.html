			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: So you think your pension is safe . . . - Most are - but there is a minority of cases where employers have gone bust. Debbie Harrison examines the risks THE MAXWELL case made many pension scheme members realise, perhaps for the first time, that their money could be lost if their employer went bust. In 1992 alone, more than 24,000 companies in England and Wales became insolvent and similar figures are expected for this year. Investigations show that a small but significant minority of these had tapped into the pension fund. When an employer becomes insolvent, the company pension scheme has to be wound up in accordance with the trust deed. This means that the scheme is terminated legally and the assets are either transferred to another scheme, as might happen in the case of a take-over or merger, or are used to buy annuities from life offices to provide present or future pension income for members. Ellison Westhorp, a London firm of pension solicitors, has produced a free guide* which provides practical tips on how to check that pensions are safe. The firm stresses that most UK company schemes are protected by comprehensive regulation and have adequate assets to meet their liabilities as well as reliable trustees to safeguard their interests. Even where there is no suspicion of fraud, though, the time taken to sort out benefits can be unnerving. The important point is knowing when to panic and when to leave things to the professional. According to the guide, typical pension problems at insolvency include: Delays in paying your pension or your transfer value to a new scheme. Difficulty or delay in finding out information, especially about who is in charge of the scheme. Lower benefits than you expected. Ellison Westhorp recommends that if your employer goes bust, you should check that the insolvency practitioner has appointed an independent trustee. His role is to make sure members are represented fairly in dividing the spoils, and to reassure worried members that the correct procedures are taking place. Under the Social Security Act 1990, this appointment must be made where the insolvent employer ran a final salary scheme - that is, one which provides a pension linked to a member's final pay. Any delay in appointing an independent trustee can endanger your pension benefits, particularly if the employer was the only (or dominant member) of the trustee board and is suspected of serving his own interests rather than those of the scheme. Moreover, where the original trustee board has dispersed, the insolvency practitioner might become the sole trustee. This can lead to a conflict of interests unless there is an independent trustee to provide a balance, since the insolvency practitioner's main duty is to collect as much money as possible for the creditors - not for the pension scheme. Certain delays in disentangling pension benefits from the insolvency quagmire are both understandable and reasonable. In order for the scheme to be wound up, it is necessary for its assets to be collected and turned into cash. In practice, this takes time, especially if the fund had direct investments in property; in this case, it might take several years to wait for the market to turn in order to get a good price. Other delays may relate to the administration of the scheme. Records on each member's length of service, salary and transfers into the plan, for example, could be incomplete and the independent trustee must fill any gaps before the scheme's liabilities can be assessed fully. The guide advises members to write to the insolvency practitioner or independent trustee to check their personal records are complete and accurate. If the independent trustee is able to wind up the scheme, he could hit problems when he attempts to buy annuities. Insurance companies must set aside substantial reserves for these, but Ellison Westhorp's Robin Ellison says many insurers do not have the capacity to handle bulk annuity purchases because they have 'burnt' their reserves on insurance claims or have taken too much new business. Ellison warns: 'When it comes to bulk purchases - say, of 100 members - the insurance companies haven't got the solvency margins to take on the business and our experience is that, at present, it's a waste of time and money to try.' Where the employer has tampered with the pension fund - as happened in the Maxwell case - the scheme is likely to be in deficit and unable to pay members' benefits in full. Since the Social Security Act 1990 came into force, any deficit in the scheme becomes a debt on the employer. Unfortunately, it does not have the status of a preferential debt; thus, the independent trustee will have to compete with all the other unsecured creditors after the Inland Revenue and those with debentures or mortgages have taken their shares. Explaining the likely implications for members if the scheme is in deficit, Ellison says: 'What can happen is that all benefits are reduced on a pro rata basis before the annuities are purchased. Alternatively, the trustees may decide to pay current pensions out of the pot and review the position of the rest of the members in a year or two when the legal and financial position is more clear.' One word of warning. You might feel anxious to get your money out of the company fund as quickly as possible but, ideally, you should wait until all the scheme assets have been collected and your position is clear. It is important to review all your options - certainly, you should not consider transferring to a personal pension before taking independent advice. If you have a complaint about your pension, put it in writing to the independent trustee. If you are dissatisfied with the response, contact the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS). *For a copy, write to Ellison Westhorp, 52 Carter Lane, London EC4V 5EA.

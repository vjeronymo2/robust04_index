Top INPE officials  are meeting in Brasilia today with leaders from 10 African  countries, also interested in using the satellite's resources.    According to Minister Israel Vargas, the Brazilian Space  Agency, a civilian body, will circumvent the boycotts  encountered by Brazil in the transfer of sensitive technology  from the developed nations. "Our space program is strictly  peaceful," he observed.    In the minister's opinion, the new space agency will enable  Brazil to enter the low-altitude communications satellite  market. "One of the agency's first assignments is to reexamine  the entire Brazilian space program," he said.    At present, the Ministry of Science and Technology has  signed  major space cooperation agreements with China and is studying a  partnership with Argentina.</p>

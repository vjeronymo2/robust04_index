The addition of Cr increased the amount of  TiAl (_g_) phase in the binary Ti-Al alloy and changed the  _a_[.sub]2[/] lamellae into block shaped particles. Cr  accelerated the discontinuous coarsening process of the lamellar  _a_[.sub]2[/]+_g_, by which the finer new-growing lamellar  grains were formed. Therefore, addition of Cr and long-time heat  treatment at 1150C are an effective way to refine the large  lamellar grains of _a_[.sub]2[/]+_g_ in as-cast alloy. Cr  promoted the formation of an ordered bcc _b_[.sub]2[/] phase.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST : BALDWIN PARK;  </P> <P> CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT PLAN  </P> <P> Officials are overhauling the city's 4-year-old Sierra Vista Development Plan  because it is hindering the very development that it was meant to encourage.  </P> <P> The development plan for the corridor along the 10 and 605 freeways was  designed to foster larger-scale development in an area littered with small  properties.  </P> <P> City planner Lawrence Onaga told the City Council on Wednesday that development  has stalled because developers have had difficulty assembling lots meeting  their requirements. He recommended that land-size requirements be relaxed in  certain areas and that design guidelines and a high-priority zone be  established. Onaga said it would be several months before public hearings on  the proposed changes would begin.  </P></p>

Proposing a toast to the distinguished Croatian guest,  Romanian President Ion Iliescu recalled with satisfaction his  visit paid to Croatia last spring, the understandings and  decisions adopted on that occasion, stressing that President  Tudjman's visit to Romania opened up new prospects to the  collaboration between the two countries, consistent with their  mutual political will.    Referring to the situation in the region, to the next-door  tragedy caused by the armed conflict in the territory of the  former Yugoslavia, and to the effects of the embargo, felt by  everyone, President Ion Iliescu stressed that as far as Romania  was concerned, the best compensation for the economic losses  sustained was the fastest normalization of the situation in the  area of ex-Yugoslavia. "The escalation in the last period shows  the necessity that confrontation be given up, that combat and  military actions be ceased and all parties concerned give proof  of utmost responsibility", President Iliescu assessed,  reiterating Romania's stand for the seeking out of a political  solution to the Yugoslav crisis and welcoming the steps taken on  this line. Ion Iliescu also expressed his belief that Romania,  through the bilateral relations with the states resulting from  the former Yugoslavia, along with the efforts of the  international community, would help remaking the stability, the  climate of confidence among those states, the reinstatement of  peace.    In turn, President Tudjman stressed in his toast that his  country attached great importance to the relations with Romania,  because Romania was the biggest country in south-eastern Europe  and was very important in the area. Recalling that the two  countries have lived through the same phenomena after  totalitarianism fell apart, with similar effects in the economic  and political domains alike, President Tudjman recalled the  specific difficulties Croatia had to cope with because of the  war. Drawing a picture of the former Yugoslavia whose unity  Tito had managed to maintain, the Croatian president evoked the  changes come about after Tito's passing away and in the new  circumstances the wish for self-determination of the countries  in the area, that could have been materialized, avoiding an  armed conflict, if the countries involved had made efforts on  this line. The recent signing of the agreement on the peaceful  settlement would lead, the Croatian president said, with the  support of the international community, Romania included, to the  peaceful settlement of the conflict.    Assessing the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina as one of the  most  intricate crisis in the world, the Croatian head of state  cautioned that one must not forget that it was precisely in  Sarajevo that the first world war too, had started, and hoped  that history should not recur, in consideration of the current  armed conflict.    Evoking the international consensus on the situation in the  former Yugoslavia, Franjo Tudjman hoped that the conflicting  countries too, would find a common, peaceful way of settling the  situation. "The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has come to a climax  and this is the moment at which we can reach a political  settlement or see the expansion and worsening of the conflict in  this part of the world", the Croatian president stressed,  expressing his confidence in the way of peaceful settlement, for  the benefit of the peoples in the area.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE: RAIDERS;  </P> <P> PLAYOFF PICTURE IS STILL UNCLEAR  </P> <P> The Raiders have clinched a playoff spot, but their first-round opponent is far  from being determined. If the Raiders defeat San Diego this Sunday and win the  AFC West, they will receive a bye along with Buffalo and then wait for the  outcome of two first-round games involving the three wild-card teams and the  AFC Central Division champion.  </P> <P> Because Buffalo has clinched the conference's best record, it is guaranteed a  first-round game against the remaining wild-card team with the worst record.  </P> <P> A quick review of the new format: The division winner with the worst record,  which will be the eventual AFC Central champion, will play host to the  wild-card team with the worst record, leaving a game between the wild-card  teams with the two best records. Those teams would be Kansas City and Miami at  the moment.  </P> <P> Kansas City needs to defeat the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field this Saturday to  remain alive for the AFC West title. The Chiefs received a motivational break  when the New York Giants won Sunday and clinched the second first-round bye in  the NFC along with San Francisco. It renders Saturday's game against Kansas  City meaningless for the NFC Central champion Bears, who are destined to play a  first-round game as the divisional winner with the poorest record.

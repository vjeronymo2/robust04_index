			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Leading Article: France and Islam On the technical level, the denouement of the Algerian hijack drama is an undoubted success for France, which should be a source of relief and pleasure to anyone who is likely to travel to France or use French airlines, whether for business or pleasure. The capacity to protect its citizens against terrorism is a necessary attribute of any modern state. The French state, faced with a severe test of that capacity, has passed it with flying colours. No such encouraging conclusion can be drawn for Algeria. The fact that this hijacking could happen at all, in what must be one of the most heavily guarded airports in the world, is one more indication of Algeria's deep political and social crisis. It is clear that Islamic extremist groups have members and sympathisers among airport employees, as they do in other public services such as education and the post office. Algeria is in the grip of a particularly vicious civil war. According to 'well-informed sources in Paris and Algiers', quoted by the leading French newspaper Le Monde, the average death toll in the violence is now running at 800 per week, with 'peaks' as high as 1,000 in the worst weeks of all. France's anti-terrorist strategy is impressive; its Algerian policy much less so. Officially France is neutral in the Algerian conflict. Its spokesmen minimise, sometimes even deny, the military aid France is giving to the Algerian government. Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, warns the government that it must not rely solely on a policy of repression. Yet at the same time the French Interior minister, Charles Pasqua, not only cracks down heavy-handedly on suspected Islamic militants in France, but denounces third countries which seek to promote dialogue by giving a platform to moderate spokesmen of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) - the party that would have come to power in Algeria through the ballot box but for the coup of January 1992. There can be no hope of ending the violence unless, as in South Africa, some common ground is established between moderates on both sides. Nor can it be in the French or European interest to represent this conflict as a clash of civilisations or war of religion, which would inevitably rage on European as well as North African soil. Yet that is what Mr Pasqua's policies, and those of his colleague at Education, Francois Bayrou, such as expulsion from state schools of Moslem girls who insist on wearing headscarves, are tending to do. The EU now has several million Moslem citizens. It needs to earn their loyalty by showing respect for their faith.</p>

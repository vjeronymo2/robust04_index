			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Cleaner water costs mount Plans to improve drinking water in the EU, mainly by eliminating more lead, could cost member states more than Ecu50bn (Pounds 39m), a draft Commission document reckons. 'The estimated potential investment costs of the proposed changes in the (drinking water) directive are almost entirely associated with the change of the (limit) value for lead,' the draft proposal says. 'These costs could be of the order of Ecu50bn.' But 'it will be for member states to decide to what extent individual householders should replace lead pipes within their property,' the text says, adding that they could be given 15 years to bring their water up to scratch. According to Commission estimates France's bill could be as high as Ecu44.5bn and in England and Wales the costs could run to Ecu10.7bn. The draft proposal keeps the existing limit for individual pesticides but scraps a limit on the cumulative total. The European environmental bureau, which groups 150 environmental groups from 23 European countries, attacked the decision.</p>

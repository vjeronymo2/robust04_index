			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Model State Certification Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the development of any operator certification program, several key factors must be addressed. Among these factors is which personnel should be required to be certified. The EPA believes certification should not be limited to only the operator with hands-on control of the boiler. These operators may lack the authority to request the assistance of a repairman when equipment needs maintenance or service. Also these operators may not be authorized to take corrective action in the event of equipment malfunction. Such authority may rest with the operator's supervisor. This may be a shift supervisor, chief engineer, plant manager, etc. It is the operator's supervisor who is usually responsible for making critical decisions regarding operation and maintenance of the equipment. Because decisions made by the operator's supervisor are key to proper operation of the boiler, the operator's supervisor must have a broader level of understanding than the operator. Thus, there is a need for separate levels of certification for operators and operator supervisors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the level of knowledge needed by an operator or operator supervisor is dictated by the complexity of the equipment operated. For example, the knowledge required to operate a coal-fired boiler with an air pollution control system is greater than that required to operate a gas-fired boiler without an air pollution control system. It may not be reasonable to require an operator of a boiler without an air pollution control system to demonstrate knowledge of such equipment. Therefore, several classes of boiler operator certification should probably be developed for each operator certification level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, since, as the commenters have indicated, many boilers may operate with little or no operator attention, any certification program should consider including those individuals who perform the boiler tuning and maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another key area concerns the qualifications that an applicant should possess for certification. An acceptable level of skill and operating ability should be demonstrated on a boiler system which is equivalent to (or higher than) the class of boiler for which certification is being sought. This ``hands-on'' ability could be demonstrated by an on-site examination by a qualified/certified examiner or demonstration of ability before other certified operators who verify the applicant's ability. Also a consideration is the prior experience needed before applying for certification. The certification program should require some prior experience under the direct supervision of a certified operator/operator supervisor who verifies the proficiency of the applicant. Finally, an applicant should be required to successfully pass a written examination covering the areas of knowledge deemed necessary for the particular class/level of certification being sought. The written examination could be administered by the State or some authorized certification organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA's intention, announced in the October 6, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, for developing a model State certification program for high capacity fossil fuel-fired plants is to outline the scope and components that a State agency should include in a certification program. Components that should be considered for inclusion in any State developed or approved certification program are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Coverage of the Certification Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Determination of the type and size of boilers for which operator certification is appropriate. Boilers for which environmental regulations apply are candidates for inclusion in any certification program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Level of Operators To Be Certified <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The duties and responsibilities of the positions of the operator and operator supervisor should be established for the purpose of identifying facility personnel to whom certification applies at fossil fuel-fired plants. Certification for all persons who have control over the process and can affect process emissions should be included. This may include operators, supervisors, maintenance personnel, and outside contractor personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator is generally in direct control of the operation of a boiler system and is responsible for the startup, operation, and shutdown of equipment. Typical responsibilities may include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Operating equipment in accordance with established practices and procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Operating equipment consistent with applicable federal, state, and local government requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Identifying and initiating responses to upsets and emergency conditions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Identifying and communicating the need for equipment repairs and maintenance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Communicating with management when system operation is in noncompliance with applicable regulations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Operating in a safe manner;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Recording operational data as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator supervisor generally has direct responsibility for the operation of a boiler system and is responsible for overall on-site supervision, technical direction, management, and performance of the facility. Typical responsibilities may include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Supervising, training, monitoring, and evaluating operators;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Assuring operation in accordance with established practices and procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Assuring equipment is operated in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local government requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Failure to deliver what Russians most require (2) Sir, I recently started a company in London with a representative office in Moscow. My Russian contacts are desperate to buy all kinds of fast-moving consumer goods for immediate export to the Commonwealth of Independent States. I have been contacting many blue chip companies, in the UK and overseas, in order to obtain quotes for their products. I have evidently mistakingly assumed that during a time of recession in many part of the world, companies would be bending over backwards to sell their goods to whichever country wanted them. This apparently is not so. A small proportion of the companies I contacted took more than a week to respond, despite my requests for a prompt reply; most did not even bother to respond at all. What does one have to do to increase this country's export potential, or at least boost the order books of businesses which claim to be suffering from recession?

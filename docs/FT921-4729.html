			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: When the cat sat on the fax - The message on the growing feline menace to warm, whirring machines THE service engineer looked closely at the facsimile machine before gazing intently around the room. 'Where's the cat, then?' he demanded. He had called in response to my faxed request for service and had instantly diagnosed my trouble from the order letter, covered with myriad tiny black spots and criss-crossed with fine short strokes. The spots were grit from my cat's fur; the little fine lines were her hairs. All over Britain, it seems, cats are creating havoc on faxes and the number increases weekly. I was the third service call that morning resulting from damage to fax machines on which cats had lain, shedding fur and dirt. At that point Flirt, my cat, entered, stared with annoyance at the engineer and the dismembered fax machine and stalked out in characteristic feline dudgeon. 'It is a very widespread problem and nobody ever thinks about it until the faxes become messy, even illegible,' said my engineer. Cats seek out and sit on faxes, revelling in the consistent warmth. Flirt will often lie as though hugging the machine on which I have long since put a plastic cover plus a fabric cover. That is fine when I am here because, when the fax phone rings, I can remove Flirt, covers and all while, replacing the irritated animal when the faxing stops. When I am not at home, well, the fax is basically out of commission unless the door to that room is locked. In which case Flirt vents her frustration on the wallpaper in the hall, now in ribbons at the height of her out-stretched forepaws. Then she lies, resignedly, under a radiator. But, come summer and no radiators? My engineer had just come from an open-plan office, shared as a London headquarters by a clutch of small-business entrepreneurs who mostly worked from their homes. The office has a resident cat, some 14 years old, who sits on the fax. Nothing comes through except in screwed-up bits and pieces unless someone is present to keep the cat away. Some papers had got stuck in the works and the engineer had been clearing for some time. Nobody has the heart to exile the cat after all this time. A graphic artist in Kennington, London, lives, sleeps, eats and works in one large open-plan studio, no doors except to bathroom and loo. His cat steps off the fax when something is coming through, stands resignedly by the machine until the faxing ends, and steps back on to the fax when it is still. Fur and grit have filled the unreachable parts of the machine and the artist is now clearing space on a wardrobe shelf for the fax. A managing director, whose home office has French windows on to the garden, has to have them closed to keep the cat off his fax the family will not hear of locking up the cat so he can enjoy his garden while working at home. My own engineer suggested I allow Flirt to lie, as she once was wont to do, on my cable TV box because it is sufficiently sealed not to suffer. However, that does not work because, every time she rises to change her position she also changes the channel as she steps on the keys. A friend and I once settled down to watch a film preprogrammed for VCR recording in my absence. Our recording turned out to be a real mixture of flashes of horror, drama, romance, and sport as a result of Flirt's walkabouts on the cable box. The VCR is protected from Flirt by some creative ironmongery that keeps her off while allowing ventilation to the VCR. I have solved the problem. I remember, long ago, staying with the late Billy Butlin, at his luxury home near Ascot. Rows with his Welsh gardener had culminated in Taffy's stamping off, swearing never to return unless Bill fenced in the acreage dedicated to his beloved tropical birds, who flitted in trees to which heaters had been wired while herons waded in a specially-bulldozed lake. Taffy's problem was that the birds had eaten all the young bedding plants in the small, decorative garden near the house. Bill promised that the garden would be suitably fenced for Taffy and his spring planting. He kept his promise. Taffy came back expecting to see the large acreage of bird sanctuary expensively fenced in. But no. The small garden was fenced in while the birds continued to enjoy freedom. So I have 'fenced in' my fax. Finding no suitable, ventilated protective covers, I bought from my vet a white-painted aluminium cat-carrying cage in which the fax now lives (the hinged top having been removed until again needed). Suitable justice until an ingenious manufacturer starts producing anti-cat cages for fax machines. And Flirt? She lies on a thin cushion-against the back of the cage where some heat still emerges. She does not like it too much and rushes on to the machine every time the cage is removed. But she is resigned to it now.</p>

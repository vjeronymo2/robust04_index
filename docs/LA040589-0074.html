			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A sudden flash of natural steam with temperatures surpassing 600 degrees  injured three workers at the Navy's geothermal energy plant at the China Lake  Naval Weapons Center, authorities said. Sam Berry of Cal Energy, the company  that operates the 80-megawatt natural steam-driven facility, said the three men  were engulfed by the steam while cleaning screens in steam lines. It was the  first mishap at the new plant, which went into service Friday. George Wagner,  61, was in stable condition at Ridgecrest Hospital with first- and  second-degree burns over 40% of his body. William Bridgham, 30, and Brian  Cwetzig, 33, were treated and released. Steam at Coso Hot Springs, which powers  the electricity generating facility, is measured in excess of 600 degrees. The  geothermal project will eventually generate enough power to furnish electricity  to 160,000 homes.  </P></p>

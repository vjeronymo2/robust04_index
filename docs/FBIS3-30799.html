			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 9 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, today sent a letter to Vitaliy  Churkin, deputy minister for foreign affairs of the Russian  Federation. In the letter he points out that the Serb side  "cannot tolerate a situation in which the perpetrator of the  crime in Sarajevo's marketplace remains unidentified. Nor can  it tolerate the international community's tacit agreement that  this was done by the Serbs."    "If the truth is not established promptly the Muslim side  will continue to perpetrate crimes to fool the international  community while the Serbian people and the whole region will  experience an escalation and intensification of war," Radovan  Karadzic cautions in his letter.    The president of the Srpska republic demands that the  Russian  Government provide a neutral international group of experts to  compile a professional report. This team of experts should also  include, in addition to ballistics specialists, pathologists who  would investigate the causes and time of death of the civilian  victims.    Radovan Karadzic maintains that in the course of identifying  the true perpetrator of the massacre in Merkale marketplace one  should also analyze it politically, something President Yeltsin  has mentioned too. This analysis, Karadzic believes, would  indicate which side has made a political gain from this crime.    "We call on you and the Russian Government to provide such  an  expert report and appoint Russian ballistics experts,  pathologists, and political analysts to such an international  group of experts. It goes without saying that this group should  also include experts from the Serbian and Muslim side," Karadzic  writes in his letter to Churkin.</p>

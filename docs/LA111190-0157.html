			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. HITS 99 ON HEAT PARADE -- TOPS IN U.S.  </P> <P> Thermometers in El Toro topped all others in the United States on Saturday as a  record-breaking heat wave gripped Orange County, driving thousands of people to  the beaches and local parks and prompting nervous fire officials to watch the  tinder-dry hills.  </P> <P> The almost bone-dry heat was expected to cook the Southland throughout the  holiday weekend, ensuring that today's Veterans Day observances would be awash  in summer-like weather, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData,  which provides forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> Burback said that temperatures in the unincorporated South County community of  El Toro reached 99 degrees, making it the hottest spot in the country.  </P> <P> "I don't have anything warmer, not even in the deserts," Burback said.  </P> <P> The hot spell, exacerbated by almost no wind, was expected to begin easing up  Tuesday, with a marked drop in the mercury by Wednesday, when temperatures are  expected to fall back to the 70s.  </P> <P> That was good news for organizers of today's wreath-laying ceremony at the El  Toro Memorial Park on Trabuco Road, who watched their Memorial Day  wreath-laying plans wash out due to rainy weather.  </P> <P> "That's super. I love it," said Georgia Bent, a spokeswoman for the hourlong  Veterans Day ceremony, which will include readings of a selection of letters  from service personnel stationed in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> But the heat wave caused fire officials to worry that any resumption of Santa  Ana winds may spell trouble in the parched canyons around the county. If winds  begin blowing to about 25 m.p.h., Young said, the department's stations will be  put on red-flag warning and strike teams will be staged in at least two areas.  </P> <P> "This weekend, we will monitor (the hills) real closely," Orange County Fire  Department Capt. Dan Young said. "The message to get out there is that fire  season is not over."  </P> <P> Outside of El Toro, other cities, including Huntington Beach, which is normally  cooled by ocean breezes, produced temperatures that rose above 90 degrees,  meteorologist Burback said. In fact, he added, most cities were reporting  temperatures more than 20 degrees above the average for this time of November.  </P> <P> At 12:30 p.m., a bank sign located a few blocks from the Huntington Beach  Municipal Pier flashed a temperature reading of 96 degrees.  </P> <P> Temperatures throughout the area topped the county's record of 94 degrees, set  in 1956 in Santa Ana. (Historical temperature records are kept only for Santa  Ana.) Santa Ana's high temperature for Saturday was 93 degrees.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Civic Center reported 93 degrees, tying the record set for the  date in 1956. Los Angeles International Airport also recorded a high of 93  degrees. High temperatures in other cities included: Long Beach, 96;  Montebello, 92; Torrance, 92, and Woodland Hills, 91. The relative humidity  ranged from 13% to 42%.  </P> <P> Burback said the heat wave was due to a high-pressure zone that has been  trapped above the entire West Coast for the past few days by two low-pressure  troughs, one in the Pacific Ocean and one over the Northeast.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the unusual weather transformed the fall season into just another  summer day, turning people's attentions to thoughts of outdoor recreation.  </P> <P> By the tens of thousands, Orange County residents attempted to beat the heat by  wading or surfing in the unusually warm waters of the county's beaches or just  relaxing under the shade trees of the county's regional parks.  </P> <P> Surfer Lloyd Ly, 25, paddled out into the water south of the Huntington Beach  pier about 10 a.m. But by noon, he was finally forced back to shore to peel off  his blue, orange and black wet suit.  </P> <P> "You can't sit out there on your board for more than about five minutes without  beginning to sweat," Ly said, adding that the only way to stay comfortable in  his suit was to repeatedly slide off the board and into the 65-degree water. "I  can't believe it's this hot. It's hotter than the summer was."  </P> <P> Neither could Mike Murray, a transplant from Ohio, who stood ankle deep in the  surf and expertly twirled a Frisbee.  </P> <P> "Now this is nice," said Murray, clad only in baggy trunks, as he practiced for  a Frisbee spinning competition. "I'll call home today to a couple of friends of  mine to rub it in."  </P> <P> Although some halfheartedly groused about the unseasonably warm weather that  hit the coast 12 days before Thanksgiving, most cheerfully basked in the  luxurious weather.  </P> <P> "It is just unbelievably wonderful," said Moshe Ovadia, a 35-year-old Miami  resident who was visiting his sister for the weekend. The two were savoring the  dry heat as they strolled around a lake at Fountain Valley's Mile Square  Regional Park.  </P> <P> "I came prepared for a different kind of weather," he said, pointing to his  long pants as others around him jogged along the footpath in neon-colored  shorts. "But I'm very pleasantly surprised."  </P> <P> At Rancho La Cienega Recreation Center in southwest Los Angeles, children were  lined up waiting to get into the pool at its 2 p.m. opening time.  </P> <P> "Last week, they came bundled up in jackets and warm clothes," said Deven  Bouchet, the weekend pool manager. "Today, they were in T-shirts and shorts,  some of them carrying skateboards."  </P> <P> Lifeguard Mitch White said that about 20,000 people made the trek to Newport  Beach to cool off in the water. Thousands more, however, crowded the streets of  the coastal city to stroll along Balboa Peninsula.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are just walking around," White said. "It's a great day."  </P> <P> Although the official high temperature for the city was 80 degrees, White said  it reached 87 at the lifeguard station, located on Newport Pier.  </P> <P> "It felt like a blisteringly hot day here," he said. "I almost fainted."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TEMPERATURES SOAR  </P> <P> Summer-like mercury readings broke recoerds and sent Orange County residents in  search of cooling recreation Saturday.  </P> <P> El Toro: 99  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano: 97  </P> <P> Santa Ana: 93  </P> <P> Anaheim: 92  </P> <P> Newport Beach: 80  </P></p>

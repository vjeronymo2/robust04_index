			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Capital becomes a burden for banks: A turning point marked by Lloyds' bid for C&amp;G Amid the ructions set off by Lloyds Bank's announcement last week that it was bidding Pounds 1.8bn for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, one non-event with profound implications for banks passed nearly unnoticed. Lloyds' debt ratings were not downgraded by international ratings agencies. Both Standard &amp; Poor's and IBCA affirmed their ratings of the safety of Lloyds debt despite the fact that it intends to remove up to Pounds 940m of its Pounds 3.2bn capital at a single stroke. For bankers who believe they must hold more and more capital to satisfy agencies, this may prove a revelation. Beyond the matter of ratings, Lloyds' decision to leverage its capital by adding to assets through acquisition could prove an important turning point. It has occurred as bankers muse ever more loudly about whether they have been pushed by regulators and agencies into holding too much capital. The trend towards banks holding more capital against assets such as loans emerged from two events. One was the realisation in the mid-1980s that banks such as Citicorp had been leveraging assets so aggressively to increase returns that they had difficulty coping with credit shocks. Along with this general perception that banks had become too risky - and therefore too volatile as investments - came the 1988 Basle accord between international bank regulators. This set higher benchmarks for capital by insisting that all banks should hold minimum ratios of capital to assets. The trend since then has been towards holding more capital, helped in the US by the Federal Reserve's policy of creating a sharply positive interest rate yield curve to allow banks to rebuild capital. The yield curve also ensured that all banks could achieve good returns on this capital cushion. Banks engaged in operations requiring high ratings - such as selling derivatives - have had to boost capital further. The average ratio of tier one capital - equity and retained earnings - to risk-weighted assets among US banks last year was 9.4 per cent, more than twice the Basle minimum. Yet two events have led to bankers questioning whether the trend will now reverse. One is the tightening of US monetary policy, which makes it harder to make risk-free profits. The second is the emergence of stable low inflation - and so lower demand for loans - in many countries. These two factors have led bankers to ask whether they can afford to keep accumulating capital. If they do so without being able to expand balance sheets through lending, then their capital will be under-utilised, and they will find it much harder to achieve target returns on equity. Before the C&amp;G bid emerged, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, was signalling that the bank would have to find new ways of leveraging capital in a low inflation environment. At a recent seminar held by Hoare Govett, the broker, he argued that banks could not afford to under-utilise capital. Lloyds had a more pressing problem than other banks because it had retained earnings, and reduced the degree to which its capital was leveraged by its assets, for longer. Its leverage ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets had fallen from 17.3 per cent in 1990 to 13.5 per cent last year. This accumulation of cash was making it progressively more difficult to maintain returns on equity. As Mr Pitman said: 'The question is how to make the most efficient use of capital. We have grown our capital faster than our assets . . . We have got almost more capital than we need.' Lloyds' answer has become clear: to reduce capital while boosting assets through acquisition. Its tier one ratio is expected to fall to about 5 per cent from the current 6.6 per cent at the end of next year because of the goodwill element in the C&amp;G acquisition, although it should then rebuild. Ratings agencies believe that Lloyds can take this in its stride. 'Five per cent is not a fantastic ratio, but it is certainly liveable-with,' says Mr Robin Monro-Davies, IBCA managing director. He argues that Lloyds' ability to generate retained earnings should soon rebuild its capital. Lloyds' more aggressive use of capital already has implicit support at other banks - notably National Westminster, which has a relatively low 5.7 per cent tier one ratio. Mr Richard Goeltz, its chief financial officer, argues that there are dangers in banks accumulating too much capital. Mr Goeltz says that forcing banks towards higher tier one ratios may encourage them to lend more riskily in order to raise equity returns. 'More than a few of the problems of the 1980s can be attributed to the attempt to enhance earnings with questionable lending decisions,' he says. Such issues have led Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, into a review of how much capital the bank needs. Barclays last year set itself a target tier one ratio of 6 per cent - which it has now achieved. However, it has yet to approach its target return on equity of 15 per cent. Mr Taylor says that one advantage of strong capital is that it allows a more sophisticated approach to risk management than categorising assets by regulators' broad risk-weightings. 'Regulatory capital does not distinghish between good and bad companies, and you might want to do that,' he says. One problem facing big banks is that they are made up of a mix of businesses which have different capital requirements. Their investment banking arms rely on high credit ratings to attract business from big companies. But branch banking arms do not need anything more than adequate capital backing. This internal conflict does not afflict Lloyds as strongly because it has no investment banking operation. The most worrying possibility for other banks as they re-assess their need for capital is that they may not be able to reach the same clear answer as Lloyds has implicity declar-ed. But even Lloyds will only put off the problem temporarily by buying C&amp;G. One reason for the bid being well-received by ratings agencies is that it may further strengthen Lloyds' ability to generate capital. If so, it will not be long before the bank again has to find a way of leveraging it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------             BANKS AND THEIR FINANCIAL MUSCLE  -----------------------------------------------------------------                           Barclays   NatWest   Lloyds   Midland  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *Equity capital (pounds)    6.11bn    5.88bn   3.16bn   2.67bn** Tier 1 ratio (per cent)          6       5.7      6.6        6.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------                           Abbey        Royal Bank      TSB*                           National    of Scotland *Equity capital (pounds)    3.39bn       1.9bn**     1.35bn Tier 1 ratio (per cent)        9.4           6.9        8.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *TSB year-end Oct 31, Royal Bank Sept 30, others Dec 31 **Shareholders' funds, others tier 1 capital  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

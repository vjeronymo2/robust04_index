			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku, January 4 (AZERTAC)--Yesterday, President  Aliyev and Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev, supreme commander  of the Russian Federation Frontiers Defence Forces, discussed on  the question of ensuring the CIS frontiers security.    The Azerbaijani president expressed his readiness to  cooperate in the field of protection of the border between the  two countries as well as the frontiers between the Commonwealth  and its neighbours. According to him, both issues mentioned are  narrowly related to one another and must be dealt with together.  The president thinks that this approach is in accordance with  the spirit of the treaty on common security of the CIS. Urgent  measures in order to implement the Treaty have recently been  evaluated out at the Ashgabat summit. In respect to this, Mr.  Aliyev has expressed his concern about the situation in Azeri  districts bordering Armenia. 170 kms of the frontier between  the two countries are under control of Armenian troops.  President Aliyev also pointed out that the frontier between  Azerbaijan and Armenia has turned into an arena of military  operations.    The commander-in-chief of the Russian frontier troops is  giving priority to the reinforcement of the security of  frontiers between the CIS and neighbouring countries. He has  pointed out that it was necessary to coordinate measures to be  taken in this context. Russia and Azerbaijan have to work out a  definite concept of how to cooperate in this field, he said.    In his short statement made to the local media, Mr. Andrey  Nikolayev said that negotiations would continue, including the  issue of mutual cooperation as far as the frontiers protection  is concerned. Mr. Nikolayev evaded a question on plans of the  possible stationing of Russian frontier troops on the border  between Azerbaijan and Iran. Everything depends on the eventual  terms agreed upon by both parties, he said.</p>

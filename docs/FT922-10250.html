			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed at Shiloh Shiloh saw pre-tax profits dip from Pounds 659,383 to Pounds 502,782 over the year to March 28 as recession affected its textile spinning, healthcare and packaging activities in the second half. Turnover rose to Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 19m) after three acquisitions. Some 76 per cent of profit and 52 per cent of turnover emanated from the healthcare side, although pressure on margins and lower than budgeted activity prevented the group gaining full benefits from acquisitions. Earnings eased to 5.82p (7.98p); a final dividend of 1.875p brings the total for the year to 2.75p (2.625p).</p>

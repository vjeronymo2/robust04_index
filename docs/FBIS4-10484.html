			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy returned to the  country at noon on 9 April after visiting Belgium and France. On  arriving at the airport he reviewed his main activities in  Europe. In view of the fact that in Europe he had reiterated his  desire to privatize state enterprises, he was asked about the  Senate's determination not to privatize ANDE [National Electric  Power Administration], Corposana [Water and Sanitation  Corporation], Antelco [National Telecommunications  Administration], and INC [National Cement Industry]. He answered  that he fully respected the senators' decisions, but he made it  clear that he will inform himself fully of the scope of that  decision and will speak afterward with the senators. "It is not  a question of talking about privatizing enterprises.... For  example in ANDE's case, the distribution, maintenance,  invoicing, etc., can be privatized. This can even be done  through bids or with the private sector," he insisted.    He commented that he had asked for "fresh resources in terms  of foreign investment, nonreturnable cooperation, and the  financing of the expansion of social programs." He stressed that  he had received the EC's commitment to support these plans, and  that, of course, he had discussed our democratic process. He  also stated that he had discussed the situation of the Pilcomayo  River, state reform, the third stage of industrial reconversion,  and the Chaco's sustainable development, etc. He gave no details  on these points.    He then said: "It is not the government's idea to get the  country into debt, but to advance in accordance with our  possibilities so as not to affect the pocket and stomach of the  people.    "I have spoken about the openness of our government in the  sense that governments and the armed and police forces are  always accused of corruption. Moreover, in some European  countries the winners of bids even figure on their balance  sheets the commissions they pay to Latin American countries," he  said. He announced that, together with other chiefs of state,  they hope to "submit a project of openness" during the meeting  they will have with President Bill Clinton on 9 and 10 December  in Miami, Florida, referring to the Summit of the Americas.    He announced that he had found the possibility of  modernizing  our railway in order to count on a rapid transit system between  Asuncion and neighboring towns. He even spoke of the intention  of connecting Asuncion with Itaipu Lake and finally with the  [Paraguay-Parana River] waterway through a railway system. A  mission is going to come for the technical studies, but for the  time being there are no details. Finally, he admitted that our  country is unknown in Europe. "I am pained to see that we are  not known in the world," he said.</p>

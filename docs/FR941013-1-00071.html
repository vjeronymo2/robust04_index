The MACT floor for existing tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities is determined to be use of covers on tanks managing wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. This floor determination is based on consideration of data for site-specific tank management practices reported at 540 of the 710 hazardous waste TSDF and existing EPA air emission standards for tanks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA's review of its tank data base for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category indicates that most tanks (significantly more than 12 percent) managing waste or recoverable materials containing organic HAP are covered tanks. A small portion of these tanks also are reported to use more effective air emission controls such as venting the tank to a control device or using a floating roof on the tank. However, the higher level of air emission control achieved by this segment of tanks does not represent the average of the top 12 percent of tanks listed in the data base. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control technology for the existing tank MACT floor is use of a cover. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For other source categories, the EPA has established the need to use a cover or other air emission controls on a tank based on a characteristic parameter of the materials placed in the tank. The EPA believes that using this approach provides an effective and enforceable means for applying air emission controls to those tanks with the potential for organic air emissions and not requiring the unnecessary installation of controls on tanks with no or little potential for organic air emissions. Consequently, to complete the definition of the MACT floor for tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities, an applicability cutoff provision (referred to hereafter in this notice as an ``action level'') is needed to distinguish the tanks at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities that need to use air emission controls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the need to periodically confirm that a material placed in a tank remains below the action level selected to determine applicability, the indicator parameter must be in a format that is relatively simple to determine by an affected facility owner or operator and can be expeditiously checked by EPA or State enforcement personnel. Considering this requirement, the EPA evaluated possible action level formats and decided that an action level format based on the volatile organic HAP concentration of the materials as determined using EPA Method 305 is appropriate for identifying those tanks used for off-site waste and recovery operations that are expected to have little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

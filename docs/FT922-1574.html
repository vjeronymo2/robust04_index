			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Rewards at Ecobrasil Sir, The commitment of Britain's gallant few to seeking exports at Ecobrasil ('British business left in the cold', June 10) was matched and encouraged by the Department of Trade and Industry with financial support and by our consulate general in Sao Paulo with its first class commercial intelligence and administrative assistance. We found David Maclean, minister of the environment, who visited us, to be excellent value. The political uncertainty surrounding the Earth Summit in Rio deterred many exporters, not just British, from exhibiting at Ecobrasil. Participation by companies in all of the national pavilions was well down on first estimates. The determination of 'our few' has been well rewarded. While we did not see many delegates from the Earth Summit (far less FT correspondents]), those of us new to the Brasilian market, and those already established, were delighted with the results of their participation in Ecobrasil. David Stagg, Trade Fair Support, 71 Bank Street, Maidstone ME14 1SN.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aydin Mekhtiyev: "Who Will Get First Oil </F> Rights?--The Smell of Caspian Fuel Is Exciting the World"]    [Text] The Russian Federation leadership has informed  official London that the project to develop Caspian Sea basin  oil fields and to transport this oil to the European countries  will not have legal force without preliminary coordination with  Moscow. Reporting on this sensational development, the British  publication FINANCIAL TIMES noted that Brian Fall, Great  Britain's ambassador to Moscow, was handed a letter drafted in  Smolensk Square. The document emphasizes that the consent of all  countries having an outlet to the Caspian Sea is required in  order to begin implementation of the "oil" project.    Thus, on the eve of the signing of an agreement between the  Azerbaijan Government and a consortium of Western companies  marking the start of the "project of the century," with a total  cost of $7 billion, Moscow declared it had rights to the richest  oil fields--Azeri and Chyrag, which the Western countries and  the United States had acknowledged as belonging exclusively to  Azerbaijan. Taking into account the reliability of the  publication that publicized Moscow's demarche on this issue (it  is well known that the reputation of FINANCIAL TIMES in the West  is so great that important government decisions are sometimes  made based on information reported by the newspaper), one may  draw the conclusion that the struggle between the Russian oil  giant Lukoil and Western companies to control rights to  Azerbaijan oil is entering its decisive phase. It is not by  chance, it is felt, that London was informed of Moscow's  position on the "oil" question. After all, the British company  British Petroleum (BP) obtained priority rights from Baku to  develop the Caspian oil fields, while the British Government  assured President Geydar Aliyev that it was prepared to be the  guarantor of fulfillment of BP's obligations as envisaged by the  contract. From the very beginning of talks with the Azerbaijan  Government on the question of oil extraction, the Western  capitals were not euphoric about the "project of the century."  Experts predicted that Russia, considering itself the legal  successor to the collapsed USSR, could hardly be expected to  renounce its rights to the Caspian oil. Perhaps this is not so  much an economic issue as a purely political one. Over the  course of seven decades, it has been in Moscow that decisions  were made as to what volumes of Caspian oil should be produced  and for what needs it should be utilized. The lion's share of  the profits from Baku oil settled in the USSR budget, but not  only did Azerbaijan not derive any benefit whatsoever from this,  it also received as an inheritance from the former USSR the  so-called "Karabakh problem." Now the republic, weakened by six  years of war and with a quarter of its territory under  occupation by Armenian troops, had gotten an opportunity to  independently manage Caspian oil. According to preliminary  estimates, even in the first years of development of the Azeri  and Chyrag oil fields by the Western consortium, total  production volume would amount to approximately 30-40 million  tonnes of oil per year, which would mainly be exported to  European countries. According to the calculations of Azeri  specialists, petrodollars would turn the republic into one of  the richest countries of the former USSR, even before the end of  the present century. Consequently, the war with Armenia for the  right to control Nagornyy Karabakh would be concluded in  Azerbaijan's favor. The prospect of emergence of a Transcaucasus  country that is independent from Moscow in a financial respect  evokes serious anxiety, from all appearances, not just in  Yerevan. Officials in the Russian capital also realize the  possible consequences of implementation of the "oil" project.  One possible way of maintaining influence over Azerbaijan  consists of reestablishing Russia's military presence in this  Transcaucasian republic. Moscow is insisting on immediate  introduction of its peacemaking forces into Azerbaijan. However,  the West is suspicious of the Kremlin's military preparations.  It is no accident that Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs  Andrey Kozyrev admitted during the course of a meeting with U.S.  Senator Sam Nunn: "We are being accused of neoimperialism, the  assertion being made that a political agreement must first be  signed, and only afterwards can peacemaking forces be sent to  Karabakh."    Moscow's demand addressed to the West that Russian  Federation  consent be obtained for implementation of the "oil" project is  based on the theory that the status of the Caspian Sea is  indeterminate. The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs  considers the Caspian a border lake and believes negotiations  must be held among all the Caspian countries with respect to  dividing the Caspian water area into sectors. In this regard,  Baku rejects Russian attempts to place in doubt the fact that  the Azeri and Chyrag oil fields belong to Azerbaijan.  Incidentally, Baku has not received from the Russian leadership  a copy of the letter sent to the British side. Nonetheless, the  leadership of the republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to  Thomas Yang, Great Britain's ambassador to Azerbaijan, that  attempts to impede the signing of the "oil" contract were  without foundation, since in November of last year during the  course of a visit to Baku, Yuriy Shafranik, Russian Federation  Minister of Fuel and Energy signed a protocol with the  Azerbaijan Government confirming that Azeri and Chyrag belonged  to Azerbaijan.    Simultaneously with its demand for determination of the  status of the Caspian on an international level, Moscow  intensified efforts in another direction as well. The secretary  general of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was  sent a letter containing the oblique demand for diplomatic  pressure to be exerted on Ankara with the aim of not permitting  shipping restrictions in the straits of the Bosporus and  Dardanelles. Moscow accuses Ankara of violating the Montreux  Convention of 1936. The struggle for the straits is closely  linked with the project for extraction and transportation of  Caspian oil discussed above. In restricting movement in the  straits, Ankara is letting Moscow know that it does not support  Russian Federation intentions to use the Bosporus and  Dardanelles in the near future for transporting oil out of  Central Asia and Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Need to Modify the January 11, 1993 Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The January 11, 1993 Regulations can be Read to Give Utilities the Ability to Bring Phase II Units Into Phase I and Create Excess, New Allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated regulations that implemented the major provisions of title IV, including the substitution and reduced utilization provisions. As discussed in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60951&hyph;60953), these provisions can be read to provide utilities two alternative methods of bringing into Phase I, with few limitations, selected Phase II units and creating excess, new allowances. The Agency concludes that both provisions must be revised in order to eliminate this problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;72.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the designated representative for a unit on Table A may include in the Phase I permit application a substitution plan designating, as substitution units, one or more existing units that are Phase II units and so not on Table A. 40 CFR 72.41(b) (1993). There is no express requirement that the substitution unit make reductions beyond those that it would have made without the plan or actually provide allowances for the Table A unit and no express limit on the number of substitution units that a Table A unit may designate. Further, for the most part, the decision whether to designate a particular Phase II unit as a substitution unit is at the discretion of the utility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58 FR 60952.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 72.43 of the January 11, 1993 regulations requires, under certain circumstances, that the designated representative for a Phase I unit submit a reduced utilization plan designating a compensating unit. Such a plan must be submitted if the owners and operators of the unit plan to reduce utilization of the unit below its baseline for purposes of complying with Phase I emissions limitations and to accomplish this by shifting generation to a non-Phase I unit. 40 CFR 72.43(b) (1993). Because of concern that utilities would be unable to designate compensating units and therefore might engage in uneconomic dispatching to avoid reduced utilization requiring such designations, the regulation establishes broad exceptions to the requirement to submit a plan. 40 CFR 72.43(e) (1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60958&hyph;60959. There is no express requirement that the Phase I unit actually have any reduced utilization or the compensating unit actually provide any compensating generation to the Phase I unit. There is also no express limit on the number of compensating units that a Phase I unit may designate and no express bar on a compensating unit itself designating a compensating unit. Further, as with substitution units, a utility's decision to designate a compensating unit is largely discretionary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60952.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because utilities generally have broad discretion and flexibility in designating substitution and compensating units, such units will likely be designated only if early entry into Phase I is beneficial, e.g., where early entry creates new allowances because the units have lower actual emissions in Phase I than the allowances they will receive as substitution or compensating units.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60953 and n. 2. Before the enactment of title IV, some Phase II units had reduced emissions rates for economic or other reasons and some States had already adopted laws requiring their utilities to reduce emissions rates prior to Phase II. Such reductions occurred, or will occur, for reasons independent of the substitution and reduced utilization provisions. Under the January 11, 1993 regulations, for each Phase I year that a substitution or reduced utilization plan is in effect, each substitution or compensating unit under the plan is allocated a number of allowances equal to the unit's baseline times the lesser of the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate for the unit. 40 CFR 72.41(c)(3) and (d) and 72.43(c)(4)(ii) and (d) (1993). Consequently, some Phase II units may enter Phase I as substitution or compensating units and convert emission rate reductions into excess, new allowances: i.e., allowances that would not otherwise be available and that reflect emission rate reductions that would occur even without plans allowing early entry into Phase I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The excess, new allowances may become available to affected units in Phase I and/or in Phase II and enable such units to avoid making emissions reductions that title IV would otherwise require them to make. These allowances may thereby diminish the emissions reductions that Congress intended to be achieved by virtue of title IV. In sum, as explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble, the January 11, 1993 regulations transform the statutory substitution and reduced utilization provisions from provisions for facilitating and protecting anticipated emissions reductions under title IV into potential means of creating excess, new allowances that can be used to avoid such reductions. (58 FR 60953.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the regulations provide alternative means (through substitution plans or reduced utilization plans) of creating excess, new allowances, the regulations are contrary to Congressional intent and sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act and therefore must be modified to eliminate both alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Under the January 11, 1993 Regulations, Entry of Phase II Units Into Phase I can Significantly Compromise the Emissions Reduction Goals of Title IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential number of excess, new allowances created by substitution and compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations may be sufficient to compromise significantly the achievement of the emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. The Agency estimates that entry into Phase I of Phase II units that will benefit from becoming substitution or compensating units and that reduced emissions rates between 1985 and 1991 for economic or other reasons or were required by federal or State law as of November 15, 1990 to reduce emissions rates between 1985 and 1995 will create about 200,000 allowances per year in Phase I in excess of emissions without such entry. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60953 and n. 4; and Calculation of Potential Impacts of Phase I Substitution Units, ICF Inc. at 5 (July 7, 1993). Thus, the current substitution and reduced utilization provisions will potentially result in the creation of excess, new allowances authorizing additional emissions of 1,000,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in all of Phase I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This is a conservative estimate of the potential for creation of excess, new allowances. Assuming that all 250 designated substitution and compensating units in existing permit applications are activated as substitution units for all of Phase I, about 385,000 excess, new allowances will be created per year under the January 11, 1993 regulations. Assuming all existing Phase II units (about 2,000 units) will become substitution units for all of Phase I, almost 1,000,000 excess, new allowances will be created per year in Phase I under the January 11, 1993 regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Estimates of Allowances Impact of Proposed Permits Rule Revisions and Alternative Regulatory Scenarios at 3, 8, and 52 (Oct. 20, 1993) (comparing ``totals'' for allowance allocations under ``existing'' rule and ``proposed'' rule). The Agency's 200,000-allowance estimate reflects the assumption that only those units (about 200 to 300 units) with projected 1995 emissions lower than their 1985 level will be likely to become substitution units under the current regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation of Potential Impacts of Phase I Substitution Units at B-4 (``total'' of units with ``SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  decrease'' under ``CAT7'') (July 7, 1993). That estimate also assumes that some allowances that will be created will result from reduced utilization and will be subject to surrender to EPA under &sect;&sect;72.91 and 72.92 of the regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at 7 and 9. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

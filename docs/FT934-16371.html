			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Italians unveil plan to shed 11,600 steel jobs ILVA, the loss-making, state-run steel group, has unveiled plans to axe over a quarter of its 40,000-strong workforce in response to EC pressure to cut Italy's over-capacity and end state subsidies. The job cuts are part of Ilva's plan to split the group into two companies - flat products and special steels - in order to privatise. The project is due to be decided at the end of the month by the Ilva board, headed by Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese executive brought in earlier this year to reorganise the group. According to the plan, 11,600 jobs will be lost between 1994-96, the bulk of which will come from the workforce producing flat products at Taranto, Europe's largest steel plant, and Novi Ligure, near Genoa. Some 5,000 workers already laid off will not be re-hired. This is a far more radical solution than originally envisaged. It has been drawn up in the past three months after the government recognised the EC would only be satisfied with a clear commitment to rationalise Ilva. The trades unions have been warned well in advance and their protests are likely to be directed less at the job cuts than at the redundancy terms, retraining and investments in fresh employment - especially in the Taranto area of southern Italy. Ilva currently has debts of L8,400bn (Dollars 5.33bn) and in order to split the group into two for privatisation a complex book-keeping operation is expected to take place where some L5,800bn is written off. The main battle will be over the future of Taranto and the smaller flat products plant at Novi Ligure. One proposal is that Lucchini, the Brescia-based private group, take over the flat products. Lucchini has already acquired Ilva's Piombino works with France's Usinor-Sacilor, and the unions see the latter lurking behind its offer. A second proposal, apparently favoured by Mr Nakamura is that a group of local businessmen back a management buy-out in conjunction with commitments to the work-force.</p>

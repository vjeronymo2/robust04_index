			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alcoa slides to Dollars 16.7m deficit in fourth term Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer, reported a loss of Dollars 16.7m, or 20 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, as the US company was battered by the continued deterioration in prices for primary aluminium and for aluminium sheet used for beverage cans. The loss is a reversal of the fourth quarter of 1992, when Alcoa earned Dollars 49m, or 57 cents a share, before an extraordinary accounting charge. Including a previously-announced extraordinary charge of Dollars 70.2m, or 80 cents a share, which was taken to cover the cost of severance for 1,600 employees and the closure of some manufacturing operations, Alcoa's loss totalled Dollars 86.9m, or Dollars 1 a share, in the quarter. The company's sales fell to Dollars 2.3bn in the quarter, from Dollars 2.5bn in the fourth quarter a year ago. For the full year, Alcoa had earnings of Dollars 79.3m or 88 cents a share before special charges, compared with Dollars 196.3m, or Dollars 2.27 a share before extraordinary charges in 1992. Full-year sales were Dollars 9.1bn, slightly below the previous year's Dollars 9.5bn. Alcoa had remained profitable through the third quarter while other aluminium companies were suffering losses. The company said that it had succeeded in trimming costs, but that the decline in costs had not kept pace with the precipitous decline in aluminium prices.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> UCLA VISION '89 SHOWCASES PROMISING FILM MAKERS  </P> <P> A year-end outpouring of student films is always a grab bag, but some elements  are constant: idealism and raw energy, awkwardness and sincerity,  overreachingly lofty ideas and good simple ones. To judge by the works  prescreened for the weeklong UCLA Vision '89, opening tonight, some lovely  talent is coming to fruition.  </P> <P> Tonight, which opens with a tribute to director and teacher Dorothy Arzner,  contains two personal favorites. "Sand Dance" is an animation done literally  with sand, although heaven alone knows how, since Richard Quade's little,  longing jazz dancer seems even more evocative than a drawn character. "Sand  Dance" is so deft, so technically challenging and so charming, it's not  surprising that its four fascinating minutes have already won this year's  student film award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the  animation division. Do not miss this.  </P> <P> Then there is "Caruthers," a character study of an engaging, rather marginal  singer working a desolate job somewhere in a Death Valley roadhouse, and the  sultry, enigmatic young woman who crosses his path. This is all atmosphere,  longing, delicate innuendo, with a pair of full-blown performances, by Tom  McCray and Audrey Wells, that are absolute knockouts. Writer-director Bruce  Muller is masterly in his handling of actors, at mood and telling detail; a  little less brilliant at hard-core storytelling. But as this bittersweet  evocation catches you, it may make you, too, forgiving of its rather wispy  plot.  </P> <P> Also tonight is "Arena," Niel Mueller's ambitious, fragmented story about a  frenetic stand-up comedian (Joe Marinelli) who turns everything into fodder for  his routines. It's given him control on stage and chaos when he's off. Although  Marinelli is lively, the outstanding moments belong to Talia Balsam as the  put-upon love of his life, and at almost 40 minutes the film begins to spin its  wheels even more emptily than its hero does.  </P> <P> Sunday's documentary evening begins with "China Diary," an already interesting  film that has had the white heat of topicality thrust upon it. Film maker  Jinhua Yang, raised in China during the cultural revolution, went back to  Beijing and Shanghai in late 1986 after five years of study in the United  States and found things so radically changed that her astonishment echoes  throughout her film. Yang reels from an individually owned beauty parlor to a  radiator factory and a rural hotel now owned by "the peasants." She encounters  the richest peasant entrepreneur of a small town living in a house with  catalogue-ordered Louis XIV furniture and toy dogs for his children, all with  their heavy plastic slipcovers intact. "I don't know what to make of this  economic success," Yang broods.  </P> <P> Even more suspect is a swimsuit-judged beauty contest for the government  airlines, who press film maker Yang into jury duty as a visiting celebrity. The  once-unthinkable unveiling of all this flesh leaves her shaken and sad: "Is  this real beauty?" she worries. No, but it's real capitalism. If you want to  meet some of the people and understand some of the ferment behind the tragedy  we've all been watching on television, try "China Diary." It's riveting.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, Two films, Molly A. Strange's "Dream of the Unbroken," and  Edgar Michael Bravo's "Mi Casa," seem wrenched out of personal feeling. In the  first, the subject is incest and sexual molestation, as an 11-year-old daughter  deals with her torrential feelings. Abandonment is also the concern of the  brief second film as an 8-year-old Mexican boy in Los Angeles watches his  family disintegrate. Bravo inclines toward the stagy, but his ending is  desolate and real and so is the actor playing the father.  </P> <P> You may feel you've gone through the Angst of one of the Wednesday-night  entries, Javier Gomez-Serrano's "An Unhappy Ending," more than once before in  student films, but the power of this aphoristic love/death story comes from the  director's splendid eye, from the beautiful black-and-white photography and  from the exceptionally haunting and inventive musical score.  </P> <P> Melodrama seems to have afflicted the two prescreened Thursday-night films like  flu germs. Angela Barton's earnest, self-righteous "Taking the Rap for Eve"  plays like outtakes from a '60s consciousness-raising session, but it's a lot  less fun. "Il Finale" by Russell Martin, about two Cuban emigres trying to  rebuild their lives in Los Angeles, begins very interestingly but, as one man  finds a job and his lover holds out for a more worthy one, the story turns into  purest soap opera.  </P> <P> The program ends Saturday with a show of strength, after a tribute to UCLA  alumnus Colin Higgins. Donald Bull's "The Last Five Hours," a contemporary  criss-crossed romance, is genuinely comic and genially cool; its three  principal actors -- Kenny Ransom, Laura Hinto and Kevin Han Yee -- are  splendid, with Ransom's beleaguered boyfriend particularly memorable. In  "Twilight" Scott Alberts animates a walk through the woods at that magic time  with a pair of friendly children and turns it into an affectionate, Dr.  Seuss-like event. Donald Matos' "The Other Side" about three Latino street kids  and a white horse is marked by extraordinary black-and-white photography by  David Swett and real affinity for the subject. Then there's director Steve  Anderson's "Hearts of Stone," which imagines Los Angeles gang warfare settled  by combat between a "warrior" from each faction and a game of Russian roulette.  Anderson, too, is stronger than his dialogue (skip this if realistically raw  language offends you) but powerful at evoking mood and tension.  </P> <P> Each night's starting time is different, so be advised to check: (213) 825-8710  or 206-5331.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (8): Grievances shed some useful light / Profile of Uralmash The advertisement outside the gates of recently-privatised Uralmash, Russia's biggest heavy engineering company, promises great hope for the future. 'New Times, New Ideas, New Frontiers. Uralmash - the Guarantee of Your Success.' But the reality at the factory in President Boris Yeltsin's home town of Yekaterinburg gives less cause for cheer. Mr Victor Korovin, Uralmash's 41-year-old director, finds adjusting the company to the new circumstances of Russia's market economy tougher than he expected when it was privatised last year. Mr Korovin is one of a breed of younger managers who have welcomed radical market reforms. His grievances, which are not the whinings of old-style managers who have no idea of how to cope, shed useful light on the long-term problems facing the flagships of Russian industry. For all its reformist zeal, Uralmash is caught in a vicious squeeze - by its sheer size, built up in the Soviet past when big was beautiful and quality irrelevant, and by a dearth of investment finance to make it more competitive for the future. Far from warning that the company is on the verge of collapse, as many directors do when they try to squeeze subsidies from the government, Mr Korovin says Uralmash will survive - but will continue a gradual decline. 'There is no money for investment and this means we are not looking after our future,' he says. 'For a good businessman, for someone who wants the company to flourish, this is a catastrophe.' Monthly inflation, which has been lowered from 30 per cent last year but is still high at 10 per cent, discourages investment while prohibitive interest rates discourage bank-borrowing. Meanwhile, many of Uralmash's potential customers are caught in a web of mutual debts, caused by the government's failure to impose financial discipline on companies for fear they will go bust. Uralmash itself owes, and is owed, some Rbs13bn. In his fight to control costs, Mr Korovin has already begun painful restructuring. The workforce has contracted from 28,000 to 19,000 - with some of the departures voluntary but others compulsory. Mr Korovin has also closed down or mothballed entire sections of the 5 sq km plant. He expects his output to fall by another 30 per cent this year - roughly in line with a 25 per cent drop forecast for industrial output as a whole but less than the 40-plus per cent fall forecast for machine-tool plants such as his. He agrees that much of this is necessary slimming - 'We have to pay for the (Communist) system we had for 70 years'. But he believes that this year's contraction in output - to a third of what the company produced in 1987 - is 'the limit beyond which we cannot afford to go'. And even if it pares its own costs further, Uralmash is unlikely to be able to finance investment from its own funds. Having made a pre-tax profit of Rbs13bn last year, Uralmash paid Rbs5.2bn in taxes, and spent most of the rest on wages, workers' housing and working capital. To appease the workforce, which acquired half the company during privatisation, it spent another billion roubles on dividend payments which other shareholders would have preferred to plough back into the company. Very little was left for capital investment which Uralmash needs to replace inefficient, worn-out equipment. Adding injustice to injury, it is 'official' enterprises such as Uralmash rather than Russia's booming unofficial economy, which carry the brunt of taxation in Russia. In addition, many of them continue to finance a heavy burden of so-called social assets - such as housing, hospitals, and kindergartens - which elsewhere in the world are taken in charge by the state. Mr Korovin has made an energetic start in paring these so-called 'non-productive assets.' But despite these efforts, Uralmash still spent Rbs1.3bn out of its pre-tax profits on the upkeep of housing built for its workers but no longer exclusively occupied by them. The best deal which Mr Korovin could squeeze out of the regional administration was a promise that it would take on 30 per cent of these costs this year, 50 per cent next year, and the whole lot in five years' time. The changes which this former Communist youth movement leader has already pushed through have led to his growing unpopularity among a demoralised workforce which accuses him of uncaring capitalist exploitation. 'He does not strive for the working class,' said Sasha, a 24-year-old worker. But as one of the few managers who did not try to block outside investors from buying into the company when it was privatised, Mr Korovin appears to be disappointed with the kind of support he has received from his own capitalist backers. He says Mr Kakha Bendukidze, a Moscow entrepreneur who acquired 18.5 per cent of the company when it was privatised, has not, for example, provided him with the sort of financial expertise and advice he had hoped for. A deal he engineered to supply equipment for the development of Russia's huge copper deposit at Udokan in eastern Siberia may also be at risk because the Russian entrepreneur who won the tender to develop it is having trouble raising the finance needed to build the mine. Having sought strategic partnerships with western engineering companies, Mr Korovin has tried to get around foreign investors' reluctance to invest directly in Uralmash by setting up joint ventures with the likes of Caterpillar of the US. But these are taking time to translate into contracts for orders. Meanwhile Uralmash is quickly losing a competitive advantage due to cheap Russian raw materials which are now climbing in price towards world levels. Mr Korovin, like many industrialists, argues that the government must at least create minimal conditions for him to succeed. In the absence of a coherent industrial policy from the government, he recently convinced it to repay debts owed by Russia to Bulgaria with Uralmash machinery. The benefit for the government would be to assess the machinery's value in world prices but pay Uralmash only up to 70 per cent of that amount. However, an official from the local administration, Mr Yevgeny Grachev, berates Uralmash for not doing more to help itself. He says the company is doing a poor job marketing what it produces, and should drastically slim down its range of products anyway. 'Our big tragedy is that everybody is waiting for economic and political stability, perfection of the banking system, and tax improvements,' claims Mr Grachev. To which Mr Korovin's assistant, present at the interview, replies that 'this is all easier to do than it sounds'. For the time being, Mr Korovin's pessimism about the future seems better founded than the bright hopes he started off with a year ago.</p>

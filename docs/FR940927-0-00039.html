			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter states that the AD should allow for incorporation of an engine heater/de-humidifier to be installed on low utilization engines when not in operation. This type of device would reduce the accumulation of moisture in the engine, which can cause disk corrosion. The FAA concurs in part and does not dispute that an engine heater/de-humidifier would probably reduce the moisture content in low utilization engines. This type of device, however, would need to be tested to produce data to quantify its effect on moisture and associated disk corrosion. Since this data has not been submitted to the FAA, it cannot be included in the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter agreed with the rule as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the NPRM, the FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW ASB No. 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. This final rule AD references the latest revision of the ASB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes that include elimination of the borescope inspection and associated tables, changes to the compliance intervals, elimination of the records search, addition of the optional eddy current probe inspection, addition of the adjustment for mixed utilization, and simplification of the utilization determination, are introduced in response to comments received to the NPRM. The format of the compliance section is revised to incorporate the above changes and to simplify the readability by eliminating duplication of compliance instructions that are now included in PW ASB 6038, Revision 5, dated August 17, 1994. The FAA has determined that these changes do not increase the economic burden on any operator, however, the economic analysis has been recalculated to reflect the total scope of the compliance program. The FAA has also determined that the above changes do not compromise the safety impact of the compliance program and do not increase the scope of the AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 11,119 PW JT8D&hyph;1, &hyph;1A, &hyph;1B, &hyph;7, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7B, &hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that approximately 6,815 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and 2 work hours will be necessary to determine the utilization rate and type of surface treatment. Based on domestic fleet-wide data, the FAA estimates that approximately 8.7% or 593 engines are considered to have low utilization rates. Approximately 8.6 work hours will be required to remove these engines from the aircraft, 500 work hours to tear down, deblade, and to reassemble the engine, and 8.6 work hours to reinstall the reassembled engines. The FAA estimates 69% of the removed engines will require scrapping the disks. The FAA assumes that three disks per engine may require replacement, and the cost of a new disk is approximately $7,000. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, and a forecast 20-year compliance program, the annual cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,308,958. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

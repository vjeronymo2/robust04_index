			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 7 May -- An official source has denounced an  Israeli radio report today quoting Eytan Bentzur, the deputy  director general at the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry, as  saying that Saudi Arabia's stance, during the meetings held in  Doha last week on the Arms Control and Regional Security  Committee emanating from the Middle East multilateral talks,  posed difficulties in the way of reaching agreements.    In a statement to the Saudi news agency, the source said  that  Saudi Arabia remains committed to the Gulf Cooperation Council's  [GCC] decisions whose stance has been general and unified.    The source stressed that Saudi Arabia and the GCC states  have  not adopted a stance that poses difficulties, as Bentzur said.  Posing difficulties, the source added, is procrastinating in  the implementation of agreements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Harald Stanghelle: "Record Poll for Center </F> Party"]    [Text] The Center Party is enjoying a record level of  support, but the Progress Party is at rock bottom, Opinion's  poll on party standings for June shows.    The poll was carried out between Monday and Wednesday [6-8  June] and is based on 1,005 telephone interviews.    The Center Party moved up 0.4 percentage points and now has  support of 18.7 percent. This is the highest level of support  for the Center Party Opinion has registered since its polls for  AFTENPOSTEN began seven years ago.    The June poll contains another "record": The Progress  Party's 3.3 percent (a loss of 0.2 percent) is the lowest level  of support Opinion has measured for this party. But the  Progress Party has had major problems for a long time, and it  does not look as if the party is able to rebuild voter  confidence.    The level of support for the Center Party is impressive when  we analyze the background material to the poll. The party has  the highest level of voter loyal, at the same time as the Center  Party is no longer winning voters from the Christian People's  Party and the Socialist Left Party. This means that the  successes of the last few months are based on the party's own  strengths and not on the problems of others, and this fact shows  that the Center Party has a great mobilization potential. Many  political commentators had their doubts about such a development  after the party's sensational election result (18.7 percent)  last year. It goes without saying that the improvement for the  party is connected with the European Union [EU] issue, but there  are good reasons to ask whether there are not other factors that  are pulling in the Center Party's direction.    The other clear no parties are also making gains. Both the  Christian People's Party and the Socialist Left Party look to  have stopped the voter leakage to the Center Party, and overall  there can be little doubt that the no parties are strengthening  their positions.    But the Conservative Party too is able to note an increase  in  support. With gains of 1 percent, to 18.8 percent, the party  can be happy that the Conservative Party overtakes the Center  Party in the June poll.    There are no major changes in the June poll. The only  exception is the Labor Party, which with losses of 1.8 percent  now has 36.4 percent support, a little below the election  result. The party has lost just under 3 percent since March,  but the Labor Party has been able to maintain the high level of  voter support from the Storting election. Its loyalty  percentage remains high (73.5), but its steady losses could be  the first signal that the Labor Party is about to run into  problems at the beginning of a hectic EU election campaign.

An Army source said the two, now naturalized  Americans who were named in a Supreme Command complaint to the  police on Wednesday, were believed to be in the United States.    The request was conveyed through the US embassy in Bangkok  as  well as through the Thai military attache in Washington, the  source said. He said a similar request was conveyed to Canberra  on Wednesday through the Australian Embassy's military attache  here in case the two might be in Australia.    Vang Pao spent two years along the Thai-Laotian border after  the 1975 defeat of the US-backed Hmong guerrillas by the  Communist government in Vientiane. He then migrated to the  United States from where he frequently returned to Thailand, the  Army source said.    According to the source, the United States could possibly  arrest the two generals and extradite them to Thailand under a  law which prevents Americans from trying to subvert foreign  governments. However, the Supreme Command's Intelligence chief  Col Chanya Warakhamin said the Army had not yet asked the United  States to arrest the two. But he said the United States had  made suggestions on legal angles which could be used to allow  action to be taken against them. He did not explain.    The Supreme Command on Wednesday lodged a complaint with the  Crime Suppression Division asking the police to arrest the two  for violating Thailand's national security laws by organizing  the United Independent Front and Laos United Independent Force  and making forays into Laos to carry out sabotage. The  complaint also covered Vang Pao's followers in Thailand.    The move signalled the Army's complete break from the  generals who in the past were allies to the Thai Army and  American troops in the anti-Communist movement along the  Thai-Laotian border.    Washington had always refused Thai requests for cooperation  to stop Vang Pao, saying the US government did not support him.    On Aug 20 last year, the supreme commander ordered that  action be taken against anti-Vientiane guerrillas residing in  Thailand, Col Chanya said.    The Army has mounted a campaign to suppress the guerrillas  during the past two years which led to the arrests of dozens of  Vang Pao's supporters and members. Legal action has been  limited to immigration law violations.    "Most of them were arrested, checked for possession of  weapons and sent back to whichever country they had come from,"  Chanya said.    Chanya said the Army had run out of patience in trying to  thwart the group's activities so it had to resort to asking for  the arrest of the two leaders under criminal law.    Army chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday said there was  evidence that the two generals had raised money from Lao  expatriates in the United States on a monthly basis to help the  Lao liberation movement in Thailand.    Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he believed  the police would be able to trace the movements of the group as  its members frequently crossed back and forth along the  Thai-Laotian border.</p>

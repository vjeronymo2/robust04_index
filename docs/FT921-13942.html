			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Appointments: Entertaining synergies The Tussauds Group, which owns and operates not just the London waxworks but a range of other attractions from Warwick Castle to Alton Towers, has appointed Michael Jolly to the newly created post of chief operating officer. A marketing man who spent 11 years at Cadbury-Schweppes before moving to Tussauds in 1983, the 39-year-old Jolly has recently returned from three months at Harvard on the advanced management programme. He says he is now 'going through the mental processes of deciding which parts of what I learnt are applicable (to Tussauds).' The point of having a chief operating officer, according to Jolly, is to make more effective use of potential synergies within the group - from sharing management expertise to co-ordinating an approach to large suppliers such as Coca-Cola and Kodak. In a month when Windsor Safari Park called in the receivers, Jolly contends that Tussauds, while far from untouched by the recession, is faring 'rather better than some'. The group, which is owned by Pearson, is keen to grow outside the UK - beyond its one Madame Tussaud Scenerama in Amsterdam. Consequently, Ray Barratt becomes development director, also formally a new post, although he had previously been an executive director responsible among other things for development.</p>

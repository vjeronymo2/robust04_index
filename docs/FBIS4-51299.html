			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) has notified "the United Nations  Command (UNC)" that it has established "the Korean People's Army  Representative Mission at Panmunjom" to replace its component of  the Military Armistice Committee, a UNC spokesman said here  Wednesday.    The DPRK's Army Lt. Colonel Yu Yong-Chol made the  notification on Tuesday at Panmunjom in his capacity as chief  liaison officer for the newly-organized mission when he  contacted UNC Lt. Colonel R. Flury.    Pyongyang, however, told the UNC that it will maintain its  telephone lines at the joint duty officers' room at Panmunjom.    The spokesman said that the UNC plans to ask the DPRK to  hold  a senior secretaries' meeting of the Military Armistice  Committee soon to discuss the issue.    The DPRK unilaterally withdrew its representatives from the  Military Armistice Committee on April 27, demanding the Korean  armistice agreement signed at the end of 1950-1953 Korean war be  replaced by a peace accord.</p>

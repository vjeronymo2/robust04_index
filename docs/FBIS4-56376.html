			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- UCR [Radical Civic  Union] President Raul Alfonsin was elected on 29 April as  president of the UCR bloc in the Constituent Assembly and  Cordoba UCR leader Ramon Mestre was appointed first vice  presidential candidate for the Constituent Assembly that will  meet in the cities of Santa Fe and Parana.    Both decisions were made during the first 10 minutes of a  meeting the UCR Constituent Assembly members are holding at the  party's National Committee headquarters in Buenos Aires'  Congreso neighborhood.    The motion for Alfonsin to preside over the UCR bloc was  made  by Antonio Hernandez, a pro-[Cordoba Governor Eduardo] Angeloz  Constituent Assembly member from Cordoba, while Cesar  Jaroslavsky, a pro-Alfonsin member from Buenos Aires, moved that  Mestre be nominated first vice president of the Constituent  Assembly.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / QMH accounts show hidden deals A SERIES of deals under which Queens Moat Houses sold some of its German hotels to directors and senior management and leased them back are detailed in the troubled hotel group's accounts. The deals pushed DM270m (Pounds 110m) debt off balance sheet and bolstered group profits. This, and the fact that Pounds 33.1m had been paid in unlawful dividends, are the main breaches of company law and Stock Exchange regulations which the new management has reported to the authorities. The accounts are heavily qualified by new auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which said that as well as the group depending on a Pounds 1.1bn refinancing, the present directors 'consider they do not have a sufficient understanding of the 1991 property valuation to enable them to provide a full explanation for the decline'. Property values fell by Pounds 1.34bn between the 1991 and 1992 balance sheet dates. Also yesterday Mr Andrew Coppel, the new chief executive, responded to suggestions by Mr John Bairstow, former chairman, that a report prepared by accountants Grant Thornton at the request of QMH's banks should be published. Mr Coppel said the report was 'a severe indictment of previous management'. According to the new management the German transactions should have been notified to shareholders under Stock Exchange rules since they involved directors. They included a deal concluded prior to the end of March 1993, when the group's shares were suspended, backdated to midnight on December 31 1992. This involved selling shares in a subsidiary with assets of DM4.6m for DM1m to Mr Jurgen Mannes, finance director of the German business. This and other deals done in December, including the sale of five hotels for DM146m, of which DM34m has yet to be received, could have added more than Pounds 20m to group profits under its old accounting policies. As well as Mr Mannes, the purchasers included Mr Gerald Bell, joint managing director, and Mr Peter Bertholdt, another director of the German business. QMH is attempting to amend the transactions and warns that it is 'not able to quantify losses which might arise'. The accounts also show that Mr John Williams, former property director, received Pounds 1.2m in 1992 and Pounds 1.03m in 1991 including bonuses, relating to the performance of a business he sold to QMH, and salary. The 1991 figure had not been disclosed in that year's accounts as the bonus of Pounds 895,000 had been capitalised. Mr Bairstow received a bonus of Pounds 128,400 in 1991. This was consolidated into his remuneration in 1992 which rose from Pounds 208,800 to Pounds 335,500, giving him total emoluments of Pounds 435,948, up from Pounds 415,969. Lex, Page 18</p>

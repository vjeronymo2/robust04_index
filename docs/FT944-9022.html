			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Technology: Toyota moves on line Toyota, the Japanese car maker, is tying up with a cable TV operator to conduct experiments in high-speed data transmission. Toyota and Himawari Cable, which operates in the Nagoya area where Toyota is based, will start experiments this month in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) high-speed data transmission using Himawari's optic fibre cable. Toyota owns almost 13 per cent of Himawari, which reaches 90 per cent of households in Toyota city. ATM is a technology which enables data to be sent at about 26 times the speed of systems using conventional telephone lines by sending digital information in packets. Speedier data transmission will allow Toyota to improve efficiency in communications between facilities, the company says. 'We need to send huge amounts of information, such as vehicle designs,' Toyota explains. The company, which is also a shareholder in IDO, the cellular phone maker, and in Teleway Japan, a long-distance carrier, hopes to expand the network to affiliated companies in the auto industry by the end of 1996. If Toyota succeeds in linking its separate facilities with each other and with suppliers, the lead in efficiency the company already commands over many auto manufacturers is likely to widen even further. Toyota is one of the more forward-looking in its approach to advanced computer and tele-communications technologies among Japanese companies, which have generally been slow to adopt high technology in the office. Japan's largest car company has also been quick to make use of computer on-line services, for example. It has built an on-line forum on the Prodigy computer network in the US through which it provides Toyota owners with information on everything from insurance to future models and accessories.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail Trust buys cable arts channel The Daily Mail and General Trust yesterday expanded its interests in the new media with the acquisition of The Performance Channel, an arts channel distributed on cable television networks in the UK. The purchase means that by the end of the month the publisher of the Daily Mail will own two cable TV channels. Channel One, a 24-hours a day television news channel will soon be launched, initially in London. The acquisition of Performance, is part of a Pounds 50m investment to take DMGT into the electronic media. Sir David English, chairman of Harmsworth Broadcasting, a DMGT division, told a Media Week conference in Brighton yesterday: 'We want to expand into TV. We want to have more channels.' Cable is an area where newspapers are free to expand without ownership restrictions. The cable industry is keen to have exclusive channels to differentiate itself from satellite television. Performance broadcasts a mixture of music. It is available to more than 750,000 cable subscribers as part of the basic tier of channels and is already in profit. At the conference Mr Eugene Connell, president of Nymex CableComs, the second largest cable operator in the UK, and chairman of the Cable Communications Association, forecast that cable would have more than 6m viewers in the UK by the turn of the century. At the Royal Television Society on Wednesday evening, Mr Charles Allen, chief executive of Granada TV and LWT, promised that his company intended to find a way into the pay television market. Although ITV would remain an important business, Mr Allen predicted that in ten years' time subscription revenues would dwarf both the BBC's licence fee and advertising revenues.</p>

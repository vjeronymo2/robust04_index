			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA LOSES ANOTHER ASSISTANT: ROBINSON TAKES JOB WITH JETS  </P> <P> Greg Robinson, UCLA's offensive coordinator last season and an assistant to  Coach Terry Donahue for eight seasons, has been named defensive line coach of  the New York Jets.  </P> <P> Robinson, 38, is the fifth assistant to leave UCLA since the end of a 3-7-1  season, the Bruins' worst in 18 years.  </P> <P> Donahue has filled two of the positions with offensive coordinator Homer Smith  and defensive line coach Jacob Burney.  </P> <P> Robinson was the defensive line coach for seven seasons in Westwood before  being switched to offensive coordinator last season, when the Bruins were  ranked ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference in total offense, accumulating their  lowest rushing yardage total since 1964 and their lowest passing yardage total  since 1981.  </P> <P> In December, Robinson was named assistant head coach and moved back to defense  to coach linebackers. UCLA was ranked among the nation's top eight in rushing  defense three times in Robinson's last four seasons as coach of the defensive  line.  </P> <P> The move to New York, he said, presented an opportunity to work with some of  his closest friends. The Jets' defensive coordinator, Pete Carroll, was  Robinson's teammate at Pacific. They coached together at Pacific and North  Carolina State, where the head coach was Monte Kiffin, who is the Jets'  linebacker coach. The Jets' head coach, Bruce Coslet, also played at Pacific.  </P> <P> "It takes my career to another level," Robinson said. JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

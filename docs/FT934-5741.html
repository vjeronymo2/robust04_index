			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Defiant China determined on a tame HK: Britain still hopes for a negotiated deal When, in April, Britain and China embarked on talks about Hong Kong's political development, their chance of reaching an agreement was never bright. But the depth of division is underlined by the fact that the only piece of common ground to emerge between the two after 160 hours of talks is lowering the colony's voting age to 18 from 21 years. Although Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, was quick yesterday to leave the door open to further talks, the reality facing his administration and the British government is that China will never agree to increasing democratic participation in Hong Kong along Mr Patten's lines. The immediate question for Mr Patten and his colleagues in the British government is what to do next. The colony's Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's 60-strong lawmaking body, will expect to hear how Britain plans to proceed when the governor addresses Legco on Thursday. The most likely outcome will be the splitting of Mr Patten's five proposals for democratic reform - first made a year ago - into two bills. The first - which may be presented to LegCo as early as December 8 - will encompass the so-called 'simple' issues which Britain and China were unable to agree on at the weekend. These are: abolishing appointments to Hong Kong's district boards and municipal councils so that elections next year will be fully democratic; creating 20 single-member electorates for the LegCo elections in 1995; and lowering the voting age. The second bill will consist of the more contentious aspects of Mr Patten's plans. These are: broadening democratic participation in elections for 30 'functional' constituencies, which represent business and professional interests; and the constitution of an 'electoral college' which will elect 10 LegCo members in 1995. An important consideration for ministers is whether this second bill should be Mr Patten's 1992 proposals unmodified, or the compromise offer the UK put to China during the summer. This decision has yet to be taken but, in the words of one of the governor's aides, 'If a process of mutilation is to take place, better to start with a whole body rather than half.' The speed of presentation of the second bill will be determined by China's reaction to the tabling of the first. At the weekend Britain proposed an 18th round of talks to discuss the more difficult parts of Mr Patten's plans. If, in the face of LegCo debating the first bill, China takes up that offer then more time will be available for discussion. The offer of more talks was mostly presentational but also reflected the UK's unchanged policy towards relations with China. The prize still to be fought for - which now appears to be beyond Britain's grasp - remains an agreement. Since the negotiation of the Joint Declaration between 1982 and 1984 the cornerstone of British policy has been to agree 'transitional' issues with the Chinese on the basis that what is agreed has a greater chance of survival after 1997 than what is not. It is far from clear, however, if China really wants an agreement on the political transition of Hong Kong, or that Britain could live with what China seeks. One thing which has emerged from the talks is that, in spite of the neutering of Mr Patten's proposals during the summer, China was still not satisfied. The inescapable conclusion to draw from this is that China desires a tame legislature in 1997, one which not only excludes so-called 'subversive' democratic politicians, such as Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, but which restricts participation in elections. The equally unpalatable fact for Mr Patten and the British government is that when the governor's legislation gets to LegCo its members will probably ensure that most of China's wishes are observed. LegCo is unlikely to agree to broadening voter participation in the functional constituencies; it could opt for appointment, rather than election, to the electoral college. The current balance of power in LegCo suggests that its members are more likely to vote in the direction of Beijing than of London. There are about 23 members who will support Mr Patten's democratic alternative and an equal number who will do China's bidding. In the middle are 10 members - known as the 'Breakfast Club' - most of whom when pushed will incline to Beijing on the big issues. Time has never been on Britain's side; less so now that Chinese resumption of sovereignty is just 3 1/2 years away. But that reality cuts both ways: China has a clearer idea of what is at stake for itself. Possibly for that reason Mr Guo Fengmin, a senior Chinese government official, said on Friday that if there were no agreement, 'the sky will not fall down. We are confident that we, together with the Hong Kong people, can maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.'</p>

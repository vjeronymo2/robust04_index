			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds falters The setback to Lloyds Bank's move to merge with Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, announced after the market had closed on Wednesday, saw Lloyds Bank shares marked down sharply at the outset before staging a strong rally. The shares went to 553p at the start of trading as dealers sought to head off any attempted selling by institutions. Little pressure developed at that level, however, and the stock quickly recovered its poise, closing at 566p for a net fall of only 5. Turnover was a heavy 9.7m shares. Bank analysts saw the blocking of the merger as only temporary. 'It is a case of spot the cleverest way of getting round a little local difficulty,' said one specialist. Final results from British Land helped the shares move forward as the group unveiled a net asset value (nav) of 423p, well ahead of market forecasts. Profits at Pounds 53.9m (against Pounds 27.2m a year ago) were also higher than forecast. Goldman Sachs has pencilled in an nav of 475p, up 23p, for the current year, with 522p expected for 1996. The shares added 5 at 389p against a weak property sector. There was more big demand for Standard Chartered after recent broker recommendations and the shares added 6 at 277p with turnover reaching 7.9m. Switching from National Westminster to Barclays saw the latter edge up to 550p and the former slip 12 to 461p. The two classes of HSBC stock, London registered and Hong Kong registered, were the market's most heavily traded shares as the shares representing the enhanced scrip dividend were put through the market, the HK shares at 726 1/2 p and the London stock at 702p. HSBC London shares lost 7 at 715p with 13m traded, and the HK stock was 8 lower at 734p on turnover of 16m. CE Heath was the latest in a series of dismally performing insurance brokers, plunging 24 to 339p after the group said it would include an exceptional charge of around Pounds 22m as the group's Australian subsidiary lost a court case involving the State of Victoria's Accident Compensation Commission. Pharmaceutical issues were wanted after a buy note from Wertheim Schroder on Glaxo, up 4 1/2 to 548 1/2 p. Mr Jonathan Gelles said he believed the stock had been oversold on the prospect of commercial threat to Zantac, its anti-ulcer drug. He also cited anti-asthmatic, migraine, and steroidal hay fever drugs as potential areas for growth. Renewed comment on prospects of a demerger at Thorn EMI boosted the shares, which closed 11 up at 1089p. Bearish tales on Ladbroke, mainly concerning difficulties in breaking into the US casino market, undermined the stock, but a late rally kept the damage to a penny fall at 159p. There was talk of big institutional buying accompanying Kwik Save's swift rise of 15 to 569p. Sales at clothes retailer Etam in the current year to end-January 1995 were continuing to run ahead of levels a year ago, shareholders were told at yesterday's agm. The shares put on 5 at 265p. At its agm, Austin Reed shareholders heard sales were 14 per cent above the same period a year ago. The stock gained 3 at 226p. Switching in a directionless market was blamed by some analysts in the transport sector for a tumble in BAA shares and a rise in British Airways. 'There is some switching going on to generate business and the feeling is that there is more chance of good news in British Airways since we have had the results from BAA,' commented one analyst. The phasing out of EU subsidies on national airlines and an airlines presentation at Kleinwort Benson also helped to trigger some activity in the stocks. BAA fell 12 to 929p while British Airways appreciated 7 to 397p. Over-optimistic views ahead of the results were blamed by one analyst for a drop in the shares of Johnson Matthey after the company delivered its figures. The stock finished 28 down at 558p, albeit in very thin volume. A bullish agm statement from media agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi pushed the shares 8 ahead to 141p, the market responding to chief executive Mr Charles Scott's comments that revenues would be higher than budgeted. Chubb Security shares suffered a fall of nearly 7 per cent as they slid 25 to 335p after results came in below some analysts' forecasts. Funeral group Great Southern jumped 133 to 608p after an Pounds 87.4m bid worth 600p a share. Stock market debuts from Brewin Dolphin and Spargo saw the stockbroking group steady at the 150p placing price, while the computer software consultancy went to a 13p premium at 108p.

This proposal would require a reduction of the low cycle fatigue (LCF) retirement lives for certain high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disks, and would provide a drawdown schedule for those affected parts with reduced LCF retirement lives. This proposal is prompted by the results of a refined life analysis performed by the manufacturer which revealed minimum calculated LCF lives significantly lower than published LCF retirement lives. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a LCF failure of the HPTR stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by February 21, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;37, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.

A study performed by the manufacturer using updated life analyses for the high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disk has revealed minimum calculated low cycle fatigue (LCF) lives which are significantly lower than published LCF retirement lives. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a LCF failure of the HPTR stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1069, dated September 12, 1994, that describes a reduction in the published LCF retirement lives for affected HPTR stage 2 disks, and an FAA-approved rework procedure for the affected disks to increase the FAA-approved LCF retirement life to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles since new (CSN), depending on the CSN of the disk when the rework is performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design, the proposed AD would require a reduction of the published LCF retirement lives for certain HPTR stage 2 disks, and would provide a drawdown schedule for those affected disks with reduced LCF retirement lives. If the FAA-approved rework is accomplished, the LCF retirement life may be increased to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles, depending on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 280 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 194 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $16,383 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,574,840.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Observer: The Crookery Is this the first recorded sighting of a Maxwell House? Jack Rose, a veteran property man whose book is reviewed in today's Business Books supplement, records how he had tried to buy a derelict factory on London's Marylebone Road in the late 1940s. However, a recently demobbed Robert Maxwell pipped him to the post, turned it into a wholesale bookstore and renamed it Maxwell House. Maxwell's partner in the deal was none other than Clarence Hatry, who in his hey-day was an even better known fraudster than Cap'n Bob. The collapse of the Hatry empire in 1929, after Hatry had been caught forging bogus share certificates, helped precipitate the 1929 Wall Street crash. So now we know where Maxwell learned the tricks of his trade.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Capitalism, Chinese style THIS WEEK in Beijing, the contradictions inherent in China's experiment with 'market socialism' are on display in all their peculiarity. At the 14th national Communist party congress, the doddering men and women who rule 1.2bn Chinese are gathered to write another chapter in the country's conversion to capitalism. The watchwords are free markets without free politics; a vibrant private sector alongside a dominant public sector; a further opening to the west, but a vigorous fight against pollution by western ideas. It is tempting to conclude that this represents an unstable mix - that the system, like communism in the former Soviet Union, is moving inexorably towards collapse under the weight of such contradictions. Yet that is not how things have turned out to date. On the contrary, China's partial liberation of market forces has produced one of the most extraordinary phenomena of the late 20th century: an economy that has more than doubled in size since liberalisation began in 1978 and could double again by the year 2000. China would then be well on the way to becoming the world's newest superpower. Whether it can manage such a transformation without domestic upheaval or international conflict will depend in part on decisions rubber-stamped in Beijing in the next few days. This congress will almost certainly be the last in the lifetime of Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old architect of reform. Will the cause outlive him? Or will economic change spawn social unrest and a clash over demands for political reform? Private enterprise Three years ago, after the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen square, many observers gave pessimistic answers. The crackdown, they said, demonstrated that the party could not cling to power without reversing, or at least shelving, its market reforms. Recent events suggest party bosses have drawn different conclusions: that private enterprise holds the key to China's modernisation, and that - as in several other recent Asian success stories - it can be harnessed without a significant dilution of authoritarian rule. The people seem to approve. Indeed, the evidence suggests that economic liberalisation would now be difficult for the gerontocrats to reverse. How long these nostrums will hold true is open to doubt. Behind this week's sloganising lies an uneasy awareness of some difficult policy dilemmas. Most immediately, the economy is showing signs of overheating. Given that the authorities now seem powerless to fine-tune the economy, they may find themselves forced into a crude clampdown on inflationary pressures like that which helped fuel political unrest in the late 1980s. Discontent could be fuelled by the enormous economic imbalances between the regions resulting from the southern provinces' dash for growth, or by rampant official corruption. Tricky questions The dismal performance of state industry also raises tricky questions concerning the party's role: the streamlining of state-owned enterprises under the discipline of thoroughgoing price reform could throw millions out of work in a country which has hitherto guaranteed lifetime employment. Above all, the drive for the market will inevitably mean a progressive loss of power by the party. State industry already accounts for not much more than half of total Chinese output, and the proportion is certain to fall further. It is far from clear that the party or military elders are all reconciled to such a diminution of their role. Much will depend on the next, somewhat less elderly, generation of reformers, some of whom are expected to be promoted to the party's inner circle at the end of the current congress. For western countries, China's rapid development inevitably spells ever closer involvement in its economic affairs. It also means that they have a growing stake in ensuring that it accompanies economic liberalisation with sensible political reform, including an improved record on human rights. They will need to recognise that the best means of fostering broad-based change lies in encouraging China's private entrepreneurs through trade and investment, not in using trade sanctions on political grounds.</p>

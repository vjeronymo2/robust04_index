			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> BUSH HAS UNDERMINED HIS OWN PARTY;  </P> <P> HE IS UNWILLING TO MAKE THE CASE FOR THE SIDE THAT ELECTED HIM.  </P> <P> Make no mistake, President Bush and his senior advisers have lost badly in the  budget wars. Headlines around the country represent the President as being  confused and unsure of himself on taxes. He has only himself to blame.  </P> <P> Two years ago, he campaigned and was elected on the plain and simple promise of  no new taxes. Four months ago, he allowed himself to be persuaded by budget  negotiators that "tax revenue increases" were needed to reduce the deficit.  There was a gleam in the TV anchormen's eyes that night. Journalists covering  the White House knew a fatal compromise when they saw one.  </P> <P> Since then, things have not gone well for the GOP. After months of secret  meetings, a deal was worked out with Democratic leaders. Rep. Robert Walker  (R-Pa.) has been one of the few to point out that the deal included $150  billion in spending increases and $134 billion in new taxes to pay for them.  Some deficit reduction. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip,  saw this as a repudiation of the Republicans' defining issue. The GOP was  unwittingly aligning itself with the Democrats. He opposed the deal, and a few  days later it was voted down in the House.  </P> <P> We are now back to partisan budget-making, which at least has the virtue of  clarity. Republicans, however, remain gravely undermined because the President  no longer stands for much of anything on the domestic front. Indeed, it is  possible that within a week or two he will actually be campaigning for a  package of tax increases voted through by Democrats in Congress. In which case  he will have made a 180-degree turn on his most potent issue.  </P> <P> Since June, when he changed his mind on taxes, Bush's repeated displays of  philosophical aimlessness have confirmed the worst fears of conservatives. His  goal in the budget struggle, he said recently, is to show "that we can still  govern." But governing is not an end in itself. The pursuit of a well-defined  political goal requires vision -- already dismissed by Bush as "the vision  thing." Then again, he said a few days ago that he aspired "to keep the process  moving forward." As has been repeatedly shown in recent years, "the process"  will take unwary politicians to unsuspected destinations.  </P> <P> In pursuing a bipartisan deal, secretly negotiated, Bush showed not only a  distaste for politics but also a failure to understand the passions that  animate politics. In the nature of things, there can be no satisfactory  bipartisan solution to the problem of deficit spending because the country is  deeply divided on the relevant issues. The President seems not to grasp the  reality of this division, which cannot be papered over in private meetings.  Strikingly, a few days ago Bush conceded that he was not comfortable with  domestic politics. In foreign affairs, by contrast, "people really basically  want to support the President," he said. But a President uncomfortable with  domestic affairs is not in the right line of business.  </P> <P> There is only one way that the problem of the federal budget can be sensibly  addressed, and that is for the President to take his case to the American  people. He could use the media, which is forever at his disposal. He could say:  "Americans are overtaxed," or: "I would like to try to cut back on the size of  government and I need your help." He could show that he perceives the political  fault lines and is willing to make the case for the side that elected him. But  this is what he will not do, and it can only be because he does not feel  strongly enough about the issues to take such a stand. President Reagan showed  that a conservative message is also a winning one. But President Bush seems not  to have absorbed this lesson in his eight years as Reagan's vice president.  That is why conservatives are disheartened at this moment.  </P> <P> Consider this. Last weekend, the government was briefly shut down -- but at a  time when tourists and museum visitors were hurt, not federal employees.  Nonetheless, it was a perilous moment for bureaucrats because the unwelcome  distinction was publicly made between "essential" and "non-essential" workers:  87,000 of the latter at the Department of Health and Human Services, for  example, 80,000 in the Department of Agriculture, 30,000 in the Commerce  Department. But on Monday morning, they were all back at work, and Bush held a  press conference in which he said: "I want to recognize the valiant federal  work force that had to suffer through some uncertainty in this period." Is he  on their side, then? There has been much talk of shared sacrifice, pain to be  borne equally by all Americans. Are government workers alone to be exempt from  this? If Bush showed that he understood this issue, conservatives would be  encouraged. And at this late date, surprised.  </P></p>

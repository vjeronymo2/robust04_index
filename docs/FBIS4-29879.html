			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  expressed hope Wednesday that the Social Democratic Party (SDP)  [Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ)] would return to the  ruling coalition, almost two months after the SDP left the  coalition in protest. But Hata declined to comment on the  timing of a top-level meeting with SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, who is under fire from rank and file members of his  own party for his calls to the Hata cabinet to voluntarily  resign.    The SDP on Tuesday unveiled a blueprint of a potential new  coalition government as agitation increases among SDP  legislators to rejoin the coalition, which the party quit in  April to protest the sudden formation of a parliamentary group  excluding the SDP.    Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  the largest opposition group, told reporters Wednesday morning  he is not sure if the SDP is really serious about allying with  the coalition once again.    At a high-level meeting on Wednesday morning, the LDP  confirmed that it will submit a no-confidence motion against  Hata's minority government. The LDP's action is expected to  come after the passage -- possibly on Thursday -- of the fiscal  1994 state budget, LDP sources said. But some LDP lawmakers  have cautioned against such a step, saying a no-confidence  motion would not pass in the 511-member lower house without the  help of the SDP, the LDP sources said.    LDP officials said Kono met former foreign minister Michio  Watanabe to seek the LDP Stalwart's support for the campaign to  oust the Hata cabinet from power.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The December proposal would have established a transition period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from July 1, 1994, to April 1, 1996. Institutions subject to data collection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements would have been required to begin collecting home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mortgage, small business, and consumer loan data on July 1, 1994. The data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have been reported to the agencies no later than January 31, 1995, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually thereafter. Evaluations under the proposed standards would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begun April 1, 1995. However, any institution could have elected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated under the existing twelve assessment factors rather than the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards until July 1, 1995, and any institution showing cause could have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested evaluation under the existing standards up to April 1, 1996. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies would have accepted strategic plans for approval at any time after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December proposal, in addition, would have insulated some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions from supervisory sanctions until they had been subject to at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two examinations under the proposed standards. Specifically, the agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have disapproved corporate applications or taken any enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action against an institution whose initial CRA rating under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards dropped by more than one level, if the agencies determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drop in ratings occurred despite a good faith effort to achieve at least a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory level of performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the commenters criticized the transition period in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal for being too short. Those commenters were particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical of the proposal to begin collection of data on July 1, 1994. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested that the proposed data collection be delayed as much as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 months after the publication of a final rule. Some also criticized the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to begin conducting examinations in 1995 using a partial year's data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the second half of 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters criticized the proposal to insulate certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions from supervisory actions until they had gained more experience with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standards. Those commenters were generally concerned that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would have protected institutions whose performance ratings would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have suffered as a result of more objective, performance-based assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

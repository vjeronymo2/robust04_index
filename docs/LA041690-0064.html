			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> Moody's Investor Service may soon downgrade the credit ratings of several major  Japanese banks because of their huge exposure to real estate loans.  </P> <P> "Moody's remains concerned that rapidly rising interest rates or a credit  crunch could pop the real estate bubble," said a report from the rating agency.  </P> <P> A Moody's Japan official cautioned: "This will not be an across-the-board  downgrading of Japanese banks."  </P> <P> New York-based Moody's is one of the world's prime rating agencies for judging  the credit-worthiness of companies and governments.  </P> <P> The official declined to comment on the names or the number of banks involved  or when Moody's decision would be announced.  </P> <P> But he said the chances that the ratings of at least some banks would be  downgraded were fairly high. Most major Japanese banks are double-A rated or  higher. Moody's highest rating is triple A.  </P> <P> "Real estate lending decisions have often been premised on repayment from  capital gains realized from future land price increases, not from the projected  cash flows of a project," Moody's said in its recent report on Japanese bank  ratings.  </P> <P> Moody's downgraded three Japanese trust banks in February for the same reasons.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> EINSTEIN-FREUD LETTERS SOLD  </P> <P> Two handwritten letters between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud discussing  the nature of war sold for $165,000, and a Louis Armstrong trumpet drew $16,500  at the same auction.  </P> <P> The exchange of letters was initiated by a League of Nations official for a  limited-edition book published in 1933.  </P> <P> The letters, which were sold Tuesday by Sotheby's, were consigned by an  educational institution and purchased by a private American buyer, said Matthew  Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman.  </P> <P> Einstein's four-page letter of July 28, 1932, asks, "Is there a way to liberate  man from the doom of war?" The 14-page reply from Freud concludes, "There is no  prospect of getting rid of this aggressive instinct."  </P> <P> Another private American buyer bought the trumpet and a manuscript essay on the  musician's recollections on the development of jazz.  </P> <P> The B-flat trumpet sold for $16,500 and the handwritten essay for $27,500,  Weigman said.  </P></p>

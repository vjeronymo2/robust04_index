			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW COMES BACK TO EARTH THANKS TO PROFIT-TAKING SURGE  </P> <P> Wall street stocks closed marginally lower today, after soaring into record  territory the previous day, as profit-taking offset continued interest in  technology and retail issues.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.42 at 2809.73 on heavy New York  Stock Exchange volume of about 194 million shares.  </P> <P> The industrial average gained 56.95 Tuesday to close above the 2,800-level for  the first time.  </P> <P> Today, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the New York  Stock Exchange, with 878 up, 726 down and 395 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 192.33 million shares, against 162.07 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index lost .20 to 197.80.  </P> <P> International Business Machines continued to build on its gains from Tuesday to  close on the New York Stock Exchange up 3/4 at 98 7/8.  </P> <P> The market's sharp rise Tuesday in the first session of the new year featured  strength in many stocks that had fared poorly in the waning stages of 1989.  </P> <P> Analysts said that resulted from a lifting of the pressure of year-end tax  selling.  </P> <P> As profit-taking halted the Dow's rally today, some investors also seemed  reluctant to chase after stocks, given persistent worries about the outlook for  the economy and corporate earnings.  </P> <P> In the minds of many observers, stocks of many companies still represent a  risky bet that business activity and earnings growth will begin to recover  later this year from the slump that set in several months ago.  </P> <P> Bond prices were sharply lower in early trading today after the government  reported robust sales of new homes in November.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000  face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, climbed to  8.03% from 7.99% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said that sales of new homes surged 9.6% in November,  the steepest gain in four months. Analysts said the report threw water on  recent talk of a real estate industry slowdown.  </P> <P> Since long-term fixed-income investments such as bonds are considered a safe  haven during periods of economic sluggishness, prices tend to decline following  positive economic news.  </P> <P> The government said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted  annual rate of 710,000 units in November after edging up a revised 0.9% in  October. Sales in October originally were reported to be off 0.5%.  </P> <P> "The strength of that number led people to believe that the real estate market  is not as soft as the casual evidence might suggest," said Ray Stone, a  managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc.  </P> <P> "There's been a lot of to-do in the press in the last month about home prices  falling," he said. "This would tend to dispel that notion to a degree."  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were off 1/16 point to 7/32 point, intermediate maturities were down about 1/4  point and long-term issues were 11/32 point lower, according to Telerate Inc.,  the financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, was down 2.44 to 1,185.33.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued Tuesday fell to 7.89% as the  discount was unchanged at 7.64%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.94% from  their level at auction as the discount gained 2 basis points to 7.54%. Yields  on one-year bills were up to 7.82% as the discount gained 4 basis points to  7.31%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8 3/8%, down from 8 1/2% late Tuesday.  </P></p>

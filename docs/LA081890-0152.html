			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WITH THE RIGHT GARDEN, YOU CAN CREATE A RAINBOW DURING DROUGHT  </P> <P> Even during a drought, a landscape can bloom with color.  </P> <P> Rely on shrubs, flowers and herbs that thrive when rainfall is scarce.  </P> <P> Some of the favorites flourish in hot, dry conditions.  </P> <P> Annual flowers are probably the best choice for an arid landscape. Some of the  most heat-tolerant annuals are portulaca, zinnia, tithonia, sanvitalia, salvia,  marigold, petunia, nasturtium, globe amaranth, four o'clocks, gazania, celosia,  California poppy and cosmos.  </P> <P> Drought-resistant perennials include rudbeckia, coneflower, daylily, achillea,  artemisia, gas plant, coreopsis, hardy lily, gaillardia, butterfly weed,  cranesbill geranium, Siberian iris, malva, monarda, sedum and veronica.  </P> <P> Ornamental grasses are also capable of withstanding hot weather.  </P> <P> For background color, choose heat-loving shrubs like cinquefoil (Potentilla  fruiticosa), dwarf winged spindle tree (Euonymus alata compacta), vanhoutte  spirea (Spiraea vanhouttei), tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima), yucca (Yucca  filamentosa) and Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius).  </P> <P> Herb plants are exceptionally heat tolerant too. Lavender, catmint, thyme,  oregano, sage and chives ignore parched soil.  </P></p>

At a study seminar organized by the CISL confederation, in  this city northeast of Milan, the visiting ambassador was  welcomed by the assembly with a long round of standing applause.  "We want a more active role for the Italian government, which  must be much more involved in peace in Bosnia," declared  Filipovic who said the Rome government should take on a  "leadership role."    On the sidelines of the seminar, Cabinet Undersecretary  Antonio Maccanico said, "At the level of humanitarian relief,  Italy is perhaps doing more than any other European country for  Bosnia."    In his statement, the Bosnian ambassador spoke of living in  "stone age" conditions in the ex-Yugoslav republic, "forced to  live without water, light, gas, food. And when they go to look  for them, they are killed by the artillery of the Serbian  troops," he said in the dead silence of the hall. "We will  never accept anything that is not freedom and democracy for our  country. We want peace...with a political solution," declared  Filipovic who noted that canons only serve to prolong the war.    The ambassador, who was invited here by the Bergamo Refugees  Committee, began distributing Bosnian passports over the weekend  to fellow nationals holding Yugoslav passports, which were  declared invalid as of January 1. Bosnian refugees from around  Italy were arriving here to join some 150 fellow refugees  already in the city.    For its part, the CISL urged the other two big trade union  confederations, the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of  Labor] and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], to join  in the organization of a May 1 for Italian workers in Sarajevo,  the war- torn Bosnian capital, an event which, according to  planners, will be broadcast live to Italy.    D'Antoni said Italian planning for the day should go ahead  if  the European Trade Union Confederation failed to take the  initiative at the European level, because of differences within  the organization. "Conditions within ex-Yugoslavia are so  dramatic that everyone must do something," declared the CISL  leader.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Chirac resolute on EC trade interests France's centre-right opposition, expected to form a government in four weeks, is proving even more critical of the Gatt negotiations and the US role in them than the ruling Socialists, whose leader, President Francois Mitterrand, meets US President Bill Clinton today, David Buchan writes from Paris. At a party congress on Sunday, Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR Gaullist leader, said 'the time has come to defend (European) Community preference' in trade, both agricultural and industrial. The US has threatened to shut EC companies out of US federal contract bidding if the EC does not this month scrap a price preference in its new public procurement law. Government and opposition have been equally strident in denouncing EC-US accords on farm exports and oilseed output.</p>

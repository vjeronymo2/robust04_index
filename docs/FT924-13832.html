			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Antiques trade association launches code of practice THE antiques industry has launched a code of practice in an attempt to improve consumer confidence in a sector where some dealers have gained a reputation for sharp practice. The London and Provincial Antique Dealers' Association, which has 700 members throughout the UK, has drawn up an Antique Buyers' Charter, outlining dealers' responsibilities and shoppers' rights. It has been approved by the Office of Fair Trading. Shoppers will be able to take complaints to the association, which will consult antiques experts for arbitration, scrutinised by an independent adjudicator. Statutory legal rights will not be affected by the process. Lord Derwent, association chairman, said: 'Antiques is an unusual business in that it relies on expert opinions which sometimes genuinely differ. If you buy a refrigerator and it does not work that it is pretty clear-cut. But what happens if you buy some Meissen and do not believe it is Meissen?' Member companies will display the charter in their shops and give detailed information about an article's price, date of manufacture, material and maker's name, and state whether it has been subject to restoration or reproduction. Members found to have broken the code will be required to resign. The number of antique dealers in the UK is not known but the association estimates that it represents about a quarter of the industry. Shoppers' charters are becoming increasingly common in service industries - the Office of Fair Trading is working with about 30 trade associations to draw up codes.</p>

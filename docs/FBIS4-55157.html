			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 10/5/1994 -- Romanian Minister  of State Mircea Cosea appreciated as a success the stabilization  of the leu exchange rate reached in April as much valuable as it  had been achieved without "traumas or big commotions." In an  interview with the Romania Radio, Vacaroiu cabinet's reform  minister Mircea Cosea said the stabilization process would  continue till June, the current year, when the inter-bank market  is scheduled to be established. Cosea opined the success  belonged to a fruitful cooperation between Government and the  National Bank of Romania "extremely well valued abroad" and the  "final" condition on the IMF stand-by loan.    Referring to the stage of privatization, Cosea said the  so-called "30 percent" action would be finalized within the  current month. The action will consist in the population's  exchanging their property certificates -- previously granted to  the population -- for shares in the commercial state companies  amounting up to a total value of 30 percent of the commercial  companies' aggregate capital. The Governmental Council of  Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform -- headed by Cosea  -- together with the National Privatization Agency, State  Property Fund, and the (five) Private Property Funds are drawing  up the details of the stock public offering.    Mircea Cosea gave as a proof of the increasing international  recognition of the economic reform in Romania the invitation he  had received in order to open and lead a conference organized by  the specialized commission of the European Union for issues  concerning the small and middle-sized enterprises.</p>

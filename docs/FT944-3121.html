			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Economic upturn has revived Alphandery: A confident finance minister discusses France's lead in Europe's growth league with David Buchan France is set to record the highest growth of any large European country next year, said Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, dismissing the autumn's sluggishness in consumer demand as a natural pause after rapid recovery. 'Don't confuse deceleration of the rhythm of recovery with a halt to the recovery,' he said in an interview. 'After exceptionally fast growth, especially in the second quarter of this year, we knew we couldn't continue at that pace. But we have already registered growth of 2.3 per cent for the first nine months of this year.' He stuck to his official forecast of 3.1 per cent growth in 1995, but noted that the European Commission predicted France would top the European Union league, with 3.2 per cent growth next year. Mr Alphandery flatly ruled out the return of the recession that saw French gross domestic product contract by 1 per cent in 1993. 'No economist or forecaster envisages the scenario of a double dip in the French economy,' he said. The economic upturn has clearly restored Mr Alphandery's confidence, shaken in 1993 by the monetary crisis and by criticism that his supply-side focus on improving companies' cash flow and promoting long-term savings and investment, rather than pumping up consumer demand, risked prolonging recession. 'The choices we made are now bearing fruit,' he said. Growth has returned to the French economy without increasing inflation (running at an annual rate of 1.6 per cent) and without diminishing the trade surplus (likely to be FFr80bn (Pounds 9.5bn) for the second successive year). The synchronisation of policy with Germany, enshrined in a joint convergence plan that Mr Alphandery presented a year ago with Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart, has created 'a formidable factor of stability' within the European monetary system. Mr Alphandery recognises that one consequence of French policy convergence with Germany, and of 'the openness of our economy which is much more linked than in the past to our neighbours', is to make 'the French economy more cyclical'. But at the present, the cycle is moving in the right way. 'What makes me optimistic that the recovery is definitely here for 1995-96 is that the whole environment surrounding France is improving, with strong German, Italian, Spanish demand for French goods.' The other factor in Mr Alphandery's optimism is his pride in 'getting ourselves out of recession with pretty sparing use of (public) resources' and in inducing savers to switch 'the money they were hoarding in short-term money market funds into long-term savings, helping private and public investment. 'We have also systematically assisted the competitiveness of French companies. For instance, we gave companies a FFr50bn cash reimbursement on value added tax. President (Francois) Mitterrand criticised this, saying it was economically inefficient not to give the equivalent of money to households to support general consumer demand. We didn't do that. And it has paid off. Look at the balance of payments surplus which, even with recovery, has not shrunk. Exports have increased in line with imports.' The 'sparing use' made of public resources took the form of 'targeted incentives in favour of car purchases and housing investment', Mr Alphandery said. 'We thus put 'super' into the two motors of the French economy.' But it is on his restructuring of savings that he waxes most enthusiastically. To a large extent what he has done is simply correct the over-generous tax treatment given to French money market funds when, with the lifting of all exchange controls in the early 1990s, it was feared these funds would depart for Luxembourg and other tax havens. Nonetheless, Mr Alphandery has wrought a significant change. When he took office individuals had FFr800bn, and companies another FFr400bn, piled up in short-term money market funds known as Sicavs. 'These were really false savings, and counted as part of M3 money supply. Some FFr250bn of these funds have now been consolidated into long-term savings. 'I was of course helped by the fall in short-term rates relative to long-term rates.' But the minister also vaunts his reforms allowing money from Sicavs to be switched, tax-free, into equity investment schemes, into lending to the government in the form of the four-year 'Ballabonds' issued in 1993 and into housing, as well as lowering tax exemptions on withdrawals from Sicavs for any other purpose. Mr Alphandery has one more big investment vehicle on his drawing board: capitalised private pension funds. Far from being a threat to the shaky state scheme, he argues that private pension funds could help buoy it, by boosting investment and growth and thereby creating higher salaries and pension contributions paid into the state scheme. It is thus a much more confident Mr Alphandery who on January 1 takes over chairmanship of the council of European Union economic and finance ministers for the six months of the French presidency of the EU. Among his priorities will be to put into effect the Commission white paper's recommendations on general competitiveness and labour market flexibility, and to scrutinise more closely international aid programmes. On such issues, he said he found himself 'much in intellectual harmony' with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. It is surprising to hear a French centrist express such affinity with a British Tory. But it is clear that 20 months of holding office have confirmed Mr Alphandery's fiscal conservatism and supply-side instincts.</p>

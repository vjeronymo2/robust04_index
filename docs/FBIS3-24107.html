We Promise To Thin Out the Pantheon of Our  Political Bohemia in the Near Future"]    [Text] There is every reason to suppose that our extremely  mobile public opinion will clash in the near future with the  failure of still another perestroyka legend--the legend about  the wise reformer and spontaneous democrat, the great friend of  free Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev. By nickname "the red emir."  It is always extremely unpleasant to part with legends.  Expecially against our background of massive disappointments in  simple, but radical decisions, the aspiration to the panacea of  a firm label. But it is simply necessary to understand from  where the legend about Nazarbayev came.    However, for the beginning it is nevertheless necessary to  understand in how far our prophets, who in spite of the  well-known parable have multiplied chock-full in our Homeland,  are so inconsistent. To illustrate, we will take two political  figures, who at various times have caused a considerable stir in  Russian minds--General Pinochet and the lawyer Zhirinovsky. Both  of them have been treated as fascists without any special  reasons, since neither the one nor the other in a strict sense  meets the classic national-socialist definitions. But the  essence is not to be found in this disappointing  misunderstanding.    The embarrassment lies in the fact that the same eloquent  prophets, artists at heart, whom from the moment of safe  glasnost they invited to the Russian throne of their own  Pinochet, called upon to cut with a dexterous stroke, in a fully  Chilean manner, all the knots tied by the communists, have  fallen into despair, abusing their own "people as not yet mature  for democracy", having seen in parliament Zhirinovskiy with his  falcons. It would seem, they conjured up a fascist a la Augusto  Pinochet--and a fascist, according to their definition, they  received, but instead of gladness--vulgar language. Or are no  two fascists alike? There are fascists who are ours and who are  not ours.    The problem, of course, lies elsewhere. In the example of V.  V. Z. [Zhirinovskiy] it has become quite evident that many of  our creators of public political theories and images do not  think with arguments and concepts, but with models so to speak,  they put external sympathies higher than logic and concrete  knowledge. Strictly speaking, there would not be anything  surprising in this since Bohemians have started to come out into  political boundaries in the garbs of prophets, and recent  theater critics--have made their debut in the capacity of  newspaper political scientists. . . A whole direction of thought  has arisen which can be fully defined as political Bohemianism.  The legend of N. Nazarbayev can be explained precisely as by the  views of this stratum.    In the case with Nazarbayev, the image of the progressive  ruler, established during the epoch of the ecstasy of  perestroyka, completely concealed the real state of affairs in  Kazakhstan for many Russian lovers of political literature. To  this day, many in Moscow are prepared to close their eyes to the  openly authoritarian order of the republic with the blue flag  and the absence there of--in the Gaydar sense--real economic  reforms, to the national socialism that is gathering force  there, and the edge aimed against the Russian community. And  Nazarbayev is forgiven a great deal because he is. . .  Nazarbayev.    Naturally, Nazarbayev gained a great deal from the fact  that,  at the moment of the collapse of the Union, he was already a  well-known and recognizable politician. He had enough intellect  if only to follow in the wake of Gorbachev, but to keep his  distance, giving rise to rumors of an independence unknown in  the Union. That mask of the independent "perestroyka-politician"  helped Nazarbayev in the beginning to avoid the Gorbachev trap  of the vice presidency, and then not to go to the bottom with  the retinue of the last general secretary.    The Belovezhsk Agreements became the first strike at the  prestige of the "red emir." On the one hand, he was shown his  place, not even having been informed about the plans of the  Slavs. But on the other, it was incredibly comfortable for  Nazarbayev behind the cracked walls of the USSR. Nursultan  Abishevich, earlier than the other colleagues from Central Asia,  understood that an Eastern ruler in of his own accord is of  little interest without the magical power of the Union looming  behind his back. And the state of the union's  semi-disintegration made it possible for Nazarbayev once more to  "shine," coming out with his own initiatives for the  reconciliation of the center and the republics. Taking into  consideration the fact that even President Bush at that moment  was an opponent of the liquidation of the empire, the mediator  Nazarbayev collected points in the larger world game: He was  recognized and well remembered. And the longer the period of  semi-disintegration would last, the more of the residues of the  might and authority of the Union would be "privatized" by the  Kazakh, who had understood the methods of Shevardnadze very  well. But Shevardnadze at this moment had virtually departed  into non-existence and all the laurels went to Nazarbayev. For  this reason, the rapid disintegration of the Union became for N.  A. N. [Nazarbayev] the strongest personal defeat. In the  economic sense, he already did not add anything to it, in the  political sense, the losses were obvious.    Vague and temporizing was Nazarbayev's position during the  days of August 1991, but he left the Union with an international  reputation of a politician of wise, balanced and open reforms.  The latter circumstance, strictly speaking, in no way assumed  concrete form. But the image is really more precious than money.  Somehow in the bustle it was forgotten that the liberation of  prices, already widely announced, was held back precisely at the  insistence of Nazarbayev, and to this day it is unclear what the  cost of the ultimatum of the "reformer" of Russia was.    Later the insurance policy of its own natural resources  mitigated for Kazakhstan, in contrast to some of the other  post-Soviet republics, the burden of the transition period, and  the interest of Western investors in the power of Nazarbayev was  hastily proclaimed as the best proof of the effectiveness of the  reforms begun under his wise leadership. About the policy which  so actively fought for the formation of the CIS nothing bad  could be written at all. Either good, or not all.    Meanwhile Nazarbayev understood one indisputable truth: What  concerns Western investors is not his passion for reform and not  even state democracy (naturally democratic proprieties must be  observed), but only political stability.    And as a result, the simple goal of stability began to  justify any means: The suppression of any free thinking,  suppression of the press, the pleasing of Kazakhstan's own  nationalists, the forcible change of the demographic situation,  and bans even on national-cultural autonomy. Nursultan  Abishevich drew conclusions from yesterday's masochism of his  Russian colleagues, who for the past 2 years, as it were,  specially tested their own fate, discussing abroad the threats  of the red-browns, apparently not being aware that in so doing  they merely decrease the chances for capital investments from  the outside. Nazarbayev, on the contrary, quite in the Soviet  manner, likes to talk about the unity of the people of  Kazakhstan.    But precisely here the "Russian question"--the fate of the  Kazakhstan Slavs, who constitute nearly 40 percent of the  republic's population--presents a special danger for the  building of the Nazarbayev prosperity. The slightest allusion to  the coming aggravation of inter-nationality relations in the  "red emirate", threatening unprecedented shocks--and the  ephemeral reformist curtain, put up with such oriental art by  Nazarbayev, simply comes tumbling down. The projects of the  century will remain unrealized, but the king (more  correctly--"emir") risks turning out to be naked. The  laughing-stock for all.    The realization of such an indisputable fact during the past  several months is clearly obscuring Nazarbayev's reason.  Meanwhile the crisis in his relations with the Kremlin is slowly  ripening. Strictly speaking, Nazarbayev received the first  strike from Russia at the moment of the breakdown of the de  facto ruble space. Not having received the requested supplies of  Russian rubles of the new pattern, Nazarbayev, the "successful  reformer," was deprived of one of the bases of his ostentatious  economic prosperity--permanent Russian subsidies. The time of  prosperity was over.    Since that time, Nazarbayev and Yeltsin have practically not  had a single personal meeting. Even during the CIS summit  meetings. Recently in Ashkhabad Nazarbayev found the possibility  to meet and talk tete a tete even with Leonid Makarovich  [Kravchuk], but by no means with Boris Nikolayevich. Nazarbayev  with all his might is demonstrating his dissatisfaction with the  policy of Moscow, which has revealed, with some delay, the  millions of our own compatriots in the outlying districts of the  former empire. A new turn for Nazarbayev for the demonstration  of character is the problem of dual citizenship for Russians,  who by the will of fate have unexpectedly turned out to be  emigrants.    And here Nazarbayev displayed a for a refined and variegated  oriental ruler unprecedented inflexibility. His unbending "No"  clearly troubled Andrey Kozyrev, who with all his might tried to  observe diplomatic etiquette. Moreover, Nazarbayev not only  himself does not allow his Slavic subjects to adopt a second  Russian citizenship, but he also is among those who are now  exerting pressure on A. Akayev, who has already given his assent  to the Russian proposal. Why is Nazarbayev so confused by the  specter of a second passport among his fellow citizens who are  residents of Kazakhstan? Is it not because the queues in front  of the Russian embassy better than anything else tell about the  real achievements of his regime?    The introduction of dual citizenship clearly does not suit  Nazarbayev for two reasons. First of all, the very logic of  authoritarianism does not leave the subjects (we are not talking  about citizens) room for maneuver. It is no secret that not only  Russians are aspiring to Russian citizenship everywhere, but  many "aboriginals"--titular nations. The classic example is  Armenia. Secondly, dual citizenship, under any propagandistic  orders, is the acknowledgement of national trouble, smouldering  behind the smiles of Nursultan Abishevich. Of the indirect  support of the "Russian question," an act whose existence can  mine the "system of Nazarbayev." This, the "red emir", who  counted on the attractive, painted curtain of complete political  and ethnic stability, cannot allow under any circumstances. The  comedy of masks must be continued as long as possible. For the  time being, large dollar flows are not coming into Kazakhstan.  Well, and then, as, evidently, they count on in the entourage of  the "emir." The West, having become the hostage of its own  money, will be forced to support any eccentricities of the ruler.    However, it is not enough for Nazarbayev simply to refuse  the  Russian proposal for the introduction of the institution of dual  citizenship. It is extremely necessary for him to receive  directly from the Kremlin the assurance that no "Russian  question" of any kind exists in the Kazakhstan subordinated to  his will. There cannot be because there can never be one! And  this is why, as people in the know assert, Nazarbayev  demonstratively procrastinates with the long ago announced  personal meeting with his colleague Yeltsin, trying to attain,  they say, from the Russian president public confirmation of the  "inter-nationality purity" of the policy of Nursultan  Abishevich. To go for such a concession to Nazarbayev would be a  strategic error for Yeltsin. Especially in the present  conditions, when even for the defense of the far-away Serbs, the  parliamentarians are ready to become a friendly and inviolable  wall.    And for this reason, one can expect from Nazarbayev in the  near future unexpected unfriendly improvisations with respect to  Russia. It is not out of the question that the "red emir" will  blame some of his domestic difficulties on the intrigues of  Moscow and simply Moscow inflexibility. Variations are possible.  But one thing is obvious, many in Moscow will have to part with  illusions regarding the wise and just oriental ruler.    P.S. Incidentally, already in America Nazarbayev cautioned  against the extension of assistance basically to Russia, whose  policy is becoming increasingly more rigid in relation to the  so-called near abroad. H.A.N. [Nazarbayev] wisely counseled to  support Moscow depending on its faithfulness to democracy.  Whoever's cow would moo, and Nazarbayev's goat. . .</p>

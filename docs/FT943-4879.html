			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / HK airport 'not ready for 1997' The Hong Kong government yesterday admitted for the first time that the colony's multi-billion dollar airport would not be fully operational by the time British rule comes to an end in mid-1997, Simon Holberton reports from Hong Kong. Mr Hank Townsend, chief executive of the Provisional Airport Authority, the government corporation responsible for the building of the airport, said contracts to build the terminal building and services would not be finished until mid-way through 1997. Award of these contracts, which have a combined value of about HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 670m), was taken a step closer on Monday when the PAA said 16 international consortia of construction companies had qualified to bid. China appears to have balked at a UK request to approve financial agreements between the Hong Kong government and the PAA and the Mass Transit Railway.</p>

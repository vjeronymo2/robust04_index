			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Church may have to cut clergy, synod told SERIOUS FINANCIAL problems will force the Church of England to examine issues as fundamental as the number of full-time clergy it employs, its General Synod was told yesterday. The Right Reverend John Wayne, Bishop of Chelmsford and chairman of the Lambeth Group - a committee examining issues arising from the investment management of the church commissioners - told the synod that the Church's financial problems were likely to become 'even more difficult in the short term'. The problems have been brought to a head by a drop in the capital value of the church commissioners' property-dominated investment portfolio. Total value of income-producing assets fell from nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year. Criticism of the commissioners, who are responsible for handling the Church's main investments, led to the establishment of the Bishop of Chelmsford's group last year. But even before publication of its report the bishop set out some of the choices the Church will face. During the early 1980s, he said, the commissioners had financed better stipends, pensions, retirement housing and other benefits for its clergy. As a result, the Church had become too reliant on the commissioners. 'We became ever more ready to embark upon good and desirable work without facing up to the costs, or our ability or readiness to pay for it.' The Church had to look at such questions as the number of stipendiary clergy it needed, and might become increasingly dependent on a non-stipendiary ministry. Urgent action, said the bishop, must be taken to increase contributions from Church members, which did not compare with other churches. The Church of England needed to move rapidly towards making the majority of parishes self-financing. 'There can be little justification for the commissioners' money being used to assist parishes which scarcely need their help.' The average level of stipends financed by the commissioners - currently 41 per cent - is likely to fall to below 30 per cent by 1996. Mr John Smallwood, a commissioner, told yesterday's meeting that parishes would have to meet up to 90 per cent of clergy salaries by the end of the decade. Mr Michael Colman, chairman of Reckitt &amp; Colman and the recently appointed first church estates commissioner, admitted that he shared the reservations of speakers who were concerned about the size of the commissioners' holdings in property and gilts. About half the commissioners' investments are in property - a much higher proportion than most investment institutions. Sir Michael said he did not see justification for the Church risking the market exposure this level of investment created.</p>

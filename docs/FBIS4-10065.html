			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Morning Paper" newscast] </F>   [Text] Honduras has asked the U.S. Government for time to  settle all property expropriation demands involving U.S.  citizens. According to Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar,  Honduras has promised an adequate solution, but any solution  must always be within the law.    Republican Congressmen have proposed the suspension of  economic aid to Honduras as a means of pressuring for the  solution of demands by U.S. citizens who have been victims of  expropriations. They also asked that the United States oppose  the granting of multilateral credits to governments that do not  respect the rights of their citizens abroad. Foreign Minister  Ernesto Paz Aguilar reacted to the Republican Congressmen's  proposal as follows.    [Begin Paz Aguilar recording] The U.S. Congress is now  debating the general issue of expropriation of property  belonging to U.S. citizens abroad. Honduras falls in this group  because there are a number of cases, apparently 10 or 11, in  Honduras. We have asked the U.S. Government to give us some  time to solve all these claims. You may recall that these claims  are over four years old; they existed prior to our  administration. They are very old claims. They are now pressing  for a solution.    The Honduran Government's position is that this is going to  be solved appropriately, within the law, respecting the law,  analyzing each case. Each case is different. It is possible  that in some cases the claimants are correct, while in others  they may not be.    Another matter is that under international law, it is normal  for foreign citizens who live in our country, when they feel  unprotected, when justice is denied, or when there is a delay in  the administration of justice, to appeal to their diplomatic  missions and their corresponding governments to defend their  interests. International law establishes this. [end recording]    Although Honduras recognizes that some expropriations cases  do exist, the foreign minister said not all U.S. citizens'  complaints in Honduras are specifically related to this issue.    [Begin recording] [Paz Aguilar] I would like to say that not  all are expropriations cases. Some are disputes, some  conflicts. These might be between Hondurans and U.S. citizens;  these might be between the Honduran state and U.S. citizens.  Therefore, each case must be analyzed. I believe whoever is  right will win the case in our courts, as these are the only  bodies that can bestow justice.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there a time limit for Honduras  to  solve these cases?    [Paz Aguilar] What we have said is this new government has  barely taken office. We have not been in power for even 70  days. We said it would be unfair to sanction Honduras for events  that occurred in the past. We are only asking for an  opportunity; we are asking for some time to resolve these  problems, within the law's framework. [end recording]    Reports presented by Republicans to the Senate's Foreign  Relations Committee suggest that visas be denied to foreigners  who are deemed responsible for confiscating U.S. citizens'  properties in their respective territories. The foreign  minister was asked if this was related to the U.S. Embassy's  decision to deny former Immigration Director [words indistinct]  a visa.    [Begin Paz Aguilar recording] These are merely [word  indistinct] measures; they are pressure tactics. Nevertheless,  I would like to reiterate that the right to grant a visa to  enter a nation is that nation's option. That means the United  States has every right to grant or deny a visa. Honduras can do  the same, or, it does the same. It is the Honduran Government  that decides if it grants a visa to a foreign citizens. [end  recording]    Honduras, along with Nicaraguan and Costa Rica, was singled  out. There are 1,603 cases of the expropriation of U.S.  citizens' property between the three countries.</p>

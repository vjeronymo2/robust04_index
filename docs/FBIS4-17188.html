			<p>BFN     [Text] A high-ranking official in the Ukrainian president's  administration reported in his interview with the agency  INTERFAX-Ukraine that the statement by Black Sea Fleet Commander  Vice Admiral Eduard Baltin saying that as many as 35 percent of  the Fleet's ships had been already transferred to Ukraine is  false. In his words, "these ships are being build at the  Ukrainian shipyards and have nothing in common with the Black  Sea Fleet."    In his interview with INTERFAX on Wednesday Vice Admiral  Baltin declared that a total of 35 percent of the Fleet had been  already transferred to Ukraine and "the remained 65 percent are  to be divided."    The official in the presidential administration declared  that  "in accordance with the agreements reached in Yalta, Zavidovo,  Massandra, and Moscow, the Black Sea Fleet ships and crafts will  be divided on a 50-50 basis." About 20 percent of ships and  crafts needed for Ukraine's defense will be assigned to it, he  said. "The remaining 30 percent can be sold to any other  country, including Russia," he pointed out.</p>

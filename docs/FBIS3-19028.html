			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Shrimsley: "Alert Comes as Committee on </F> Ulster Is Voted In"]    [Text] Last night's attack coincided with the start of 24  hours of significant political activity on the future governance  of the Province.    Not only did it take place during a debate on the renewal of  the Prevention of Terrorism Act but it came just hours before  MPs voted to set up a select committee on Northern Ireland for  the first time in Parliamentary history -- a move bitterly  opposed by Nationalists.    It also came on the eve of today's Anglo-lrish Conference  talks in London between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland  Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish deputy premier.    The two men will consider the best way to move forward from  the Downing Street Declaration after its effective rejection by  Sinn Fein.    MP's were speculating that the attack -- the most serious on  the British mainland since the Downing Street Declaration --  will increase the pressure on Mr Major to end all efforts to  bring Sinn Fein to the negotiating table.    One said: "This just boosts the need to turn the screw on  the terrorists."    However, senior sources said last night that they would not  allow the attack to "deflect" them from their search for peace.    Last night's vote to establish the select committee, which  was passed by 324 to 221 votes, met a key Unionist demand and is  seen by them as an important step towards closer ties between  Britain and Ulster. While all other departments have a select  committee to monitor their work, ministers had resisted  establishing one for Northern Ireland, arguing that without  Nationalist support it could damage the peace process.</p>

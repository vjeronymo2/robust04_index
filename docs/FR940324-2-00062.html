Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Therefore, the CMHS strongly encourages all awardees to provide smoke-free project and work environments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of the goals of this program are consistent with the President's Health Care Reform initiative (e.g., providing quality mental health services, reducing the number of unnecessary inpatient and outpatient medical visits, and increasing productive work capacity as a result of receiving these services) and support the DHHS Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people, preventing future problems, and improving services to our customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Part II_Programmatic Purpose, Goals and Scope, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Services Demonstration Projects: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  CMHS will award competitive cooperative agreements under Section 520B of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to develop or expand programs to provide mental health services for individuals, their families and others who experience serious psychological reactions as a result of HIV/AIDS antibody testing, and to provide mental health services for people with HIV/AIDS.

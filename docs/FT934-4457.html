			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher takes stake in German office supplier Kingfisher, the retailing group, is buying a 33 per cent stake in Maxi-Papier-Markt, the German office superstore group for DM20m (Pounds 7.9m). The purchase follows its move into France through the takeover earlier this year of Darty, the electrical retailer. The agreement also involves Staples, the US office superstore chain investing a further DM20m in Maxi-Papier, which was founded in 1989 and operates 11 office discount stores in Germany, lifting its holding to 49 per cent. Kingfisher and Staples formed a joint venture last year to develop office superstores in the UK. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of Kingfisher, which also owns the B&amp;Q, Comet, Woolworths and Superdrug chains, said its entry into the German market was a direct result of its relationship with Staples. 'Staples' and Maxi-Papier's expertise in the office supplies industry combined with our own retail experience will enable us to expand and grow this business,' he added.</p>

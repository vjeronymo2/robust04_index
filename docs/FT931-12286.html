			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Milan magistrates widen their net MAGISTRATES investigating the Milan municipal corruption scandal have widened their investigations to include the controversial reorganisation of the chemicals industry in 1990. Under investigation are ENI, the state oil concern, the Ferruzzi Group's Montedison, and Anas, the state road building authority. The Milan scandal, which this week saw the 100th person arrested on corruption charges, has shaken the Italian political establishment. So far the political casualties have mainly been politicians with a base in northern Italy. This includes Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, whose home base is Milan. Parliament is considering whether to waive his parliamentary immunity over allegations of corruption and illegal party financing. A picture has emerged of a well-organised and systematic process whereby the main political parties, headed by the Christian Democrats and Socialists, demanded 5-7 per cent on public works contracts. However, the investigation is now focusing on the activities of the parties in Rome, where the same process is believed to have been practised on a bigger scale. The spotlight on road building contracts has followed the interrogation on Tuesday of Mr Alberto Mario Zamorani, a former deputy managing director of Italstat, the civil engineering subsidiary of IRI, the state holding company. Equally explosive is an investigation into the sale by Montedison to ENI of its stake of their jointly run chemicals group, Enimont. The oil and petrochemicals industry had long been considered a fiefdom of the Socialist party. In the past few days police have searched both Montedison and ENI offices. They also sought files from the office of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former chief executive of Montedison. Milan magistrates are also investigating power station contracts. But this so far has been limited to Sardinia. Rome magistrates are investigating the purchase by the treasury of a number of buildings in Rome. Following arrests on Wednesday of four senior or retired civil servants, including a former director-general of the treasury, 44 people have now been charged with corruption in this investigation. Milan magistrates have been persuading the Swiss authorities to co-operate more closely over access to suspect bank accounts. As the magistrates' net draws closer to party headquarters in Rome, Mr Craxi has suggested that parliament form a commission to examine party financing. The Christian Democrats have given informal backing; but Mr Craxi's enemies see the move as a smokescreen.</p>

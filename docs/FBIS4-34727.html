			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  requested that comments and criticism with respect to the Armed  Forces be made with some kind of foundation and that those  making these criticisms "at least have completed the fourth  grade."    In an open criticism of the education of legislators  studying  the draft bill on the National Defense Organic Law, the  president said: "I think people with experience should comment  on these kinds of issues, particularly military issues. But it  is precisely those who have not completed the fourth grade or  done their military service who want to comment."    The head of state made these comments when asked about the  position of legislators who support the idea of having an equal  number of military and civilian representatives in the National  Defense Council. The occasion was the celebration of the "Day  of Military Justice" at the Diserjumil [Military Justice Service  Directorate] premises in Itaugua.    Rear Admiral Carlos Lopez Moreira agreed with Wasmosy, and  pointed out that the executive bill essentially seeks "to avoid  excessive bureaucracy." Lopez Moreira said the idea is to avoid  having a gigantic National Defense Council that would be  difficult to assemble. The admiral added that officers are not  opposed to including "civilians" on the council, as some  legislators want to make people believe.    Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee members, who were  scheduled to discuss the retirement of Armed Forces officers who  want to run for president or other important positions, decided  to postpone the discussion of the issue until 29 June, due to  the absence today of the military representatives.    According to a note remitted to Defense Committee President  Sergio Lopez, the military representatives justified their  absence "due to service reasons."</p>

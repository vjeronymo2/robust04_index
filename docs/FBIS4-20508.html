Sixty thousand copies  of the document are expected to circulate in research circles,  kicking off the minister-initiated national discussion that will  culminate in a great parliamentary debate in June.    In January, 1982, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, then minister of  research and technology under the Mauroy government, inaugurated  the "National Research and Technology Days." Twelve years later,  Francois Fillon has borrowed the formula to "survey the state of  French research" and "collectively define strategic priorities."  The national research debate was announced last May and aims to  "wipe the slate clean and redefine priorities." It was  ultimately postponed until last fall, when a group of experts  headed by atomic energy high commissioner Roger Dautray compiled  a preliminary report.    The first draft of the expert report was written between 14  September and 3 December, 1993, and barely scratched the  surface. Overly concerned about circumscribing the debate, its  authors were careful not to make any final decisions or suggest  priorities or strategies. The only exception was a series of  remarks and questions on the prickly issue of higher education  and research organizations, and how to reconcile cutting-edge  research with mass university education.    Since then, various people involved in research have  enriched  the report with their thoughts, desires, and questions  concerning universities, research organizations, big  institutions (Academy, College of France, Parliamentary Office  of Science and Technology), manufacturers, and trade unions.    Six regional symposia to be held between mid-February and  mid-March in Marseille, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Lille,  and Le Mans will base their work sessions on the report, which  features four main chapters[.sup]1[/]:    -- Basic research. In the opinion of the  reporters, France, despite several weaknesses, "is active on  most basic research fronts, and is well-positioned to compete  internationally." But they emphasize the need to raise questions  about how to "maintain research's vitality and dynamism."    Examples of such questions include how to combat the  "persistent inadequacy of engineering sciences"; how to spur  research professors and researchers to "take risks"; how to  increase the ability of research organizations, whose resources  are mostly allocated to "personnel and other fixed  expenditures," to take initiatives; and how to keep budgets for  big programs and equipment from adversely affecting small  science. Regional symposia participants will try to answer those  questions.    -- Science and society. Aware that research often  leads to "results that transform personal and collective life,"  the reporters believe "the scientific community cannot remain  indifferent to the expectations or criticisms of citizens."  Accordingly, they recommend more communication, through a  broader inclusion of learned societies and Parliament in  discussions. They also suggest that scientists listen more  carefully and "pay greater heed to human and social sciences,  which, by shedding light on the factors that determine  scientific and technical creativity and on society's demands,  can bolster interaction [between laymen and researchers]."    -- Research, technologies, and companies. To no  one's surprise, the report's findings here are "worrisome."  French companies spend only 1.3 percent of GDP on research,  against approximately 1.9 percent in competitor countries. The  report stresses, for instance, that German industry conducts  nearly twice as much research and development work as its French  counterpart, and employs twice as many researchers. Moreover,  although "the big state-led and -supported programs (in  aeronautics, space, nuclear power, telecommunications, and so  on) have scored many successes," their "effect is only decisive  in their own industry" and "spills over very little into others."    Isn't it time, the reporters wonder, to question the  relevence of objectives and the methods used to achieve them?  Shouldn't S&amp;T policy seek to revitalize the technological  fabric  of small and medium-size companies; inject a little science into  traditional industries such as construction, public works,  agriculture and food, etc.; and redefine research priorities for  higher education and the big professional schools?    -- Higher education and research organizations. A  significant amount of research, especially basic research, is  conducted in establishments of higher education and specialized  organizations. But in the opinion of the reporters, particularly  Academy of Sciences president Jacques Friedel, higher education  must adapt to future needs without delay.    Put another way, the reporters suggest that there may be a  need to team up with regions, companies, and local government  agencies to create short, accessible technology-training  programs better suited to mass education. This would not be done  at the expense of university research, whose level would be  maintained through the development of centers of excellence. The  reporters seem to favor such a shift, just as they appear open  to the idea of more overlap between the research and teaching  communities.    This contrasts with their December observation that "the  notion floated by some of a future merging of the two  professions would require an exhaustive study to assess its  relevence and feasibility." The reporters tried to soften their  remarks on the question this time around, for it is a sensitive  one. The new document states that "without abandoning a system  of research organizations that has proven its worth," we must  "think about how we can incorporate that system into the  university fabric."    NOMINATION: Jacques Joussot-Dubien as the  vice-president of the Higher Council on Research and  Technology. Higher education and research minister Francois  Fillon installed the new Higher Council on Research and  Technology (CSRT) on Tuesday, 1 February. The research minister  is the lawful president of this body, which elected 65-year-old  Jacques Joussot-Dubien as vice-president. The CRST was created  in 1982 to advise the government on important science and  technology choices, and consists of 40 members who sit for  two-year terms. [Jacques Joussot-Dubien, born in Oran, Algeria  on 12 April, 1928, specializes in photochemistry and lasers. He  is a professor at the University of Bordeaux-I, director of the  Wave/Matter Interaction Physics Laboratory of the Bordeaux  National Advanced School of Chemistry and Physics, and an  elected correspondent of the Academy of Sciences as of 1980.  Joussot-Dubien was research director at the central  administration of the National Education Ministry from 1986 to  1988.]  Footnotes  1. Plus a very short fifth chapter on regions, Europe, and the  world.</p>

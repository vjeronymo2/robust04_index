			<p>BFN     [Text] Israeli sources now say that PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat will arrive in Jericho during the first week of July.  The sources said 'Arafat will probably ask to meet with Prime  Minister Rabin, but it is not clear whether such a meeting will  take place. The security forces have decided to plan for  'Arafat's upcoming visit. Among proposals are the closing off of  all roads in the Jordan Valley during the visit.</p>

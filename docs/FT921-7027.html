			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): CAC-40 nears 2,000 at start of new account THE CONTINENT started the week in a positive mood, though trading became increasingly technical, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS rose for the sixth consecutive day as the new account opened, but it came off the day's high on afternoon profit-taking. Dealers reported that a large US sell program hit the market just before the close. The CAC-40 index reached 1,993.44 at midday but closed at 1,976.52, up 14.15. Volume eased to FFr3.6bn from FFr4.3bn. Dealers were divided about the CAC-40's chances of rising above 2,000 this week. The CAC-40 was last above 2,000 on July 20, 1990. Some were worried that the bourse was running out of steam and that there would not be enough volume to push the index through this chart resistance point. Euro Disney rose another FFr1.70 to FFr154.70 with 775,900 shares following last week's news that it would replace Perrier in the Cac-40. Cerus, the French holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo de Benedetti, added FFr5.20 to FFr134.50 on rumours that a third party wanted a 10 per cent stake. Hachette and Matra advanced FFr13.50 and FFr5 respectively to FFr166 and FFr180 as investors searched for laggards. FRANKFURT overcame a hesitant start and ended at another 18-month high. Dealers cautioned that the market was becoming too technical and had lost touch with fundamentals, such as the slowing economy and the increased cost pressure on earnings. The DAX index closed 11.47 higher at 1,729.10, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 5.32 to 701.98. Volume fell to DM6.9bn from DM8.6bn. Viag rose DM6.30 to DM379.80 after reporting an expected 20.5 per cent rise in 1991 profit. The mechanical engineering sector was also firmer with Preussag up DM4.80 to DM381.80 and Linde DM14 higher at DM817. MILAN was encouraged by good February inflation data and prices continued to firm in the after-market. The Comit index rose 3.51 to 540.08 in turnover estimated at L80bn after L84.5bn. Eridania, which is about to come under the control of its French subsidiary Beghin-Say, saw its ordinary shares rise L266 or 4 per cent to L6,900, while its saving shares added L215 or 4.3 per cent to L5,240. Dealers said these gains reflected late demand on Friday and that volume was light. Cementir fell another L16 to L2,495 as the stock's speculative premium evaporated. The stock has lost 10 per cent since last Thursday, when it became clear that Caltagirone, Cementir's new majority shareholder, would not buy out minority shareholders. MADRID rose on speculation that the central bank would cut interest rates today. The general index gained 1.40 to 260.35 in turnover estimated at Pta12bn. Telefonica reversed some of last week's losses to end up Pta40 or 3.6 per cent to Pta1,135. AMSTERDAM consolidated after Friday's rally, as 1991 results due from Unilever today and Philips on Thursday kept activity low. The CBS Tendency Index edged up 0.1 to 126.2. KLM fell 40 cents to Fl 40.10 in active trading following weekend reports that merger talks with BA had reached a critical stage. Royal Dutch recovered from last week's poor results, moving up Fl 1.6 to Fl 143.40. Akzo, which reports 1991 results tomorrow, gained Fl 1.20 to Fl 145.50. BRUSSELS rose to a 10-month high following a cut in the central bank's seven-day advances rate. The Bel-20 index gained 14.35, or 1.2 per cent, to 1,196.89 in turnover of BFr1.25bn. CBR, the cement group, put on BFr400 to BFr8,750.0 on speculation that SGB might sell its 43 per cent stake. ZURICH closed firmer, though uncertainty over the direction of German and US interest rates made investors cautious. The all-share SPI index rose 5.8 to 1,139.5, having earlier reached a high of 1,140.1. STOCKHOLM ended mixed in quiet trade, the Affarsvarlden General Index down 0.3 to 931.3. Astra free B-shares, having risen as high as SKr577, finished up SKr5 at SKr570. Ericsson free B's lost early gains and closed unchanged at SKr113. HELSINKI waited for results from Repola and Nokia, due later in the week. The HEX index put on 7.9 to 935.9 in turnover of FM34.5m. ISTANBUL fell to a three-month low, the 75-share index closing down 381.62 or 9.6 per cent to 3,603.89.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 24  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1158.55  1159.91  1163.03  1164.29   1164.35  1162.88  1162.46  1163.91  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Day's High  1164.60    Day's Low  1158.55  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Feb 21    Feb 20    Feb 19    Feb 18    Feb 17      1154.51   1149.62   1140.09   1143.83   1135.65  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

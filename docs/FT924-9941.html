			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / People: Buffett quits Gardiner Gardiner Group, the UK-based distributor of security and surveillance products, faces further boardroom changes following Tom Buffett's decision to retire as non-executive chairman in order to concentrate on his commitments as chairman of Automated Security (Holdings), the electronic security group. Yashar Turgut, chief executive, will temporarily assume additional responsibilities pending the appointment of a new non-executive chairman. Earlier this year Gardiner was forced to replace Ian Nellist, its former finance director who resigned by mutual consent after the group reported pre-tax profits well below City expectations. Subsequently, Harvey Samson was named group finance director in July. Yesterday the company also announced the appointment of Jeff Caplan to the board as director with responsibility for directing and developing the group's CCTV businesses. Caplan is currently managing director of Multi-Video Distribution, Gardiner's specialist CCTV operation which was acquired in 1991. Peter Blenkinsop, 48, has been appointed a non-executive director; he has been involved in the security industry for more than 20 years and was managing director of Scantronic Holdings which included responsibility for Alarm Parts, subsequently bought by Gardiner.</p>

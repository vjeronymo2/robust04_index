			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Nov 24 (AFP) -- A Greenpeace delegation left  300 grams (about 10 oz) of highly toxic waste outside the New  Zealand embassy here on Wednesday in a protest about French  plans to import 500 tonnes of New Zealand PCBs for incineration  in France.    New Zealand does not have the equipment to destroy the PCBs,  which are used as an insulator in electricity transformers, and  French Environment Minister Michel Barnier says France has  agreed to import the chemical out of ``ecological solidarity.''    The French branch of the environmental organisation said on  Wednesday that there were thousands of PCB transformers in  France that needed to be processed as a priority.    The PCBs are incinerated at a plant operated by the  state-owned Tredi group in south-eastern France. Incineration  produces a highly toxic residue, a sample of which was left at  the New Zealand embassy on Wednesday.    Greenpeace said the imports from New Zealand ``will in no  way  solve the growing problem of New Zealand's toxic wastes.''  Greenpeace last year vainly campaigned aginst French imports of  another 500 tonnes of PCBs from Australia.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Travel: Slave to wind and wave - Andrew Anderson braves the elements in Shetland THERE IS no escaping the wind in the Shetland Islands. It swings across the chill North Sea like an invisible fist, whipping spume from the waves, stopping walkers in their tracks and carrying off untethered objects: dustbins, picnic rugs, sheep, unwary tourists . . . The locals seem to consider Force 7 on the Beaufort scale a mild breeze, although Force 10 is enough to make them mutter: 'Aye, the wind's picking up a morsel.' The Arctic terns, knife-sharp, gorgeously streamlined, ride the air currents like Top Guns. Puffins - dressed to kill in multi-coloured beaks, dinner-jacket bodies and stubby orange feet - blunder about like colour-blind gigolos. Only the Shetland ponies seem unmoved, grazing pot-bellied and content in rough pastures. It is the remoteness of the Shetland Islands, far off the north-east of Scotland, that gives them their wild climate. They are slaves to wind, wave and weather, volcanic outcrops cast adrift in a great expanse of water. The convoluted coastline means that no point of the main island is more than three miles from the sea. They are not as flat as their diminutive size might suggest, rising from the sea in craggy leaps to create a jagged cliffscape. The interior is rippled with hills, soft green in the South Mainland hardening to near-Arctic tundra in the north. The islands have no trees apart from a tiny, stunted copse that has become a tourist landmark: people drive up, leap out, point at a tree, have their pictures taken and drive off again, much to the locals' amusement. The islanders - some 28,000 - regard themselves as Shetlanders first, British next and Scots some way behind that. They enjoy waving cheerily at cars, or passing the time of day. Shared interests, once unearthed, lead complete strangers to rummage in fishing bags to find you a top secret trout fly. At the Sumburgh Hotel, standing solidly by the airstrip on the tip of South Mainland, everyone seems to know each other, and the 'offcomer' oil rig workers, regularly grounded by fog at sea, stand out in the crowd. Jarlshof, the unearthed Viking settlement, is a few yards away and well worth a scramble among the stone houses and beautifully constructed underground chambers. Sumburgh Head is good for puffin-spotting. Lerwick, the Toytown capital, can be covered in a couple of hours, but after the deserted countryside can seem like a metropolis. Lerwick is best known as home to the Up-Helly-A festival, a New Year shindig of Viking costumes, flaming torches, epic tale-telling, epic drinking and the ceremonial torching of a replica longboat in the harbour. Tourism in the 17 inhabited islands is geared to the outdoors. Bird watchers will have a field day: besides terns and puffins there are gulls and guillemots, cormorants and oystercatchers and the thuggish great skua, or 'bonxie', which dive-bombs any twitcher who strays too near its nest. Anglers can cast a fly in a different trout loch every day for a year - although the wind may cast it back at them - or try salt-water sea-trout fishing in the 'voes', where a loch meets the sea. There is sea fishing, riding, sailing (for the brave: the sea is glacial) and wind-surfing (for Spartans). All land is common so this is a walker's paradise, especially on the springy turf of the cliffs from which one can watch seals sporting in the surf like aquatic labradors. The air seems scrubbed clean. A couple of hours strolling in a 'mild breeze' is enough to wind-blast one to tingling exhaustion. St Ninian's isle is particularly recommended for walking, being joined to the South Mainland by a 'tom bola', a shimmering spit of white sand. Being so far north, the summer months boast near all-round daylight, a time known romantically as the Summer Dim. Conversely, winter is as black as black, although the Shetland tourist board has baulked at calling it the Winter Dull. The benign Gulf Stream means that the islands are rarely very cold - but then they are never very warm, either. Accommodation is plentiful, cheap and largely concentrated in bed &amp; breakfast or self-catering cottages. Many of the island's purpose-built hotels are architectural horrors, but isolated Busta House - a former laird's home in North Mainland that claims to be Britain's most northerly luxury hotel - is well worth a trip. Its bar is warming, its walls feet thick and the library comfortable. Busta's resident ghost - a woman wronged in love in the 17th century - was to be heard moaning in the corridors. Or perhaps it was the wind. Shetland tourist board: Information Centre, Lerwick, Shetland Islands ZE1 0LU, tel: 0595-3434. Busta House Hotel: Busta, North Mainland, Shetland Islands, tel: 0806-22506.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gilberto Banda] </F>   [Text] Reynosa, Tamaulipas, 23 February--A fire on a tank  truck inside a warehouse located in the Colonia Las Cumbres  early this morning revealed a shipment of nearly four tons of  marijuana contained in another similar vehicle and a pickup  truck. The fire chief, Jose Pulido Calvillo, made this  announcement. He reported that, as of this morning, the drugs  still remained in that warehouse, because the strong butane gas  odor prevented their transfer to the force's storage facility,  even though the blaze was under control.    The warehouse guard, identified as Jose Luis Sanchez, was  seriously injured, sustaining burns when the fire began between  midnight and 0100 today, at that warehouse located at No. 1168  East Second Street in the aforementioned settlement.    Pulido Calvillo said that, when residents of the section  reported the blaze, the firefighting personnel responded  immediately to extinguish it. The tank truck in question,  containing butane gas residue, exploded, causing the fire.    He explained that another truck and a pickup were located  nearby and, when both vehicles were searched, the packed  marijuana was discovered.    He added that the pickup truck is presumed to have been  loaded with the drug for local distribution, with the rest  intended for shipment to the United States.    He said that the Federal and State Judicial Police were  notified, as well as the agent at the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office, Francisco Vargas Pelayo, who undertook the  investigation of the case.    The first-named agency and the social representative did not  reveal the firm names on the tank trucks and the other vehicle,  nor the names of the truck and warehouse owners, so as to avoid  interfering with the investigation.</p>

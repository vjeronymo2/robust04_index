			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of General Authorization and Implementing Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The implementing regulations for the General Authorization are organized into five parts: (1) The General Authorization and the types of activities covered; (2) letter of intent requirements; (3) procedures for confirming that the General Authorization applies or notifying the applicant that a permit is required; (4) the terms and conditions applicable to activities conducted under the General Authorization, including reporting requirements; and (5) the circumstances under which NMFS may suspend, revoke, or modify the authority to conduct scientific research under the General Authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Activities Included Under the General Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Research activities that are likely to involve only Level B harassment of marine mammals, and therefore that may be conducted under the General Authorization consistent with the requirements of these regulations, include: Photo-identification studies; behavioral observations; vessel surveys; and aerial surveys over water or land, and over pinniped rookeries if flown at altitudes greater than 1,000 ft (305 meters (m)). These activities are listed in &sect;216.45(a)(3). This list may be expanded as new information becomes available and NMFS determines that other types of research activities are likely to involve only Level B harassment. Comment is requested regarding what other types of research activities are likely to involve only Level B harassment (i.e., no potential to injure) and can be clearly and uniquely categorized as such in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Authorization also applies to persons issued a scientific research permit under the ESA that authorizes the taking by Level B harassment of marine mammals listed as threatened or endangered. An ESA permit holder authorized to conduct Level B harassment is not required to submit a separate letter of intent. Such Level B activities are included under the MMPA General Authorization for Scientific Research and no letter of confirmation is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Activities Not Included Under the General Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in section 2(b) of the 1994 Amendments, ``Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this Act is intended to amend, repeal, or otherwise affect any other provision of law.'' Thus, marine mammals listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA may be taken for purposes of scientific research only after issuance of a permit for such activities pursuant to the ESA (50 CFR part 222). And, except for Level B harassment, other types of taking of marine mammals listed as threatened or endangered that are authorized under an ESA permit for scientific research are not authorized under the General Authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research activities involving the harassment of marine mammals in the wild that have the potential to injure a marine mammal (Level A harassment) are not covered by the General Authorization. They may be conducted only pursuant to a scientific research permit. Likewise, activities that involve the hunting, capturing, or killing of marine mammals for the purposes of scientific research, public display, or enhancing the survival or recovery of a species or stock, or taking by Level B harassment for photography for educational or commercial purposes, are not covered by the General Authorization and require a permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

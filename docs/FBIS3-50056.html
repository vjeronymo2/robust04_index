The recently approved  electoral law does not give this opportunity to members of  national minorities in Hungary. Our correspondent Gregor Martin  Papucek reports from Budapest:    [Begin Papucek recording] The consultative body--also called  a minority roundtable--of 13 enthnic groups who enjoy minority  status in Hungary decided at its meeting in Budapest today to  make a last attempt to resolve the question of direct and  independent representation of minorities in the parliament.  Michal Mata, the executive chairman of the Union of Slovaks in  Hungary, who was present at the meeting, told me that the  participants in the roundtable no longer nurtured high hopes.  Nonetheless, they will write a letter to the president, prime  minister, and the parliamentary speaker. They will also ask a  parliamentary deputy to open up the whole problem again in the  National Assembly and convey views and proposals of the  representatives of the minorities. [passage omitted]    The minorities roundtable will thus make another attempt to  engage in talks with representatives of parliamentary parties.  It makes no secret of the fact that it wants to lobby in order  to change the current electoral law. If this endeavor brings no  results the minorities are prepared to appeal to international  institutions. This is the united view of all participants in  the roundtable. True, they would prefer the issue to be  resolved at home. But as Michal Mata told me, the minorities  roundtable is not willing to accept any solution other then a  direct and independent representation of national and ethnic  groups in the parliament. Thus some kind of a council for  minorities or an ombudsman especially for minorities issues does  not come into consideration. This would amount to very little.  Such attempts at seeking a solution outside of parliament have  recently gained strength in political circles. [end recording]</p>

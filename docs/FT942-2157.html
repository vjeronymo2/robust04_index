			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Upturn 'far short of rip-roaring boom' Bank and building society lending bounced back in May from April's low levels, according to Bank of England figures yesterday. But taken with subdued growth of broad money, the latest seasonally adjusted lending data continued to point to a steady and unspectacular economic recovery. Ms Ruth Lea, chief UK economist of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, said the May money and lending figures were 'a salutary reminder that the UK is not experiencing a rip-roaring boom'. The Bank's figures, the first to incorporate a new monthly system of seasonal adjustment, showed bank and building society lending to the private sector rose by a provisional adjusted Pounds 1.5bn in May. This was below the City's consensus expectation of Pounds 1.9bn growth in such so-called 'M4 lending' but higher than April's Pounds 735m increase, which was revised upwards because of the new method of seasonal adjustment from an earlier announced Pounds 470m. Figures from the British Bankers' Association also pointed to unspectacular lending growth. Its seasonally adjusted data, which is broadly consistent with Bank figures, showed the nine leading UK banks increased lending by Pounds 928m in May. This more than reversed a fall of Pounds 501m in April but was still below the average rise of Pounds 1.08bn in the previous six months. Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said: 'Demand for bank lending from the corporate sector remains elusive.' Consumer credit from the banks remained weak but their mortgage lending increased by Pounds 610m last month, a rise of 9 per cent on April. Meanwhile, the Bank reported that M4, its broad measure of money supply that includes bank and building society deposits and cash in circulation, increased by a seasonally adjusted 5.3 per cent in the year to May, down from revised year-on-year growth of 5.5 per cent in April. The May figure was below City expectations of a 5.8 per cent rise and well within the lower half of the government's 'monitoring range' of 3 per cent to 9 per cent annual growth for M4. The new system of seasonal adjustment also prompted the Bank to revise down its earlier estimates for growth of M0, comprising mainly notes and coins in circulation, to 6.9 per cent in the year to end-May against 7.1 per cent previously.</p>

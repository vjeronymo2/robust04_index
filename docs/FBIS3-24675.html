			<p>Chinese     media coverage of the first meeting of Chinese and Indian  diplomatic and military experts on Sino-Indian border issues  suggests that while some progress was made, problems remain over  how to proceed with the reduction of troops on the Sino-Indian  border.  The meeting, held in New Delhi from 2-4 February, took  place as a followup to the border accord signed by the two  countries last September that created a team of experts to help  the Sino-Indian Joint Working Group implement the border  agreement.  Xinhua on 4 February reported that the two sides  "basically reached consensus on certain issues" and that the  border experts agreed to hold another meeting in Beijing within  the "next few months."  Although there was no further elaboration  on the areas of agreement, Chinese media comment suggests that  the two sides continue to differ over the issue of troop  reductions along the border.  The 4 February Xinhua report  alluded to the problem when it noted that the two sides  "exchanged views" on "solving as early as possible" the question  of "close-range military confrontation in certain territorial  sectors" on the border.  Similarly, Xinhua noted on 14 January  that the Indian Army chief of staff, in an interview that day,  had "apparently made reference to" the "large number of force  levels that would become available" for other uses once the  border agreement was implemented.     Despite remaining differences over the troop reduction issue,  Beijing has indirectly signaled that it continues to see China-  Indian relations as steadily improving.  An article appearing in  the 4 February edition of the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Wen Wei  Po quoted PRC Ambassador to India Cheng Ruisheng as saying that  the "tense situation" between China and India is "now history,"  that the two countries are "working hard to regain lost time,"  and that relations are "improving step by step."

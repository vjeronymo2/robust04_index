			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nellija Locmele: "Program of Christian </F> Democrats Emphasizes Protection of Human Life"]    [Text] Riga, 10 May -- Today, on the eve of municipal  elections for the Riga City Council, the Union of Christian  Democrats [KDS] presented the program it drafted with its  coalition partner -- the League of Economic Activity [SRL]. The  program consists of 14 parts and outlines plans for the coming  three years.    At a press conference, KDS Deputy Chairman Maris Vitols  referred to the program as the basis for KDS and SRL political  cooperation: We believe not only in God, but also in each other.  Vice President of SRL Ojars Blumbergs assessed the cooperation  as real and fruitful.    The priorities of the program are social protection and  health protection, which together help secure human life. In  this domain, KDS and SRL make promises that one cannot find in  other parties' programs -- unemployed people will receive  additional payments in the amount of 50 percent of their  unemployment benefit for working on social jobs (repairing  streets, roofs, etc.); by concluding contracts with local  authorities, social aid centers will be created in the  countryside, which in turn will offer seasonal jobs to local  inhabitants; humane conditions will be ensured in Riga mental  hospitals. KDS states directly what the often-mentioned  reorganization of municipal authority should look like -- it  should become centralized, subordinated to the city mayor (in  the sense of political responsibility), and specialized in three  directions -- securing order in the streets, market places, and  municipal premises. It is also foreseen to create a department  of secret police, to fight gangs, corruption, and robberies.  KDS also promises to carry out, in a few weeks' time, a listing  of city housing funds and to determine the number of inhabitants  living in unsanitary conditions, to whom unoccupied flats should  be granted. There is also a project to cancel the zone-based  ticket system in the Riga city transport, and return to two  radial tramlines on both banks of Daugava, for the convenience  of passengers. KDS also proposes to earmark one part of the  excise tax for the needs of the city -- for transportation and  for fighting air pollution. In the realm of privatization, KDS  is of the opinion that the most optimal variant would be an open  "court of interests," in which lawyers representing the  interests of the town, environment and inhabitants employment  would take part.

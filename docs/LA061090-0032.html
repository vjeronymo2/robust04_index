			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBJECT TO HIGH COSTS  </P> <P> I look forward to Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips column in the Travel Section, but  am losing my enthusiasm very fast. Instead of slapping down the people or  establishments who recommend accommodations with outlandish prices, you give  them space with nary a comment.  </P> <P> I don't count anymore the so-called B&amp;Bs charging three-digit rates for a  room with a cup of coffee and a couple of fancy croissants.  </P> <P> Your paper is read by hundreds of thousands of readers for whom $100, while not  being what it used to be, still means something pretty big. Why don't you  suggest that overly fancy hotels, even when they masquerade as B&amp;Bs, send  their press releases elsewhere to be read by people with money to burn and/or  lavish expense accounts?  </P> <P> Keep giving us the three-four liners of people who really travel and send in  their contributions. But spare us the (mostly American) super-deluxe  commercials.  </P> <P> FRANK S. DESSAYER  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

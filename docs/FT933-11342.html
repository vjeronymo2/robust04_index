			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Tajikistan announces amnesty THE Tajikistan leadership, plagued by rebel attacks from neighbouring Afghanistan, announced an amnesty yesterday for both insurgents and refugees, Reuter reports from Moscow. Itar-Tass news agency said the Islamic rebels operating in Tajikistan were given until September 9 to hand in their weapons. Those in Afghanistan had to return by the same date. The amnesty was announced by the Tajik parliamentary leadership, dominated by pro-communists and conservatives. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to Afghanistan from the impoverished Central Asian state after the Islamic-led opposition was defeated in a civil war late last year. Most of the fugitives have been reluctant to return and the government has refused to hold talks with the rebels. Russian and western human rights groups accused Tajikistan's government on Tuesday of allowing the torture and persecution of refugees returning from camps in Afghanistan. The Tajik and Russian governments say the rebels have launched several attacks across the border, which is guarded by Russian and Tajik troops, with support from Afghan mujahideen. Mr Anatoly Adamishin, the deputy Russian Foreign minister, arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe yesterday to pursue Moscow's diplomatic drive to end the border conflict. But media reports said fighting at the border was continuing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- Arriving on an  official visit here last night, today Germany's Vice-Chancellor  and Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel had talks with  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They considered  bilateral relations and a range of international problems.  [passage omitted]    Later today Mr. Kinkel was received by President Zhelyu  Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and  Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. He discussed the state  of Bulgarian-German relations and assured the president, Mr.  Yordanov and Mr. Matinchev of Germany's support for Bulgaria's  efforts to carry out economic reform. He also assured them that  Germany would ratify Bulgaria's Association Agreement with the  European Union before the election of a new Bundestag. Mr.  Kinkel told President Zhelev that Germany would continue helping  Bulgaria settle its foreign debt, including its trade deficit  with what was formerly East Germany, the president's spokesman  said.    "Because of its unification, Germany can understand  Bulgaria's problems better than any other West European  country," Mr. Kinkel told Mr. Matinchev, stressing that Germany  would advocate Bulgaria's bid for closer ties with the European  structures. At his meeting with Parliament Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov, Mr. Kinkel said that at the beginning of democratic  reform Bulgaria had been among the leaders in Eastern Europe but  now it is lagging behind. "Bulgaria now needs classical private  economic contacts," Mr. Kinkel told Mr. Matinchev who informed  him of the government's economic policy and the progress of  privatization and the land reform. At his meeting with  President Zhelev the guest pledged his assistance in attracting  German investment.    Saying that he would not like to interfere in Bulgaria's  internal affairs, Mr. Kinkel told the National Assembly chairman  he hoped that parliament would allow the UNPROFOR [United  Nations Protection Force] convoy through Bulgaria into Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. Later on  parliament granted passage. At his meeting with the president  Mr. Kinkel highly praised the decision, the president's  spokesman said.</p>

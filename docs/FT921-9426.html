			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Activity muted as market awaits Ecu sector deals NEW issue activity continued at a slow pace in the international bond market yesterday, although syndicate officials are expecting substantial deals in the Ecu sector later this week. The European Community is expected to raise Ecu490m later this week or early next week to finance loans to eastern European countries. Many syndicate managers are expecting the EC to re-open its Ecu190m seven-year issue, launched by Warburg Securities last month. In addition, Credit Foncier, the French public sector housing finance agency, was thought to be considering a deal of up to Ecu500m at around the 10-year maturity. Elsewhere, the launch of two high-yielding Australian dollar issues underlined the sharp correction this sector of the market has seen this year. The ADollars 100m 10-year deals, by State Bank of South Australia and the Victorian Public Financing Agency, both carried an 11 per cent coupon. At the end of last year, bonds issued by borrowers of comparable credit quality carried coupons of little more than 9 per cent. The higher yields are attracting some of the retail buyers who deserted the market last year when Australian interest rates and bond yields fell sharply. The lead managers of yesterday's deals, Hambros and Merrill Lynch respectively, reported buying from continental European banks with retail clients and Far Eastern investors. In addition to higher yields, many outstanding Australian dollar bonds are coming up for redemption and investors are re-investing some of the proceeds. Bonds worth around ADollars 2bn mature during this month and next. However, the demand for Australian dollar debt securities remains much less than in the recent past. The two deals launched almost simultaneously yesterday proved too much for the market to digest at once. Both deals traded down from issue price to stand at or around a discount equivalent to full fees by the close.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong performance by franc THE FRENCH franc continued to perform strongly against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers speculated that the Bank of France might cut its official interest rates today in a move to stimulate the French economy, writes James Blitz. There was disappointment at the start of European trading that the Bundesbank had reduced the cost of borrowing wholesale funds in the German money market by a smaller amount than anticipated, making it more difficult for France to ease policy. But the franc's strong performance in the first week-and-a- half of the life of the new French government raised hopes that the authorities in Paris might be confident enough to reduce their official 5 to 10-day lending rate, currently at 12 per cent. The franc closed a touch stronger against the D-Mark in London at FFr3.3834 from a previous FFr3.3840. Three-month French franc interest rates fell to about 9.0 per cent from 9.50 per cent, the lowest they have been since November 12 last year. The recent narrowing of the spread between three-month French francs and three-month D-Marks shows the franc is shaking off the need to have a premium against devaluation. The spread was down to around 120 basis points yesterday, having been at 400 basis points in January. However, Mr Jonathan Hoffman, economics director at Credit Suisse First Boston, believes the Bank of France may leave policy unchanged today. He thinks that French industrial companies, which tend to borrow at the long end of the market, are satisfied with the recent reductions in the spread between German bunds and French government bonds - and that this should take pressure off the Bank of France to ease policy. Yesterday's cut in the repo rate took only 4 basis points off the cost of borrowing 14-day funds, when the market had been expecting a reduction of at least 7 basis points to around 8.10 per cent. Both the dollar and sterling performed quite firmly against the D-Mark yesterday, in spite of the modest size of the repo cut. The US unit ended some  1/4 pfennig higher at DM1.6155, while sterling finished 1/2 pfennig stronger at DM2.4475. In New York the dollar further improved to close at DM1.6188. The two currencies were boosted by a revised figure for March consumer price inflation in Germany, putting the year-on-year rise at 4.2 per cent instead of 4.3 per cent. This raised speculation that high inflation might not be such a strong excuse in Frankfurt for tight monetary policy. The dollar was also underpinned by expectations that Friday's CPI figure for March might show an increase in inflation and a need for US interest rates to rise. Sterling's stronger performance was due to a report from the Halifax building society showing that house prices had seen their largest rise for four years in March.</p>

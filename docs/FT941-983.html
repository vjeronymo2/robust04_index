			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Balladur hint over youth pay: Local government elections Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday indicated that he may be prepared to make concessions on a controversial law which allows young apprentices to be paid less than the minimum wage. The law, which the government has insisted is necessary to help curb the rise of youth unemployment, has prompted nationwide demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of French students who demand that it be withdrawn. Mr Balladur admitted that the law 'is regarded as displaying a lack of attention. It is my duty as head of the government to respond to what is an appeal from the young'. He stopped short of offering to withdraw the law, but said he would seek to open a dialogue with youth representatives within the next few days to discuss possible solutions. Mr Balladur was speaking at the end of the second and final round of elections for regional councils, which confirmed the dominant position of his centre-right coalition in local government, but which also brought gains for the opposition Socialist party. The ruling RPR-UDF coalition lost 10 seats but still took 52 per cent of the vote, while the socialists and their allies gained seven seats with 36.6 per cent support, according to the Interior Ministry. The communists secured 7.7 per cent of the final vote, the extreme right National Front 2.6 per cent and the ecologists less than 0.5 per cent. There was a 58.7 per cent voter turnout, against 60 per cent in last week's first round vote. In the first round, the RPR-UDF coalition won 44.7 per cent of the vote and the socialists 28.7 per cent. Mr Balladur described the results as a vote of confidence in the government and RPR-UDF coalition. Mr Michel Rocard, the socialist leader, said the results were very satisfying and demonstrated the recovery of the party since last year's general election. The local elections were the first nationwide vote since the general election and were regarded as an important test for Mr Balladur's government. The prime minister has seen his personal popularity decline steadily since the beginning of the year and his approval rating now stands at below 50 per cent. Yesterday's elections concerned the 1,372 council seats in which there was no outright winner in the first round of voting. The 95 conseils generals are an important part of France's structure of local govern-ment. Their responsibilities include the management and development of public services, such as transport and healthcare, outside urban areas.</p>

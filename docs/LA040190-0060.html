			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRACTICE OF 'OUTING' DRAWS FIRE  </P> <P> Although the gay and lesbian lifestyles differ greatly from my own, I base my  acceptance of them on the belief that what goes on between consenting adults is  their business and not mine.  </P> <P> Now a self-righteous few insist that one's choice of sexual partners is, in  fact, everyone's business. This same group suggests that anyone whose personal  conduct or politics do not pass their inspection is a proper target for public  humiliation, loss of job security and disrupted personal relationships through  exposure of their sexual preferences. This is progress for the gay community?  </P> <P> Sounds like sexual McCarthyism to me.  </P> <P> ELISABETH MAIN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

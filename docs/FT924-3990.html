			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Arts: Docklands Sinfonietta provides competition - Concerts on the South Bank While Levine and the VPO performed, Sian Edwards was conducting the Docklands Sinfonietta next door in the Queen Elizabeth Hall. They are an excellent band, expert and enterprising, and this was a particularly successful programme. Their violins boast a cutting edge - keen rather than harsh, but never emollient - which in Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream Overture reminded us that there is rough, spine-tingling magic in the music, not just faery-effects. The 'chamber'-size forces were exactly right for it; the pizzicato violas, for example, told better against the scampering pp violins than they ever do in big-band performances. Just one quibble: in Bottom's hee-haws, the 'hee' was always played with a modern, drily literal staccato. Even in Mendelssohn's time, no ass ever brayed like that, and if I were Miss Edwards I should have insisted on having at least one violin palpably out of tune for it. The scathing DS string-address was electrical in young Britten's Rimbaud study, Les Illuminations, the better to complement Joan Rodgers' bright and searching soprano. For a long time, Les Illuminations was regularly smoothed out to accommodate fluting English tenors; it has needed the rediscovery of the Britten/Auden Our Hunting Fathers to remind us all that early Britten could be abrasive, even nasty - but always clever. Here, Miss Rodgers did eloquent justice nonetheless to the decadent, swooning numbers too. Miss Edwards kept the ambiguous lines of Ligeti's Melodien lucent and properly tantalising. In Haydn's D minor Symphony, no. 80, the Sinfonietta's muscular elegance paid dividends. By comparison, almost any big-band performance - such as Haydn could never have expected, until his later London seasons - would seem bland, or too comfortably inflated. The English Chamber Orchestra, the St. John's orchestra and the Academy of St.- Martin's-in-the-Fields deserve some thrusting competition; the Docklands ensemble supplies just that.</p>

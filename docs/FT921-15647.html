			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Dixons reports strong Christmas MR Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons Group, the electrical retailing company, yesterday reported a strong Christmas trading period in the UK with sales increases in their 'mid-teens' but said it was too early to tell whether this upturn in consumer spending would be sustained. 'I would like to think so but I do not think we can actually say so,' he said. 'There is more consumer confidence out there than you might imagine. Parts of the country are bouncing with enthusiasm such as Scotland and the North East.' However, the uplift in sales fell outside the company's first-half trading period and could not save it from reporting a sharp fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 17.5m. A revitalised performance in the UK was more than offset by steepening losses at its US Silo chain and a reduced contribution from property development. Nevertheless, analysts were cheered by the news of Christmas trading, and Dixons shares rose 13p to 205p. The analysts suggested that Dixons had been one of the first companies to feel the effects of the downturn in consumer spending in 1987 and might be one of the first to emerge from recession. Group sales in the 28 weeks to November 9 rose from Pounds 812.1m to Pounds 869.3m. Earnings per share fell sharply from 3.4p to 1.6p. The interim dividend was held at 1.6p. The UK contributed Pounds 537.5m - a 5 per cent improvement. Profits grew markedly from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 20.5m reflecting better stock control and management systems and the growing proportion of sales accounted for by the Currys edge-of-town superstores which have superior cost ratios to the Dixons high street stores. As in the past two years, the UK profits figure included Pounds 5m released from the surplus on its extended warranty fund. A similar sum is expected to be released in the second half but will not be repeated next year. Dixons' Silo business in the US suffered an escalation of losses, growing to Pounds 10.9m from Pounds 2.3m, in the face of the severe recession. Profits on property development were Pounds 3.1m, down from Pounds 9.8m and interest receivable also fell from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 3.9m. Dixons announced a management restructuring with Mr John Clare, currently managing director of Dixons Stores Group, becoming group managing director, and the creation of a retail team. Hosting a rare press conference, Mr Kalms, 60, pre-empted the obvious question by saying: 'No, I am not retiring.' Lex, Page 18 Rising losses in US, Page 20 Olympian ambition, Page 36</p>

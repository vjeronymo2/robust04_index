			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Reporter" newscast] </F>   [Text] The nation's oil workers will join the strike staged  by the United Workers Front [FUT] to demand that the government  revoke its decision and not implement the gasoline price hike,  said Pedro Chiriguaya, leader of the Petrocomercial workers.  Here is what Pedro Chiriguaya said:    [Begin recording] [Chiriguaya] The government is mistaken,  totally mistaken. We have already said they are mistaken; there  is no reason to raise gasoline prices.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] go on strike  tomorrow [words indistinct] into a nationwide strike?    [Chiriguaya] We are just now on our way to the meeting  called  by the Federation of Oil Workers and the [words indistinct] in  Pichincha. A decision will be made on Thursday.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Chiriguaya] We must obey our union headquarter's decisions.  We believe the strike will be total.    [Reporter] [Passage indistinct]    [Chiriguaya] In any case, the one to correct the mistake  would be the finance minister, as he is the one who raised fuel  prices. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Fidel Garcia, president of the federation of  public employees in Pichincha, announced they will join the  strike called by FUT as they consider that the gasoline price  hike adversely affects all national sectors, particularly the  most needy. Garcia explained that although they are prohibited  from participating in the strike, they will go ahead anyway as  the government must understand that its duty is to work for  Ecuadoreans, not against them.    In addition, Luis Macas, Conaie [Confederation of Indian  Nationalities of Ecuador] president, said Thursday's strike will  be characteristic of a struggle and that demonstrations will  continue in the coming days until the government revokes its  decision. Macas said that an Indian uprising might occur on 8  or 9 February. Here is what Luis Macas said:    [Begin recording] [Macas, in progress] ...of the union  workers movement, the Indian-peasant movement, that is all the  Ecuadoran people. A day of struggle by the students has been  called for today. In the same fashion, tomorrow the whole  Ecuadoran population is summoned, all of us who are adversely  affected -- that is, from the middle class on down. That  measure is nothing more than a statement by the ruling class, by  this nation's oligarchy, against all Ecuadoreans. We call on  the people to join this struggle; this is a popular struggle.  This summons is coordinated precisely through this nation's  Indian-peasant, workers, and peoples organizations. [end  recording]    Along these same lines, student leader (?Elwis Moreira) has  said the Student Federation will actively participate in the  strike called for tomorrow by Ecuadoran workers. He termed  successful the current student demonstrations.    Meanwhile, in Guayaquil, at the National Teachers Union of  Guayas, Alonso Lopez, president of Teachers' Democratic Front,  was asked about what actions are planned for tomorrow. Here is  Alfonso Lopez:    [Begin recording] [Lopez] Specifically, the Teachers Union  has called on all education sectors: supervisors, directors, and  students in general, to join [words indistinct] tomorrow the  24-hour protest. They should attend peacefully. But if there  is repression, if the repressive forces prevent the  demonstration's normal development, we the teachers, together  with the organized sectors, are willing to carry the  demonstration through to its ultimate consequences. We call on  all organized sectors to gather tomorrow morning at 0900 at the  Centenario Plaza [words indistinct] in the afternoon at 1600.  [passage indistinct] In addition, certain important sectors of  the roads in the Guayas Province will be blocked on Friday, as  on this day we will not stage a protest. The following day, on  Friday we will continue our activities at the National Teachers  Union of Guayas [break in reception] [end recording]</p>

He was speaking straight after addressing the Russian  people from the Ostankino Television studios.    Clinton said Russia could do its part "in two ways - first  of  all, the Russian military are still one of the best trained and  best armed militaries in the world. So, for Russia and the  United States to participate means all these other military  armies, particularly from the smaller countries, get a chance to  do planning, and training, and actual exercises at a much higher  level, than they would otherwise.    "In other words, it's a big thing. It increases the capacity  of their armed forces and their sense of security.    "Also, if Russia joins the "Partnership for Peace", one of  the conditions for joining is saying, "We promise to be good  neighbors. We respect the terrritorial boundaries of all the  other countries in the "Partnership for Peace". So it takes  away one of the big fears that you hear in some countries or in  the Baltics or wherever. [no end quotation mark as received]    Responding to a question about what impressions of Russia he  will take home, the President said, "I think it's a wonderful  country and I have had a wonderful trip. And I think you're  going to have a great future. I know this is a tough time, but  you'll work through it. You'll figure it out."</p>

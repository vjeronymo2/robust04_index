			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LOTTERY HAS HURT NEVADA CASINOS, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> A study by two economics professors at the University of Nevada-Reno says the  California lottery has cut into Nevada's casino business.  </P> <P> The report, released Monday, compares revenue trends in the gambling industry  before and after the start of the lottery in the neighboring state.  </P> <P> Professors Thomas Cargill and Kambiz Raffie said their study for the years 1986  through 1989 shows that gross gambling volume averaged 3.7% less each quarter  once the lottery started.  </P> <P> Cargill and Raffie also said there were fewer visitors to Nevada. That meant  reduced sales tax revenue, which were 4.5% lower than if the lottery had not  been in effect.  </P> <P> The estimated loss in gaming gross revenue to casinos last year is $170  million. Nevada casinos reported their win at $4.5 billion for 1989, up 7% from  the previous year. Gross revenue is computed before business expenses and taxes  are deducted.  </P> <P> Cargill said Californians may not come to Nevada as often as in the past  because they have gambling at home. In addition, he said Nevadans are also  going over to California to buy lottery tickets.  </P> <P> The Nevada Gaming Control Board is conducting its own study of the impact on  Nevada gambling of the lottery. Board economist Gary Horton said the lottery  definitely "impacts" the casino industry. But he added that there were other  factors.  </P> <P> "Many people who play the lottery do it at the 7-Eleven (stores), and they are  not going to drive over the hill (to Reno) or travel to Las Vegas anyway," he  said. The study said what casino owners have known for some time. They have  taken steps to increase advertising and are looking for other markets outside  of California. The industry has also set up slot machine jackpots of more than  $1 million to counter the lottery.  </P></p>

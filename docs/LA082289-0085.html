			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG-TERM DEFICIT PLANS FACE DELAY;  </P> <P> CONGRESS' SLOWNESS ON CURRENT BUDGET CITED BY DARMAN  </P> <P> Prospects that the White House will be able to hammer out a long-term  deficit-reduction plan with Congress later this year have narrowed  substantially, and the effort may be postponed until early 1990, a Bush  Administration official said Monday.  </P> <P> Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that  the dimmed outlook reflects the fact that congressional committees are taking  more time than expected on the current year's budget plan, not that any snags  have developed.  </P> <P> However, Darman said he doubts that the delay will diminish the ability of the  two sides to work out a significant agreement affecting fiscal 1991 and beyond.  He said he still is optimistic that an accord can be reached after the current  year's appropriations process is completed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Momentum From Summer  </P> <P> The Administration had hoped to hammer out a long-term deficit reduction plan  with Congress this year to take advantage of momentum from talks held last  summer.  </P> <P> Those discussions were limited to the budget for fiscal year 1990, which begins  Oct. 1. But, Darman said that "the people who would negotiate on fiscal 1991  are the same people who are working on fiscal 1990, and I don't think it would  be productive . . . to sit down on 1991" without them.  </P> <P> Thus, he said, it is likely that the longer-term talks will not begin until  next year.  </P> <P> Darman suggested also that, once the longer-term talks have produced an  agreement, the Administration may seek to overhaul the Gramm-Rudman  deficit-reduction law to close several major loopholes.  </P> <P> The budget chief said that the biggest gap in the law is that it allows  Congress to add to the budget without limit once it has passed the  early-October deadlines that trigger automatic spending cuts if the deficit  exceeds certain targets.  </P> <P> Other possible changes, he said, involve "silly little" procedural  requirements, such as one forcing the OMB to adhere to one set of statistics  for the pace of economic growth even if the nation's actual growth rate turns  out to be different, as it generally does.  </P> <P> But Darman warned again that the Administration almost certainly would want to  wait until the long-term budget agreement with Congress has been completed  before starting any push to "reform" the Gramm-Rudman procedure.  </P> <P> "I don't favor reforming Gramm-Rudman until you have a credible (long-term  deficit reduction) plan in effect," he said.  </P> <P> Darman made his comments as the OMB issued an updated report showing that  fiscal 1990 appropriations are about on track and that no automatic cuts will  be required under the Gramm-Rudman law, provided Congress lives up to the  budget agreement it worked out with the White House earlier this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $116-Billion Deficit Level  </P> <P> The estimates show that, if the budget were totaled up now, the deficit for  fiscal 1990 would be $116.2 billion. That would be $16.2 billion over the  target set under Gramm-Rudman and $6.2 billion over the level at which  automatic spending cuts are triggered.  </P> <P> But, Darman said, if Congress continues to follow its budget agreement with the  Administration as it approves remaining appropriations bills between now and  Oct. 1, then it probably would come in just low enough to avoid automatic  cutbacks.  </P> <P> "They will try to find a way to spend every last dime" up to the level at which  automatic spending cuts would be triggered, Darman said. "We are cutting it  very close."  </P> <P> The OMB report estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal 1989, which ends  Sept. 30, probably will be near $167.5 billion, roughly $2.5 billion below  earlier expectations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope for Capital Gains  </P> <P> Darman predicted that the Administration would be able to persuade Congress to  approve Bush's proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits  from the sale of stocks, real estate or other assets. Leaders of key tax panels  have hinted as much.  </P> <P> The OMB's deficit projections are somewhat more optimistic than estimates  published by the Congressional Budget Office last week. That agency forecast  that the fiscal 1990 deficit was heading toward $141.5 billion, about $25.3  billion more than predicted by the OMB.  </P> <P> But Darman reiterated that the gap reflects different estimates by the two  agencies of how rapidly the economy would grow, how high interest rates would  be and how quickly the Administration could act to bail out troubled savings  and loan associations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Automatic Spending Cuts  </P> <P> Under the Gramm-Rudman legislation, Congress and the Administration must set a  target of reducing the deficit to $100 billion in fiscal 1990. If they exceed  that target by $10 billion or more, spending is slashed automatically -- by  4.3% for military spending and 5.3% elsewhere.  </P> <P> Partly as a warning, Monday's report contained some illustrations of the  possible impact of such cuts on defense and non-defense programs, ranging from  reductions in grants to needy college students to cutbacks in the war on drugs.  </P> <P> Congress still has several more appropriations bills to enact and also must go  through the process of reconciling differences between the outlays it has  approved and the budget targets it set last spring. The lawmakers are scheduled  to finish their work in mid-autumn.  </P></p>

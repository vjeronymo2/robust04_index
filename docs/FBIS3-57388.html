Olkhovikov promised to present withdrawal timetable very  soon, Luks said while adding another meeting would be held after  a meeting in Stockholm on Paldiski reactors held from Tuesday to  Thursday. The meeting was organised by the Swedish Foreign  Ministry and besides Estonia and Russia also experts from U.S.,  Germany and Finland attend. The deadline for withdrawal is  August 31, 1994.    Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama told a government  briefing on Tuesday the government had supported Justice  Ministry's proposition to unite Paldiski with Keila, a small  town some 30 km from Estonia's capital Tallinn, pending local  elections. This would be a step on bringing civil power  structures to Paldiski, Kama said.    Local elections were skipped in Paldiski last fall due to  Russian military presence.</p>

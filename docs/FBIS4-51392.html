			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Hebei Plant Fined for Dumping Toxic Waste"] </F>   [Text] In the most serious environmental case in Hebei,  provincial officials have fined a chemical factory 90,000 yuan  ($10,300) for discharging toxic waste.    The No 5 Chemical Factory under the Applied Chemical Company  in Langfang, a city between Beijing and Tianjin, is also likely  to be brought to court and forced to pay compensation to victims  of the waste dumping.    The factory has until June 5 to pay the fine, said Wang  Junhe, director of the provincial environmental protection  bureau.    Local officials discovered in February that the factory had  dumped 227 drums of phosphorus sulfide along mountains in Hebei  Province and into rivers in Tianjin municipality.    Each barrel contained 1OO kilograms of the poisonous  chemicals.    The first 20 drums were uncovered on February 22 in the Ziya  River in Tianjin's Xiqing District--a major source of drinking  water for residents.    The local government immediately channeled river water to  the  Luanhe River to clean up the contaminated Ziya. No cases of  water poisoning were reported.    Another 33 drums of waste were uncovered in the rivers and  irrigation canals in Wuqing county, Tianjin.    Wang said the local government is preparing to sue the  director and vice directors responsible.    It is estimated compensation to local residents could be  more  than 1 million yuan ($114,000).</p>

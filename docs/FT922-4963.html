			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Nuclear survey of Kara Sea proposed BRITAIN is to approach the Commonwealth of Independent States for permission to send a research vessel to the Kara Sea, south of the Arctic Ocean, where radioactive waste was dumped by the former Soviet Union. An initial request, in 1989, to monitor radioactivity in the nearby Barents Sea was turned down by the Soviet authorities. Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for radiation monitoring around the UK coastline are drawing up details of the approach to the CIS. British officials want to study the movement of radioactivity from the dump area. Scientists believe contamination may be spreading. Radioactivity has been detected in the sea around Greenland and the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing works of British Nuclear Fuels has come under suspicion. British scientists believe Sellafield is unlikely to be the source. Regular monitoring of an area of the Atlantic Ocean formerly used by Britain to dump radioactive waste has failed to detect any leakage. Dumping in the area, 400 miles from the coast, was suspended in 1982, after a campaign by environmentalists. The ocean there is more than half a mile deep.</p>

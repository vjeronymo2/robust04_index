			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Arts: A new twist to 'The Turn of the Screw' - Opera In the Glasgow Tramway, that gloriously rough, untamed and mysterious theatre space, Scottish Opera has taken up a first-ever period of residence. The choice of work is, on first glance, entirely apt: Britten's The Turn of the Screw, which requires an orchestra of only 14 and a cast of only six, and which solicits its chilling beauties of sound, mood and atmosphere from the most economical and flexible of musico-dramatic substances. On second glance - which on Tuesday took place during the rather fidgety early stages of David Leveaux's new production - the opera's demands for a proscenium-arch prove not always answerable in this loosely defined auditorium. The Governess arrives - by bicycle, not coach - at a Bly spread out over a floor of bark-turf, and framed by a huge cracked, tilted window, a spiral staircase and a pool of murky-looking water (designer: Vicki Mortimer). For the precise scene-setting of Britten and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, the substitute here appears to be an all-too-familiar kind of 'experimental music-theatre': the gap between it and the opera's fine-tuned exactnesses threatens to yawn wide. Miraculously, the performance then sets about healing it up, with a distinctiveness of dramatic purpose that grows ever more sure. Leveaux, a distinguished theatre-director making his first sortie into opera, has divined a way of exploring the trauma-haunted inner avenues of the drama by means of an intensely physical response to the text. The private rituals that unfold between the children, at all edges of this increasingly wide-flung and eerily lit theatrical environment, and the agonies of the adults are enacted with sometimes hair-raising vividness. No-one who has witnessed this Miss Jessel scrabbling desperately in the turf, or this Flora turned by the end into a screaming, spitting fury, is ever likely to forget it. In sum, this production mines frightening new insights out of The Turn of the Screw, a masterpiece capable of supporting just such adventurous theatrical investigation. Leveaux is immeasurably helped by the unswerving commitment of his cast. The children (the touching, slightly frail-voiced Colin McLean and the astonishingly powerful Paula Bishop), Menai Davies's classic Mrs Grose and Louisa Kennedy-Richardson heart-rending Miss Jessel all rise triumphantly to the challenge. Philip Salmon (Prologue and Quint) sings words and notes with Pears-like eloquence. Anne Williams-King, an impulsive, passionate actress with a shining, sometimes unruly soprano, charts the Governess's course with a full-bloodedness that becomes ever more moving in its urgency. Side-stage disposition does not always aid the band; the conductor, Timothy Lole, occasionally risks pressing the (excellent) instrumentalists to melodramatic extremes. But the positive aspects of this remarkable achievement render its handful of negative ones of small account. At the Tramway, Glasgow: until February 26; sponsored by Scottish Opera's 'I'm Backing Britten' campaign</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ORANGES ARE NOT THE ONLY FRUIT': AN ENGLISH GIRL'S ENGROSSING ODYSSEY  </P> <P> A beguiling BBC drama, "Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" (airing twice tonight,  at 6 and 10, on Arts &amp; Entertainment), unfolds like a cinematic,  first-person novel, in this case the odyssey of a girl growing up in a  fanatical evangelical environment in northern England.  </P> <P> What rewards the viewer hearty enough to stick through the overlong three-hour  production (including some 10 commercial breaks) are the sense of place, the  weathered faces of the Christian zealots (a gaggle of aging women mostly), and  the luminous protagonist with the orange hair and wondrous eyes (Emily Aston as  the child and Charlotte Coleman as the adolescent).  </P> <P> This debut of an all-female production team (producer Phillippa Giles, director  Beeban Kidron, and writer Jeanette Winterson, who adapted the film from her  autobiographical novel) is impressive in capturing the novelist's first-person  viewpoint, which is difficult to do on film. You observe this pinched world and  these hatchet faces through the unwavering eyes of the young girl.  </P> <P> The second hour is the most riveting, with the teen-age girl's tumultuous  discovery of the flesh in a lesbian love affair, her denunciation in front of  the pulpit, a harrowing exorcism performed by a charismatic pastor, and her  ultimate break from the church to hit the road selling ice cream out of a van.  </P> <P> Geraldine McEwan is memorably fierce and also loving in her crazed way as the  girl's spiritually obsessed mother. The heroine's two girlfriends (Cathryn  Bradshaw and Barbara Hicks) are exquisite casting, and the protagonist's  affairs with both leap from puppy love to sexual discovery with economy and  touching sensibility.  </P> <P> There's nothing pat about the story.  </P> <P> The tone is never merely satiric or mean-spirited, and the film grows into a  reflection of a young woman's looming acceptance as she prepares to go off to  Oxford with one last visit with Mum and her now rather affectionate-looking  band of believers.  </P> <P> One caution, besides the length, is the British accents. Occasionally, you  can't make out what people are saying, but don't worry about it.  </P> <P> It's small talk, it's life, and you don't need to hear everything. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

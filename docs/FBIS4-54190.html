			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan will suspend imports  of long-grain rice from Thailand, which has accounted for  one-third of all imported rice since the government began  importing the grain after the worst rice harvest last year in  the postwar period, government officials said Thursday [26 May].  Long-grain Thai rice imports reached 570,000 tons, against  total rice imports of 1.7 million tons.    The Food Agency made the decision as contracts on purchases  of Thai rice expired in April, the officials said. They also  cited anticipated boarding troubles of the Thai rice during the  May-June period, the usual rainy season in Thailand. But some  experts say the real reason for the decision is sluggish sales  of long-grain rice, unpopular among Japanese who favor short- or  medium-grain rice.    The agency, which plans to stop sales of Thai rice to  wholesalers at the end of August, has signed contracts to buy  about 400,000 tons of short- or medium-grain rice from China,  the United States and Australia as of Wednesday, the officials  said. The agency plans to purchase an additional 750,000 tons  of rice with expectations of another off-crop season.    Sales of Chinese, U.S. and Australian rice to domestic  wholesalers will begin in September and October, according to  the officials.</p>

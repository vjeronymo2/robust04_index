Police officers found about four kg of cocaine  camouflaged as the inner lining of a suitcase that was in her  possession.    According to the PF, the Bolivian woman had used a resin to  glue the cocaine to the suitcase. She had arrived at Cumbica  International Airport in Guarulhos (in Greater Sao Paulo) hours  earlier on a flight from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. The  suspect was about to board Varig Flight 766 for Zurich,  Switzerland.    Airport police suspected her because of the weight of the  briefcase [as published] (about 8.5 kg) and because her passport  showed that she had made another trip from Santa Cruz de la  Sierra to Europe--the traditional drug trafficking route--within  the previous 30 days. According to the PF, the case will have to  be treated chemically to remove the cocaine paste. Editha was  taken to a Federal Police cell on Piaui Street in Higienopolis  (downtown Sao Paulo). She is being held without bail.</p>

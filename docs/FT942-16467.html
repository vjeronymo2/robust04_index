			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Books: Moistly unpleasant HOUSE OF SPLENDIDISOLATION by Edna O'Brien Weidenfield &amp; Nicolson Pounds 14.99, 216 pages Mention Edna O'Brien, and somebody is sure to exclaim: 'I loved the early books]' Readers were enchanted by those green-eyed country girls and when their heroines' lives became messy and urban, women looked back on their own lost innocence. No writer, though, wants to be remembered only for the early work, and since her starry debut O'Brien has produced a large oeuvre which includes some superb short stories with sympathetic, sometimes beautiful and scorned protagonists. Unfortunately, it is difficult to feel anything kinder than exasperation with Josie O'Meara, the heroine of House of Splendid Isolation, and O'Brien has assembled such a cruel and prurient cast around her that it is hard to know whom to dislike the most. Josie, once beautiful, now old, ill and alone in her decaying mansion, might excite more pity if she had not chosen to pay for the Big House in humiliation and subservience to a brutish husband, or if she had not aborted their child for unconvincing reasons. She would be easier to like if she had not fantasised thus about the priest with whom she fell in love: 'To shower him with things, wordly things, and the fruits of nature. Looking at the thrushes so sleek and plump she longed to catch them with her bare hands and grill them and serve them on toast for him, the way they did in Southern Italy.' Her unconsummated affair with the priest made her a scandalous woman. She was inadvertently betrayed by Paud, who thought her 'the Queen of the Munster Fairies'. Paud was also the unwitting cause of Josie's husband's death when he persuaded him to hide a cache of weapons for the Fenians. O'Meara, drunk as usual, was shot in a brawl with Guards. It was Josie who tipped off the sergeant. Deranged with guilt, she wandered around sucking the spittle from the stems of wild irises. 'Having to be put away for a while. A small room in a nursing home named after St Jude Help of the Hopeless.' Years later, Paud suggests to an IRA terrorist on the run that he hide out in Josie's house. McGreevy, known as the beast, breaks in and holds Josie hostage. A delicately-handled relationship grows between them. That, and the scenes involving the police pursuing McGreevy, show O'Brien at her best. Too often elsewhere the prose goes stravaging and maundering down memory lane with its hair streeling down and its clothes in flitters. Sometimes a remarkable image is skewered on a sharp pin of observation, but those that linger are moistly unpleasant. There is a sickening complicity and voyeurism in the episode where Josie's husband traps her in a sash window and beats her. Then there is lusty Brid, the servant girl, who imagines herself with her lover: 'out of doors in the soft unruly underlay of bog and bogland, everything seeping into her, his instrument in tooraloora fettle.' Josie's husband saw her as a horse: 'Her haunches were what he liked best, wide and yet with a daintiness to them. A good mare.' When Josie is shot, there is less sense of tragedy than of a wounded animal put out of its misery after a wasted life. The crescendo and climax of the book are excellent, but then Paud, who provided its portentous prologue, has to get in on the act with a sententious epilogue. McGreevy was no more the legendary hero Cuchulainn with whom he was compared than Josie was the Queen of the Munster Fairies, although O'Brien succeeds in personifying two sides of a seemingly insoluble problem; a much harder novel struggles to get out of the bogland of history and whimsy, and sometimes breaks free.</p>

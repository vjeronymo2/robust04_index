			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: German bank to raise DM500m convertible BAYERISCHE Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank, the smaller of Bavaria's two leading banks, is increasing its capital by an issue of DM500m worth of convertible participating certificates. The certificates give investors a share of the profits, but do not carry voting rights. Under German banking law, they count as risk but not core capital, and under future EC guidelines will be classed as tier two supplementary capital. The bank is boosting its capital reserves after a year of rapid credit expansion in all areas, including in east Germany. The participating certificates are being offered, at a price yet to be fixed, to holders of shares and to holders of warrants in the ratio of 39 shares or 39 warrants for one convertible participating certificate with a face value of DM1,000. The certificates mature at the end of 2001 and pay a coupon of 9.25 per cent. Investors have the option to convert one certificate into 3 shares in the period June to December from 1992 to 1999. Spain's Banco Hispano Americano and Commerzbank of Germany have agreed to open a joint offshore banking operation in Gibraltar. The bank, to be called Hispano Commerzbank, will begin operations with Pta1bn in start-up capital.</p>

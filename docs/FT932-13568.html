			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: RTZ downgrade Heavy falls in the price of copper led to a sharp decline in the price of RTZ shares as one of the leading securities houses cut its profits forecasts and advised clients to sell. RTZ shares were the worst performers in the FT-SE 100 Index, dropping 27 to 631p. Global copper prices quoted in London hit a 5 1/2 -year low yesterday, prompting SG Warburg to cut its current year estimate of average prices for the key industrial metal by 10 cents to 95 cents a pound. RTZ is the world's second biggest producer of copper, and Warburg subsequently lowered its 1993 profits estimate for the mining group by Pounds 70m to Pounds 575m. The house also changed its recommendation on the stock from hold to reduce.</p>

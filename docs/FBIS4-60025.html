			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>   [Text] In Amman, Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah has said  that his movement will allow nobody to disarm it as long as  there is Israeli occupation. Ghawshah was commenting on  statements made by Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the  Palestinian Police, who announced in Gaza yesterday that he will  organize carrying of arms in the self-rule area. Ghawshah  stressed that the issue of disarming is a red line, adding that  we advise the Palestinian police not to cross this line.</p>

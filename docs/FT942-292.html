			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (20): From cash to cowries - Money and Society / Mark Archer finds Nero and Norman Lamont in the account A History of Money: From Ancient Times to the Present Day by Glyn Davies, University of Wales Press, Pounds 39.95 696 pages The Sociology of Money, Economics, Reason and Contemporary Society by Nigel Dodd, Polity Press, Pounds 39.50 209 pages Should sterling have been devalued? Were the authorities trying to maintain an unrealistic parity? The question, refers, of course, not to the 1992 ERM crisis, nor to Britain's return to the Gold Standard in the 1920s, but to whether 'medieval England was crucified on a cross of silver'. Even the author of the question, Glyn Davies, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Wales, admits that 'at this distance of time it is unlikely that anyone will be able to come up with a convincing answer'. The aside, though, is typical of the many fascinating historical perspectives contained in Davies' highly readable new history of money. During the several centuries in Europe in which money was convertible into gold or silver, control of the money supply was tied to the discovery of new mines or the decisions by rulers in times of shortage to debase the coinage through reminting. By monetising the gold stocks of the Persian empire, Alexander the Great gave an enormous boost to world trade. By contrast, the inflow of New World gold into England into the 17th-century proved highly inflationary, as the accompanying rise in urban population resulted in too much money chasing too few goods. In general, though, bullion famines were the chief cause of economic downturns over a period lasting from the invention of coinage in Lydia in the 7th century BC to the advent of paper money in the forms of bills of exchange from the early 17th-century onwards. The Athenians were the world's first devaluers (405 BC), responding to a silver shortage brought on the Spartan wars. In later times, the spiralling cost of the 'bread-and-circus' budget could equally be said to have been behind the decision by Nero (AD 54-68) and Norman Lamont (AD 1990-93) to let 'the currency find its own level'. By AD 270 the silver content of the Roman denarius had fallen from 50 per cent to 4 per cent, prompting a 50-fold rise in prices which was only brought under control by the Emperor Diocletian's Edict of Prices in AD 301 and his unveiling of the world's first budget. Commodity monies were especially prone to new sources of supply. The value of the Ugandan cowrie shell slumped following its wholesale importation into the country in the mid-19th century. In the more remote regions of Uganda in 1800 two cowrie shells were known to have been sufficient to purchase a woman; by 1860 one would have needed 1,000. Europe had first learnt of paper money from Marco Polo's account of the court of Kublai Khan, which he visited between 1275 and 1292. Indeed, China had experienced paper money, as well as regular bouts of hyper-inflation, for well over 800 years before the printed banknote became common in the west. But it was the establishment of the Bank of England, which effectively democratised the Sovereign's Debt, that initiated the huge increase in the money supply which dominates the second half of Davies' history. Among several outstanding chapters, his account of the origins of the Bank, especially the way in which its position was consolidated by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble Company which had also competed to manage the National Debt, and his analysis of the role of regional banks in the Industrial Revolution, are first-rate. The proliferation of paper money substitutes, from bills of exchange to bank bills and cheques, eventually made the principle of monetary convertibility increasingly hard to sustain, not least because money itself became harder to measure and define. In 1982 the Bank of England admitted there was 'no single correct definition of money but went on to list 24 measurable asset classes', prompting Sir Ian Gilmour's remark about monetarism being 'the uncontrollable in pursuit of the indefinable.' Davies' own monetarist principles show through clearly enough in his discussion of the 18th-century's mercantilist-bullionist debate (which produced John Law's splendidly Keynesian pamphlet A Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money), a debate which anticipated many of the monetarist-v-Keynesian arguments today. But he is honestly agnostic about the relationship between the money supply and the cultural, social and competitive conditions which shape a nation's productive activity and can disrupt the monetarist's best-laid projections of economic equilibrium. It is at this point that a book such as Nigel Dodd's The Sociology of Money ought to be interesting. While the main advantage of modern capitalism may well be 'a necessary - but far from sufficient - condition of an open society in which many alternative cultures can flourish', there has been a surprising lack of interest in examining the different cultural, political and social configurations which economic activity can underpin. Dodd rejects Marx's belief in labour as the sole value of economic life, just as he has little time for the arguments of post-Marxists such as Weber that money is an inescapably alienating force in modern life. But he also rejects the views of classical and neo-classical economists, whether Adam Smith or Hayek, whose view of an individual rationally maximising his utilities in a free market tells us next to nothing about what sort of life such an individual might lead. The disappointment is that Dodd's is a deliberately destructive book which draws back from positing an argument of its own.</p>

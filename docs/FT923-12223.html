			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK small companies It has traditionally been safe to make two assumptions about portfolio investment in smaller companies. Such a portfolio tends to be less responsive to cyclical expectations than one containing large companies, and to outperform over the longer term. The behaviour of the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies (HGSC) index during the recession suggests that at least the first of these assumptions should be challenged. During the first half of this year the index showed the same 4.9 per cent total return as the FT All-Share. It outperformed by 4.4 per cent during the period of euphoria that followed the election and underperformed by 1.5 per cent as hopes of imminent recovery were dashed from late May onwards. Part of this volatility may be simply due to the way the index is constructed. It includes the bottom 10 per cent of stocks by market capitalisation, into which a number of highly cyclical companies will be pushed as their capitalisation falls in the recession. These are also companies in which recovery hopes are also most strongly vested. But there may also be deeper forces at work. According to Paul Marsh of the London Business School, who helped compile the HGSC index, smaller companies are becoming more highly geared both operationally and financially. Their beta - the measure of share price volatility relative to the market overall  -has risen to about 1 compared with 0.85 when the index was launched in 1987. Nor do the very smallest companies appear to have retained their tendency to outperform their bigger brethren. The total first half return on the HGSC index falls by 0.1 percentage points to 4.8 per cent when extended to include USM stocks. There is clearly some evidence of the recession at work here. Institutional investors have become wary of companies with a capitalisation of Pounds 50m or less. Hoare Govett says there has been evidence for just over a year that middle-ranking companies by capitalisation have outperformed the rest of the market. It might be assumed that such deviations from the historic pattern will be reversed once the recession ends. Yet the shape of the economy may be very different by then if ERM membership does lead to a low-inflation, low-growth Britain. Doubtless, real growth will always be easier to achieve from a small base. But in such an environment there is more operational risk in being small as well.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Arts: The Journey - Dance I am lonely./ My body prison./ Door I am lonely./ My body prison./ Door closed./ Hear them/ Talk over my head/ Like vegetable./ They afraid/ To see me out with Mum./ She hates them./ Watch them. This poem is by Bill Robins. He is 24 years old, very severely disabled with athetoid cerebral palsy, and he is the central and compelling figure in a new work made for and by Amici Dance Theatre. Amici is the creation of Wolfgang Stange, whose career has been spent in proving the therapeutic power of dance in helping people with every physical and mental disadvantage to explore and explain their identities in movement theatre. From their aspirations, as from their sometimes distressing handicaps, Stange has guided the creation of brave and challenging theatre-pieces during the past decade - and none more so than The Journey which is at Riverside this week. Bill Robins' condition - in the prison of his body, with a wide-ranging intelligence - is the theme of the work, which has a scenario by Gilly Fraser. Indomitable will can set his imagination free to explore a world and his own hopes. He becomes, thereby, a magic shaman-figure for others, handicapped or able-bodied, who are taught by his suffering as by his bravery, and through his plight - and his needs - they, and we, can learn. Stange's cast of over 40 performers are involved in simple, effective routines. Bill Robins' journey is fantasy, but it confronts handicaps other than his own, and makes powerful cause for the emotional (and sexual) needs of its players. A significant extra to the presentation is the presence of three members of Ra Ra Zoo, the acrobatic theatre troupe. Nigel Warrack, Jeremy Robins and Lindsey Butcher can be seen as physically splendid figures in contrast to the rest of the cast. They may be ideals; they appear, though, as friends, guides, and - playing with great sensitivity - Miss Lindsey becomes Bill Robins' lover. The Journey, as you may gather, is neither mealy-mouthed nor playing for undue sympathy. It is honest in its humour as in its sorrows. Its boldest trick is to introduce a parallel with Giselle. One of the characters is Jack, played with marvellous concentration by Ian Willis. Suddenly he is revealed as a transvestite, wildly arrayed in long red dress, pearls and white gloves. As we hear a recording of the Giselle mad-scene, Jack becomes Giselle, tearing through the crowd of on-lookers, finally killing himself with a drug over-dose. His wife, Mary, grieves over the body. The ingredients seem preposterous; the performance - with an implicit comment upon the reasons for Jack's madness - is heart-tearing. Even more so a later parallel with the last moments of the ballet. We have seen that Bill Robins' character is loved by Lindsey Butcher. As the music for Giselle and Albrecht's last farewell rings out, Robins and Lindsey Butcher are carried in on the shoulders of Nigel Warrack and Jeremy Robins, to meet briefly, clasp at each other, and then be separated. The effect is truer in feeling, more vivid, than the ending of most stagings of Giselle we sit through today. And, as an historical quirk, let me record that it was from these Riverside Studios in 1958 that BBCTV transmitted Margaret Dale's celebrated production of Giselle, with Nadia Nerina and Nikolay Fadeyechev. Thirty-five years later, the immediacy of emotion which marked that superb performance was to be seen in Amici's playing. Amici represents something of huge value: art as understanding. One might go a long way to find an enterprise odder than The Journey. One could travel even further to find something as inspiring. To everyone connected with Amici and this performance, admiration. Amici is part of the Hammersmith Community Education programme. Further support came from London Arts Board, Allied Irish Bank, Harper Collins. Riverside Studios until June 12</p>

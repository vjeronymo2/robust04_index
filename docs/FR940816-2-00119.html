			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, any class may be given exchange privileges. Shares of such a class generally will be permitted to be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics in another Fund. All such exchanges will be allowed only between funds that are within the same ``group of investment companies'' as that term is defined in rule 11a-3 under the Act. At the discretion of the Trustees, exchanges may also be permitted among dissimilar classes. All permitted exchanges will comply with the provisions of rule 11a-3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Any class of shares may offer a conversion feature. A conversion feature will automatically convert shares of one class (``Purchase Class'') to shares of another class with different features (``Target Class'') after the expiration of a specified period, subject to terms fully disclosed in the Fund's then-current prospectus. For purposes of the conversion, all Purchase Class shares in a shareholder's account that were acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of such shares (and which had not yet converted) will be considered to be held in a separate sub-account (``Dividend Purchase Shares''). Each time any Purchase Class shares in the shareholder's account convert, an equal portion of Dividend Purchase Shares then in the sub-account will also convert and will no longer be considered held in the sub-account. The portion will be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's converting Purchase Class shares bears to the shareholder's total Purchase Class shares, subject to the conversion feature, but excluding Dividend Purchase Shares. Any conversion will be subject to the continuing availability of an opinion of counsel or a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the conversion does not constitute a taxable event under federal income tax law. Conversions might be suspended if such an opinion or ruling were no longer available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Any Fund or class may be subject to a Shareholder Servicing Plan whereby the Trust may enter into agreements on behalf of a Fund with certain financial institutions, securities dealers, and other industry professionals providing for the performance of services such as answering client inquiries, servicing client accounts, and other services to existing shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, applicants expect to offer at least four classes of shares: Class A shares; Class B shares; Class C shares; and Class Y shares. The Funds may create additional classes of shares, which will differ only with respect to attributes described above. No Fund, however, will be required to offer all or any number of the classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Class A shares are offered at net asset value plus a front-end sales load, and are assessed an ongoing service fee under a servicing plan adopted by the Trust pursuant to rule 12b-1. Certain Class A shares that are offered without a front-end sales load to certain classes of purchases may be subject to a 1% CDSC if such shares are redeemed within eighteen months of purchase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Class B shares will be offered at net asset value per share without the imposition of a sales load at the time of purchase. Pursuant to a distribution and servicing plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1, the Trust would pay to the Distributor with respect to each Fund a service fee of up to 0.25% per annum and a distribution fee of up to 0.75% per annum of the average daily net asset value of that Fund's Class B shares. In addition, an investor's proceeds from a redemption of Class B shares made within five years of his or her purchase may be subject to a CDSC which is paid to the Distributor. The rate of the CDSC is expected to be approximately 5% on shares redeemed in the first year after purchase, 4% on shares redeemed in the second year, 3% on shares redeemed in the third year, and 2% on shares redeemed in the fourth and fifth years. Class B shares may also be subject to a conversion feature whereby such shares automatically would convert to Class A shares after a specified number of years from the date the Class B shares were purchased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Class A shares are offered at net asset value and will be identical in all respects to the Class B shares except that the Class C shares will be subject to a lower CDSC and will never convert to Class A shares. The Class C shares are designed as a so-called ``level load'' series. The Class C shares will be subject to a 1% CDSC if the shares are redeemed within one year of purchase. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Class C shares described here are currently offered by the Trust as ``Class B'' shares. This existing class of shares converted from a declining CDSC class to a level load class pursuant to no-action relief obtained by the Trust.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Thomson Fund Group (pub. avail. Apr. 29, 1991). Shares purchased before July 1, 1991 are subject to the previous CDSC structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. The Trust may also offer Class Y shares, which will not be subject to any servicing fees under any rule 12b-1 plan, will not be subject to any front-end sales load or CDSC, and may bear lower transfer agency fees and other operating expenses than some other classes. The Class Y may be designated as a class of shares (``Institutional Shares'') which will be offered only to ``Institutional Investors''. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to purchase any class of Institutional Shares, if created. All other investors will be permitted to purchase only non-institutional classes of shares. No Institutional Investor that is eligible to purchase any class of Institutional Shares, if any, will be permitted to invest in any class of non-institutional shares. Accordingly, there will be no overlap between the investors eligible to purchase any class of Institutional Shares and investors eligible to purchase any class of non-institutional shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Institutional Investors'' will include only (a) unaffiliated benefit plans, such as qualified retirement plans, other than individual retirement accounts and self-employed retirement plans, with total assets in excess of $10,000,000 or such other amounts as the Funds may establish and with such other characteristics as the Funds may establish; provided, that any such unaffiliated benefit plans will have a separate trustee who is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets, will have limitations on the ability of plan beneficiaries to access their plan investments without incurring adverse tax consequences, and will not include self-directed plans; (b) tax-exempt retirement plans of the Manager or the Distributor and their affiliates; (c) banks and insurance companies that are not affiliated with the Manager purchasing for their own accounts; (d) investment companies not affiliated with the Manager or the Distributor; and (e) endowment funds or non-profit organizations that are not affiliated with the Manager. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

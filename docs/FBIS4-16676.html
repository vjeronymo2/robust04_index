			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Khachim Karmokov, chairman of the Federal </F> Assembly Comptroller's Office, by Ruslan Lynev; date, place not  given: "Comptroller's Office -- Between the Branches of Power"]    [Text] There are avenues of economic policy which are  fatally unlucky. This has been the case not only with the budget  but with the control of its execution. The former Russian  Supreme Soviet's Control and Budget Committee found itself  sidelined, as it were, before it was able to develop and the new  Federal Assembly Comptroller's Office currently consists only of  the chairman -- the 52-year-old State Duma Deputy Khachim  Karmokov, who had until recently headed the Republic of  Kabardino-Balkaria Supreme Soviet.    [Lynev] So, there is a chairman but no office. Why? And  what form should the office take?    [Karmokov] Under the Constitution (Article 101, Paragraph  5), the Comptroller's Office is the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly organ that monitors the execution of the federal  budget. A draft law on it and its status, functions, powers,  and structure was drawn up by the president's Legislative  Proposals Commission with the participation of the Supreme  Soviet Control and Budget Committee and other organizations.  This bill had its first reading in the State Duma the other  day. And the shape of the office will depend on the type of law  that is passed.    [Lynev] What does the draft law say on this score?    [Karmokov] It raises the question somewhat differently from  the Constitution. First, the office is presented as a statewide  financial control organ that is independent in its activity and  is subordinate only to the law. Second, under the draft, the  office monitors not only execution of the budget but the  activity of nonbudgetary funds and, finally, the utilization of  state property.    [Lynev] That's a tall order, as they say. Doesn't it strike  you that each of the three avenues of monitoring you have  mentioned are important in themselves and have their own  features? For instance, there would seem to be nobody  responsible for the state property that is not currently being  privatized. How is it to be dealt with? Should a special  superministry be set up? Should administrative control be  passed down to the regions, creating something akin to the old  national economic councils? It's an open question. And we can  see that it is linked with two other, quite separate issues --  monitoring of the budget and nonbudgetary funds.    [Karmokov] I agree. These are different, independent areas  of monitoring. I am convinced that they should not be mixed up  -- you can't do everything. (Suffice it to say that the sums  handled by our nonbudgetary funds -- pensions funds and others  -- are of the same order as the revenue side of the federal  budget). But it is far more important that the Comptroller's  Office, under the draft and contrary to the Constitution, will  not be a parliamentary organ but will be positioned somewhere  between the branches of power without being dependent on either  of them.    [Lynev] Is there a bad side to the monitoring organ having  this kind of independence?    [Karmokov] First, as I have just said, it contravenes the  Constitution. Second -- and this is the main point -- it is bad  because parliament is deprived of essentially the only means of  monitoring envisaged by the fundamental law. With the current  noticeable strengthening in the executive, there is a risk that  the office could come under its influence -- as has in practice  happened to the recently independent Central Bank of Russia.  Just imagine -- those executing the budget would be monitoring  it themselves. That is only possible when there is no  separation of powers or when the system of their separation is  incomplete.    [Lynev] As is well known, the Finance Ministry is  responsible for the execution of the federal budget. It  monitors the timeliness and fullness of every item of revenue,  the accuracy of spending on the upkeep of the authorities,  defense, education, and so forth -- down to the very lowest  level. What form should the Comptroller's Office take -- surely  not a new administrative monster duplicating the Finance  Ministry?    [Karmokov] Anything but. I am opposed to increasing the  staffing of the office to that level. But let's take another  look at the Constitution and at real life. The fundamental law  envisages that the chairman of the office is chosen by the Duma,  the deputy (who has not yet been chosen) is selected by the  Federation Council, and the auditors are drawn from each chamber  equally.    [Lynev] How many will there be?    [Karmokov] That too has not yet been decided. But if we  have one for each of the most important avenues of budgetary  control, there will be eight to 12 people.    [Lynev] Will they be deputies?    [Karmokov] They will primarily be qualified specialists.  And if a deputy has the relevant qualifications, then why not?  This will strengthen the office's links with parliament. As  for its size, the office's staff will reach 500-550 people.  These will mainly be comptrollers [kontrolery] and auditors.    [Lynev] Wouldn't you call that overblown?    [Karmokov] The corresponding body in the FRG has 420  employees, while the U.S. equivalent has a staff of 5,248.    [Lynev] And are they paid out of the budget they monitor?    [Karmokov] Yes. But in the United States a single budgetary  dollar invested in monitoring yields $60 in return. In 1989  staffers at the General Accounting Office -- which is what this  service is called in the United States -- saved $23 billion.    [Lynev] How will the office's work be organized? For  instance, the draft budget for this year states that  privatization proceeds will total 147 billion rubles. How will  that be checked?    [Karmokov] First and foremost we must find out just how  realistic this figure is. Of what does it consist? What are  the specific sources? It is not enough to know that the Finance  Ministry, under the budget adopted by the State Duma, has  allocated so much to education or defense, say. It is important  to monitor the figures all the way down to see whether the funds  reach each specific consumer on time or get stuck halfway,  bringing somebody a "windfall." We have to do that for each  item.    [Lynev] Are you not worried about the scale and complexity  of the job?    [Karmokov] It's a difficult area because it requires not  just a certain level of qualifications but also other human  qualities -- a principled approach, firmness, and experience of  organizational work. Nonetheless, I would like to answer your  question optimistically -- we will do our job.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fifth, a pre-chill antimicrobial treatment step would be required. This would help assure lower microbial populations on raw carcasses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional assurance of poultry wholesomeness provided by the proposed regulation would increase consumer confidence in the U.S. poultry supply, with further increases in the domestic and export markets for U.S. poultry a likely result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another benefit of the proposed regulation would be improved safety and health conditions for FSIS inspectors. The new inspection procedures to be implemented by this proposal would result in the elimination of most repetitive inspector hand motions, and this would lead in turn to a dramatic reduction in repetitive motion disorder among FSIS poultry inspectors_including days off from work for medical consultation and treatment. Annual claims reported by FSIS inspectors (both poultry and red meat) to the Office of Workers Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor have amounted to over $500,000 per year for repetitive motion disorder. In addition to such well-publicized conditions as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis, inspector have reported cases of epicondylitis, ganglionic cyst, and other conditions imposing compensation costs of $4,000 to $5,000 per case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposed regulation would establish a single, uniform inspection system for all classes of poultry that are subject to the PPIA. Poultry processors would have added assurance that_no matter what kind of poultry they market_the standards and procedures by which the poultry are inspected are the same, and that all birds are expected to meet uniform requirements. All establishments would be able to maintain, and some establishments would be able to increase, their production rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency would gain short-term flexibility in assigning inspectors from some line positions to existing vacancies in the inspection program, and long-run flexibility to train personnel in a uniform methodology and to assign or reassign them more readily to locations where they are most needed. Implementation of enhanced poultry inspection would benefit the Agency by helping to offset the need for more inspectors to meet industry growth, fulfill HACCP monitoring requirements, and carry out microbiological sampling programs. Finally, consumers would gain the assurance that the same dressing and contamination standards had been applied to all types of federally inspected poultry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests that comments on these and other benefits be submitted to help evaluate the advantages that could be expected from implementation of a final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Costs of Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The major impacts of the proposal on the poultry industry would be the one-time costs associated with installing new facilities and equipment and the on-going costs associated with information collections and the 100-percent reinspection of reprocessed birds. Preliminary estimates of these costs are summarized in Table 4. The Agency requests that comments on the proposal include information on the costs to the extent it is available. These comments would help evaluating the costs in the final rule. As indicated in the section of this preamble concerning the Paperwork Reduction Act, a detailed analysis of the information collection requirements of the proposal is being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

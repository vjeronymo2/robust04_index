			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, March 29 (TANJUG) -- The first draft  resolution on renewing the mandate of the U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR), which expires on March 31, grants only two of the  numerous demands made by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman -- it  renews UNPROFOR's mandate for an additional six months (instead  of the one year recommended by Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali) and extends air support for UNPROFOR to include  the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.).    The first draft, a copy of which was submitted to TANJUG on  Monday, retains the insistence on the sovereignty and  territorial integrity of the breakaway Yugoslav republics of  Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina contained in  Resolution 871 which renewed UNPROFOR's mandate six months ago,  but leaves out the provision which calls for placing under  Croatian authority the disputed 'pink zones' border areas  between the R.S.K and Croatia.    The draft also drops the original insistence on the  integration of the U.N.-protected R.S.K. into Croatia, and  instead calls for a generally acceptable negotiated solution.    The R.S.K. has been proclaimed by the local Serbs in their  ancestral lands within Croatia's communist-era arbitrary borders  in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former  federation and trampling on the local Serbs' rights.    The territory was placed under U.N. protection in the spring  of 1992 in order to end fighting between the Croatian Army and  Krajina Serbs. The step has, however, failed to deter Croatia  from launching four offensives against the R.S.K. since, in an  effort to enforce its rule there.    The draft also drops all reference to a demilitarisation of  the U.N.-protected areas. Butrus-Ghali, reporting to the  Security Council, pointed out difficulties inherent in such a  demilitarisation, in view of Croatia's four offensives against  the territory, and explained that UNPROFOR was unable to protect  the Serb civilians.    The draft resolution retains the controversial provision  that  a full normalisation of relations between the international  community and the parties concerned would depend on their  cooperation in the application of a peace plan and the relevant  Security Council resolutions. This provision has been  interpreted in various ways, with individual Security Council  members insisting it means pegging the Krajina problem to  sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro).    The U.N. Security Council clamped sanctions on Yugoslavia in  late May 1992 for the country's alleged aggression on  neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, where in actual fact civil war  has been raging for the past two years among the local Moslems,  Serbs and Croats.    The draft insists on a need for normalising communications  and reopening the Adriatic oil pipeline, but makes no further  reference to the Zagreb-Split railway or the reopening of the  Zagreb-Belgrade highway, which is at present open only to U.N.  troops.    The first draft ignores Tudjman's demands for placing Udbina  Airport and the Dzeletovci oilfield in eastern slavonija,  R.S.K., under UNPROFOR control, for deploying foreign monitors  along Croatia's 'internationally recognised' borders, and for  posting international border guards along the R.S.K. borders.    Although the haggling that follows is certain to be fierce  before a final text is put to the vote on Thursday, it is  already clear that Tudjman has been given far less than he had  hoped for, at least in the first draw.    The part of the resolution that relates to  Bosnia-Herzegovina  upholds the Bosnia peace process and the efforts to reopen Tuzla  Airport for humanitarian needs.    Bosnian Serbs have agreed to permit the reopening of the  airport in that Moslem-held northeastern Bosnian town, on  condition that Russian observers and Serb control be deployed  there to safeguard against the Moslems using the airport as a  conduit for arms and other military materiel.    The latest draft endorses Butrus-Ghali's recent request for  an additional 8,250 troops, monitors and civilian assistants to  reinforce UNPROFOR, and instructs that the necessary funds  should be mustered for the purpose.</p>

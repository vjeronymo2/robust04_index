			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Lucas wields jobs axe against predators - Bottom Line LUCAS INDUSTRIES, one of the largest UK engineering groups, this week joined the sad roll-call of British companies announcing sweeping redundancies. The Midlands-based manufacturer of automotive and aerospace components has already started a three-year restructuring programme to shed at least 4,000 jobs, half of them in the UK. As a result, the workforce will fall below 50,000, compared with more than 57,000 two years ago. Lucas reported a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 22.5m in the year to July. A controversial Pounds 90m credit from the Lucas pension fund, taken in the first half, was completely offset by a provision for the restructuring costs. Yet the group's news was not entirely gloomy. A strong performance by automotive components in continental Europe helped maintain overall sales and profits, despite the weakness of markets in the UK and US. Lucas and other British manufacturers have risen to the challenge of meeting the demanding standards set by Japanese car makers, and the UK is becoming an increasingly favoured source of components for discriminating buyers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Lucas's biggest headache is aerospace components, which saw operating profits slump from Pounds 65.3m to Pounds 19.1m. The company blamed defence cuts and weak demand in the civil aircraft sector, together with stock writedown provisions. The presentation of the restructuring plan struck the City as a pre-emptive strike against a possible bid. Lucas was certainly careful to accentuate the positive and wants to maintain the full dividend payment of 7p next year, even although it is likely only to break even in the first half. Mustapha Omar, an analyst at Williams de Broe, said: 'Despite the sensible strategy outlined to thwart a hostile approach, the group is still vulnerable, because it was slow to rationalise its businesses during the recession to protect its operating margins, and as a result is inferior to its automotive peers GKN, BBA and T&amp;N' However, Omar points out that Lucas's prudent approach to accounting, - writing off all its R &amp; D spending in the year it is incurred - had depressed its earnings and hence its market rating, thereby increasing the likelihood of a bid. He adds: 'We are not advocating that Lucas should deviate from its former path, but it is interesting to note that if Lucas capitalised 56 per cent of its R &amp; D budget - like its prospective suitor Siebe - it would have reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 77.5m rather than Pounds 22.5m.' Monday's results caused the Lucas share price to close 4p higher at 94p, valuing the company at Pounds 660m. This mainly reflected relief that the company had dipped into its reserves to maintain the dividend payment of Pounds 49m. At the week's close of 99p, the shares were still well below last year's peak of 170p, which gave the group a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.17bn. Lucas hopes to raise Pounds 100m in the next year by selling peripheral concerns, such as its fluid power distribution business. Some analysts are sceptical that the company will be able to achieve the prices it wants on timetable in current market conditions. The chart illustrates the recent volatility of the stock, with Lucas outperforming the market during the post-election recovery and underperforming it during the recent collapse in confidence. The high yield obviously reflects market doubts that the dividend can be maintained next year. Yet a failure to do so could well flush out prospective bidders. Given the shares' recent record, Lucas looks an interesting, if speculative, bet.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 8% rise for man from the Pru Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, gave Mr Mick Newmarch, its chief executive, a 7.9 per cent pay rise to Pounds 586,570 in 1991, an increase said by the company to include a cut in the bonus element of his remuneration, writes Norma Cohen. Mr Newmarch's salary sparked a storm of protest from shareholders last year when his 1990 remuneration rose by 43 per cent while company profits slumped by more than a third. At the time, Prudential defended the rise, saying it included performance-related pay based on the performance in 1989 when profits had risen sharply. In 1991, Prudential's pre-tax profits rose by 9 per cent, while its dividend rose 6.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: US staff biking to work US workers who commute by bicycle are becoming pampered employees at many companies. Nike, the Oregon-based sports shoe manufacturer, gives workers a Dollars 1 credit at the company's cafeteria, fitness centre or store if they pedal to work. At Fleetwood, a maker of motor homes in Southern California, biking employees enjoy mini-garages for storage, a free repair facility, showers and changing rooms, the free loan of a bicycle, and a safety kit. USAA, an insurance group in San Antonio, Texas, encourages workers to form bicycling clubs to articulate needs to management and to help riders devise the best routes to the office. The bike-to-work movement is being pushed along by government initiatives. Next year, Oregon will enforce a law that requires all businesses in the state to provide covered storage spaces for customers and workers. Massachusetts plans to spend Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.6m) over the next few years to adapt roads to bicycle use. Under Clean Air legislation passed during the Bush administration, every state must present a plan to encourage bicycle use by the end of 1995. 'San Antonio has launched a big bicycle-mobility plan because they are on the edge of non-attainment of the Clean Air Act standards,' says Andrew Clarke, deputy director of the Bicycle Federation of America. 'If they do not take the initiative themselves, the federal government will force them to.' Biking is an increasingly popular way to reduce air pollution, say politicians, because it costs relatively little compared with public transport improvements. Refitting roads to accommodate bicycles does raise the ire of many, though. In densely populated cities, it often means eliminating traffic lanes, slowing the flow for drivers. And by providing shelters for bicycles, businesses may have to cut the parking spaces available for cars.</p>

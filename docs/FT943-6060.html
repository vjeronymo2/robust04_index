			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Unease inside Moslem Paris: How immigrants are coping with a clampdown The heavy policing of areas of Paris inhabited by large numbers of Moslem immigrants, following the killing of five French officials in Algiers last month, appears so far to have been well received by French public opinion. The policy, announced by Mr Charles Pasqua, the minister of the interior, won the support of 71 per cent of respondents to one poll taken in mid-August who said they trusted the government to 'avoid the risk of terrorism'. Some 57 per cent agreed that repeated identity-checks by security forces were 'efficient and dissuasive'. Weeks after the killings, with newspapers carrying daily reports of further violence and deaths in Algeria, the police are still out in force in the north-African populated districts of larger towns, although the tension is now easing. However, in such north-African strongholds as Barbes, near Montmartre, shops close earlier and cafes are quieter than usual. Some immigrants have even abandoned their customary Friday prayers at the local mosque for fear of police spot-checks or being caught up in random trouble. Older immigrants, mainly Algerians, fear that the worsening violence in their country could spill over into terrorist acts in France. They remember all too clearly that the Algerian war of independence was fought out in the streets of French cities as well as in north Africa. But they also fear growing racism encouraged by indiscriminate political and media rhetoric. Mr Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Paris mosque, has expressed his concern that the 'fragile consensus' which has grown up in recent years between many immigrants and French society is coming under increasing strain. The greater police activity has yielded what appears to be a very mixed bag of alleged terrorists, reminiscent of a similar crackdown nearly a year ago in response to the kidnapping of three consular officials in Algiers. One of the two dozen Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) sympathisers detained at the Follembray barracks, 100km north-east of Paris, is the activist, Mr Ahmed Simozrag, who acted as lawyer for Mr Abassi Madani, the leader of the FIS who has spent the last three years in an Algerian jail. Others are self-proclaimed imams or run bookshops which stock FIS literature. Some had weapons and considerable sums of money when picked up. Critics of Mr Pasqua's policy argue that he does not differentiate between the FIS, with its armed wing in Algeria, the Islamic Liberation Army (AIS) which has condemned the killing of foreigners, and the hardline Islamic Armed Group (GIA) which claims to be responsible for the deaths of the 59 foreigners killed over the past 12 months. As a result, they feel that the minister is inviting reprisals on French residents in Algeria and tempting the FIS to take its fight onto French territory. Unlike Mr Alain Juppe, the minister of foreign affairs, who has called for a dialogue between all parties to the conflict in Algeria, Mr Pasqua has given his unstinting support to the military-backed regime. Mr Pasqua's involvement with Algerian affairs can be traced back to the days when he founded the Service d'Action Civique (SAC) to fight settlers who, between 1959 and 1962 had regrouped in the Organisation de l'Armee Secrete (OAS) to fight General Charles de Gaulle's policy in Algeria. Mr Pasqua's supporters argue that there is no such thing as a 'moderate' fundamentalist. Ironically, since government-backed attempts in the mid-1980s to integrate immigrant children in the poorer suburbs failed, mayors of cities with large immigrant populations have often turned to imams in the battle against crime and drugs. Young unemployed Beurs, as French-born north Africans are called, found solace in Islam and are proclaiming their Moslem faith in growing numbers. Traders have erected signs which distinguish their outlets from other, 'non-Moslem' shops. A sharp rise in the number of TV satellite dishes in north African suburbs has allowed immigrants increasingly to tune in to non-French television An estimated 3m Moslems live in France today, 500,000 of whom are French citizens and the children of older immigrants. Of this total, 800,000 are Algerian, 500,000 Moroccan and 200,000 Tunisian. It is more a patchwork of groups than a homogeneous community, however, and the French authorities remain extremely nervous at any sign of fundamentalism spreading. But the real fear is based on the eventual outcome of the conflict in Algeria. Should the fundamentalists come to power in Algeria before next year's French election, Algeria and, by extension, the values propagated by radical Islam, would take centre stage in the presidential campaign. That is a prospect relished by few Frenchmen, other than right-wing supporters of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, and even fewer immigrants.</p>

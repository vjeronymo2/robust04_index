			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTER PRAISE  </P> <P> My home was one that survived the Puente Hills fire July 3. I returned home  that evening to find it had been saved from total loss by a fine group of brave  young men from Camp Paige. I watched them and they were determined not to give  up. I still have a home, and I'm filled with gratitude.  </P> <P> I would like all your readers to know that those young men from Camp Paige,  among all the other firemen and firefighters, deserve special recognition and a  "Thank you" bigger than any of us can describe for their extraordinary effort  and determination.  </P> <P> JAMES E.

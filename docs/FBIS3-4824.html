"We can guarantee that the  agreement we have reached with China about Suzhou, and about  projects in Shandong (province), will be honoured. That  includes projects like the revitalising of state-owned  factories," said Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew in an interview  with the Beijing-based correspondent of the German financial and  business daily, Handelsblatt.    A transcript of the interview, conducted on Feb 19 at the  Istana [State Palace] here, was made available to BT [BUSINESS  TIMES] yesterday. Safeguarding the interests of foreign  companies which ride on the Singapore connection is one of the  ways whereby third parties may benefit from the guanxi [personal  connections] which Singapore's business community has built up  in China. "Singapore will provide the means to a relationship,  help in negotiations to reach agreement and to make the  agreement work," he said.    Singapore has a role to play to help foreign companies move  into China, because China needs investors from the whole world,  not just from Hong Kong, Taiwan or the overseas Chinese, said Mr  Lee. Unfamiliarity with Chinese culture and language, coupled  with the lack of legality in China, has made some investors  uncomfortable, which is where Singapore companies with guanxi  come in.    Mr Lee admitted that although Singapore's agreements with  China are on paper, they "are never as clear-cut as we would  have with Western countries". Only the broad outlines are laid  down, while much is unwritten, unspoken and depends on good  faith.    Mr Lee arrived yesterday in Tianjin, only a  one-and-a-half-hour drive from Beijing where he will be signing  an agreement tomorrow for the so-called "software transfer" from  Singapore to China. The government-to-government agreement will  allow Singapore to pass on its experience in running a modern  city through the development of a 70 sq km township in Suzhou,  which is some 90 km from Shanghai.    Mr Lee said one of the changes to the centralised system  which today's China has to make, is to unify its tax system.  This will address the dichotomy which arises from the fact that  while everything is centralised, the provinces collect their own  taxes and therefore begin to act independently. China has to  change its regulations, and which is more difficult, its  mindsets.    Mr Lee said the transformation will take over 20 to 30  years,  and will involve some dislocation. By then, growth rates would  be between six and eight percent, and between 50 percent and 60  percent of Chinese will live in towns. "That's a different  China. The majority of the population will be together, with  quick and easy access to real time information. They will have  to evolve a system to govern this different China," said Mr Lee.</p>

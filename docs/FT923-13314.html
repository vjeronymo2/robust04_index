			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Rafidain Bank wins reprieve AN APPLICATION by the Bank of England to wind up Rafidain Bank, the Iraqi state-owned bank whose UK branch is in provisional liquidation, was delayed for another year in the High Court in London yesterday. Sir Donald Nichols, the vice-chancellor - the senior judge of the Chancery division - ruled that in view of the continued freeze on Iraqi assets since the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the application should be adjourned until the first day of the Trinity legal term in 1993. He also approved a plan for the creation of a nine-person creditors' committee to liaise with the two partners at Price Waterhouse appointed as provisional liquidators last year. The Bank requested that Rafidain be placed in provisional liquidation on February 21 last year. It argued that this would prevent a worldwide scramble for the assets held in the UK branch of the bank. The London branch of Rafidain is the only branch outside the Middle East. Other branches within Iraq and the Middle East continue to trade. The High Court was asked at a previous hearing to consider whether it had the powers to wind-up a foreign, state-owned bank. Representatives of the various interests in the case decided at the time that no further action could be taken until a change in the political circumstances between the UK and Iraq. Sir Donald said yesterday that in the 'very unusual circumstances' surrounding the status of the bank, 'the justification of the last 12 months still holds good'. The court was told that if Rafidain was placed in liquidation now, the dividend to creditors would be less than one half of one pence in the pound. A further deferment would be in the creditors' interest. The creditors' committee will include the Deposit Protection Board, an Iraqi creditor and up to seven other creditors including four of the largest who are willing to serve. Goodman International and Anglo Irish Beef Processors, two Irish beef producers, agreed not to serve on the committee. As joint creditors for more than Pounds 100m, they are taking legal action to recover their assets. Separately, a circular from Price Waterhouse distributed to creditors last month shows that the liquidators had been notified of worldwide assets in Rafidain totalling Pounds 260m, against liabilities of Pounds 4.68bn by the end of April this year. The assets include Pounds 163.7m held in London and Pounds 96.3m overseas about which the liquidators have been notified. Its liabilities in London are Pounds 125.9m and those overseas Pounds 4.5bn.</p>

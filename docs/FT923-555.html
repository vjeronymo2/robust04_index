			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Iliescu set for re-election: Romanian ex-communist ahead of democratic opposition MR ION ILIESCU, the incumbent president of Romania, looked set for re-election last night as exit polls indicated a 48 per cent vote for the former high-ranking communist. Mr Emil Constantinescu, his main rival, who represents Democratic Convention (DC), a loose alliance of 18 anti-communist opposition parties, polled 33 per cent, followed by for Mr Gheorghe Funar, an anti-Hungarian nationalist, with 10 per cent. If the exit polls are confirmed by the final results later this week, Mr Iliescu will face a second-round run-off for the presidency with Mr Constantinescu on October 11. This is according to Romanian electoral rules, which require an absolute majority of the country's 16m eligible voters for victory in the first round. But the biggest uncertainty now hangs over the new parliament, where voters were faced with a choice among 91 political parties. The exit polls showed that the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF), which supports Mr Iliescu, would emerge as the largest single parliamentary party with 27.5 per cent of the poll. But the DC, together with its ally, the ethnic Hungarian party, which won 7 per cent of the vote, would come out as the strongest single political group in both houses of the bicameral parliament with 30 per cent of the vote. The exit poll, organised by Irsop, a Romanian company, in collaboration with Infas of Germany, accurately forecast the results of Romania's first post-communist general elections in May 1990. Mr Iliescu then won 85 per cent of the popular vote in what was essentially a plebiscite celebrating the end of the tyrannical rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed with his wife Elena on Christmas Day 1989. The absence of a clear majority in parliament indicates that a possibly long period of political horse-trading will now be needed before a new government emerges. It will replace the current caretaker government headed by Mr Theodor Stolojan, the non-partisan prime minister who has guided Romania through a difficult year of institutional and market reforms. Mr Stolojan's market-oriented reforms have won the support of the IMF, which plans to send a follow-up team to Bucharest once the new government is formed. The IMF has already agreed a new loan deal but will need to be assured that the new government is capable old fulfilling the terms. The new government will also have to convince the European Community that Romania remains on track for signature of an EC association agreement on similar lines to those already agreed with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.</p>

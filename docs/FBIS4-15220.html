			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian parliament continued debate on the  regional peace agreement signed in Moscow on Monday. Debates on  the same topic the day before had yielded no results.    Opposition members have failed to offer any alternative to  the peace deal, our correspondent reports.    At the same time, one opposition member Boris Kakubava has  made an abortive attempt to bring a motion of no-confidence in  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze.    In an emotional address to the house, head of the interim  committee for the state of emergency Jaba Ioseliani called the  opposition's bluff: "What exactly do you want? If you want  war, you must say so. But if you want peace, this can be  achieved by moving step by step, including agreements similar to  that signed in Moscow."</p>

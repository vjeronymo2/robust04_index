			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Renault to axe 2,100 jobs Renault is to cut 2,109 jobs in 1994, according to a plan presented to unions yesterday, writes John Ridding in Paris. The job cuts, which represent just under 5 per cent of the workforce at the French state-owned car group, reflect attempts to adapt to the depressed state of the European car market and to improve productivity. The company said the cuts would be achieved through voluntary redundancies. Most would come from early retirement for more than 1,100 employees, the non-replacement of departing workers, and an increase in part-time employment. The plan is in line with demands from the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur that publicly-owned groups should avoid compulsory redundancies in their restructuring efforts.</p>

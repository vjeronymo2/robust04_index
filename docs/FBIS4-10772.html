			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Imposed </F> `Options'"]    [Text] With an already definite initial 1 million-copy  edition, the Catholic Church of Brazil intends to publish a  leaflet to teach Brazilians how to vote. This is an old custom;  a lot of religious and non-religious people have done this. But  we must recognize that such an "obligation" has become an  obsession among a group of Brazilian prelates. In every  election, always at the last CNBB [National Conference of  Brazilian Bishops] meeting before an election, some kind of  document defining how Catholics must vote is submitted to the  bishops conference. In the past few years the tone has always  been more or less the same -- at least since the PT [Workers  Party] appeared on the national political scene. This election  year, The Responsible Vote does not conceal its position. The  religious men who sign it define themselves politically.    The document distinguishes three threats to the informed  vote: the resistance to voting, the lack of knowledge of what is  at stake in the elections, and the lack of information about the  elections. The latter subject is blamed by the voting  instructors on the pernicious role played by the media, which  "nearly totally" responds "to the interests of the major  economic groups." Given that Brazilian voters cannot perceive  what is correct without the help of these progressive clergymen,  they have barely three options: the "neoliberal" choice, which  represents the peak of submission of the sinners to Satan --  given that this option meets the "recommendations of the IMF and  the World Bank" -- and preaches a considerable increase in the  role of the market; then comes the "organized capitalism" option  that attempts to "solve the crisis" through the reorganization  of the economy and the state (is this a crime?). This threat is  equally sinful because it seeks to promote a "swift  incorporation of the Brazilian economy into the international  market." And finally, the redeeming proposal, the "people's  democracy proposal," which is the only one that seeks "to resume  development by redistributing wealth and meeting the needs of  the people."    Only one political party fulfills the yearnings of the  national progressive prelates. As Bishop Demetrio Valentino,  coordinator of the CNBB Social Pastoral and one of those  responsible for the document, said: Political action is not "a  mere option, but an obligation" for Christians. He added that  through political action "men and women" transform society.  However, serious problems can result from supporting this party  because the PT does not divide humankind into two genders. Under  the light of the Social Pastoral, can the third gender, which  also is accepted by the PT, transform society?    In this document -- which is plagued with commonplace ideas  (such as "we should not be deceived by speeches" and "several  candidates who make believe they are good and respectful persons  only want to fool the people") -- it is stated that our  participation in the electoral process is not a matter of choice  "but a matter of faith." Could it be that Pope Johan Paul II  lends the word this meaning? Can "faith" depend on party  obligations?</p>

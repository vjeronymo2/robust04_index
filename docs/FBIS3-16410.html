The President Is Tired of Being a  President"]    [Excerpts] Kalmykia President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who has  repeatedly scandalized the Russian public with his  unconventional steps, has once again come to the attention of  politicians and the press. Addressing Kalmykian  parliamentarians, he proposed that they abrogate the republican  constitution and lower Kalmykia's status to that of a kray or an  oblast. Against the backdrop of habitual demands by Federation  components about greater autonomy, the Kalmykian president's  proposal for the voluntary return "under Moscow's heel" sounds  sensational. If it is adopted by the deputies, the Great Steppe  Code, the draft of which the president submitted yesterday to  the parliament for consideration, may become Kalmykia's  fundamental law. [passage omitted]    The Kalmykian president's new political move is apparently  the strongest one in his entire political career -- both  according to the effect it produced and its possible  consequences. At a time when Chechnya is stubbornly chanting  independence mantras, Tatarstan is relishing its special status,  and a number of other Federation components are dreaming of  repeating Kazan's success, many advocates of a "soft" federation  appear to see Ilyumzhinov's initiative as a subversive action by  "Moscow agents." This is how it seems to have been received by  the Federation Council; Mr. Ilyumzhinov says that he has already  had telephone calls from the Council wondering if this step had  been agreed on with Yeltsin. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, however, in a  conversation with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent flatly  denied the suggestion about the alleged preliminary agreement  with the federal authorities. In his view, the republican  status impedes, not facilitates, close cooperation with the  center. Federal ministries are reluctant to embark on joint  projects with republics for fear of unpredictable steps, "even a  cessation."    Observers do not doubt that the parliament will approve the  president's proposal. In this event, the future of Kirsan  Ilyumzhinov himself so far remains uncertain, but it is evident  that upon losing the status of president he may acquire  something more valuable: the laurels of a pioneer paving the  way for Russia's return to a guberniya-based structure,  something for which certain politicians in Moscow have been  calling for a long time.</p>

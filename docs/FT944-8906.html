			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Study calls for exchange to clear OTC contracts - Derivatives A self-regulating exchange should be set up to clear many over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts, recommends the winning entry in this year's Amex Bank essay competition. The authors, Mr David Folkerts-Landau and Mr Alfred Steinherr, say an exchange or clearing house would help reduce credit risk and ensure liquidity in the OTC market, where two-thirds of transactions are conducted. They point to the success of clearing mechanisms at exchanges such as Liffe and the Chicago Board of Trade. The essay, 'The wild beast of derivatives: to be chained up, fenced in or tamed?' is one of two concerning derivatives among the eight prize essays published by Amex*, which announced details of the prize yesterday. Both authors work with supra-national banks: Mr Folkerts-Landau is chief of capital markets and financial studies division at the International Monetary Fund; Mr Steinherr is director of the financial research department at the European Investment Bank. They argue the development of derivatives has been 'one of the most profound structural developments in financial markets since the organisation of limited-liability equity markets early last century'. Advances in data processing and communications technology, combined with developments in statistical and financial techniques, such as options pricing, have made possible the developments of a range of liquid derivatives markets. These have brought a range of long-term economic benefits, such as better pricing of financial risk. However, they also point to shortcomings in the present regulatory, accounting and legal framework 'that was designed for on-balance sheet finance'. Periodic balance sheet examinations - often the focus of the traditional supervisory structure for banks - are ill-suited to deal with the speed with which both on and off balance sheet positions can change. Recent efforts to improve regulation have focused on refining capital requirements, increased disclosure and more effective supervision. This approach - although a step in the right direction - does not come to terms with the basic issue - 'namely that derivative finance . . . has fundamentally changed the relationship between regulators and institutions in favour of the industry,' say the authors. They argue that broader industry should learn from the way that clearing houses act as counterparties to trades in listed contracts, thereby ensuring their financial integrity. On the exchanges, credit risk is managed by marking positions to market and by effecting settlements through the payment of margin and netting arrangements. By contrast, counterparties in OTC deals need not generally finance margin payments, so that banks and other intermediaries selling OTC products can be exposed to credit risk off their balance sheets. At the same time the systems used by banks to measure their credit risks are sometimes opaque and difficult for regulators to police. This lack of transparency raises the spectre of 'precautionary withdrawals of funding from intermediaries that are perceived to be experiencing difficulties,' and the disappearance of liquidity. The development of the derivatives market also means market disturbances can be transmitted quickly to, and magnified in, other markets. The authors argue that a clearing house arrangement for the bulk of OTC transactions - involving probably fewer than 20 contracts - would be feasible. Although OTC products are typically regarded as offering customers greater choice and flexibility - with features such as strike price varying according to particular needs - the authors claim that three-quarters of the OTC market is made up of relatively simple 'plain vanilla' contracts, such as interest rate swaps. They estimate that if two-thirds of OTC transactions were routed through a clearing house, a maximum of Dollars 80bn of margin requirements would need to be financed. 'Most of this credit would end up on the balance sheets of the clearing banks so that off-balance sheet credit positions would become on-balance sheet credits.' Moving derivative trading to an exchange would greatly improve market transparency and solve some financial disclosure issues. Mr Andrew Freeman, whose essay 'The future of finance: capitalism without owners' was awarded joint second prize, argues that 'the coincidence of the globalisation of capital flows and the development of derivative instruments is undermining not only the basis of traditional financing regulation, but also of corporate capitalism.' Mr Freeman, a former Financial Times journalist now with The Economist, predicts that companies will issue new forms of financial securities - so-called 'risk participations' - which will undermine the rationale of the joint-stock company. *Finance and the International Economy: The Amex Bank review: Oxford University Press Pounds 11.95</p>

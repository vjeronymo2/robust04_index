			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CENTER HELPS INDIANS ADJUST TO NEW LIVES IN LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> More than 200 years of painful experiences have engendered a mistrust of  government agencies among American Indians, who have gravitated to Los Angeles  more than any other U.S. urban center.  </P> <P> John Castillo is assistant executive director of the Southern California Indian  Center, a nonprofit organization that serves as a conduit between the nation's  largest urban Indian population and government social agencies.  </P> <P> "Indians won't go to government offices, but they'll come to us," said  Castillo, whose organization is staffed primarily by Indians.  </P> <P> With a budget of more than $3 million, provided mainly by federal, state and  local government grants, the organization's 40-member staff provides  educational counseling, job training and housing assistance to about 10,000  American Indians and ethnic Alaskans and Hawaiians each year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Much Poverty and Unemployment  </P> <P> According to the 1980 U.S. Census, about 100,000 American Indians live in Los  Angeles and Orange counties. The Los Angeles County Community Development  Department estimates that 75% of the Indian population is below the poverty  level. More than 40% are unemployed.  </P> <P> Castillo said more than 300 tribes are represented in the area and predicted  that the 1990 census will show that the overall population has grown  substantially as more young Indians have moved from rural areas and  reservations.  </P> <P> For the most part, this group is not emotionally or economically prepared for  the rigorous competition of urban residency, organization officials said.  </P> <P> To meet the growing need, the SCIC, which Castillo said was founded in 1968 "by  a group of people who used a garage for meetings," opened its fifth regional  office last month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help in Mastering Skills  </P> <P> The North Hollywood office is designed to meet the needs of the 10,000-plus  American Indians in the San Fernando Valley. The organization's other offices  are in Carson, Commerce, Garden Grove and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Our primary responsibility is to assist the unemployed and underemployed,"  Castillo said.  </P> <P> "If they have marketable skills, we develop them. If they don't, we provide  referrals for classroom training or work experience."  </P> <P> The center also provides a variety of programs for senior citizens, including  counseling, transportation and arts and crafts activities. Emergency housing  and food are also made available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Much Food Disbursed  </P> <P> "We give out about 5,000 tons of food a month, and about 600 food baskets  during Christmas season," Castillo said.  </P> <P> The average age of American Indians is less than 18, Castillo said. The goal of  his organization, he said, is to "foster an atmosphere in which we can help  American Indians work toward economic and social self-sufficiency."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS PANEL VOTES FOR REVIEW OF CHARGES AGAINST 5 SENATORS;  </P> <P> LINCOLN S&amp;L: CRANSTON IS AMONG THOSE ACCUSED OF IMPROPERLY INTERVENING WITH  FEDERAL REGULATORS. AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL IS HIRED TO STUDY ALLEGATIONS.  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee voted unanimously Friday to have an outside counsel  review influence-peddling allegations against Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and  four other senators in connection with the $2-billion failure of Lincoln  Savings and Loan of Irvine.  </P> <P> The committee voted also to have the special counsel investigate similar  complaints against Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) resulting from scandal at  the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  </P> <P> Robert S. Bennett, a Washington attorney who has specialized in white-collar  crime, was hired to help the committee determine whether it should proceed with  a preliminary inquiry, the first of three stages of investigation the panel  could pursue.  </P> <P> Cranston and Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), John  Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) are accused of improperly  intervening with federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln after receiving  political contributions from its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> D'Amato is accused of using improper influence in federal housing programs on  behalf of political contributors and friends.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a member of the House Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee  said that the panel has been informed that Keating plans to invoke the 5th  Amendment right against self-incrimination when he is called to testify Tuesday  about Lincoln's collapse and his dealings with the five senators.  </P> <P> Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) said that fellow members of the committee had  been told of Keating's intentions, but a spokesman for the Arizona businessman  said he did not believe a final decision had been made.  </P> <P> Bradley J. Boland, a spokesman for Lincoln's parent company, American  Continental Corp., said that Keating had been urged by a number of advisers to  decline to testify. He said that American Continental executives believe that  the House hearing does not provide a fair forum.  </P> <P> Keating, under FBI investigation on fraud and other allegations, has said in  court documents that he expects to be indicted for his role in the Lincoln  case.  </P> <P> Cranston said that he did not think the Ethics Committee needed to hire an  outside counsel because "as numerous legal precedents have shown, I did not  violate any laws, ethical standards or rules of the Senate."  </P> <P> But he said that the appointment of Bennett, brother of William J. Bennett, the  top official in the Administration's war on drugs, "will further promote  confidence in the Senate's process for reviewing the conduct of its members."  </P> <P> Cranston and his colleagues have been accused by Common Cause, a political  action lobby, of improperly helping Keating with federal regulators in 1987.  Keating and his associates had contributed about $1.3 million to campaigns and  other causes supported by the senators.  </P> <P> McCain said in a statement: "I am confident that an investigation will  vindicate my repeated statements that I never abused my office nor took actions  that were improper."  </P> <P> DeConcini said: "I welcome anything that will establish the facts and I will  cooperate fully."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was learned that DeConcini not only discussed Lincoln with  federal regulators, he also telephoned the boss of California's top savings and  loan regulator on behalf of Keating in April, 1988.  </P> <P> At the time, Keating was trying to sell the Irvine firm before federal agents  could seize it. William J. Crawford, California's savings and loan  commissioner, had rejected the proposed deal, and Keating was seeking federal  approval instead.  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, Crawford said that DeConcini sought assurances from his  boss, John K. Geoghegan, that Crawford would keep his objections to the sale  quiet.  </P> <P> Crawford said that Geoghegan, a member of Gov. George Deukmejian's cabinet, did  not try to silence him and that he continued to oppose the transaction. The  deal was rejected by federal regulators, too, and Lincoln was seized by the  government last April 14.  </P> <P> It will cost the federal government an estimated $2 billion to bail out  Lincoln, making it the most expensive thrift failure ever.  </P> <P> Staff writers Douglas Frantz in Washington, James Bates in Los Angeles and  James S. Granelli in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

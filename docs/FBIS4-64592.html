			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gonzalez Will Deliver Solchaga's and </F> Corcuera's Heads to Pujol as Guarantee"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez is willing to deliver  the heads demanded by his partner, Jordi Pujol. Carlos  Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Jose Barrionuevo -- implicated  in the Mariano Rubio and Luis Roldan cases -- will relinquish  their parliamentary responsibilities before the 12 June  elections, according to Socialist sources. CiU [Convergence and  Union], which has demanded that he "take the bull by the horns,"  yesterday forced him to appear before a plenary session of the  Congress of Deputies next Wednesday [11 May].    CiU, within which Jordi Pujol and Jose Antonio Duran Lleida  seem to have again shared between them the roles of conciliator  and hard- liner -- though their basic stance is similar -- and  the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party], to which the Socialists and  the Catalan nationalists are again paying attention in order not  to appear isolated, have decided to grant Felipe Gonzalez  temporary support conditional on the implementation of a  strategy that was largely formulated jointly.    During the 2 May holiday Felipe Gonzalez, helped by Narcis  Serra, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, and Javier Solana, obtained an  extension of support to deal with the harassment by the PP  [People's Party] and the IU [United Left], granted to him by the  CiU and PNV. Furthermore, Gonzalez presented his strategy for  resolving the crisis to the narrow circle of his closest aides.    According to Socialist sources, this strategy includes  Carlos  Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman and Jose Luis  Corcuera's and Jose Barrionuevo's resignation of their  parliamentary seats, as demanded by CiU, even though the  government says that "there is no pressure" from Jordi Pujol.    Gonzalez wants to play these cards very cautiously and  gradually, realizing that he must not leave himself without  "trumps" in the event of a process whose duration cannot be  estimated. However, the deadline for playing these cards has  been set -- a month at the most, that is, by the European and  Andalusian elections on 12 June.    According to opposition sources, Minister of the Prime  Minister's Office Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba has in practice taken  over Solchaga's responsibilities. Indeed, it was Rubalcaba who  spoke with CiU spokesman Miguel Roca and PNV spokesman Inaki  Anasagasti in order to secure those groups' support for the  government's refusal to accept the PP's demand for Gonzalez to  make a special appearance before the Congress of Deputies.

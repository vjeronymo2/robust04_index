			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews by Max jacobson.  Prices are based on average cost for a party of two without wine.  </P> <P> $--less than $15  </P> <P> $$--$15 to $39  </P> <P> $$$--$40 to $75  </P> <P> $$$$--More than $75  </P> <P> </P> <P> AMERICAN  </P> <P> * Crocodile Cafe, Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-2233.  Open Mondays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; weekends to 11 p.m.  $$  </P> <P>  Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's  making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe.  Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired  pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettuccine with  roasted Pasilla chili. Sip wines while sitting under the 30-foot vinyl  crocodile. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant is a good value.  </P> <P> * Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant, Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd.,  Buena Park. (714) 220-5080. Open daily, except Christmas, 7 a.m to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P>  * Disneyland, 1313 N. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 999-4565. Hours vary. $$  </P> <P>  Between them, Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland feed more mouths than any  local restaurant ever could hope to, yet their food concessions get  surprisingly little notice. With regard to Disneyland, it's not surprising: You  are a captive audience there and the food is mediocre at best. Mrs. Knott's  Chicken Dinner Restaurant fares much better. You don't even have to enter the  park to eat there. For $7.95, hungry families can get individual dinners  consisting of a rhubarb appetizer, a mixed green salad, fried chicken, mashed  potatoes and country gravy, fresh cabbage seasoned with ham, buttermilk  biscuits and a choice of pie. Take that, Mickey!  </P> <P> * The Original Pancake House, 1418 E. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim. (714) 693-1390.  Open Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. $  </P> <P> The Original Pancake House is one of the very best restaurants in Orange  County. Just ask anyone who has eaten there. All the batters are made with  sourdough yeast and come straight from the grill -- light, finely textured, and  complex. The Belgian waffles are eggy and crispy, and the apple pancake, a  giant golden puff with a cinnamon glaze topping, is one step away from nirvana.  </P> <P> * Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9319. Open Mondays through  Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular during  the '50s, and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes in  credible versions of plain old American food -- prime rib, pan-fried chicken,  turkey with all the trimmings -- all churned out with dependable regularity.  The menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice  of Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the  tapioca pudding you get for free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHINESE  </P> <P> * Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., No. 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends from 9 a.m. $$  </P> <P> A vast Hong Kong-style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is  beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the  capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both  food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black pepper beef brisket from the  Page 1 specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first rate kung pao  dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy sauce squab. On a menu with 150  entrees, there is much to choose from.  </P> <P> * Shan-Li Palace, 5634 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. (714) 779-1410. Open Mondays  through Thursdays and Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays  to 10:30 p.m. $  </P> <P> This Mandarin-style Chinese restaurant is further proof that gentrification is  spreading like a brush fire. It is nestled snugly in the Anaheim Hills not far  from the Riverside County line. A few years back, you couldn't have found a  hamburger stand in these parts. Order the steamed dumplings, despite the fact  that the waiter may try to discourage you. They are wonderful. Spinach bean  curd soup tastes as fresh as if the spinach came from out back. Twice-cooked  pork is fiery and colorful. Moo-shu dishes (minced meats and veggies rolled up  burrito-style) are terrific.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONTINENTAL  </P> <P> * The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open  Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through  Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies  rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer  pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is  like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of  avocado, immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled  marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on  the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines  and bistro-like desserts. The ambiance is relaxed and casual.  </P> <P> * Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim.  (714) 750-4321. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays  through Saturdays from 6 to 10:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there  can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is  predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu  features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad,  and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the  mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is  extensive and intelligent.  </P> <P> * Morell's, in the Irvine Hilton, 17900 Jamboree Road, Irvine. (714) 863-3111.  Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily except Sundays  from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Morell's is one hotel restaurant making an obvious effort to keep up with the  times, but one still comes away with the impression that institutional  practices die hard. It's a quietly elegant room done up in various shades of  pink, and there is a formal quality to the service. Appetizers such as  sweetbreads and smoked salmon are among the strong suits. Desserts are visual  stunners. The basically sound main dishes suffer occasionally from a desire to  impress.  </P> <P> * Sorrento Grill, 370 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-8686. Open  Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 and from 5:30 p.m. to 9.30  p.m.; Sundays from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Sorrento Grill is one of the best new restaurants around, a virtual lock for  local stardom. The restaurant is a high-concept operation and it pushes all the  right buttons: a stunningly designed open kitchen, postmodern vastness and a  decibel level even Phillip Glass would object to. The food is wonderful. Young,  innovative chef Roseanne Ruiz uses the finest ingredients, Chino ranch  vegetables, carefully selected poultry and fish, and she prepares them with the  finest olive oil and utmost care. Desserts like an amazing creme brulee are  brutally rich. Expect lines and unbridled enthusiasm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FRENCH  </P> <P> * The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755.  Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through  Thursdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10. $$  </P> <P> * La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through  Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m.  $$$  </P> <P> Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants  advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge  more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and  salad included in the prices of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything  without sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more  accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade  chicken liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here, too.  </P> <P> * La Vie en Rose, 240 S. State College Blvd., Brea. (714) 529-8333. Open  Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 6 to 10 p.m.  $$$  </P> <P> La Vie en Rose is supposed to be fashioned after a Normandy farmhouse, but the  building is a masterpiece in kitsch; it looks like a swap meet replica of the  Mont-St-Michel abbey. Luckily, the food is good. Spinach salad sizzles with  natural flavor. Salad perigourdine (a simple dish of mixed greens with slices  of preserved duck and a heady garlic dressing), makes a terrific lunch. Fish is  prepared with delicacy. The veal chop is wonderful. Service is flawless and  attentive. The only major drawback is the noise level, which befits, well, a  swap meet. Moderately expensive.  </P> <P> * Voila Bistro and Grill, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 841-1166.  Open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 9 p.m.  $$$  </P> <P> A new local dining spot, Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising find indeed, a  combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic. Chef Rochelle Robinson  turns a brilliant onion soup -- a bistro classic -- and does fine braised duck  and lamb dishes. Dessert souffles such as chocolate and lemon are on the varied  menu, and given proper notice the chef will even make a cheese souffle. Salads,  pizzas and a respectable little wine list fill things out nicely.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INDIAN  </P> <P> * The Clay Oven, 15435 Jeffrey Road, Irvine. (714) 552-2851. Open Tuesdays  through Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> The Clay Oven is an Indian restaurant inauspiciously located in a country  shopping mall and specializing in dishes from the tandoor, the authentic oven  advertised by the restaurant's name. Fish tikka, here made with chunks of  broiled swordfish, is downright heavenly, and tandoori chicken, rubbed red with  a spice mixture and broiled until sizzling, is another winner. There is an  interesting selection of vegetable dishes, as well. Wash everything down with  giant bottles of imported Indian beer and lament the fact that most of the  really exotic specialties you see displayed on the menu won't be available.  </P> <P> </P> <P> INDONESIAN  </P> <P>  * Dewi, 1762 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (714) 637-1101. Open Tuesdays through  Saturdays from 11 a.m to 8 p.m. $  </P> <P> Hurry over -- while there is still time -- to Dewi, a small Indonesian  restaurant/grocery store hidden among commercial properties along a busy avenue  in Orange. Nasi rames is a mixed rice plate with a whole cookbook full of  Indonesian goodies, and the restaurant has fabulous barbecued chicken and hot  stewed beef dishes. Owner Edith Vredevoogd is constantly preparing little  snacks like lemper (a sticky rice roll filled with minced chicken) or cendol  (mysterious green bits taken with crushed ice, syrup and jackfruit). Don't  despair if you miss the restaurant, though. There is a second Dewi run by Mrs.  V's brother in Huntington Beach. Exotica at its best.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ITALIAN  </P> <P> * Capriccio Italiano Ristorante, Village Mall, 25380 Marguerite Parkway,  Mission Viejo. (714) 855-6866. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to  2:30 p.m. and from 4 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 4 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Capriccio may mean "whim" in Italian, but there is nothing whimsical about the  food in this restaurant; it is polished and sophisticated. For my money, it is  a real find. The kitchen is run by two brothers from Palermo, Sal and Franco  Maniaci, but there is barely a trace of Sicilian influence in the dishes they  serve. Appetizers like vitello tonnato and lumache del bosco are marvelous, and  pastas are fresh and homemade. Many main dishes have French overtones, like a  stylish lamb rack with truffles and foie gras, or a civet of hare called lepre  salmi. Cappriccio's location is modest, and so are prices, but its class is  obvious.  </P> <P> * Ciao, 1730 E. 17th St., Santa Ana. (714) 972-3101. Open Mondays through  Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m.; Saturdays from  4:30 to 9:30 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Ciao is one of those indistinct little neighborhood restaurants you can drive  by 100 times without noticing, but it happens to be an exceptional one. Bina  Crivello, a Sicilian mater familias who runs the restaurant with the help of  her five sons, makes most of the food herself: crusty pizzas, earthy pastas,  and a good rich tomato sauce to go with them. Bring a hefty appetite and leave  room for the excellent tiramisu -- intense, mocha rich, and drooling mascarpone  cheese.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JAPANESE  </P> <P> * Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 6 to 10:30; Saturdays from 5 to  11 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an  exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into  a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of  Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful  $14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per  person, is unforgettable.  </P> <P> * Umi, 2075 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 631-2208. Open Tuesdays through  Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10 p.m.; Fridays and  Saturdays to 11 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Umi is a modern and imaginative but often unprofessional sushi bar with  high-tech pretensions, and knowing what to order is important. You are safe if  you stick with the sushi, which is fresh and crafted with an excellently  prepared rice, but it is easy to run aground on the many hot dishes. Among the  best are a wonderful scallop casserole, a toothsome Japanese steak, and  yaki-onigiri (grilled triangles of sushi rice with various fillings). Service  can be painfully slow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEBANESE  </P> <P> * Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open  Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5:30 to 11; Sundays  from 5:30 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish,  French and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic.  Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid  array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and  warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting  main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort  of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MEXICAN  </P> <P> * Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to  midnight. $$  </P> <P> Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new  restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest  adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red '80s-chic motif  complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen and a comal (a high-tech  version of a stone tortilla cooker). The restaurant smokes its own meats, and  you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila.  Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful.  </P> <P> * Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5546. Open nightly from  5:30 to 10 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Kachina is new, but it already may be the county's best restaurant. Named for  Hopi Indian dolls that represent spirits, the restaurant serves food that is  rare and exotic -- edible art. David Wilhelm, late of Pave and the El Torito  Grill, has composed a menu featuring some of the most imaginative, intelligent  cooking this side of the Twilight Zone, full of sumptuous tastes and  color-splashed textures. Run, don't walk, to taste the green corn tamale,  honey-glazed pork and celestial chocolate bread pudding. And go early.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SEAFOOD  </P> <P> * Los Alamitos Fish Company, 11061 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos. (213)  594-4553. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and  Saturdays to 11 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> Order mesquite broiled fish from the restaurant's giant circular grill, or  enjoy a brace of other dishes such as steamed Dungeness crab, smoked albacore  tuna or simply flavored steamers, all of which go beautifully with the  restaurant's standout sourdough bread. Desserts are all homemade. The best of  them are a superior blackout cake and a soft, tart lemon mousse pie.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THAI  </P> <P> * Mongkut Thai, 212 Avenida del Mar, San Clemente. (714) 492-3871. 31976 Coast  Highway, South Laguna. (714) 499-2100. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 11  a.m. to 3 p.m.; nightly 5 to 10 p.m. $  </P> <P> Besides being one of the current nicknames for Thailand, "Land of Smiles" could  also describe the type of service you can expect at the often exotic,  occasionally bland Mongkut Thai restaurants. Here, smiles often substitute for  intelligible English. Dishes get flowery names such as Glittering Coastal Onyx  (sauced calamari) or Garnet Ocean Field (crab fried rice) on one of the most  unusually written menus anywhere. And they can be blisteringly hot. The  mussuman (beef) curry and the oily, flavorless chicken curry tend to  disappoint, but most of the fare is exuberant and flavorful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THEME DINNERS  </P> <P> * 1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings Fridays at  7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 7:30 p.m. $$$  </P> <P> The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares. When you eat  with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this  re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup,  drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a  choice of four entrees: slow-cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak  kabob and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top.  The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake and  the bottomless mugs of ice cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself  would have enjoyed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VIETNAMESE  </P> <P> * Places Afar, 25932 Muirlands Blvd., Mission Viejo. (714) 581-4200. Open  Mondays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays  from 5 to 9; Fridays and Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> * Calesa, 2106 N. Tustin Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 541-6585. Open daily except  Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 to 10 p.m. $$  </P> <P> Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is  circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes  alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup.  Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics  as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining"  -- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental  specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and  cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos  flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust.  </P></p>

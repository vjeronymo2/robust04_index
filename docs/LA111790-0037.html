			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAL FOR STRAWBERRY SEEMS TO MAKE FANS OF BOTH SIDES HAPPY  </P> <P> Being a big fan of the Mets, I am now relieved that the departure of Darryl  Strawberry has been finalized. The Dodgers just may see that not working with  their farm system and just living off players from other teams could hurt them.  </P> <P> Who needs Strawberry with that New York pitching staff? Go Mets!  </P> <P> LOUIS MARTINEZ  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

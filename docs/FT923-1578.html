			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc remains under pressure THE Bank of France inter-vened to support the franc on the foreign exchanges for the third trading day running yesterday, but the currency remained under pressure in Europe's exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. France's decision to vote Yes to European monetary union, even though it was by the slimmest of majorities, probably saved the ERM from an instant realignment. The strains in the system have not disappeared, however, and the French franc was one of a number of currencies which the market tested yesterday, in spite of a big rally in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. The franc was supported by heavy intervention from the Bank of France, when the currency was a centime above its ERM floor. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said the franc was a healthy and stable currency, in contrast to the ambiguous comments he reputedly made about sterling last week. The fundamental strength of the French economy, including its strong trade balance, also makes the currency more resistant to pressure. However, analysts believe that, in the current climate, the franc's future remains uncertain. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp in London, said there is still a 25 per cent chance that the pressure on the franc could turn into a full-blown crisis. Mr Mike Gallagher, director of economic research at the IDEA group, said pressures are likely to intensify until German interest rates are cut. Last night the franc closed at FFr3.4150 to the D-Mark, 1 1/2 centimes above its ERM floor against the German unit. Even if the franc holds in the ERM, several other European currencies are under pressure. According to Mr O'Neill, the next most vulnerable is the Irish punt, which closed in London at DM2.6210, just  1/2 pfennig above its ERM floor. More worrying for the Irish authorities is the punt's higher rate against the devalued British pound. Analysts said the Irish authorities are unhappy to allow it to rise above IPounds 1.05 to the UK currency, because more than 40 per cent of Irish trade is with the UK. Last night the punt had strengthened to IPounds 1.03. Both sterling and the Italian lira were victims of heavy selling following the uncertain French referendum result, and the Bank of Italy confirmed that it would not re-enter the ERM as originally planned. Sterling ended in London 7 1/2 pfennigs down from Friday's close at DM2.5375, an historic low against the D-Mark and an effective 14 per cent devaluation from the old ERM central rate. According to the IDEA research group, the pound could go as low as DM2.33 before the end of the year. The Italian lira finished at L845.2 per D-Mark, after a previous close of L836.1.</p>

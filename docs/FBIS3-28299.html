			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February  close at hand, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's setback on the  issue of the tax cut and the accompanying tax hike at the last  minute has brought about a crisis of confidence in his  "management ability" of the Japan-U.S. relations. This may  dampen considerably the Clinton administration's expectations on  the prime minister's leadership to reduce the trade surplus and  open the Japanese market, which are significantly higher than  its expectations on the previous Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  administration.    If Hosokawa visits the United States without bringing about  a  substantial breakthrough in the new economic consultations, the  U.S. Government may reconsider its support of the prime  minister's reform line. The United States is expected to stand  firm on its position that "if there would not be any substantial  agreement, it will be better not to have any agreement at all,"  (according to Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen) If  conflicts in Japan-U.S. relations flare up, the prime minister's  political responsibility may be questioned.    The U.S. Government, which is irritated with the impasse in  the new economic consultations, is plagued by a sense of  distrust of the Japanese bureaucrats who stubbornly refuse to  accede to the U.S. demand on "numerical targets," while it also  harbors over- expectations on the ability of the prime minister,  who upholds the slogan of "changing status quo politics." Since  late 1993, U.S. Government officials have been trying to set the  stage for bilateral negotiations by criticizing the bureaucrats,  while expressing support for the prime minister. This is part  of the strategy to set aside the prime minister as a so-called  "good guy" to draw a favorable final "decision" from him.    However, the attitude taken by the prime minister in the  process of formulating and eventually rescinding the "national  welfare tax" scheme completely runs counter to U.S.  expectations. At first, the prime minister had sided with the  Ministry of Finance, which attaches more importance to a sound  fiscal policy than to economic stimulation to please the United  States, by proposing to implement a tax cut "two years" ahead of  a tax hike. However, dissenting views came from the ruling  parties, saying "With that, you cannot negotiate with President  Clinton." Thus, the prime minister ultimately settled on "a tax  hike three years later." However, this was sufficient to  illustrate the prime minister's subservience to the bureaucracy.    On top of this, he had to rescind his own proposal. This  seems to have also shocked the United States. After his second  round of talks with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on the morning  of 4 February, when U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was  asked to comment on the volatile Japanese political situation  during a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Minato Ward,  Tokyo, he replied, "We do not interfere in internal affairs.  The situation is still volatile." However, he did not also  pass over the chance to remind his audience that "the United  States hopes for the implementation of strong, consistent  economic stimulation measures."    Some government officials are even concerned now that the  "nostalgia for the past LDP regimes' ability for internal  coordination," which so far remains half-forgotten, may revive  in the United States.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO CUT MILITARY BUDGET BY 8% IN 1990  </P> <P> The Soviet Union said today it will slash military spending by more than 8%  next year and gave the most detailed breakdown to date of its armed forces.  </P> <P> Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov said at a news conference that the 8.2% cut, to $115  billion, is part of a program of shifting the Soviet armed forces from an  offensive to a more defensive role.  </P> <P> The number of men in the armed force as of Jan. 1 will be 3,993,000, he said,  without specifying what category of personnel the figure included.  </P> <P> "The new political thinking in defense doctrines allowed the military to reduce  the budget in practical terms," said Chervov, head of a general staff  department.  </P> <P> It was the first time the complete armed forces budget had been given to  foreign journalists before publication in the official Soviet press.  </P> <P> Military spending this year amounted to $129 billion, according to the first  fully disclosed figures for defense expenditure, released in June.  </P> <P> The Soviet armed forces as of Jan. 1 will be equipped with 4,045 missile  launchers of all kinds, 10,000 missile warheads, 63,900 tanks, 8,207 combat  aircraft and 157 major surface ships, according to the breakdown.  </P> <P> Chervov said that offensive weapons are being reduced, that operational  training is being revised and that most major military maneuvers have been cut.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already begun cutting the country's  armed forces in an attempt to lessen international tension and free much-needed  funds to help modernize the outdated Soviet economy.  </P> <P> "We were guided by (Gorbachev's policy of openness). The cuts are one way of  building confidence," Chervov said.  </P> <P> A year ago Gorbachev told the United Nations that 500,000 troops would be cut  from the Soviet armed forces. Chervov said 256,000 of the half million men have  already gone.  </P></p>

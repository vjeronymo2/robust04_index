			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard reviewed spill data from tank vessels for the years 1989, 1990, and 1991 and found that tank overflow spills occurred infrequently aboard vessels with cargo carrying capacities of less than 1,000 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (approximately 6,290 barrels). Specifically, a total of 279 cargo tank overflow spills were recorded during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3-year period. Of those overfill spills, 215 cargo tank overflow incidents occurred from tank barges. Only four of the 215 overflows were from barges with a cargo capacity of less than 1,000 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , resulting in 0.6 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (159 gallons) oil spilled. During the same period, 64 similar incidents occurred aboard tankships. Of these incidents, only two occurred from tankships with a cargo capacity of less than 1,000 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , resulting in 0.4 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (106 gals) oil spilled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this comment and its review of available data, the Coast Guard has raised the applicability threshold in &sect;155.480(a) to a cargo capacity of 1,000 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Coast Guard requests comments concerning this change. The data on which the Coast Guard made its decision is available in the docket for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment specified that the phase-in requirements proposed in 33 CFR 155.480(c) did not cover Canadian tank barges because they are not subject to the requirements of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Load Line Conventions. The Coast Guard did not intend for Canadian barges which operate in U.S. waters to be treated differently from U.S. flag barges under the regulations. The Coast Guard expects that overfill devices will be installed on such Canadian tank barges at their next scheduled drydocking or internal tank examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment recommended that tank vessels required to be equipped with double hulls within the next 5 years under the double hull requirements of OPA 90 should be excluded from the overfill device requirements. The comment contends that many of these vessels will be phased out of service in 5 years and that the costs of upgrading overfill devices on these vessels would not be recovered within 5 years. The Coast Guard agrees and has added &sect;155.480(e) to reflect the exemption of vessels that under 46 U.S.C. 3703a(c) can not operate on the navigable waters or Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States after the year 2000, unless equipped with a double hull. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment requested that the regulations not apply to open-hopper barges which are limited to carrying non-hazardous oil-field waste material. Because such cargo operations are not covered by 33 CFR parts 155 and 156, the requirements for overfill devices do not apply to these barges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment at the public meeting requested that the regulations not apply to tank vessels which carry only asphalt. Participants at the public meeting noted that because of the density of asphalt, vessels carrying this product are usually not fully loaded. Also, the participants reported no overfill spills from asphalt carriers. Currently, technology is not available to provide a cost-effective means of overfill detection for asphalt carriers. Therefore, the Coast Guard has decided to exempt tank vessels that are dedicated to carrying asphalt as cargo from the overfill device requirements. This change is reflected in &sect;155.480(f). The Coast Guard requests comments concerning the exemption of tank vessels carrying asphalt from this interim rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked the Coast Guard to require overfill devices to be activated during all types of cargo transfers, including internal transfers from tank to tank and cargo discharges. Although overfill incidents do occur during internal cargo transfers and discharges, these incidents are infrequent and do not result in large spills into the water. Tank vessel owners and operators are encouraged to use overfill devices for all transfer operations, but the regulations continue to apply only during loading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments asked that the regulations not apply to deck tanks used to store barge generator and pump fuel, or oil slops. The regulations only require installation of overfill devices on cargo tanks. Deck tanks used for slops and barge generator and pump fuel are not covered by the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven comments stated that high viscosity oils prevent overfill devices from functioning properly. The Coast Guard finds that heavy oils are just as likely to overflow from cargo tanks as lower viscosity oils. Vessel owners and operators must choose overfill devices best suited for the oil they carry and, in accordance with 33 CFR 155.750(e)(2), 46 CFR 39.20&hyph;7(b)(3), and 46 CFR 39.20&hyph;9(b)(3), they must test their equipment prior to each cargo loading. If a method of overfill detection is not technologically available for a particular type of high temperature service oil, such as Number 6 oil, the owner or operator of a vessel, on a case by case basis, may request an alternative means of compliance in accordance with 33 CFR 155.120(c) of this regulation. The Coast Guard requests comments concerning the application of alternative means of compliance with the interim regulations for vessels carrying high temperature service oils. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Somali gunmen hold aid agencies to ransom as thousands starve to death - Protection rackets that are immobilising UN relief efforts SADDYR OMAR sits behind his chicken-wire grill in war-blasted Mogadishu's bustling gun-bazaar chewing qat, Somalia's war-drug. In one hand he holds stems of the leafy narcotic stimulant and in the other he plays with a Chinese-made grenade. To a group of gunmen gathered around his stall, Saddyr is boasting that he can get FN rifles used by the 500 United Nations Pakistani troops who have been sitting idle in their camp in Mogadishu for the past six weeks. 'And for another 200,000 shillings I get you a Pakistani - dead or alive,' he jokes to the crowd's stoned amusement. Contempt by Somalia's brutal bandits and gunmen for the UN operation in Somalia (Unosom) threatens Africa's largest relief effort, which is increasingly paralysed and falling victim to an obscene protection racket. Blackmail, threats and extortion made by Mafia-style warlords have defeated intensive efforts to help Somalia's civilians dying from malnutrition. Eight months after the UN started a serious relief effort the balance sheet of achievement is poor. Death rates from starvation remain extremely high, looting and banditry continue and little progress has been made by the UN towards political reconciliation of the warring factions. A handful of power-hungry, greedy warlords, led by Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, continue to hold the international aid community to ransom in their effort to save Somali lives. The UN estimates 250,000 more people could die before the end of the year. 'The warlords don't give a damn about their people,' said one aid boss who feared to be identified. 'They see us as weak and just keep vetoing our efforts and grabbing loot. If it wasn't for them we could sort out the humanitarian situation in Somalia in two months.' The central problem facing the relief effort remains lack of security - the inability of agencies to deliver food to those most in need in the face of banditry, looting, violence and inter-clan rivalry for UN resources. The 500 Pakistani troops in Mogadishu, whose mission was to help increase security, particularly at the port and international airport, remain holed up in the bombed-out buildings of the former naval headquarters in the sand dunes north of the airport. 'The more they do nothing, the more the Somali gunmen think they will do nothing and treat the UN with derision,' said one aid worker. Conditions have deteriorated significantly since the forced resignation last month of Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN special envoy for Somalia, who was widely credited for what little progress the UN had achieved. Mr Sahnoun was obliged to resign following his outspoken criticism of the record in Somalia of UN agencies such as the World Food Programme, United Nations Development Programme and Food and Agriculture Organisation. Mr Sahnoun's resignation has left Unosom rudderless at a critical time and has raised fears among UN personnel in Mogadishu that they do not have the full support or confidence of New York. 'Sahnoun's resignation is a disaster for Somalia and for the reputation of the UN,' said Ms Rakiya Omar, executive director of Africa Watch. Since Mr Sahnoun's departure, hostility by Somalia's gunmen towards the UN has increased. This week a gunman with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher hijacked a UN aircraft. Gen Aideed warned last week of 'fierce confrontation and bloodshed' if the UN tried to deploy more troops. He has also ordered the expulsion of two senior relief experts, threatened the expulsion of four others, and encouraged gunmen imposed on relief agencies and Somali workers to strike for better pay and conditions. Twelve supplementary feeding centres run by Save the Children Fund in Mogadishu have been paralysed by the strike action. The general has also begun backtracking on an agreement he signed with Mr Sahnoun on the deployment of the 500 Pakistani troops. Originally, he agreed that the UN troops could be deployed at the port with 500 local Somali guards - to be given one uniform each and under the command of the UN. Now he is insisting on 2,000 Somali guards, with three uniforms each and under their own chain of command. Similarly, the UN has been unable to deploy troops at the international airport, which has been closed for five weeks, as rival clan gunmen dispute who should control it and take the exorbitant landing fees imposed on the relief operation. The UN has been forced to divert air operations to a private dirt airstrip 50km south of Mogadishu established by the qat merchants for importing the drug by air from Kenya. Although progress has been made in lowering the death rate in Mogadishu and other towns, such as Baidoa, the vulnerability of the relief operation to continued insecurity has been most powerfully exposed in Bardere, a town 200km from the capital. Three weeks ago the town was retaken by Darod clan forces loyal to former dictator Siad Barre. In the immediate vacuum afterwards the death rate soared from 20 a day to over 200. As the UN looks increasingly crippled and directionless extortion by Somali thugs and bandits masquerading as legitimate political entities has increased. Already, aid agencies are forced to employ security guards and 'technicals' - Mad Max-style customised Somali vehicles with mounted heavy machine-guns. The average cost of each technical, with about six qat-chewing gunmen per vehicle, is Dollars 200 a day. Aid agencies and the UN are warned: if you don't employ us we can't guarantee your security. Similarly, Gen Aideed warned aid workers returning to restart feeding centres in Bardere after the fall of the town that if they went, they did so at their own risk. Even greater extortion is being exerted by gunmen on aid agencies through the control of strategic assets such as the port and airport. Fees for aircraft landing or port clearance are among the highest in the world. A UN water project was held up for four months recently because the clan family controlling the Afgoi well field demanded exorbitant compensation for protecting the assets during war. Eventually the UN caved in and agreed to employ all the members of the extended family in the rehabilitation project. 'They are holding us to ransom, screwing us all over the place, upping the charges and fees and we have to keep paying them off if we want to carry on working here,' said one head of an aid agency. 'The problem with this type of blackmail is we can't call their bluff because it would be unacceptable to pull out when people are dying.'</p>

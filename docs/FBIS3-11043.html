			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Senator Bernard Sansaricq is supporting the stance  of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries of the  United Nations opposing the idea of a possible reinforcement of  the sanctions against Haiti. Sansaricq, president of the other  Office of the Haitian Senate, thinks the Group of Latin American  Countries should have also demanded the lifting of the  international sanctions against Haiti.    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Sansaricq] They have seen that  the embargo has yielded nothing. On the contrary, it has  hardened the stance of some in Haiti who are really fighting for  democracy and who have said that foreign countries do not have  the right to interfere in our internal affairs and that we have  definitively decided to pay the price -- no matter what it is.  They have seen that an illegal and criminal embargo -- an  embargo aimed at destroying the country, the country's economy,  and the Haitian people -- has already caused 25,000 deaths in  Haiti, not to mention children. We cannot imagine the  destruction brought to the country's ecology.    There will be elections very soon in the Dominican Republic.  The country's situation can affect the results of those  elections. There are factors that show the other Latin American  countries that this nonsense cannot continue. They must finally  lift the embargo and let Haiti decide for itself on its own  fate. Not only do I share their opinion but I think they should  have gone further, they should have demanded the outright  lifting of the embargo against Haiti.    [Unidentified reporter] Furthermore, Sen. Sansaricq has  called on all sectors of the national life to participate in the  formation of a new government.    [Sansaricq] Since I was [elected] president of the Senate,  we  have been ready and waiting for the other institutions which  will accompany us in the process of establishing a nationalist  government, a government that can lead the fate of the country,  because we cannot remain in this deep confusion with the  resigning Robert Malval government that is doing nothing, that  is dismissing people from time to time even though it has no  right to do so because it is a resigning government.    The Senate is ready; the Senate has always said it is ready.  We are ready to do what has to be done so we can form a  nationalist government in Haiti. We are open. We are open so we  can reach a solution that will get the country out of the  crisis. The Senate is open. The Senate is ready. [end recording]</p>

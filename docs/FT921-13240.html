			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Sharp cut in UK investment by German groups THE RECESSION is exacting a heavy toll on German manufacturing investment in Britain, which fell by almost half in the first six months of last year to about Pounds 470m, according to figures published yesterday. The report, by the German Chamber of Commerce in Britain, shows that investment in the UK fell to a rate of Pounds 940m a year in the first half of 1991, down from Pounds 1.8bn the year before and Pounds 1.5bn in 1989. The chamber said the drop reflected the severity of the UK recession rather than a diversion of investment into eastern Germany. The figures are a blow to UK hopes that foreign manufacturing investment would help to offset cuts imposed by British companies. However, the survey, covering 361 of the 967 German companies in the UK, suggests that investment will pick up again once the recession is over. About 82 per cent of manufacturers said they planned further investments soon; 19 per cent of companies without manufacturing plants said they planned to set them up, and most companies were pleased with the return they had earned on their investment, with labour productivity and with industrial relations. In spite of this endorsement of the UK as the second largest recipient of German investment after the US, German industrialists raised serious doubts about the long-term outlook for British industrial competitiveness. Mr Juergen Gehrels, chief executive of the British operations of Siemens, the electrical and engineering group, said Britain would not be able to attract foreign investment indefinitely on the basis of low labour costs. Mr Gehrels said Britain's decision to opt out of the European Community's social charter was vital to maintaining its attractiveness as a manufacturing base. However, he warned: 'It may be that Britain cannot yet afford to join the social charter. But it will have to if it is to become a modern pluralistic society.' He said it would prove impossible to win purely on the basis of labour costs. The chamber's report urges greater investment in training and transport infrastructure. The survey found that 82 per cent of German companies which already manufacture in the UK plan to expand over the next five years by investing almost Pounds 1bn.

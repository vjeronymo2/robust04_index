			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Australian deficit worsens THE Australian dollar fell below 68 US cents early today for the first time in five years after the release yesterday of October balance of payments figures showing a deterioration in the current account deficit, Kevin Brown writes. The government said the unadjusted deficit was just over ADollars 2bn (Pounds 903m), compared to ADollars 1.7bn in September. The seasonally adjusted deficit rose by 19 per cent to ADollars 1.8bn. The trend estimate, which irons out swings in the seasonally adjusted figures, rose 5 per cent to ADollars 1.5bn. This was the ninth successive monthly rise. The main cause was an 11 per cent fall in exports, which was only partly offset by a 4 per cent import fall. The underlying import trend was a record high for the second month running. Economists said the continuing high demand was surprising in relation to the slow recovery from the 1990-91 recession.</p>

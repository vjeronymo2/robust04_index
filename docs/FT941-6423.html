			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / US and UK affirm unity on policies President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major put aside past differences over Bosnia yesterday and announced broad agreement on a range of foreign policy issues as the US leader reaffirmed the 'breadth and depth' of the transatlantic relationship. After talks in Pittsburgh and Washington they agreed to bolster support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin and to launch an initiative to speed implementation of last year's Gatt world trade agreement. Mr Clinton offered strong support for British policy in Hong Kong and carefully sidestepped questions over the visit to the US last month of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. To underline the rapprochement over Bosnia, the two leaders announced they would be sending a joint civil engineering team to Sarajevo to hasten efforts to restore normality to the city. The two governments will approach international financial institutions and seek resources to restore water, power and health services in the Bosnian capital. After their discussions Mr Clinton said London and Washington had agreed also on the need to bolster Mr Yeltsin's pursuit of reform in Russia, boost Russian ties with the west, and strengthen Nato's Partnership for Peace programme with the former Communist bloc. Speaking on the White House lawn after what both sides were at pains to emphasise had been harmonious meetings, Mr Clinton once again affirmed the strength of the 'special relationship'.  He said that by focusing on occasional problems, such as Bosnia and Ireland, observers had underestimated 'the incredible breadth and depth of our shared interests'. Mr Major responded by saying that the Anglo-American alliance was underpinned by 'shared interests and shared instincts' on virtually all the big issues facing the west. To reinforce the point, Mr Clinton offered support for Britain in its dispute with China over democratic reform in Hong Kong. He expressed admiration for Governor Chris Patten's efforts towards 'a genuine long-term strategy for economic and political success' in the colony. Mr Major signalled his hope that agreement with Mr Clinton on the joint approach to Bosnia would defuse the most explosive issue in often difficult relations between London and Washington over the past year. He said active US involvement in the search for an overall settlement between Bosnia's warring parties meant 'our policy is heading exactly in the same direction'. Mr Clinton indicated the US remained determined not to send US troops to Bosnia until there was a comprehensive political settlement, but said Nato's success in relieving Sarajevo had created 'a terrific opportunity to build on'. The two leaders will seek to bring forward to January 1995 implementation of the accords reached in the Uruguay Round. Under present plans these would not come into force until the middle of next year. Inflation prospects, Page 10</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / ITC to investigate World In Action 'bias' The Independent Television Commission has begun looking at a formal allegation by the Conservative party that Granada Television has breached its broadcasting licence because of a World In Action programme. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, has submitted the formal complaint to the commission over the current affairs programme that looked at the effect of the government's taxation plans on three families in the marginal Tory constituency of Dover. In his letter to the commission, Sir Norman complains that the programme did not show 'due impartiality'. Investigation of the complaint could be the first proper test of controversial impartiality rules imposed by the 1990 Broadcasting Act on commercial television. The act required the commission to draw up an impartiality code to take 'particular account of the impartiality due to major matters of political or industrial controversy or relating to current public policy'. There was considerable opposition at the time to the idea that the contents of an impartiality code should be part of an act of parliament. The commission did, however, accept the concept after original proposals were watered down. The code says that licensees must ensure that justice is done to a full range of significant views and perspectives during the period in which the controversy is active. The commission makes clear that balance can be achieved over time and that an impartial programme service does not necessarily have to ensure that in a single programme all sides have a chance to speak. The World In Action programme chose three families in Dover who had all voted Conservative at the last general election. It asked the Institute for Fiscal Studies to calculate how much more tax they would have to pay as a result of Conservative taxation changes since the last general election. The local MP Mr David Shaw, it is believed, was asked to appear, but declined. A long list of Conservative politicians, it was suggested last night, also declined. They included all the main Treasury ministers from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary, and former chancellor Mr Norman Lamont. Conservative Central Office was also asked to nominate a spokesman, it is believed. In the end the programme contained a contribution from Mr Shaun Woodward, one of the leading figures who ran the Conservative's election campaign.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "High-Powered: A Nuclear Future"] </F>   [Text] Severe electricity shortages are whetting China's  appetite for nuclear power, but satisfying this hunger will  require foreign capital.    Sun Guangdi, chief engineer for nuclear power for the China  National Nuclear Corp (CNNC), said some foreign businesses have  shown interest in financing new nuclear power plants.    As a showcase of what Sino-foreign co-operation can  accomplish, CNNC officials cite the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant  in Guangdong Province, the country's first joint venture in this  field.    Sun said many provinces are eager to build more plants, but  developing nuclear power is hindered by the shortage of capital.    Some provinces -- such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian,  Shandong  and Hainan -- are actively looking for sites and conducting  feasibility studies of nuclear power plants.    All these provinces are in South and East China and suffer  severe shortages of electricity.    "The market for nuclear electricity is potentially vast, and  with advanced nuclear technology we have the ability to develop  nuclear power," Sun said.    Encouraged by the safe and efficient operation of the  country's first two nuclear power stations, in Qinshan,  Zhejiang, and at Daya Bay in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone,  China is stepping up work on other plants.    Second-phase construction has already begun at the Qinshan  plant to install two 600,000-kilowatt generators, Sun said. A  planned third phase would expand total capacity to 3 million  kilowatts.    The capital for the project came from the State and from  Shanghai Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, which use the plant's  electricity.    China also plans to build another nuclear plant in Guangdong  and one in Liaoning Province.    The new plant in Guangdong will be located at Lingao, north  of Daya Bay. The plant will house two 900,000-kilowatt  generators, and construction is due to be completed in 2002.    Part of the capital for the project will come from the  profits of Daya Bay, whose No 1 Generator went into commercial  operation on February 6. Its No 2 Generator is expected to  begin operating commercially in May or June.    The Liaoning plant will be located at Wafangdian near Bohai  Bay and will have two Russian generators, each with a capacity  of 1 million kilowatts.    Sun said designing of the plant has already begun.    "With power shortages becoming increasingly severe in  China,"  Sun said "nuclear power is a safe, economical and clean way for  the country to resolve its difficulties." However, Sun said,  China got a late start in nuclear power and must make big  strides to catch up with other countries.    Nuclear power accounted for only 0.3 per cent of the  country's total electricity output last year, compared with 78  per cent in France, 43 per cent in South Korea and 27.7 per cent  in Japan.    China's two nuclear plants generated 2.49 billion kilowatts  last year and the figure this year is expected to climb to 8  billion to 10 billion kilowatts.    In addition, China is negotiating to build a nuclear power  plant in Iran with two 300,000-kilowatt generators.    Sun said that construction is in full swing on the Chashima  Nuclear Power Plant in Pakistan, one of China's biggest  assistance projects in a Third World country.</p>

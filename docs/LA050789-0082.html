			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh is threatening to end the role of the American Bar  Assn. Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary in screening prospective federal  judges unless the ABA keeps a commitment not to consider political or  ideological beliefs. Thornburgh said "we expect them to honor" an agreement to  revert to pre-1980 language in the ABA's judicial screening guidelines. The  1977 version does not contain any exception to the statement that political and  ideological views are not considered. Later versions of the guidelines contain  an exception that such views are considered if they bear on the ability to be a  fair, impartial and open-minded judge. The dispute broke out Tuesday when ABA  leaders took issue with Thornburgh's testimony to the House Judiciary Committee  that the group had agreed to the change.  </P></p>

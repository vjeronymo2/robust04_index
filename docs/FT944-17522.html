			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Etam doubles but gives warning of weaker trend Shares in Etam, the fashion retailer, fell yesterday as the group almost doubled interim profits, but warned of a slightly weaker trend at the beginning of the second half. The shares, which have performed strongly since hitting a low for the year of 217p in April, fell by 20 1/2 p to close at 282p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to August 13 rose from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 4.74m. The latest figure was struck after a Pounds 1.06m loss on the disposal of shops. Sales for the group, which is heavily reliant on the second half for its profits, were ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 113.4m (Pounds 108.2m). Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the group was not reading too much into the slightly weaker trend since the end of the first half. 'It's nothing dramatic.' But he pointed to the recent interest rate rise, tax increases, particularly on dometic heating, and the autumn budget as deterrents to consumers. At the same time, the group had had a good first half, benefiting from six weeks of good weather which left it with very little in stocks to mark down. Gross margins improved from 4.8 to 7.7 per cent. 'We are obviously quite pleased with these results,' he said. 'It was always our strategy to rebuild the bottom line.' Interest receivable grew from Pounds 28,000 to Pounds 273,000, and the group ended the half with cash of Pounds 13.7m, compared with borrowings of Pounds 2.7m previously. Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 4.8m as the group embarked on a big store refurbishment programme. Mr Miles said spending for the year would be as high as Pounds 17m, with about Pounds 9m being spent on 55 branches before the end of November. 'We have come through the recession and established a platform from which to move forward. It's nice to be able to do that with your own cash,' he said. The group now operates 224 stores, of which 180 feature the Etam and Tammy brands, and 30 feature Etam, Tammy and Snob. Tammy sells children's wear, while Snob, which has been cut, targets younger women. While the number of stores is slightly lower, the selling space increased from 843,000 sq ft to 857,000 sq ft. Earnings per share rose from 2p to 4.28p. The interim dividend is increased from 1.75p to 1.95p. COMMENT This was a sparkling set of interim results, well ahead of City expectations. But the cautious trading statement was enough to prompt investors to take their profits after seeing the stock outperform the stores sector by more than 20 per cent over the last three months. Etam is trying to edge up its margins at the same time as improving both its image and the quality of its goods. The strategy paid off in the first half, and the company sees further benefits as its refurbishment programme gathers pace. The dip in sales in the first seven weeks of the second half could be merely a rogue trading period. Forecasts have been upgraded to about Pounds 18m for this year and Pounds 21m for 1995-96, giving a prospective multiple of 13.5. This is a small discount to the sector and looks fair value.</p>

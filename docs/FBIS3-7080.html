			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Niigata, March 24 KYODO -- The Niigata District  Court on Thurday [24 March] turned down a suit seeking a halt to  a 1977 government decision that allowed a power utility firm to  build a nuclear power plant in the sea of Japan coast city of  Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture. The three-judge panel said it  could not find reason to necessitate the cancellation of the  permission by the minister of international trade and industry.    The court acted on the suit filed in 1979 by a group of 282  residents who questioned the safety of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa  nuclear power plant, which was built by Tokyo Electric Power Co.    The plaintiffs demanded the annulment of the permission,  citing a geologists' report that they had discovered an  enlarging fracture of the surface of the land that consists of  layers of sandstone and mudstone. The crustal fracture is known  among geologists as the terao fault.    While the court case dragged on over 15 years, Tokyo  Electric  Power completed the installation of five nuclear reactors in the  complex. Four of the five are now in operation and construction  of two more reactors is under way.    If the additional two are completed, the complex would rank  among the world's largest nuclear power plants by having an  aggregate power-generating capability of 8,210 megawatts.    Presiding Judge Yukio Ota said in the ruling, "there is no  sufficient evidence that would substantiate a hypothesis that  the terao fault resulted from some problems in the geological  structure." The ruling went on to say, "there are no serious  mistakes in the judgment of the government which concluded that  the firmness of the ground supporting the power plant cannot be  eroded by a possible movement of the earth's crust."    The plaintiffs also argued that the power company has not  taken sufficient safety measures to prevent a possible calamity  like the 1986 reactor meltdown in Chernobyl, then in the Soviet  Union, or the 1979 accident at the Three-Mile Island power plant  in the United States. The judge said the government's  recognition of the safety of the design of the Kashiwazaki plant  cannot be questioned, as the nuclear disasters in Chernobyl and  Three-Mile Island stemmed from mistakes in operation management  or defective design of the nuclear reactors.    The ruling, however, recognized the plaintiffs' assertion  that the government's safety standard was too lenient.    The safety standard at the time stipulated that the  tolerable  dosage of exposure of residents to radiation from the nuclear  plant was 0.5 roentgen equivalent man (rem) per year. In 1989  the standard was tightened to 0.1 rem.    The ruling said, "at present, the court questions the  rationale of the tolerable radiation exposure figure of 0.5 rem  for the public, which was used by the government in examining  the safety of the plant in this case." Yoki Kawada, director  general of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, said,  "the ruling that recognized the assertions of the government on  this case was appropriate and the government will continue to  expedite the development and use of nuclear power plants."</p>

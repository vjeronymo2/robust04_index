			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE EVIDENCE THAT RECESSION ISN'T NEAR;  </P> <P> REPORTS SHOW GAINS IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, HOUSING STARTS  </P> <P> Industrial production rose for the first time in three months in July while  housing starts continued to rebound, the government said Wednesday in reports  seen as further evidence that a recession will be avoided this year.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index last month stood at  141.7% of its 1977 base, compared to 141.4% in June.  </P> <P> The 0.2% increase in July followed consecutive declines of 0.1% in May and  June. Overall production was up 2.7% over a year ago.  </P> <P> In another report, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose 0.8% in  July after posting declines for four consecutive months through May. They  started to rebound with an 8.5% increase in June.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Fed reported that the factory operating rate remained  steady at 83.6% in July, continuing to ease inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> "It's consistent with the soft-landing scenario, modest growth without tipping  into a recession," Thomas Holloway, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers  Assn. of America, said of the reports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Moderate Strength'  </P> <P> David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Assn., said  that several months of stagnant production at manufacturing plants had been  causing fears of a recession.  </P> <P> But Wednesday's report "indicates that manufacturing may have bottomed out and  we're seeing some moderate strength that should help with the soft-landing  scenario," he said.  </P> <P> The Fed has been walking a fine line between keeping interest rates high enough  to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the economy  slides into a recession. It began letting rates drop in June as inflation  seemed to lessen.  </P> <P> "The July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of total materials as  well as continued strength in business equipment excluding motor vehicles," the  central bank said Wednesday in releasing the industrial production report.  </P> <P> "In contrast, automobile and truck production fell sharply, and output of  construction supplies, on balance, remained weak," it said.  </P> <P> Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods  rose 0.2% after remaining flat in May and June. That was a 3.3% increase from  July, 1988.  </P> <P> Output at mines and oil wells rose 0.3% following a revised 1.1% decline in  June caused in part by a coal strike. The July output was 3.5% lower than a  year ago.  </P> <P> Production at utilities, reflecting increased use of air conditioning, rose  0.8% in July, following a 1.3% decline in June. Utility production was up 1.2%  from July, 1988.  </P> <P> William D. Kelleher, manager of the Community Resources Section of the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, said he was encouraged by the housing report.  </P> <P> "This month's rebound in housing starts shows that the country's economic  expansion is continuing," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Natural Falloff  </P> <P> The July level of construction totaled 1.43 million units at a seasonally  adjusted annual rate, up from 1.42 million in June.  </P> <P> Single-family construction rose 6.3% last month while apartment starts fell  1.2%. Analysts said the multifamily drop was a natural falloff from an  unusually steep 32.9% increase in June.  </P> <P> The operating rate at the nation's factories remained at 83.6% last month after  declining 0.3 percentage point in June, the Fed reported. The rate hit a  10-year high of 84.3% in December. Last month's operating rate was down from  83.7% a year earlier.  </P> <P> The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater  difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and  price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85% or above  as an indication of inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> The operating rate at manufacturing plants slipped 0.1 percentage point to  83.9%, down from June's 84%. That rate had peaked at 84.7% in January.  </P> <P> The rate at factories producing durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to  last more than three years -- edged down 0.3 percentage point from 82.6% in  June. The rate at factories producing non-durable goods rose to 86.2%, compared  to 86.1% in June.  </P></p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Budgens Judging by the swiftness with which a few institutional investors appear to have rolled over Budgens' management, it is tempting to conclude that there was not much left in the company worth fighting for beyond the chairman's compensation package. Whether the institutions picked the right fight is another matter. At this point, it is unclear how the new team proposes to turn the company around. The problems appear daunting enough to make one wonder whether the shop doors are being closed far too late. Budgens lacks the critical mass with which to compete against rival food retailers. In recent years, it has spent far too much on fancy distribution facilities which are not being fully utilised. As a consequence, the interest charge is rising and the balance sheet is deteriorating. Much-needed sale and leaseback deals on its properties will remain a distant prospect until the property market improves. It would be a shame if the move towards better corporate governance were to be deflected by the odd mistake. But a year from now, it may just be that the institutions will wish they had cut their losses and sold their shares.</p>

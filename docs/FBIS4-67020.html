			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Deaths From Heroin Drop From 1,217 </F> to 840"]    [Text] Rome -- Less heroin, more cocaine, especially  synthetics -- these are drug addicts' preferences, according to  the 1993 report published by the "carabinieri's" anti-drug  force. The NAD's [narcotics squads] seized 15,000 XTC [ecstasy]  tablets and 3,000 LSD stamps -- substances which were  practically absent from the market in previous years. Synthetic  drugs are in fact cheaper (a tablet costs between 50,000 and  80,000 lire [L], compared to L120,000-150,000 for a heroin  dose). According to the "carabinieri," the increase in the use  of synthetic drugs explains the reduction in the number of  deaths from overdose, which dropped from 1,217 in 1992 to 840 in  1993. Furthermore, the NAD's determined that most of the drugs  came from the Netherlands and their price, at the source, was in  the region of L2,000-3,000. Milan, Genoa, Verona, and Rome are  the major distribution centers.    Yesterday the NAD's exposed a Milan woman doctor who had  been  issuing morphine prescriptions -- in the form of hydrochloride  syrup -- to 35 drug addicts, many of whom had criminal records.  The prescriptions were made out in the name of a person who had  died some time before. Over a three-year period, from 1990 to  1992, she signed 1,600 prescriptions for as many bottles. This  doctor's case is not an isolated one: In the course of the  police operation, more than 1,000 people were arrested,  including 11 medical doctors; 1,584 people were arrested and  subsequently released on bail (including 357 doctors and  chemists); and 598 kilograms of drugs were seized.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WITT LOOKS LIKE AN ACE AGAIN, 9-3;  </P> <P> ANGELS ARE ROLLING, TWINS ARE REELING INTO ALL-STAR BREAK  </P> <P> Mike Witt was expected to carry the Angel pitching staff this season, but until  now, has been the weak link to a surprisingly strong corps.  </P> <P> Pitchers have set the pace for the Angels, but without much help from Witt, who  for years has been the team's ace. He was 3-7 on June 12.  </P> <P> But Witt (7-7) gained his fourth consecutive victory Sunday as the Angels  entered the All-Star break with a 9-3 victory over Minnesota, which has lost  six in a row.  </P> <P> "My goal was to be 8-7 at the break," Whitt said. "But coming from where I was,  7-7 is not bad at all. This is definitely the best staff I've ever been on.  </P> <P> "That's helped me a lot, because I've struggled. But I finally realized I  didn't have to go out there and pitch a shutout every time, just do my best."  </P> <P> Witt went seven innings, giving up six hits and two runs as the Angels held the  opposition to three runs or fewer for the 13th consecutive game.  </P> <P> The Twins have been victimized in seven of those games, their only victory  coming 2-1 last Sunday in Minnesota. The Twins have lost six in a row since  that triumph by left-hander Frank Viola.  </P> <P> "That team obviously is too much for us to handle," Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly  said. "We used four pitchers and none of them could stop them. And I can't say  enough about their pitching."  </P> <P> Brian Downing's two-run homer and Johnny Ray's two-run single keyed the Angels'  15-hit attack.  </P> <P> With their third consecutive victory and 13th in 16 games, the Angels swept  into the annual All-Star break with a record of 52-33, best in the major  leagues.  </P> <P> Wally Joyner opened the second with a single before Downing hit his ninth  homer, off Allan Anderson (9-7) for a 2-1 lead. Minnesota took a 1-0 lead in  the inning on Gary Gaetti's 16th homer.  </P> <P> Dick Schofield doubled in the third and scored on Joyner's single to make it  3-1 and the Angels added an unearned run in the fourth.  </P> <P> Tony Armas singled and was safe at second when Lance Parrish's grounder to  short was juggled by Greg Gagne for an error. Schofield then doubled home  Armas.  </P> <P> California made it 6-1 against reliever Mike Dyer in the sixth on Ray's single.  </P> <P> Gene Larkin singled and Brian Harper doubled with no outs in the seventh, but  the Twins managed only one run on Doug Baker's sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> The Angels made it 7-2 in the bottom of the inning on Parrish's RBI single.  Kent Hrbek homered for the Twins in the eighth, his ninth.  </P></p>

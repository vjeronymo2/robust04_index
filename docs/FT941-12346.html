The US Supreme Court last week backed US airports in their long running dispute with airlines over fees for using runways and airport facilities. The court ruled that airports were free to charge fees they decided were reasonable. USAir and British Airways are taking practical steps to consolidate their alliances in the US. The US airline, which is British Airways' partner in North America, plans to move its services at New York's Kennedy Airport to BA's own terminal to improve connections with BA's eight daily trans-Atlantic flights. British Airways flights to Poland are still disrupted by a dispute with Polish Airlines over landing rights at Heathrow. Travellers on BA flights to Warsaw are flying to Frankfurt and then travelling onto the Polish capital by bus. Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines, plan to add 12 international destinations to their routes this year, including Washington, Seattle, Beijing, Brussels and Khabarovsk. India is planning to change regulations to permit its state-owned domestic and international airlines to become publicly held companies, according to Indian newspaper reports. They said the government issued a special ordinance scrapping a 1953 parliamentary act that nationalised air services in the country and did not allow private airlines.</p>

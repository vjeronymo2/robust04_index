			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Reynolds presses Major on Ulster Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday called for 'an accelerated British response' to the six-week-old IRA ceasefire. In the wake of the assertion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, that the British government may never be in a position to say it accepts that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, Mr Reynolds told the Dublin parliament he was convinced that the end of IRA violence was 'real and for good'. He said he would be in touch with Mr John Major later this week to explain 'that we believe the peace process should be consolidated and underpinned at the earliest possible moment because if any vacuums develop, the process could be endangered - and we don't want to see that happen'. Mr Reynolds also said he was 'encouraged' by signs of a loyalist ceasefire. There was fresh optimism in Northern Ireland last night within the fringes of the paramilitaries after the Government allowed loyalist leaders into the top-security Maze Prison on Monday for talks about a possible ceasefire with UDA and UVF inmates. Mr Reynolds, replying to a series of questions on the search for peace in Northern Ireland, told the parliament of his forthcoming contact with Mr Major: 'I will be making the point that I believe the time has come now, into the sixth week of the cessation of violence, to accelerate the response of the British government. 'Also that the British government should use whatever pressures they can in relation to an end of violence by loyalist paramilitaries.' But he also made clear that Sinn Fein had been told that Dublin disapproved of the steep rise in punishment beatings carried out by republican hardliners since the ceasefire began on September 1. Mr Reynolds said it was expected that a framework for all-party, cross-border talks would be completed ahead of a meeting soon with Mr Major. 'The intention is that the discussions and negotiations on the document will be over before we fix a definitive date for the meeting,' he said.</p>

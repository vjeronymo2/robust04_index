			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Dogs begin to bark WATCHDOGS closed in on the secondhand endowment market place this week. The market for unmatured endowment policies has boomed in the last three years. Making a market in these complicated products is a new discipline requiring complex actuarial calculations, and does not fit easily into any regulatory category. It was in danger of slipping through a loophole. Have the regulators found the right balance? Fimbra, which regulates independent advisers and brokers, now insists that when a secondhand policy with more than five years to run before maturity is sold, any projections of how it will perform in future must conform to the growth rates prescribed by Lautro, the life assurance regulator. This puts projections for secondhand policies on the same footing as projections for policies at the beginning of their term, which makes sense. However, Lautro rates are not known for their subtlety - they allow two different projections, on annual growth rates of 7 per cent and 10.5 per cent. The machinations of a with-profits policy tend to be complex which these projections could miss. Terminal bonuses are under great pressure, while reversionary bonuses could also be under threat. It therefore makes sense to quote potential maturity values given a range of assumptions on future bonuses - for example that they are maintained at their current level, or drop by 10 per cent, or drop by 50 per cent. What some market makers now seem likely to do is abandon quoting any projections at all. Instead, they will quote a price and provide background information on the bonuses paid on the policy to date. The ruling will save investors from being misled, but may divert them from being given any useful guidance.</p>

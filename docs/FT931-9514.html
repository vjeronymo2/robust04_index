			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Ballot for 12,000 London bus staff ABOUT 12,000 London bus staff will be balloted on industrial action over pay and conditions, including pay cuts of between Pounds 30 and Pounds 60 a week, the TGWU general union said yesterday. The ballot has been set for February 19. The union said any action would probably be a series of one-day stoppages. The ballot result will be known on February 22. The union accused 10 subsidiaries of London Buses of 'blackmail', saying the companies had threatened to withdraw compensation for loss of earnings if staff did not accept the package within varying periods of time. Some companies told staff they would have to waive their right to take action, including legal action, as a condition of receiving compensation. The compensation is worth about two years lost earnings, on average about Pounds 3,000. Driver-operators earn about Pounds 280 a week before overtime.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Arnott's puts off building new factory Arnott's, the Australian food group 61 per cent owned by Campbell Soup of the US, said it had put on hold its planned ADollars 200m (USDollars 147m) biscuit factory because of the decision by the Australian Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) to continue monitoring the company, Reuter reports from Sydney. Mr Paul Bourke, Arnott's managing director, said the new factory, planned to be built in Sydney, was a key part of its push into Asia. The PSA, a federal body, recently released a report on biscuit pricing. Arnott's said earlier this year it may shelve plans to build the factory if it was not released from surveillance.</p>

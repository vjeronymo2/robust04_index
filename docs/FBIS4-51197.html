			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Foreign banking  organizations are showing more and more interest in co-operating  with Chinese investment funds.    An official of the Banking Administration Bureau under the  People's Bank of China said that overseas co-operators now  number 40, with a total investment amount of three billion U.S.  dollars.    More than 20 Chinese investment funds have their stocks  listed on the securities markets of New York, London and other  European countries as well as Hong Kong.    Starting in 1987, the Chinese investment funds burgeoned  particularly in 1992.    Banking specialists here agree that the expansion of the  Chinese investment funds overseas indicates foreign investors'  appreciation of the prospects for China's economic development.  It also paves the way for China to absorb overseas capital and  stimulates the growth of domestic investment funds.</p>

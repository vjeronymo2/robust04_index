The man initially claimed he had been contracted to funnel  the illegal narcotic to Iceland on the basis of an  acquaintanceship struck up in Amsterdam, and in return for a  $2,500 fee.    The illegal stash was then to be picked up in Reykjavik  after  he had checked into a hotel.    During court questioning the Dane related that he feared  retaliation from his "employer," of whose identity he had no  idea other than that he went under the name of Franck, and was a  foreign citizen residing in Iceland.    Despite making pronouncements to the contrary, the Dane  subsequently claimed he had acted alone in smuggling the hashish  into the country.</p>

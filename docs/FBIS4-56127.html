			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariyana Barutchieva: "Bulgaria Receives Offers </F> for Deal on 88 Percent of Its London Club Debt"]    [Text] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- Bulgaria has received offers  from the London Club banks for settlement of 88 percent of its  foreign commercial debt, Deputy Finance Minister Dimitur Kostov  told BTA. Mr. Kostov is member of the Foreign Debt Management  Committee which is in charge of negotiations with Bulgaria's  Bank Advisory Committee. The remaining 15 banks are also  expected to apply for participation in the deal. Among them are  big Russian banks, to which Bulgaria owes 6.4 percent of the  $8,700 million debt. According to Mr. Kostov, the proportion of  banks that have applied for participation in the deal is very  good, considering that deals of that kind can be finalized even  when offers cover 80 percent of the debt. He said that German  and Japanese banks hold the largest portions of the debt.    Within the 88 percent portion offered for settlement, 12.8  percent is for debt buy-back, 27.8 percent for front-loaded  interest reduction bonds, and 59.4 percent for collateralized  discount bonds. Bulgaria's actual expenses on the deal cannot be  calculated at this stage as the interest for the September  1992-June 1994 period, which will not be capitalized, is still  to be set and the $180 million which Bulgaria has paid so far  (about $90 million under Filip Dimitrov's government, $30  million at the end of 1993, and another $60 million which  Bulgaria is still to pay for the first half of 1994) are to be  deducted from the total amount.    According to Mr. Kostov, the finalization of the deal is of  major importance for Bulgaria as it expects foreign banks to  open credit lines amounting to some $250 million-300 million  within three to six months after the agreement is signed. This  will boost Bulgarian companies' sales and output by about 10  percent and will help create more jobs and raise wages.  Bulgarian production and trade have been declining in the last  few years, dropping 4-5 percent in the second half of 1993  alone, Mr. Kostov said.    The total reduction of the debt and its servicing will be an  estimated 47-50 percent, and that of its par value 37-40  percent. Between 1994 and 2000, Bulgaria will make annual  payments of $250 million on the average and will spend $945  million on buy-back of principal and interest.    Bulgaria will pay up front some $670-700 million. In Mr.  Kostov's view, the country is in position to finance the deal as  it has a foreign exchange reserves of more than $1,000 million  at its central bank. Within two months it will also receive  money from Japan on the SAL agreement and funds for the deal  promised by international financial institutions, the IMF and  the World Bank. A total of $250-300 million in extra funding is  expected, Mr. Kostov said.    The debt buy-back will start as soon as the deal is  finalized  on June 30, when it will be signed and the up-front payment  made. The Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank will be discharged of  its obligation as the nominal debtor on the day of the first  payment. The newly issued bonds will be traded freely and will  be registered on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. According to  Mr. Kostov, futures deals on debt bonds have already been made.  He said that the debt agency may be assumed by any reputable  Bulgarian or foreign banking institution which would boost  confidence in the Bulgarian foreign debt bonds on the secondary  debt market.</p>

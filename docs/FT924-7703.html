			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy Yesterday's inflation figures offer further evidence of just how subdued price pressures now are in the service sectors of the economy. Services are largely insulated from the effect of sterling's devaluation, so with their benign influence the underlying rate of inflation should inch lower still over the next few months. In the absence of any immediate pick-up in demand, indeed, manufacturers will probably take the early hit of higher import prices in the form of lower margins. The more dramatic fall, of course, will come in the headline rate which, given another 1 point cut in mortgages, could bottom out at 1 per cent by the second quarter of 1993. The worry for the markets, though, is what happens in next year's second half. History suggests that at the first whiff of renewed activity companies seek to claw back some of the lost margin. It may be that the market is underestimating the impact of increased food prices which will inevitably flow from the proposed dismantlement of the Community's monetary regime for agriculture on January 1. The devaluation of the green pound, after all, will affect domestic food prices as well as imports. The calculation for the markets is whether the chancellor starts to apply the monetary brakes again if he sees the 4 per cent upper limit of his inflation target in danger of being breached.</p>

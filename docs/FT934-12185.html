			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Allianz calls for steps to reduce insurance losses ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, has called on its corporate clients to co-operate in implementing a package of radical measures designed to reduce huge losses in the German industrial insurance sector Mr Manfred Illner, a director of Allianz's main domestic insurance subsidiary, outlined six steps which the group wants to implement in order to cut losses in this sector. Simply raising premiums to the level where the business was again profitable was not acceptable, Mr Illner said on Tuesday night, nor was withdrawing from this area of the insurance market as has happened in other countries. He urged Allianz's corporate clients to co-operate in measures which range from setting premiums which are more appropriate to the scale of the risk, to introducing better risk-management procedures in companies and agreeing limits to maximum coverage levels. This, Mr Illner warned, was the only way of keeping Germany insurable, 'and German industry must remain insurable so that it, and Germany as a location for industry, can maintain their position.' Last year, Allianz, the market leader in the German insurance industry, lost DM100m (Pounds 40.6m) in the industrial risks sector, and the German market's 10 biggest losses in the engineering sector alone amounted to DM125m. One hail storm in May this year caused a pay-out of DM28m to just one client, Munich airport. Over the past five years the German insurance market has lost DM2.6bn in industrial fire insurance alone, but there has also been a significant increase in the number and size of claims in other sectors. The German insurance market is the biggest in Europe. These sharply increased losses reflect a number of factors, including the cost and sophistication of the technology which is covered by insurance, an increase in crimes such as arson, and poor weather conditions.</p>

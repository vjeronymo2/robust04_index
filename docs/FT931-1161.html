			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Thomas Cook surges to Pounds 25m THOMAS COOK, the German-controlled travel agency which played a decisive role in helping Owners Abroad defeat a hostile takeover bid from Airtours earlier this month, yesterday announced a significant recovery in profits for 1992. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 25.3m, against Pounds 8.9m depressed by the Gulf war. Turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 486.5m (Pounds 429.6m) with international activities growing by 15 per cent while the UK side gained 12 per cent. The recovery was led by strong contributions from the leisure travel and foreign exchange businesses.</p>

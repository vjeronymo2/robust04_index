			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / ITV digs in over News at Ten scheduling THE ITV companies yesterday declined to back down publicly over the scheduling of News at Ten in spite of the political furore caused by proposals to move it to an early evening slot. The ITV Council, which brings together the chief executives of the 15 regional ITV companies, decided it wanted to meet the Independent Television Commission 'to review the extensive research on this issue and its commercial implications'. In a carefully worded statement the ITV companies said they wanted to explore different interpretations of the 1990 Broadcasting Act over the scheduling of news programmes. The future of News at Ten will be discussed by the ITC on July 14 at the previously scheduled annual meeting between the members of the commission and the chief executives of ITV. There is no sign, however, that the ITC is prepared to compromise on the issue. The commission, which saw yesterday's ITV statement as a face-saving exercise, will stick to its line that no change in the scheduling of News at Ten is possible without its approval. It is difficult to see what ITV can do, even though it has a strong legal opinion that the ITC does not have the right to specify a particular time for the main evening news other than 'prime time' between 6.30pm and 10pm. To force the issue forward ITV would have to decide unilaterally to move News at Ten. The companies would then almost certainly face stiff fines from the ITC for breaches of their licences. Only then could they challenge the ITC in the High Court by seeking a judicial review of such a deci-sion. In spite of yesterday's show of defiance the odds are that News at Ten will stay where it is for the forseeable future. ITV company Yorkshire-Tyne Tees is to axe 188 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive, it announced yesterday.</p>

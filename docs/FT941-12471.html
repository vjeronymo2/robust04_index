			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Sharing a nanny I share a nanny with another family and her duties, for both families, include the delivery of children to school and collecting them. Since she incurs motor and other expenses during her duties, it would be advantageous for her to work on a self-employed basis and thus claim expenses against her income. Is this is acceptable to the Revenue? Both the Revenue and the Contributions Agency of the DSS are likely to resist the nanny's claim to be self-employed. She will, therefore, need professional assistance from someone skilled in this area of law. As a first step, she could ask her tax office for the free pamphlets IR28 (Starting in business) and IR56 (Employed or self-employed? - a guide for tax and national insurance). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

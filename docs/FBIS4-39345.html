			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an  article by State Duma Deputy Vladimir Lysenko under the headline  "What Prevents Russia From Becoming a Full-Value Federation".    Lysenko's opinion is that the Constitutions of republics  should accord with Russia's fundamental law which is "the  cornerstone of the strengthening of Russian statehood and the  development of federative relations". "This is, of course, not  to the liking of all political forces and their leaders. But we  all should move on from words to deeds to create a powerful  Russian state," Lysenko pointed out.    In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, writer Yuriy Chernichenko, member of  the Federation Council and chairman of the Peasants' Party of  Russia, describes the current agrarian reform in the country as  a slack one. He says it has no proclaimed goals, a manifest, or  an ideology. It has, instead, a lot of purely Russian and  "Soviet" peculiarities which determine its slack nature and  immediate and distant prospects.    The writer's detailed reflections on the subject are to be  published in one of future issues of the newspaper.    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA interviewed Sergey Belyayev, general  director of the Federal Directorate for Insolvency (bankruptcy).  He describes the importance of a new concept of the relevant  legislation which is being prepared by his organisation.    "Then, we shall have a clear idea of how many enterprises  are  really insolvent and are potential bankrupts or, on the  contrary, can restore their paying capacity".    As of now, he said there are about 1,200 large insolvent  enterprises in Russia. Pointing out that most people are  psychologically unprepared to seek protection under  circumstances unexpected for them, Belyayev draws the following  conclusion:" "there is no detonator more dangerous for a social  conflict than a quiet self-liquidation of insolvent enterprises".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) raises the question of the need  to  enhance social protection of the military, which is essential,  first of all, to uphold Russia's interests.    The Army does not ask for something extra. It needs firm  social guarantees backed up financially, not lamentations that  these are hard times for everyone, the newspaper points out.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Igor Puzanov,  first  deputy commander of the troops of the Moscow Military District,  who points out the importance of a rise in the professionalism  standards in the forces, which is hindered, he said, by the  "scarcity of resources".    "It is possible and necessary to economise but there is the  limit below which one should not go in arrangements for combat  and operation training of troops and officer personnel. This  would be dangerous for the state and would threaten with  irreversible consequences", Puzanov said.    TRUD runs an interview with Fyodor Prokopov, director of the  Federal Employment Service. He points out that as of May 1,  there were 1,180,000 officially registered unemployed in Russia.  He predicts that their number will grow to about 12 million  towards the end of the year but that six million of them will be  able to get new jobs quickly: commercial entities and  small-business enterprises gain in scope.    Prokopov urges the jobless to learn to acquire skills that  the country needs, monitor the labour market situation and try  their hand in new lines of business.    PRAVDA, referring to the data of the Federal Employment  Service, writes that the number of unemployed in Russia has  grown by 40 percent since the beginning of the year. The  highest unemployment rate was observed in the Jewish autonomous  region, Evenkia, Karachai-Cherkesia, Amur region and Khabarovsk  territory as well as in central regions of Russia.    The newspaper quotes Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov as stating  that  mass unemployment threatens with such a social outburst,  compared to which hyperinflation consequences would pale into  insignificance.    PRAVDA carries an interview with Leonid Filatov, a merited  artist of Russia, an actor, stage director and writer, who  criticises the country's reform process. In his view, the  reforms lead "in a wrong direction".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs the full text of a project for the  formation of a Euro-Asian union of states. This has been done  at the request of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who  sent the text out to the heads of state of CIS countries.    The document points out that all CIS countries experience a  deep crisis. Their development is determined by two trends.  There is a further formation of national statehood, on the one  hand, and there is a tendency towards CIS countries'  integration, on the other.    TRUD interviewed Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk who  pointed out that Ukraine and Russia had lived "within a single  power" for 340 years. No one ever took up arms to fight each  other, he said.    "When I am asked whether there will be a war between Russia  and Ukraine, I answer `no' without hesitation," Kravchuk said.  "I want relations between Russia and Ukraine to be built with an  eye to long-term development", he emphasised.    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA singles out a report that Ukrainian  nationalists' leader Dmitriy Korchinskiy issued an order to  paramilitary units "to be prepared to go to the Crimea". An  article to this effect is headlined "They Are Already Prepared  To Resort to Killing in the Crimea".</p>

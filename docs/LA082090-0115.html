			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPLINTER IN TOE BECOMES $3,700 THORN IN FLORIDA MAN'S SIDE  </P> <P> The next time Jack McElhinney gets a splinter, he plans to take care of it  himself. The last one has cost more than $3,700 to remove.  </P> <P> The 57-year-old retired real estate broker had pulled most of the splinter out  of his big toe and was able to jog and play tennis, but the sliver annoyed him.  </P> <P> He went to his doctor, who X-rayed the toe and referred him to a surgeon, who  sent him to another physician. When the toe became infected, the doctor said  McElhinney would have to go to the hospital to get the splinter removed.  </P> <P> McElhinney thought it would be a simple procedure. Then a clerk called and  asked whether he had a will and had signed an organ donor card.  </P> <P> "In retrospect, that's the point at which I should have realized things had  gotten out of control," McElhinney told the Tampa Tribune.  </P> <P> He underwent tests and the surgery was done under local anesthesia May 31. The  splinter -- about half an inch long and extremely thin -- was removed.  </P> <P> The hospital bill was $3,177.11. The pathologists asked for $197.35. The  anesthesiologists billed him $400.  </P> <P> "I haven't even gotten the surgeon's bill yet. They'll probably deliver that in  a Brink's truck," McElhinney said.  </P> <P> His insurer paid $1,906.27 of the $3,177.11 bill. He is supposed to pay $476,  and the rest will be waived.  </P> <P> McElhinney said he and his neighbors have a solution for the next splinter.  </P> <P> "We've invested in a fancy first-aid kit," he said. "We'll do the surgery  ourselves."  </P></p>

The state news agency Jampress said the effort, which will  include joint projects between the two nations, was the focus of  discussions between Jamaica's foreign affairs and foreign trade  minister, Dr. Paul Robertson and Guyana's trade, investment, and  tourism minister, Michael Shree Chan, this week.    Robertson pledged Jamaica's support for Guyana's efforts to  develop trade and investment promotion mechanisms and to  cooperate in other areas of natural interest in the economic  sphere.    The two ministers discussed the long-standing relations  between their two nations and economic measures being undertaken  to liberalise their economics and gear them to meet the  challenges of the new global economy.</p>

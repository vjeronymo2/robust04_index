			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / People: Smith New Court Sir Terence Heiser, previously permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment, has picked up another non-executive position, this time at stockbrokers Smith New Court. John Gunn, former chief executive of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, stepped down in January after six years on the board. Hardly in the mould of the traditional Whitehall mandarin, Sir Terence, who was raised on a council estate and left school at 16, has been much in demand since retiring last June. He is also on the board of Abbey National, J Sainsbury and Wessex Water. SNC's chief executive Michael Marks, who is presumably something of a meritocrat himself, having joined Smith at 17 in 1959, says he and his fellow directors were 'hugely impressed with (Heiser's) wider business perspective'. They would also value his 'general guidance on personnel issues' - rather than anything as strictly 'commercial' as helping the corporate finance department win more privatisation mandates. Meanwhile, Sir Terence, who has not so far found it necessary to join a London club, will perhaps find the atmosphere at SNC, which has never quite shaken off its barrow-boy image, rather more exciting than at some of its stuffier rivals. At the same time SNC announced four executive additions to the board: Marc Edwards, 44, in charge of Smith New Court Carl Marks' equity activity in the US; John Evernden, 46, director of UK sales trading; Philip Jolowicz, legal director of Smith New Court Securities; and Richard Margolis, managing director, corporate finance, of Smith New Court Far East in Hong Kong.</p>

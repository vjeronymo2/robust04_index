			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery status divides MPs A CAMPAIGN to make the government change its proposals for a national lottery and to give the organisation charitable status won backing from Tory MPs yesterday. Sir Ivan Lawrence, Conservative chairman of the home affairs select committee, was among Tories who endorse the National Lottery Campaign. The campaigners argue that charitable status will make the national lottery independent of government and ensure its exemption from taxation. The Department of Heritage argues that there would be no benefits from charitable status. The campaign was accompanied by signs of friction among Labour MPs, who were concerned to oppose the lottery proposals. About 110 Labour MPs have written to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, calling on the opposition party to oppose the national lottery bill when it is debated in the Commons on Monday. The letter says the national lottery will affect jobs in the football pools industry and that 'there can be legitimate principled reasons for objecting to raising revenue through government-sponsored gambling.' The letter also says local charities may be affected, However, Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, supported the National Lottery Campaign. 'People are going to be more enthusiastic about buying tickets if the money is going into charitable purposes, rather than being siphoned off by the Treasury,' he said.</p>

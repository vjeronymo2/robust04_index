			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA abandons flotation after demand collapses GPA Group, the privately-owned aircraft leasing company, yesterday was forced to abort its planned global flotation valued at about Dollars 800m (Pounds 432m) because of poor demand from institutional investors. The move early yesterday, only hours before the shares were due to begin trading, followed an acrimonious meeting in London between the Irish-based company and its advisers. Institutional demand in the US collapsed at the last moment, affecting demand for shares from institutions in London and Dublin, where the flotation was due to take place. By yesterday morning there was demand - mainly from retail investors in international markets - for only 53m out of the 85m shares the company hoped to sell. The planned offer had been raised from 80m some 10 days earlier. The rapid collapse of institutional demand, particularly in the US, was blamed on falling world markets and concerns about the airline industry. At yesterday's meeting between the company and its advisers, Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder, implored his investment bankers to try to save the flotation by lowering the price or issuing fewer shares. But the advisers, which include Nomura as global co-ordinator, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch in the US, and J. Henry Schroder Wagg in the UK, felt the issue could not go ahead without sufficient institutional demand. One said yesterday: 'We had a duty to the retail investors as well as to the company.' The flotation had been expected to raise around Dollars 800m in new money, valuing the group at Dollars 2.4bn. Without the new money the group will have to rely increasingly on debt finance. GPA has to pay for Dollars 12bn of firm orders from manufacturers for aircraft by the end of the decade. Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's chief executive, said: 'We have never been dependent on one source of finance and will continue to tap other areas.' He added that the group was likely to go back to the debt market where it recently raised Dollars 500m in a public bond issue. But the aborted flotation may have an impact on GPA's ability to raise new finance. The group's credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, was yesterday placed under review for possible downgrading. Moody's Investors Service, the other big US agency, is already reviewing GPA for downgrading. Moody yesterday warned: 'The aborted flotation is a negative factor.' Mr Foley said that a downgrading would be 'unwelcome' but predicted that it would not significantly affect the group's ability to raise new finance. At a meeting at its London office yesterday GPA's senior executives discussed the possibility of trying to go public again sometime in the future. GPA's orders account for more than 10 per cent of the outstanding orders from the world's biggest civil aircraft makers, Boeing and Airbus Industrie. The failure of the flotation could further disrupt the order books of world aircraft manufacturers. The share prices of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas of the US, Fokker of the Netherlands and stakeholders in the Airbus consortium, such as British Aerospace, all fell yesterday.

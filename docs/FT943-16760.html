			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading It was a slack session in the derivatives markets, and although the stock index future contract provided a confident lead for equities, trading volume was not heavy, writes Terry Byland. The September contract held at a small premium to the cash market, although the closing quotation of 2,945 on September showed a discount of about 4 to fair value. In traded options, the picture was much the same. Overall volume dipped to 22,311 contracts from more than 29,000 on Thursday. Only 8,622 contracts were recorded in the FT-SE option.</p>

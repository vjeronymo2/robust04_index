			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ayaz Khasanov: "TOTs Intends To Come to Power"] </F>   [Text] As IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA has reported, the cochairmen  of the Tatar Social Center [TOTs] held a news conference in  Kazan on the subject "The Future of the National Movement."    One of the leaders of the TOTs, Maro Shamsutdinov,  acquainted  journalists with the decisions of the last plenum of the social  center, which openly proclaimed a new objective--coming to  power. Moreover, it was emphasized: only by constitutional  means. Up to the present TOTs had not put forth such a slogan,  and has generally not engaged in the struggle for power. It  also endeavored to resolve questions of the federalization of  Russia. In the opinion of the organizers of the news conference  there has been no real federalism in the Russian Federation,  there is none, and it seems there will not be any; it has  remained a unitary state.    For this reason, the leaders of the national movement cannot  concur with the fact of the signing of the treaty between  Tatarstan and Russia, which preserves the centralized  distribution of a planned economy. But what is dangerous, TOTs  members think, is not the treaty, which actually is more of a  political nature, but intergovernmental agreements that are  reinforced by the treaty. TOTs cannot agree at all with the 12  agreements in which the direct implementation of the treaty is  laid out. And it does not share the position of the Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, which remains silent when  the executive organs sign an interstate treaty. Early elections  to parliament, TOTs representatives think, are simply necessary  inasmuch as the legislative organ is not coping with its  functions.    In the opinion of the leaders of the national movement, the  formation of a new personnel policy plays a not unimportant  role. Up to now this question is being resolved in secrecy. But  what is needed, first and foremost, is the appointment of heads  of administration through elections. Otherwise they will remain  officials with unlimited authority over which there is no  control.    The TOTs leaders intend also to engage in the destatization  of the mass media, as they are convinced that they are strictly  subordinated today to the power structures.    Regarding the question of a split in the leadership of the  national movement, Rashat Safin informed journalists of the  decision of the plenum to declare a moratorium on criticism and  fighting among themselves. "For the sake of the nation's  interests, we must be together, especially since our views have  never differed on the main thing."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero de Leon] </F>   [Text] Haitian Charge d'Affaires George Barberousse has  informed LA PRENSA that the policy of Haiti's constitutional  government is that any arrangement with the ruling Haitian  military hierarchy must remain within the framework of the  Governors Island Agreement.    Barberousse referred to the exile offer extended by  President  Bill Clinton to the regime headed by Lieutenant General Raoul  Cedras, whereby its leaders would not be victimized or  prosecuted.    The diplomat explained that President Jean-Bernard Aristide  has agreed to grant political amnesty, but that common crimes  would not be covered by this. He stressed that common crimes  must be resolved under common law.    With regard to whether or not Haiti's powerful economic  class  has offered the military hierarchy bribes to leave the country,  Barberousse said that although this sector would be interested  in stabilizing the situation, it is also a fact that they  sponsored the coup d'etat against Aristide. If they were to  make such an arrangement, it would be among themselves, he said.    Regarding the problem posed by the 150 undocumented Haitians  who are currently in Panama, and to whom the Directorate of  Immigration has granted permits to remain in Panama while their  return to Port-au-Prince is being arranged, Barberousse said the  embassy has not yet received an official statement from the  Panamanian Government.    Nevertheless, Barberousse expressed concern over the  situation this group of Haitians will face. They will not be  allowed to work and will not be provided with the means to  survive. Under these conditions, he said, they could easily  become the victims of crime.    Barberousse commented on one aspect of the remarks made by  Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez, who banned the Haitians  from practicing voodoo.    "I believe there is certain evidence of cultural  insensitivity," said the charge d'affaires, who pointed out that  all peoples have their own values, idiosyncrasies, cultures, and  religions, and to deny a people these things is intolerable.  Barberousse defended the Haitian ancestral religion as one of  his people's values, just as Catholicism, Buddhism, and other  religions reflect other values.    It is a religion that is also a way of life and deals with  relations between humans and God; it has positive as well as  negative aspects, and the former outweigh the latter.  Barberousse added that the negative aspects have been exploited  by foreigners who go to Haiti to attempt to resolve their  problems.    Meanwhile, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino  announced yesterday that his office is trying to make  arrangements for the 150 undocumented Haitians to return to  their country on flights coordinated by the national government.    Mulino pointed out that since COPA flights will be suspended  on 26 June, arrangements are being made to schedule two flights  before that date.    "If, for some reason, a group is unable to get seats on the  scheduled COPA flights, we could do what we have done in the  past -- in other words, issue permits for one or two more  flights to return to Haiti those left behind," he said.    According to the foreign minister, this procedure would not  constitute a violation of international laws governing the  matter.    "My interest," Mulino underscored, "is to return these  people  to their country of origin, because in Panama we have enough  unemployment and security problems of our own, and we do not  have the economic capability to maintain all of them, even  though their reasons for fleeing their country are justified."</p>

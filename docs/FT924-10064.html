			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / BA clear to acquire Dan-Air THE WAY was cleared yesterday for the rapid completion of British Airways' takeover of Dan-Air, the UK's oldest independent airline, after the government decided not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The acquisition, for a nominal Pounds 1, was waved through by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in spite of concerns about the reduction in competition. Protests had been made to the Office of Fair Trading by BA's smaller rivals  - Virgin Atlantic Airways, British Midland and Air UK. The decision was announced within hours of Dan-Air's last charter flight, from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, to Gatwick. On Friday, the European Commission's competition authorities said they would not be investigating the deal. BA is taking on just 15, about half, of Dan-Air's scheduled routes. Services on six will be stopped this week, including flights to Jersey, the airline's first scheduled destination in 1956. Mr Heseltine has followed the OFT's recommendation that the public interest would be better served by avoiding an MMC referral. He was particularly concerned about the adverse impact Dan-Air's closure could have on services at Gatwick, where it is the largest operator with a fifth of the slots. BA had made it clear that it would drop the deal, which involves it taking on Pounds 35m of Dan-Air's liabilities, if the merger were referred to the MMC or bound by conditions. Mr David James, chairman of Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, Dan-Air's parent, had stressed that the alternative was receivership. BA's rivals continued to protest yesterday. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, called the DTI decision 'astonishing', describing it as 'harmful to the consumer and the interests of the majority of Britain's airlines'. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, called for an urgent review of competition policy. The DTI acknowledged the merger would allow BA to strengthen its position at Gatwick and Heathrow. Nevertheless, it said it remained committed to encouraging competition. BA said the addition of Dan-Air's routes would take its share of Gatwick slots from 11 to 21 per cent, but leave its 37 per cent share at Heathrow largely unchanged.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.Sd."-signed report: "Delamuraz Visits Moscow"] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- At the beginning of a two-day  visit to Moscow, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, head of the Chief  Department of Public Economy, on Thursday [12 May] signed a  bilateral trade and economic agreement with Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin in Moscow that contains important  regulations of the GATT Agreement. Trade between Switzerland and  Russia currently stands at a relatively low level. The  agreement will replace similar agreements that were concluded  with the Soviet Union. In a news conference after the signing,  Delamuraz made it clear that the agreement laid down the most  important GATT principles for trade with Russia -- first of all,  the principle of the most-favored-nation status and  non-discrimination. Of major importance are also the  regulations on improving the protection of the rights to  intellectual property and the definition of those areas of  economic cooperation that should be intensified with priority.    In a news conference, Delamuraz, who has been accompanied to  Moscow by leading representatives of the Swiss business, made a  point in stating that he was the first representative of the  Swiss Government to visit the new Russia. He described as most  successful and constructive his talks with Chernomyrdin. In  answering a question regarding the banker's discretion,  Delamuraz emphasized that Switzerland would try to strictly  apply the money laundering article. In connection with the  issue of aid, he referred to the East Europe credit, a sizable  part of which will go to the CIS countries.    Before his departure, Delamuraz described trade between  Switzerland and Russia as insufficient and far beneath what was  possible -- and quite rightly so: In 1993, the official trade  volume was 700 million Swiss francs, which is hardly worth  mentioning compared to the 2 billion francs in the Soviet era  (which was not a lot at the time either). Imports to  Switzerland reached 376 million francs, while exports to Russia  stood at 327 million francs. Compared with the previous year,  this means an increase by 12 percent (imports) and 23 percent  (exports); however, in view of the almost insignificantly low  overall trade volume, these figures are hardly relevant. The  5-percent growth in imports in the first quarter of 1994 and the  80-percent increase in exports should not be overestimated,  either, particularly since the Russian Government currently  appears to be greatly inclined to deter potential investors with  a flood of regulations and duties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic conducted by Sergey Sidorov </F> in Moscow; date not given: "There Are Forces which Regard  Stability in the Balkans as Disadvantageous, According to  Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic"]    [Text] Radovan Karadzic is the president of the Serb  Republic -- a state proclaimed on part of the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina after its declaration of independence without  the Serb community's agreement. Under this former Yugoslav  republic's constitution all questions with a republic-wide  dimension were to be tackled solely on the basis of consensus  among the three Bosnian communities -- Serbs, Muslims, and  Croats.    Karadzic is a psychiatrist by profession. He is also a poet  and a winner of the Sholokhov literary prize.    [Sidorov] Mr. Karadzic, during more than two years of war in  Bosnia talks to end it have been held in various dimensions, as  it were. Many prominent politicians, including Western figures,  even claim that the international community's more active  intervention has merely prolonged the war and increased the  suffering of innocent people. What is your forecast: Will the  plan proposed by the Washington contact group mark a decisive  step toward peace or will the next round of discussions about  peace end in a renewed escalation of the war?    [Karadzic] I do consider that the international community is  largely to blame for the unleashing of this war. And if that  community or, more precisely, the United States decides that it  is time to end it, then a solution acceptable to the Serb side  will not fail to emerge. If, however, they decide that it is  not yet time and that the war should continue, they will propose  a remedy that spells catastrophe for the Serbs in Bosnia. In  that case the war will continue, and the Serbs will appear to be  to blame. We have, alas, had to contend with just such a  technique of interference.    During my present visit to Moscow I have been able to see  for  myself yet again that Russia sincerely wants stability in the  Balkans and is ready to support us in our striving for peace.  If the United States built its relations with the Muslim side  in the same way, there would already be peace in Bosnia. But  the Americans are urging the Muslims to seize the greater part  of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are encouraging  the Muslim leadership in its ambitions and its desire to  dominate in the Balkans. This means in effect continuing this  exhausting war. A war by one side to secure an Islamic  bridgehead in Europe, while on our side it is a war for  survival....    [Sidorov] How are relations shaping up inside the  Croat-Muslim Federation, created through U.S. mediation? Does  it have any prospects?    [Karadzic] We do not think it has any serious prospects.  The deep-rooted conflicts between the Muslims and the Catholic  Croats constitute a separate and pretty extensive topic. The  Americans have restored the Croat-Muslim alliance not so much to  reconcile the Croats and the Muslims, who have fought each other  over the last year, as to recreate an anti-Serb front. I am,  unfortunately, forced to say that some American circles are  openly working for war. The war is now in their hands, and they  refuse to let peace and stability prevail in the Balkans....    [Sidorov] Tell me, have you come to that standpoint  recently or have you held it since the start of the war?    [Karadzic] We had our suspicions. But over time we became  convinced of the following: As soon as the sides came close to  a common solution, the Americans, who had started to pretend  that they wholly supported the Muslims, would enter the "game."  And that would prompt the Muslims to continue the war.    [Sidorov] If that is so, what, in your view, might be the  next step by the United States on this plane?    [Karadzic] As I have already said, an attempt to impose  terms unacceptable -- absolutely unacceptable -- to the Serbs.  If the United States does actually want peace, then at least  half of its initiatives will be acceptable to us and half not.  Let the terms be equally disadvantageous to the Muslims and to  us.    [Sidorov] As far as I recall, the Washington contact group's  plan, that is to say the division of territory between the Serb  community and the Croat-Muslim Federation in a 49:51 ratio, does  not suit the Serb side, as you hold 70 percent of the territory.    [Karadzic] That formula does indeed fail to suit us because  prior to the war 64 percent of the territory belonged to Serbs.  We did not start the war and we have not lost it either. Why,  then, should the Serbs have less territory after the war than  before? Yet we are ready to surrender something in the interests  of peace. We will surrender the 10 percent of the territory  which is not ours. We are holding on to it at the moment in the  interests of defense. But we are also ready to surrender Serb  land provided there is peace. To break the deadlock we could  even accept the 49:51 formula provided that an exchange of  territory -- quality for quantity -- subsequently took place.    [Sidorov] Does that mean that it is far from being a matter  of numbers and percentages?    [Karadzic] It is not just a matter of them. Discussion  should also proceed in terms of the viability of the states  formed in place of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course,  the conditions for viability are important not just for the  Croat-Muslim state but also for ours. After all, if the  international community were to accept the arguments of one side  and ignore those of the other, that would be an obvious  injustice. Our terms are as follows: the mouth of the Una  river, a sufficiently wide corridor in the Posavina, and the  rejection of any border along the Drina river, which was a  symbol of the Serbs' separation (half the Serbs were in the  Austro-Hungarian empire and half in Serbia). In addition, we  need our part of Sarajevo and access to the sea.    [Sidorov] But you know that these terms are regarded as  unacceptable by the Muslim side.    [Karadzic] No, I consider that if they were in favor of  peace they would accept these terms, as they pose no threat to  the security of their state.    [Sidorov] How do you now rate the state of contacts with  Moscow?    [Karadzic] We feel that Russia -- particularly the people --  understands us. The government is in a difficult position.  Russia cannot afford to get into conflict with the West, but we  do not want that either. For us Moscow's objectivity is the  main thing. The Russian government really can play the role of  mediator, as it understands both us and the Muslims.  Unfortunately, the United States demonstrates a different  approach.    We have no right to ask Russia to intercede in everything,  but it is in Russia's own interests to see that the Serbs always  have been and remain the country's most consistent allies in the  Balkans. And we are, after all, now paying the price for our  traditional friendship with Russia. By dividing the Serb people  and weakening their state system the West has always sought to  weaken Russia in some hypothetical conflict. The double  standards which Western countries and Turkey are demonstrating  in Balkan affairs -- in their assessments, say, of the actions  of the Croat-Muslim and Serb sides -- cannot be explained any  other way.    [Sidorov] What do you think of the intentions of your  opponents -- the leaders of the Muslim community? Do you  concede that they are sincere in their desire for peace for  their own people?    [Karadzic] We are convinced, unfortunately, that our  opponents are essentially not seeking peace. These are  politicians of a fundamentalist, pro-Iranian persuasion. They  have already promised their coreligionists in Sudan and Iran  that they will take all of Bosnia-Herzegovina under their  control and become a member of the Islamic Conference. This  despite the fact that there are fewer Muslims than Christians in  Bosnia.... Not so long ago Nijaz Durakovic, former leader of  the Bosnian Communists, said that the Bosnian Muslims would be  the best terrorists among the Islamic revolutionaries because  they look like Europeans. Alija Izetbegovic expressed himself  in similar vein a few days ago.    I have to say that we are facing the first threat of Islamic  fundamentalism in Europe -- the first but not the last.  Europeans' heads will continue to ache from what has happened  in Bosnia.</p>

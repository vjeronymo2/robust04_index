			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continuing frost fears drive US coffee futures to 8-year highs New York coffee futures powered to eight-year highs yesterday after the close of the London market as traders continued to react to fears about frost damage to the Brazilian crop. The gains were pared back in late trading but analysts thought the bull run still had farther to go. 'Prices are sky-rocketing,' said Ms Judy Ganes, softs analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, as the September arabica futures contract at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange reached Dollars 2 a pound. In London trading, the market had revived to finish close to its high point of the day. The September futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange rose by Dollars 97 a tonne to close at Dollars 3,100 a tonne. Trading in London was cautious and the market lost some of its early gains by midday. But it was pushed higher again by a strong opening to the New York trading day. Estimates of the damage to Brazil's coffee trees put losses for the 1995-96 crop at between 5m and 9m bags out of a total expected harvest of 24m bags - a quarter of world output. 'That's a pretty hefty sum,' said Ms Ganes. She said that few roasting companies were willing to part with beans, which was forcing many speculators to scramble to cover short positions. Traders fear a shortfall in coffee output while consumption continues to rise. Ms Ganes believes that New York prices could easily go up by another 50 cents a pound as a result of the recent damage, with nearby London futures reaching Dollars 3,600 to Dollars 3,700 a tonne. Latin American producers meet in Brasilia next week, where they could discuss releasing stocks to help alleviate the market tightness. But producer-held stocks are at their lowest level for 14 years, according to trading house ED &amp; F. Man, with 65 per cent of them in the hands of Brazil and Colombia.</p>

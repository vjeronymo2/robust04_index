			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Afghanistan factions take civilian hostages WARRING Sunni and Shia Moslem guerrilla factions took hundreds of civilians hostage in Kabul with Afghanistan's new coalition government apparently powerless to stop them, witnesses said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kabul. The prisoners were singled out in the street at gunpoint on the basis of their ethnic group and taken to makeshift detention centres scattered around the city, the witnesses said. Fighters of the Sunni Moslem and mainly ethnic Pashtun Ittehad-i-Islami group took away ethnic Hazaras, who are Shia Moslems, while the rival Hezb-i-Wahdat group seized Pashtuns. Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, hardline leader of the powerful Hezb-i-Islami party, threatened to intervene in the fighting and accused the ruling coalition, which he has not joined, of being weak and incompetent. The crumbling coalition is struggling to impose its authority over about 10 main factions which moved into the city in April after 14 years of civil war.</p>

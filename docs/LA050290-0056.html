			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH WILL MEET WITH LITHUANIA'S PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> President Bush will meet with Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene on  Thursday to get a firsthand report on conditions in the rebel Baltic republic,  but the White House said Tuesday that the talks do not mean a change in U.S.  policy.  </P> <P> "The President feels that it's important to get an authoritative readout and  description of events in Lithuania. . . . He is meeting with her as an  acknowledged and freely elected representative of the Lithuanian people,"  rather than as "prime minister of an independent Lithuania," spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Although the United States has never accepted the Soviet Union's forcible  annexation of Lithuania in 1940, Bush has refused to recognize the breakaway  government, which declared independence March 11.  </P> <P> Bush has said that he does not want to undermine Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev and possibly set back the rise of democracy in Eastern Europe.  </P></p>

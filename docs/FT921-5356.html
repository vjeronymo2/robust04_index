			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP abused stamp of authority - Commons Business MR Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, agreed to repay Pounds 1,406 for postage on 4,559 House of Commons envelopes used as part of a survey, it emerged last night. Mr Maude's Conservative constituency association in North Warwickshire made the repayment after the serjeant at arms said the pre-paid mailing facilities should not have been used for the letters. Mr Maude's office said the payment covered stationery, envelopes and first-class postage used for correspondence sent as part of a survey of constituents' concerns on local and national issues. The first disclosure about the incident last March came when Mr Don Dixon, Labour's deputy chief whip, raised the matter on a point of order in the Commons last night. He claimed that Mr Maude had 'abused the system' for the use of Commons facilities. Meanwhile, Mr Robin Squire the Conservative MP for Hornchurch also protested to Mr Bernard Weatherill Speaker about Hornchurch Labour party documents found beside a Commons photocopier. Mr Weatherill told Mr Squire to report the matter to the serjeant at arms.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Environmental investments beyond Finland's  borders have proved effective, says the Foreign Policy Institute  in a report. Environmental cooperation with Estonia and Karelia  has advanced well, but has been badly limping with Russia.  Jaana Kannninen reports:    [Kanninen] Finland has pursued environmental cooperation as  part of its foreign policy for three years. There have been  joint projects with four separate regions: Estonia, St.  Petersburg, Karelia, and Kola. It became clear during these  years that it is easier for a small unit to work with another  small unit. The projects in Estonia and Karelia have got off  the ground well.    [Begin unidentified voice recording] The problem areas are  the Murmansk area, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad region  where the scale is large. If one looks at this problem of  scale, Finland's possibility of having more effective input in  environmental cooperation in this region lies in seeking  international cooperation partners, thereby sharing the burden.  For instance, if we join the European Union, one central  possibility is to direct the European Union's environment  policies into these areas and that way acquire more resources.  [end recording]    [Kanninen] Tapani Vaahtoranta, director of the Foreign  Policy  Institute, says that there are other reasons too for the failure  in Russia. The Russians have criticized the Finns for being too  selfish. According to them, the Finns want, above all, to boost  their exports of environmental technology. Surprise has also  been expressed that the Finns want to support what locals regard  as secondary issues. Why is it so important to clean St.  Petersburg's effluent when the inhabitants in the region do not  even have proper drinking water, people have asked.    One problem is that, with the exception of the Republic of  Karelia, Russia's decisions are still made in Moscow, far from  the problems. The Foreign Policy Institute suggests that  Finland could start supporting local citizens' organizations.  [passage omitted]    The effluent purification plant in Tallinn is the most  advanced of the cooperation projects. The renovation of the  power stations in Narva and the installation of desulphurization  equipment in Kostamus are also in the construction stage. In  the past three years, 110 million markkas of Finnish money has  been spent on near-area cooperation, a sum that has been  worthwhile spending beyond the border, even for selfish reasons,  says director Tapani Vaahtoranta.

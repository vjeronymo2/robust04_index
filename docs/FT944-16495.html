			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth (Political Notebook): Conference focuses on a view of Europe from Planet Portillo Yesterday the Tory conference took a day trip from Bournemouth to Planet Portillo. It had a wonderful time. Europe isn't working, the young employment secretary declared. No, he wasn't just referring to the dole queues. Stop the rot from Brussels, he shouted, as the hall achieved lift-off. Huge cheers. In that strange European world, he warned the excited representatives, people thought carrots were fruit and bananas should be straight. Britain would have no part of it. Ecstatic ovation. It was a skilful performance. Mr Portillo has long been judged by the Tory right at Westminster as the natural heir to Lady Thatcher. Now he is beginning to build the constituency he needs among the party activists. Waving the Union flag among the retired colonels and the young militants who have come to dominate these annual gatherings is the surest way to win their hearts. They crave certainty. Mr Portillo gave them it. He was rewarded with an ovation lasting four minutes. Mr Michael Heseltine, for a generation the unchallenged master of conference showmanship, managed only two. Mr Portillo was careful not to overstep the bounds of collective cabinet responsibility. In his tirade against the social chapter he evoked Mr John Major's 'act of statesmanship' in negotiating Britain's opt-out. He disassociated himself from Mr Norman Lamont's apocalyptic warning that Britain may be forced to withdraw from Europe to preserve its nationhood. To have done otherwise would have invited dismissal from the cabinet. But Mr Portillo's tone was enough to stake out his ground. He does not favour withdrawal now from the European Union. But he thinks the government should not go an inch further along the path of integration - whatever the consequences. He would probably agree with the colleague who described Mr Lamont's intervention as follows: right message, wrong messenger, wrong time. It seems scarcely credible that it was only four years ago - in this same conference hall - that Mr Heseltine prepared for the challenge that would destroy Lady Thatcher; or that his most potent weapon then was her anti-Europeanism. Yesterday Mr Heseltine stuck to his principles and warned that disengagement from Europe would be an abject surrender of Britain's national interest. The representatives did not enjoy the return to the earth. They sat on their hands. Mr Major must have looked on in despair. The minefield of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of European integration lies between his government and the general election due by 1997. Alongside Mr Portillo stand Mr Peter Lilley, Mr John Redwood, Mr Michael Howard and perhaps a dozen junior ministers. Behind Mr Portillo stand up to 100 Tory MPs. The pro-European wing is stronger. Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Douglas Hurd do not share Mr Heseltine's instinctive view that Britain should participate in all projects European. But they and the majority around the cabinet table are equally clear that there is no future in opting out. Mr Hurd - busy crafting a British agenda for 1996 which has a chance of holding the Tories together without being laughed at in Paris and Bonn - is reviewing his original intention to quit the Foreign Office next year. He has just turned down the post of Nato secretary-general in spite of pressure from the Alliance's four biggest members. He has not discussed his future with the prime minister since then. But friends have the impression that if Mr Major asked him to stay, then Mr Hurd might well agree. Like most others in the cabinet, Mr Hurd sees no possibility in the short-term of Britain joining a single currency. It would break the party. The electorate would not have it. But the foreign secretary is certain that Britain must be in the vanguard of efforts to build a common European security policy. Once an admirer of Mr Portillo's sharp intellect, Mr Hurd is now dismissive of the notion that it would be possible now to abandon the political dimension of Europe. In his mind the 'variable geometry' approach to the next stage of European integration would allow Britain to opt out, if necessary, from Emu while remaining on the inside track on defence and foreign policy. Mr Major's position is more complicated. In spite of the sceptical edge to his recent pronouncements on the future of Europe he has not joined the ranks of the antis. He is irritated by the grand strategies of Mr Jacques Delors and other European visionaries. He finds them patronising. But he regards Mr Portillo's view of the world as self-serving and lacking an understanding of history. He is searching for a formula which will allow him to take the bulk of the Tory party - and of the much wider electorate - with him. If he succeeds he will be assured a place in history as the prime minister who saved the Conservative party. It is far from certain he will succeed. Beyond the German elections this weekend and the French presidential race next summer it is easy to see another Franco-German drive towards European unity. The Conservative party is being held together only by the fact that it wants to remain in government. But seen from Planet Portillo, any further transfer of sovereignty to Brussels would be too high a price for victory at the general election.</p>

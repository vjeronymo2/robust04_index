			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANT AIDS ARMENIAN REFUGEE PROGRAM  </P> <P> Fueled with $385,000 in federal funds, a Glendale-based Armenian relief  organization this week initiated a program to help Soviet Armenian refugees  adjust to life in the United States.  </P> <P> The program at the Armenian Relief Society, a private, nonprofit aid group with  a large Glendale chapter, includes acculturation classes and counseling for  refugees. It is one of three to be run by Armenian organizations in Los Angeles  County with $1.2 million allocated by the Los Angeles County Department of  Health and Human Services.  </P> <P> Under terms of the grant, society social workers will counsel the refugees both  in private and in group sessions, visit their homes and conduct English  classes, job training programs and help place them in jobs, said Sarkis  Ghazarian, director of social services at the Armenian Relief Service in  Glendale.  </P> <P> The money was awarded to the county by the federal government in July, but  allocation of the funds was contingent on approval by the County Board of  Supervisors. The board approved the awards Tuesday.  </P> <P> County refugee relief coordinator Joan Pinchuk called the federal money "a drop  in the bucket, but hopefully a pretty big drop." She applied for the money on  behalf of the Armenian organizations more than a year ago to deal with an  influx of more than 31,000 Armenian emigres who have settled in the county  since October, 1987.  </P> <P> Soviet Armenian refugees have been settling in Glendale at the rate of about  250 a month since early this year, Ghazarian said. They are joining friends and  relatives in an Armenian community that is spread throughout Glendale,  Hollywood and parts of the San Gabriel Valley. It is the largest Armenian  community in the world outside of Soviet Armenia.  </P> <P> Social workers who deal with the refugees say that refugee resettlement  programs are inadequate to help the Soviet Armenians, who generally leave the  Soviet Union so fast that they have no time to learn about the United States  before they come to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Unlike most refugees, who are taught about life in the United States while they  wait in refugee camps to get their visas for months and often years, those  leaving Soviet Armenia often arrive in Los Angeles less than two weeks after  they leave their homeland, U. S. State Department officials said.  </P> <P> Their rapid relocation, while a blessing to the emigres and to their relatives  here, means that they arrive in Los Angeles with few job skills and little idea  of how to do things such as drive to work and pay rent, Ghazarian said.  </P> <P> "They are leaving their country so fast they have no time to understand what  they're getting into," Ghazarian said. "They don't have time to take in the  vast cultural changes they are about to make."  </P> <P> The grant money is expected to be available to the relief groups by the end of  November. But the acculturation program that it funds officially began  Wednesday.  </P> <P> In addition to the money received by the Armenian Relief Society under terms of  the grant, the Armenian Evangelical Social Service Center in Hollywood will  receive $385,000 and the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church, also in  Hollywood, will receive $250,000.  </P> <P> For the Armenian Relief Society, the money represents an opportunity to more  than double the services that the organization provides, Ghazarian said. The  $385,000 in federal funding is more than half as large as the Glendale  chapter's budget this year -- about $500,000, Ghazarian said.  </P> <P> Relief Society officials have already transferred four social workers from the  agency's other offices in the county to get the Glendale acculturation program  off the ground, Ghazarian said. He said he also plans to hire four more social  workers within two weeks.  </P> <P> Many of the emigres are forced into drastic career changes because of their  lack of English language skills, and some Armenian women who were housewives in  the Soviet Union enter the job market for the first time after settling in the  United States, Ghazarian said. The result is a grab bag of problems that has  been keeping the short-staffed service open late at night for more than a year.  </P> <P> "It's both exciting and also a challenge to provide the services that we know  are needed," Ghazarian said. "All we can do now is do our best to help our  clients and the agencies that serve them."  </P></p>

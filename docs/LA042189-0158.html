			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Iowa House voted 51 to 47 to approve legalized river boat gambling,  rejecting claims that it is inviting organized crime to the nation's heartland.  The measure now goes to Gov. Terry E. Branstad, who has said he will approve  it. Under the bill, the state's Racing Commission would issue gambling licenses  for boats on rivers and streams, and would determine the number. The bill  legalizes small stakes gambling, with a $5 limit per bet and a $200 nightly  loss limit.  </P></p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Markets cautious after Fed rate rise World financial markets reacted cautiously yesterday to Tuesday's interest rate increase by the US Federal Reserve. While a rise in US rates was no surprise, the increase of three-quarters of a percentage point was larger than had been expected. Markets appeared to be divided between those investors who took heart from the US central bank's firm line on inflation and those who feared that further rate increases would follow. 'The rhetoric in the Fed statement had a clear-cut message that Mr Greenspan (the Fed chairman) is worried about economic strength and that interest rates must rise if inflation is to be contained,' said Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at broker James Capel. 'Greenspan's not ahead of the curve but he's catching up with the game.' Hopes that the rate rise would lead to a favourable reappraisal of US financial assets were largely disappointed. The dollar, which had rallied a pfennig against the D-Mark on Tuesday, failed to make further progress in European trading yesterday. In New York, even news of a lower than expected rise in consumer inflation in October gave scant boost to equities or bonds in early trading. The benchmark 30 year Treasury bond fell nearly two thirds of point by 4pm New York time, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied late in the afternoon, closed up 18.84 points at 3845. While markets welcome the Fed's anti-inflationary stance, there is also concern that the six rises in interest rates this year will eventually slow the pace of corporate earnings growth. European equity markets were weaker but held on to most of Tuesday's gains, made before news of the rate rise. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index rose 11.1 points to 3,146.5, helped by news of lower than expected underlying inflation and a public sector surplus in October. Gilts also moved ahead as heavy volume in short sterling futures indicated that markets had reduced their expectations of the extent of future UK interest rate rises. In Paris, the CAC-40 fell just over 0.2 per cent, while in Milan, the Comit index dropped by around 0.5 per cent. The German market was closed. Lex, Page 22</p>

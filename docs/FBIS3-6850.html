The Fijian government broke off diplomatic relations with  India in 1989 after it accused Indian diplomatic staff of  becoming involved in Fijian politics.    "The government will seek to resume full diplomatic  relations  with India, and will invite the government of India to re-open  its embassy in Fiji as soon as is practicable," Ratu Mara said.    The president also announced that the government of Prime  Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, returned to power in general elections  last month, would seek to regain Fiji's seat in the Commonwealth.    "Fiji sincerely hopes that this can be achieved in the not  too distant future," Ratu Mara said.    Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth lapsed in 1987 after  brigadier Rabuka, now prime minister, led two military coups  against an ethnic Indian-dominated government and declared Fiji  a republic.    The Indian government has said it would block a Fijian  application for membership unless the country changed its  constitution, which favours ethnic Fijians.    Under the 1990 constitution, ethnic Indians are restricted  to  27 seats in the 70-seat House of Representatives and are barred  from holding the prime ministership.    Ratu Mara said the government considered a review of the  constitution to be a priority.    "Government will move quickly to reconvene the expanded  cabinet subcommittee on the constitution so as to resume  consultations on the next phase in the review process," he told  parliament.    The review would seek agreement on the composition and  membership of an independent commission to undertake a review.  The constitution provided for a review within seven years.    "History has created for us a society from which we cannot  run away, but it is our responsibility as leaders to build upon  this inheritance and create a viable and vibrant nation of which  we can all be proud," Ratu Mara said.    A Ministry of Information spokesman said diplomatic ties  with  India were originally broken off because "they were seen to be  meddling in our political affairs and were told to go, but they  are now welcome to come back.</p>

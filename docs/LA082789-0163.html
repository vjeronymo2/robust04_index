			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HE PUT MARYLAND RACING BACK ON TRACK AND TOOK IT TO THE WINNER'S CIRCLE  </P> <P> Death, which waits on no man, since not the time nor the hour is printed on a  schedule, took Frank De Francis away before the letter ever arrived. The  message was written last Wednesday, mailed the next morning and he died the  following afternoon in the Miami Heart Institute. Considering the distance  involved, it's presumed he didn't live long enough for it to be processed and  delivered.  </P> <P> It was a personal note, as anyone might write to an ill friend, an attempt to  provide a lift, a smile but, mostly, to give him a moment away from the  monotony of a hospital routine when a few lines might brighten an otherwise  taxing day of looking at the same walls and an unending procession of doctors  and nurses monitoring pulse and heartbeat.  </P> <P> De Francis didn't need a letter from a sportswriter in Baltimore to underline  what he was able to achieve in putting Maryland racing on his back and carrying  it to the winner's circle. This was a man of extraordinary intelligence,  inspiration and imagination. No individual came close to accomplishing what he  was able to do for the health and welfare of the industry.  </P> <P> Baltimore and Maryland have never known a promoter like him. He spent millions  to improve the Pimlico and Laurel race courses. The tracks were put in  first-rate physical condition and the facilities around them, where the public  was to be received, had a clean, impeccable, inviting appearance.  </P> <P> The fans and the horsemen received a respect that had never been provided by  managements in the past. This, more than anything else, separated De Francis  from the rest of the parade. He believed the customer deserved the best that  he, as a host, could provide. "That's the least we can do," he once remarked.  Yet he did much more.  </P> <P> All sports are in need of people with ideas and leadership. De Francis was a  throwback to some of the outstanding promoters, such as George Preston Marshall  in football and Bill Veeck and Larry MacPhail in baseball. He went all-out in  aggressive pursuit for whatever it was he wanted to accomplish, but he went in  totally prepared and immersed in the subject of his discussion.  </P> <P> De Francis conveyed a quality of sincerity and, when he began to talk, either  to the governor, the state legislature, a horse owner or a hot-walker, there  was little doubt his persuasive ability was going to find him securing the  result he sought. Members of the General Assembly, on guard, would see De  Francis scheduled for another appearance before a committee.  </P> <P> They knew he wanted something and would brace for his arrival, telling each  other they were not going to give in to whatever it was he was intending to  request. But, once he started working with the magic of his words, offering  logical reasons for supporting the action he proposed and building to an  eloquent, effective conclusion, the members would capitulate.  </P> <P> De Francis articulated with an ability that is rare. He convinced the lawmakers  racing needed tax relief. Others had voiced the same protestation in the past,  ad infinitum, but their cries were never heard. Yet with De Francis, it was  different. After his presentation, he went away with a cut from 6 percent to 3  percent in the state's betting take and then, only a year later, 1984, got it  reduced again to 0.75 percent.  </P> <P> He awarded worthwhile gifts to fans attending the races, which was a change  because public perception was the tracks were only in a habit of taking -- and  weren't interested in giving. De Francis' booming oratory won friends and  influenced legislators. He had been an international lawyer but also a  racetrack enthusiast, owning horses and enjoying the fire and the action so he  knew his subject intimately.  </P> <P> King Leatherbury, Laurel's leading trainer, realizes what De Francis meant to  the business. "He did things that could have been done before, but nobody did  them," said Leatherbury with a tone of thankful respect. The bottom line is the  health and growth of Maryland racing, under De Francis' charge, caught the  attention of the nation.  </P> <P> De Francis reveled in the success of the Preakness and believed the 1989 event  was perhaps the greatest in history from a competitive standpoint as Sunday  Silence won by a nose over Easy Goer in an all-out battle through the stretch.  </P> <P> As with any man who is strong-willed and has the courage of his convictions, De  Francis' intensity and his demands created a share of detractors. But he paid  them no mind, even moving some of them, including those with ability, out of  the way. It was a show he originated, orchestrated and directed.  </P> <P> Now back, briefly, to the letter he never received. It was another lesson that  again demonstrates the danger in putting off would-be good intentions until  it's too late, or after-the-fact. De Francis died at age 62 of heart failure  and Tuesday some of his friends attended a private, by-invitation-only,  memorial service in the chapel at Loyola College in Baltimore conducted by his  good friend, the Rev. Joseph Sellinger.  </P> <P> The De Francis era was exciting and took Maryland racing to heights it had  never known. He, indeed, was an individual of exceptional talent, a man able to  conceive of new ideas and implement them, regardless of cost or inherent  problems the procrastinators or opponents placed in front of him.  </P> <P> The final letter, the one he didn't live to read, is expected back at any time.  It'll be marked, regrettably, with the poignant notation: Return To Sender.  </P></p>

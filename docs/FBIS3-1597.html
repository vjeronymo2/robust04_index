He answered reporters'  questions about the international and regional situation and  China's relations with South Asian nations.    Replying to a question on the idea of a nuclear-free zone in  South Asia, Qian Qichen pointed out: The domestic situations in  most South Asian countries are stabilizing. The relations among  countries in the region have been improving, and regional  cooperation is also being developed. However, there are still  some destabilizing factors in South Asia. There are still some  differences among the countries of the region. He said: China  supports the proposition of a South Asia nuclear-free zone.  China also hopes that an arms race would not occur in the  region. An arms race will not benefit peace and stability in  the region.    On Sino-Indian relations, Qian Qichen said: Since the  normalization of Sino-Indian relations, we have been satisfied  with the development of bilateral relations. We hold that the  development of Sino-Indian relations should by no means affect  China's friendly cooperation with other countries in the region.  We hope that the development of Sino-Indian relations will aid  the development of China's cooperative relations with South Asia  as a whole.    Qian Qichen emphasized: Tibet is an inalienable part of  China's territory, and the Indian Government has more than once  openly acknowledged this fact. China hopes that India will  handle some existing questions in accordance with this principle.    As regards the Kashmir issue, Qian Qichen said: China's  policy on the issue remains unchanged. China hopes that India  and Pakistan can resolve the problem through friendly and  peaceful negotiations in accordance with the United Nation's  resolutions and the relevant agreements reached between the two  countries.</p>

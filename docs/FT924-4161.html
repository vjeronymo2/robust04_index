			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Futures drift lower DISAPPOINTMENT over the lack of interest in a big gilts auction overflowed into the short sterling market yesterday. However, an increasing number of dealers have already closed their positions ahead of the Christmas break and much of the business was technical, writes Peter John. At the opening, the sterling contract for March delivery was squeezed to its high of 90.44. Then it was realised that the Pounds 2.5bn auction of gilts was only covered 1.26 times and the contract was sold down to 93.35. The auction interest was particularly disappointing because the gilts were partly-paid. One trader asked; 'If people don't want a partly paid stock that is free of tax to overseas funding what do they want?' One interpretation was that growing realisation of the extent of forthcoming UK borrowing requirements were deterring overseas buyers. The March contract, which has now moved decisively into the lead position over December closed 7 points lower at 93.35 with some 14,200 contracts traded, low compared with the previous two days. CIBC, the Canadian bank, is a seller arguing that the yield differential between March and September is, at seven basis points, too narrow and should widen to around 25 basis points. Meanwhile, the Bank of England said it expected a money market liquidity shortage of around Pounds 500m. Among the main factors affecting the position, the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands drained Pounds 685m from the system while a rise in note circulation removed some Pounds 150m and bankers' balances below target took out some Pounds 50m. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions were expected to add some Pounds 365m. The clearing banks declined to take up the early offer of assistance feeling that at 6 per cent the overnight rates offered better value. By the afternoon, overnight money had firmed to seven per cent and the central bank provided Pounds 256m of assistance, buying Pounds 216m of band one bank bills at 6 7/8 per cent and Pounds 40m of band two bank bills at the same rate. The Bank provided Pounds 25m in late assistance but the help came too late for most of the clearers and there was still around Pounds 400m of the revised Pounds 700m forecast shortage that was not taken up.</p>

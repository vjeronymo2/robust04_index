			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, 13 May, BNS -- Lithuanian Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius on Thursday [12 May] named five candidates  for ministers of economics, forestry, environment protection,  culture, and education.    The candidacies were reportedly submitted to President  Algirdas Brazauskas for consideration.    The premier proposed the social and economic policy adviser  to the president, Aleksandras Vasiliauskas, to fill the vacant  post of economics minister, and nominated the director of the  Dubrava Forestry Research Institute, Albertas Vasiliauskas, for  the post of forestry minister.    Three other nominations are related to the law on  government,  which is likely to be adopted next week. The government law  provides for 18 ministries instead of the present 16.    Slezevicius proposed the deputy director general of the  Environment Protection Department, Bronius Bradauskas, to head  the new Environment Protection Ministry.    According to the law on government, the Ministry of  Education  and Culture would be divided into two separate ministries.  Dainius Trinkunas, who now heads the ministry, announced his  intention to resign. The director general of the Vilnius  Philharmonic, Gintautas Kevisas, was nominated for minister of  culture. The post of education minister has been offered to the  head of the Pedagogics and Psychology Department of the Kaunas  Physical Culture Institute, Kestutis Miskinis.</p>

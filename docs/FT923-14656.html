			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Predators who are fearful of the 'black holes' of recession - Andrew Taylor on the reasons behind the lack of merger activity in the hard-hit construction industry WHEN businesses have been struggling to keep their heads above water as much as UK construction companies you would expect to find predators circling, eager to snap up their weakened rivals and consolidate their position in the market. Yet it is hard to identify the potential sharks in a sea where so many companies have been sunk by one of the worst recessions the industry has experienced. The truth is that very few have the strength or the will to pursue acquisitions or even strategic shareholdings as a prelude to a possible bid. Forecasts published last week by the National Economic Development Office revealed that housebuilding and property development remain deeply in recession while UK contracting output is expected to decline by a further 6.5 per cent this year following a 9 per cent fall last year. Large companies such as Costain, Taylor Woodrow, Tarmac and Wimpey, which in previous generations might have been considered predators, are instead selling off peripheral businesses in a bid to raise cash to reduce their large borrowings. Costain has been accused of selling off part of the crown jewels following its decision to float off part of its profitable Australian coal mining interests. Wimpey has sold its offshore engineering and waste management businesses which it had hoped would cushion it against cyclical falls in the construction market. These sales, however, are small by comparison with the much larger rationalisation which many in the industry believe must take place if there is not to be an increase in company failures. The UK construction sector is highly fragmented with an estimated 200,000 companies generating a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 40bn. Although the vast majority are small firms employing less than ten people, there are still a great number of large and medium sized public companies whose shares are widely owned and easily accessible on the stock market. Shares of contractors have plummeted since the late 1980s, making them even more vulnerable to a possible takeover. Costain's share price of 41p compares with a peak of 223p early last year while Tarmac, the name most linked with a possible bid, has fallen from a 1991 peak of 283p to 93 1/2 p. Taylor Woodrow shares have fallen from 289p to 85p. Despite all of this mergers, whether hostile or agreed, have been thin on the ground. The reason can be found in the depth of the recession which Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, describes as 'the worst for more than 50 years.' Groups able to finance a hostile bid are fearful that there may be further disasters hidden away in the balance sheets of badly-performing companies. There is much talk of the danger of 'black holes' waiting to suck in successful predators. Continental European companies which bought stakes in British companies in the late 1980s at the height of the market either have had their fingers burned or have turned their investment attention eastwards to former communist controlled countries such as eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. The biggest takeover to hit the sector during the recession came from Redland, Europe's biggest roof tile manufacture which earlier this year acquired rival UK brickmaker, aggregates and tile manufacturer, Steetley, after a contested bid worth more than Pounds 600m. Most mergers have been agreed. These have included Tilbury Group, which last year joined forces with fellow contractor and developer RM Douglas; Hanson, the large UK and US industrial conglomerate which rescued the financially troubled Beazer group for Pounds 351m; while Raine Industries this year paid Pounds 28.5m to acquire Walter Lawrence, a housebuilder and contractor. But even agreed bids can produce problems. Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group has so far declined to make a second payment of Pounds 54m to shareholders of Davy Corporation which it acquired last year. The second tranche is dependent upon Trafalgar receiving payment for the Emerald Producer oil production platform which cost Davy its independence. Some moves have been costly. Taylor Woodrow and Raine both incurred losses on stakes bought in YJ Lovell, the contractor and property developer which earlier this year was forced to renegotiate its financial arrangements with its banks after breaching its loan covenants. Hochtief, the West German contractor, acquired a 25 per cent stake in Rush &amp; Tompkins in the 1980s only to see the British construction and property company go into receivership in 1990. It cannot be through lack of interest that purchases have dried up. Only a few years ago, when UK construction share prices were at their peak, contractors were queueing up to make hostile bids and acquire strategic shareholdings. Before YJ Lovell fell on hard times, it mounted an abortive bid for Higgs &amp; Hill. Lilley Group similarly failed to win control of Tilbury. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O) briefly acquired a strategic stake in Taylor Woodrow. Trafalgar House similarly bought and sold a stake in Costain. Beazer before its rescue by Hanson was one of Britain's most acquisitive construction groups until it made one purchase too many and bought the Koppers aggregates business in the US. The outlook for orders and the parlous financial state of many of the companies in the industry suggest that failures will increase unless an orderly rationalisation takes place. Contractors which currently are winning at neutral or loss-making margins will feel the pain even worse when building material and labour costs start to rise. Merger activity therefore is expected to rise during the next 18 months. The question is who has got the cash and the will to make acquisitions. It will take a steady nerve and confidence that there will eventually be light at the end of of the tunnel.</p>

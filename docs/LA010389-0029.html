			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, in an address in San Juan at the start of his  second term, called for a plebiscite to give Puerto Ricans a choice of three  alternatives: statehood, independence or more autonomy by expanding the present  commonwealth status, granted in 1952. In a 1967 plebiscite, residents voted for  more autonomy within the commonwealth, but it was never granted. The  commonwealth agreement confirms Puerto Rico's exemption from U.S. income taxes  and provides for a locally elected governor. But other U.S. laws apply to  Puerto Rico. Residents may not vote for President, have no senators and their  only congressional representative is a resident commissioner who can vote in  committee but not on the floor.  </P></p>

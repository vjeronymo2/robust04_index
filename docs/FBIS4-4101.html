			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 27 (AFP)--Governor Chris Patten  confirmed Wednesday that Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong  Kong, has refused to accept an invitation to see him when he  returns to the territory this weekend for the first time in 28  months. Patten added, however, that his door remains wide open  for talks with Lu, who heads the Chinese government's Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office, despite the shrill Sino-British row  over greater democracy in the British colony which reverts to  China in 1997.    Lu has avoided coming to Hong Kong since January 1992, in a  pointed reminder to London of Beijing's contempt for Patten's  decision to press ahead with pre-1997 electoral reforms without  China's blessing. "Today, director Lu Ping has written to say  that his schedule is so busy in Hong Kong that he won't on this  occasion be able to visit and to have discussions," Patten told  local reporters. However, the governor -- who last met Lu in  Beijing in late 1992 -- added that the tone of Lu's message  appeared to suggest that a meeting might yet be possible at some  later date.    "I'm prepared to cross any street, open any door, shake any  hand and talk to anyone if it's in the interests of Hong Kong,"  the governor added.    Lu will be in Hong Kong for next week's introduction of Bank  of China banknotes in the territory, and for meetings of two  sub-groups of the Preliminary Working Committee, a  Beijing-appointed body that is paving the way for the resumption  of Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Lu is also to make a major  speech to Hong Kong businessmen next Friday.</p>

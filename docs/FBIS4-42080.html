			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`enn'-attributed report: "Rexrodt Warns Against Panic Over </F> Eko-Stahl Privatization"]    [Text] Berlin, 29 May -- Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt has warned against an outbreak of panic in connection  with the planned privatization of the Eko-Stahl steel plant in  Eisenhuettenstadt. The government will continue to support this  vital industry, he said during the weekend. The Trust Agency is  making good progress in its effort to find a buyer. The point  is now to find new markets for Eko-Stahl's products and  guarantee it a secure future.    Rexrodt said his ministry was in close touch with the  European Commission in Brussels to enable Eko-Stahl to be  modernized and privatized as quickly as possible. The Economics  Ministry will answer all European Commission questions regarding  the Italian Riva Group's abandonment of its bid to take over  Eko-Stahl, and other questions regarding privatization.    Trust Agency spokesman Wolf Schoede said that the Trust  Agency will continue efforts toward a rapid privatization, thus  contradicting earlier statements whereby the government would  not put Eko-Stahl up for sale during the next parliamentary term  of office.    According to Schode, Eko-Stahl is "on the way to  modernization." With a private investor, the steel plant could  be led toward a new economic growth. Eko-Stahl must not be  condemned to a situation where, as a state enterprise, it is  forced to compete ever more harshly against private industry.  Unless it gains strategic partners, Eko-Stahl is doomed in any  case, said Scvhoede. The European Union will hardly grant funds  for Eko-Stahl's modernization if the government maintains its  grasp on the firm for the next four years.    Following the Riva pullout, the Trust Agency is seeking a  new  investor for Eko-Stahl. Of the German steel plants,  Krupp/Hoesch and Preussag have already said no. Only Thyssen  continues to be interested in a share in Eko-Stahl, provided  other investors also take out a share. As a result, French  steel producers are also being approached to see if they are  interested a in a share in Eko-Stahl. A particularly  controversial project is the planned construction of a rolling  mill costing 1 billion German marks for the purpose of  converting Eko-Stahl into a self-contained steel plant. In  order to fulfill the requirements of the European Commission, a  buyer would probably have to purchase Riva's production quotas,  because the Italian steel producer, at its Hennigsdorf plant, is  the only steel facility in eastern Germany with the appropriate  warm-production capacity. Apparently, other steel plants are  only prepared to continue the cold-steel rolling process in  Eko-Stahl, whereby 1,000 of the present 3,000 jobs could be  preserved.</p>

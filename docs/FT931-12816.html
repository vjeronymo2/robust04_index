			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE may reach 7,000 by end of decade says BZW THE FT-SE 100 index could reach the 7,000 level by the end of the decade, said Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Economics &amp; Strategy, yesterday. At the launch of the BZW Equity-Gilt Study, Mr Hughes said he expected equities to continue to outperform gilts and cash over the next few years. However, the gap between returns would narrow. BZW's long-term data shows gross real returns from equities of 7.3 per cent per annum, from gilts of 1.16 per cent per annum and from treasury bills of 1.04 per cent per annum. Over the next few years, BZW is looking towards real returns of about 6.5 per cent on equities and 3.5 per cent on gilts. This narrowing of the gap will be caused, says BZW, by lower real dividend growth and by lower rates of inflation than occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. The research shows that 6 per cent is a pivotal figure for inflation. When inflation is below that level equity prices outperform house prices; above that level the reverse is the case. The BZW study is of little comfort for a government trying to fund a large budget deficit through gilt sales. The firm constructed a series of optimal portfolios for investors, from those who wished for minimum risk to those seeking the maximum return. At the cautious end, almost all the portfolio should be in cash, with just 2.4 per cent in gilts. At the high-risk return, 100 per cent should be in equities. Gilts did not figure in any of the medium-risk portfolios.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro </F> to the opening session of the 10th legislature at the National  Assembly in Managua -- live]    [Text] Mr. President of the National Assembly, Messrs.  members of the Board of Directors and representatives of the  National Assembly, Messrs. members of the branches of  government, Messrs. cabinet members, Messrs. members of the  diplomatic corps, special guests, Nicaraguans:    In addressing this new legislature today, 10 January 1994, I  wish to submit this annual report to the nation by officially  closing the first three years of my constitutional mandate and  opening the doors to the last three years -- the second half of  this democratic government, which the Nicaraguan people decided  should be headed by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.    In the past three years we have worked to overcome the harsh  reality I found on 25 February 1990, represented by a destroyed  and defeated Nicaragua; with dead people who should never have  died in war; with mutilated victims who should never have  suffered their misfortune; and with a bombed, sabotaged, and  simply abandoned infrastructure with an economy greatly weakened  by hyperinflation.    We are ending a three-year period which had a very difficult  starting point, very different from what I, as president, would  have liked to find. It was a reality I could never have  imagined, but I decided to face it with a deep sense of historic  and patriotic responsibility to save my people from greater  suffering. We believed that only with peace and hard work would  we be able to overcome whole decades of deterioration.    We are ending three years dedicated to putting the house in  order, to clean, and to prepare the land that was full of  resentment and hatred and damage caused by physical destruction  and economic distortions. They have been three years dedicated  to sowing the seeds of reconciliation, dialogue, and concerted  efforts. We have been sowing the seeds of a healthy economy,  free of deceit and illusions. We have been sowing the seeds of  public freedoms and political pluralism. We have spent three  years taking care of the seedling, preventing it from being  destroyed by the numerous enemies who are afraid of anything  that smells like life itself and the future.    We are ending a tough period which in the past year brought  us serious difficulties with a poor harvest adversely affected  by a severe rainy season and disadvantageous price conditions  for our coffee. We also had to deal with rearmed groups from  both sides which resisted joining civilian life and who attacked  us with kidnappings in the countryside and the city. We had to  face attacks in important cities that left death, pain, and  losses. Nicaraguans who love peace and freedom do not share  these actions.    That is why I think 1993 tested our democratic commitment  and  our determination to build a new Nicaragua. Despite great  difficulties, we promoted the country's reactivation of  solidarity, which I initiated last 10 January, when with great  confidence and trust I invited you -- honorable representatives,  your political parties, associations, labor unions, churches,  and everyone -- to promote economic growth in favor of the poor.  In 1993, we sowed the country's reactivation. This will allow  us to harvest an economic growth of approximately 4 percent in  1994, based on an encouraging growth of 20 percent in  agriculture activities and 10 percent in fishing activities.    Although it is true that there is a lot to be done, we  should be happy to have attained the best rice, bean, corn,  soybean, and peanut harvests in the history of our country. We  also had a coffee harvest that surpassed 1 million quintals  which is the basis to guarantee that the reactivation of coffee  in Nicaragua has no way back.    In 1993, we sowed solidarity with new social programs to  support the unemployed in the rural and urban sectors. More  children attended school and more youths went to training  centers. In 1994, this will allow for the harvesting of greater  stability and greater community participation in the solution of  the grave problems we still have to face.    In 1993, we also promoted the dialogue like in no other year  of my government. It was basically promoted among the political  parties.    We made substantial progress in the solution of property  problems by issuing land titles and making compensation  payments. We hope that these specific steps will allow us to  harvest greater tolerance, greater consensus, and greater  commitment from all with democracy and the de jure system in  1994.    In addition to working for reactivation, solidarity, and  dialogue in 1993, we also worked to end, once and for all, the  political opportunities and moral pretexts of the armed groups  that insisted on their mistaken attitude. We reached our goal  based on a just combination of forgiveness and amnesty with the  firmness of the Public Force.    Thus, 1993 has been representative of the first half of my  presidential mandate: a period of sowing, working, sacrifice,  and struggling so that in the second half -- without ever  thinking that we can rest -- we can begin reaping the fruits of  the patient sowing season, a time of heroic sacrifices.    Today, we begin the next three years of my government  convinced that we will devote our time to reaping the fruits of  the great effort we have been making. It is an effort that was  shared by all, an effort that will continue in the future  because we are certain that we sowed peace, democracy, and  development. No one can prevent us from legitimately enjoying  our daily work.    In 1994, we will increase economic growth by sowing the land  to guarantee a GNP for 1995. We will increase economic growth  by using better our resources from the sea and promoting the  fishing industry to increase its production. We will increase  economic growth by reactivating the construction, mining, and  tourism sectors to create more jobs and promote economic  activity, as well as to create greater confidence in our common  future.    In 1994, we will increase credit volumes for production by  31  percent. More importantly, we will guarantee that this  financing will reach the hands of 25,000 new clients to increase  the number of beneficiaries by 47 percent compared to the 1993  figure.    To do this, we will have special credits for coffee renewal,  cattle breeding and development, tourism, and industrial  reconversion, as well as unconventional credit programs for  small producers in the rural and urban sectors. This will be  done through an expansion in the Program To Support the  Micro-Enterprise, PANIC [Progama de Apoyo a la Micro-Empresa].  With this program, we will create and strengthen managerial and  technical programs for unconventional credit institutions to  promote good policies to channel financial resources and  guarantee the democratization of credit, thus allowing small  rural and urban businessmen to gain access to it.    With PANIC, we will also promote the implementation of  specific projects and programs to support the microenterprise in  an effort to increase their productivity and competitiveness.  Thus, we will also increase the revenues of small producers in  rural and urban areas.    Along with the loans, we will promote public investment,  which is a product of the fiscal adjustment efforts we have been  carrying out since I took office. Thanks to international  cooperation, we are now able to provide the public investment  plan with more funds, which will mean a 40 percent increase over  last year; this will allow us to create more jobs for the  unemployed.    As part of this program and as a result of the reactivation  of the Housing Bank, we are beginning an ambitious program to  build housing throughout the country. This program will begin  to yield results this year by meeting the housing needs of large  sectors of our society. In 1994 we hope to build some 7,000  homes in 26 cities throughout the country. A large number of  private construction companies will participate in this project,  which will in turn generate many new jobs in all 26 cities.    In 1994 we will also continue working to resolve the land  ownership problem. We will issue property deeds for 203,000  manzanas that will benefit 9,000 household, who already have  their plots but are waiting for the legal papers. These 203,000  manzanas added to the 140,000 manzanas whose deeds my government  has already issued draw us closer to the set goal. Through the  next three years we should conclude issuing deeds for 1 million  manzanas, which will benefit our farmers.    In addition to issuing deeds for agricultural plots, we will  continue working in the urban sector by issuing approximately  25,000 new OOT [Office for the Territorial Organization]  solutions to the legal owners of urban lots acknowledged by Law  No. 86. These 25,000 solutions, added to the 26,000 [word  indistinct] already issued, will draw us closer to the 90,000  requests received. I expect to meet this goal by 1995. Next year  we will begin issuing the land deeds for these lots; the  families that will benefit deserve this.    We will also make progress this year with the review of  4,200  homes that were acquired through Law No. 85. This year we want  to solve the 10,200 [property ownership] cases pending. Of  these cases, 6,000 have been reviewed and 4,300 requests have  been approved -- in principle -- in favor of the legitimate  beneficiaries. [figures as heard]    Parallel to the issuance of agrarian titles and solvencies  to new land and house owners, my government will step up the  compensation process by issuing bonds to all those whose  properties were unfairly confiscated in the last decade and who  were not able to get their properties back -- for any of the  reasons stipulated in the government program.    The bond compensation system has been in effect 10 months  and  it has proved that, aside from receiving the international  community's recognition, it is an efficient means to restore  patrimonial losses. Bonds amounting to 630 million cordobas have  been issued and accepted as settlement to numerous applications  for compensation and more than 150 million cordobas in  transactions have been carried out. This represents 24 percent  of the issued bonds. These bonds have been used to purchase  assets owned by the state -- including enterprises, farms,  shares, commercial modules, land, and industrial and farm  equipment and spare parts.    We will continue to issue bonds in 1994. These bonds will  continue to receive strong and solid support with the offer of  state-owned assets and real estate that may be purchased with  bonds. Bonds may also be used to pay debts owed to state banks  and to purchase 40 percent of the telephone company's shares.  This sale will allow us to gather at an earlier date -- through  weekly public auctions -- certificates whose owners wish to  voluntarily negotiate them in exchange for cash.    I wish to reassert today that my government is firmly  determined to guarantee an offer of assets, as well as  mechanisms to use the bonds, in 1994. This will allow the  reinstatement of their true financial value. We will manage to  repair -- in a better way -- the patrimonial damage sustained by  people whose properties have been confiscated in the measure  that they manage to wait for the best opportunity to convert  their bonds.    Credits will be used to support production activities,  public  investment programs, and solutions to the land ownership  problem. Two more contributions will be made for training  programs and the transfer of agricultural technology to small  producers of basic grains, and to repair the first 180 km of  roads in production areas, within the REMACAR [expansion  unknown] Program. The former will be handled by the new  Institute of Agrarian and Livestock Technology [Insta], which  begins its work in January with more than 600 technicians and  workers; and the latter, the roads, will be handled by the  Ministry of Construction and Transportation, which shall repair  a total of 700 km during the second phase of my term, within  this same program.    Credit and production, public investment and employment,  issuance of land titles and compensation, training and road  repairs -- all these are factors that should allow us to  strengthen peace, democracy, and development in 1994.    We have the [words indistinct] confirm the existence of a  new  geothermal source in our country -- in the Malpaisillo zone.  This brings us great hope for the nation's geothermal  development and the beginning of a major tourism activity in  Montelimar and certain zones of Granada, Masaya, Carazo, Rivas,  and Rio San Juan. This will offer numerous opportunities to the  Nicaraguan economy.    Nonetheless, my commitment does not end with the (?gold) of  recovery. It is in solidarity with the poorest, the unemployed,  and those affected by natural phenomena. In 1993 the  implementation of a community participation (?structure) yielded  97 development committees in an equal number of municipalities  so that these groups could present the social needs of their  communities to the presidency of the Republic in an orderly  fashion. In this manner, I complied with what I spoke about one  year ago in this same hall when I said that participation with  solidarity would be one of the most important social policy  bases.    In 1994 we are going to strengthen the participation of the  citizens even more, particularly in the rural areas, so that  those who receive the benefits are the ones who will exercise  their social [word indistinct] and will watch over the  development and maintenance of the social works that this  government has launched.    With regard to employment, it is important to mention that  in  1994 we will use the established bases for working jointly with  the municipal mayoralties in a series of programs that, in  addition to increasing employment, will allow the continuity of  specific works for the benefit of community development. Mayors  throughout the country with various political ideas can attest  to the (?initial) answers my government gave in 1993 to the  unemployment situations in their towns. We did not solve all of  them, but we have prepared the basis for a methodology that in  1994 will duplicate the results for the benefit of more  unemployed people, providing temporary employment to some 24,000  persons each month throughout the nation through the Social  Action Ministry. In addition, the Basic Grains Bank will be  expanded and improved in 1994, and it will become more efficient  so that the farmers who do not have access to formal credit will  receive benefits in this alternate system that supports  production.    We will also continue with the Emergency Fund for Social  Investments, FISE -- strengthened with new donations and  financing -- which will redouble its work for rehabilitating  social infrastructures and provide employment in the 1,000  projects we will implement this year in the 143 municipalities  of the country.    As president, I am convinced that the most important thing  now is to increase production and ensure that the private sector  becomes the motor for our country's development. Nonetheless, I  want to point out that -- as a member of private enterprise -- I  also understand the small coffee producers of La Dahlia, the  small corn producers of Matiguas, and the man who owns a small  workshop or produces our beautiful national crafts. For me, all  of them are members of private enterprise.    In 1994 we will emphasize support for the small producer so  that he will play a more dynamic role in the economic  development of the country, in the same manner as large  producers. We will provide support to the small producer  through the financing that has been approved for this human  network of organizations, cooperatives, nongovernmental  organizations, [word indistinct] circles, poles of development,  and other forms of associations that we have managed to organize  in the last two years.    The foundations have already been established. The year  1994 will be the year we will begin to enjoy the results of this  initiative. During the past few months I had the opportunity to  meet and talk with numerous owners of small farms, cooperative  members, mothers' associations [asociaciones de madres],  development committees, doctors, nurses, teachers, and other  professionals. We inaugurated numerous projects, especially  schools and health centers. All these contacts gave me an  opportunity to learn what the Nicaraguan people really want.  They genuinely want [word indistinct] and work. Before, they  wanted peace and reconciliation.    From as distant a place as Isla de Ometepe to Rio Blanco,  from the community of Cardenas to [word indistinct], from the  city of Juigalpa to Jinotega, from Brooklyn to Chinandega the  message was always the same: Mrs. Chamorro, we are now at  peace, now we need to produce. In listening to these simple  words from a population that does not have access to the media,  cannot voice its concern in the newspapers, and whose faces do  not appear on television newscasts, I have given instructions  for 1994 to be a year of cooperation for production. In this  respect we will jointly be able to cut the level of unemployment  and advance in a parallel direction along with the economic  take-off toward progress with less poverty.    As to education, we plan to continue increasing the number  of  schools twice as fast as the growth rate in the student  population. During 1994, the student population is expected to  increase by 3 percent, but we expect to increase the number of  schools by 6 percent. This means that the 1,000,070 students  registered during 1993 will increase by 63,000 students. The  student population is expected to total 1.123 million during  1994. Nevertheless, we are not satisfied with merely increasing  student registration, we are also seeking to cut the drop-out  rate. That is why we will continue to pay special attention to  the primary grades and give them preferential attention as well  as maintain the glass of milk program. We also plan to  implement teacher improvement programs. In addition, we will  continue to promote education decentralization in order to  ensure that the state will efficiently continue its role of  regulating national education, and for the communities, parents,  and teachers to directly participate in the performance and  management of their respective educational centers. Through this  we expect to encourage full participative democracy and honor  Article 118 of the current political Constitution which calls  for wide-ranging community participation in the education  process.    In the health sector, I must say that following the [words  indistinct] the government program, an improvement in medical  attention to those insured. Today, I can say to all Nicaraguan  workers that the health and medical program which they have been  expecting for the past 15 years has finally become a reality.  The new social security model went into effect at the end of  the past year through duly authorized provisional medical  centers already operating in Granada, Masaya, and Managua. We  expect to extend this type of medical facility throughout the  country. This new form of medical attention for workers, which  the state and the private sector initiative are jointly  operating, is the formula we have developed which allows us to  work and solve the just and simple needs of a population that  contributes and makes payments to the Nicaraguan social security  system. In order for it to improve, be objective, and grow with  [words indistinct], it must be combined with environmental  protection programs, as well as the defense of our national  patrimony.    From the beginning of my administration, I placed special  emphasis on conserving and managing the environment like no  other president had ever attempted in the history of our  country. In spite of the difficult social and economic  challenges we face, we have been analyzing and approving plans  aimed at strengthening viable development and rational  utilization of natural resources and at protecting the  environment.    I have been backed by the municipal governments, peasants,  producers, environmental protection organizations, ecologists,  and the people, and during the past three years of democratic  work we have created environmental awareness at an unprecedented  level in Nicaragua.    Many friendly governments have contributed to this effort  and  specialized international agencies have unselfishly given us  technical assistance and financial support to promote many  ecological development proejcts. The same is true for the  United Nations. We attended the Earth Summit in Brazil to  reaffirm our vocation for peace between man and nature. We are  in favor of conciliating production needs and environmental  protection.    Now, as a specific manifestation of my political will to  back  suitable efforts in favor of the environment, we are  transforming the Environment and Natural Resources Institute,  which this year will celebrate its 15th anniversary, into the  Environment and Natural Resources Ministry.    I trust that with the cooperation of all Nicaraguans we will  be able to responsibly set in motion, with our eyes on the  future, a strategy capable of transforming Nicaragua into an  ecologically ordered, environmentally clean, and economically  prosperous country.    I hope that what we are starting now will help the entire  nation and last forever.    All the plans in favor of production, social solidarity, and  environmental protection are not enough. Justice and strength  must go hand in hand with these plans. Corruption, smuggling,  tax evasion, jewelry thieves, armed bands, and criminals must be  persecuted.    The work of the police and the Army has been very important  in recent times to guarantee the citizens' security, especially  in the countryside. Security has been threatened by armed bands  that unfortunately still exist. Our authorities will always  vigorously fight these bands, which are engaged in pillaging,  attacks, kidnappings, and interrupting harvests. Many policemen  and Army officers and soldiers have died in this struggle to  return peace and security to the people who live in the  Nicaraguan countryside.    Today I want to posthumously acknowledge those who have died  in defense of the law and the Constitution and to fully back the  police and the Army in their pacification endeavor. This year  we will strengthen the Army with a new organic law that should  bolster its professionalization process, depoliticize the  process for electing its officials, and offer guarantees to the  men and women who, with an exalted sense of fatherland, dedicate  their lives to serving the nation.    Force must remain under the influence of justice and this is  why we are going to work as much as we can for a new Supreme  Court of Justice that should begin functioning this year and  increase the level of respect for the law throughout the  national territory.    The appointment of new officials at the Attorney General's  Office, as well as the fact that this week we will send a list  of distinguished professionals to the National Assembly from  which a new comptroller general of the Republic will be chosen,  should be seen as a renewed effort by my government to guarantee  stability, bolster the establishment of a state of law, and  consolidate the full enjoyment of public liberties in our  country -- ideals that have motivated my actions as president  since 1990.    During these years, my government has tirelessly sought to  achieve national stability and harmony between the different  political and social forces so that together we can work for the  common well-being, the strengthening of democracy, the  termination of the last remains of the war, and the best  solutions to overcome the economic crisis.    I have always been aware of the fact that without stability  there is no prospect for economic growth. It is not easy to  govern a country that is still dominated by the sequels of war  and political confrontation. However, agreements have been  reached thanks to good will.    Today, before you, I wish to praise the patriotic efforts  that have produced recent agreements to grant stability to the  operation of this National Assembly and bring stability to  Nicaragua as well. I wish to offer my personal recognition to  all the honorable representatives of the National Assembly who  are here today, and to those who have already stated their  willingness to undertake their parliamentary tasks later, in  order to responsibly assume the popular mandate they received on  25 February 1990.    I am not referring to the voices of those who continue to  insist on confrontation from outside this National Assembly, but  to those who, like you, have made an effort to end the  irrational polarization.    Today we will introduce changes to the composition of the  Board of Directors [of the National Assembly], as I have been  told, and this fills me with joy because this deed conveys a  clear will for understanding. I salute this will and applaud it  along with the people of Nicaragua. Therefore, I must give  special recognition to Dr. Gustavo Tablada Zelaya for his  meritorious work as president of the Legislative corps and for  his detached and patriotic contribution to the normalization of  the National Assembly.    I also recognize the members of the four blocs that broke  the  political inertia and were able to reach these agreements for  the well-being of Nicaragua. The people will know how to  recognize these patriotic contributions to the national  stability. My wish is that all the representatives to this  National Assembly may fully integrate themselves with the tasks  of the legislature that begins today and to give Nicaragua good  laws, which is what Nicaragua needs. To remain outside has no  sense or justification.    I also applaud the initiative aimed at introducing partial  reforms to the Constitution. I will closely follow the  discussion process, and my government, in line with mutual  respect for the state governments' independence, will try to  contribute with its own criteria to enrich the contents of the  reforms.    My aspiration is that the constitutional reforms will be  for the good of strengthening national stability and  institutions, not to weaken or divide them, and so that  democracy will move on a better course and so that democratic  continuity will be guaranteed through honest and fair electoral  processes. I want to state here that my government supports the  changes in the Constitution through partial reforms.    Since the nation's main political forces have been debating  diverse positions and mechanisms to reform or change the  Constitution, I, as president of the Republic, must express my  position on this issue in order to inform the Legislative  Assembly and the community. The program that my government is  obliged to fulfill has the following main objectives, among  others: first, the establishment of a state of law, exercising  full democracy and social justice; second, the reaching of a  national consensus [words indistinct] to strengthen  reconciliation among Nicaraguans and overcome the nation's  overall crisis; third, the creation of a government that is  essentially civilian, republican, democratic, and  representative, based on the nation's unity.    Within those principles and within the framework of the  political, economic, and social reality Nicaragua is  experiencing, the government must unquestionably support all the  corresponding Constitutional reforms and [words indistinct] in  keeping with those objectives and these realities. These  reforms should be conceived with patriotic goals in mind for the  community and the nation's well-being, without taking into  account party interests. These reforms should seek to create a  wise and lasting Constitution that reflects the Nicaraguan  people's true values, ideals, and feelings; it should not just  respond to mere passing situations. We should seek a  Constitution that is the result of a national consensus in which  the people are given the opportunity to express their points of  view as a significant contribution in a participant democracy.  Therefore, these constitutional reforms should be serious, [word  indistinct], and responsible. We cannot ignore the historical  opportunity we are offered to draw up a frank and open  Constitution through public dialogue.    In my opinion, the call to hold elections for a constituent  assembly is not ideal or timely. To dissolve this Legislative  Assembly as some wish means the interruption of the people's  will at a high economic cost that the nation is not in a  position to assume. Some also say that a constituent assembly  must not only totally change the Constitution, it must also end,  ahead of time, the presidential term. This type of criteria does  not represent a willingness for peace but a willingness for  confrontation.    The presidential term ends on 10 January 1997. It is my  intention to hand over my office to whomever is freely elected  in the presidential elections to be held in November 1996.  Respect for the presidential term [words indistinct]  presidential mandate as a result of free elections, is one of  the great contributions that [word indistinct] must make for  Nicaragua's democratization.    We start this year by promising it will be better than last  year; there are good signs of an improving economy. To attempt  to launch the people in a political campaign now is to take away  their right to a break and improvement. The holding of  elections for a constituent assembly would polarize the  community once again, and it would open wounds that still have  not been totally closed. It would hold back economic  reactivation so longed for in these past three years that has  had very high costs and meant big sacrifices. I propose to  these parties or political groups still bent on this idea to  give the people a political truce. Let us respect their right  to a breather and to an opportunity to unite efforts for  progress.    Instead of talking about elections, confrontations, and  political struggles, let us talk about working; let us talk  about production and order; let us talk about fighting  unemployment and reconciling ourselves; let us talk about unity  so that we can overcome the problems we are confronting. The  Nicaraguan people are entitled to have their wishes respected,  to be in a better situation. Violence, as well as the calls for  violence, must cease once and for all.    I invite the Nicaraguan people -- men and women -- to work  together for peace and stability, harmony, democracy, and  progress in our families. We all have a place in this joint  effort to build a new Nicaragua with our faith in God and with a  spirit filled with reconciliation. Thank you, dear friends of  the Legislative Assembly.

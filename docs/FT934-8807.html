			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bad move for transport Sir, There is speculation that in his November Budget the chancellor may seek to introduce VAT at some level on public transport fares. We hope this is false. Much of public transport is perceived to be expensive at the point of use and this is a deterrent to its greater use. To make this perception more of a reality by a directly imposed new tax must be contrary to what we understand is the government's strategy for relieving congestion on the roads. It would be a particularly ill-conceived action should any additional revenue raised from VAT not be 'ring fenced' for the development of improved public transport services and infrastructure. The whole subject of taxes on transport coupled with the possibility in future of road tolls, merits an overall review which this institute will now be undertaking. Richard P Botwood, director general, Chartered Institute of Transport in the UK, 80 Portland Place, London W1N 4DP</p>

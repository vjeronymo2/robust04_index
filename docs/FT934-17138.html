			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: An unfortunate denigration of Franco-German friendship Sir, James Morgan's Saturday column is original and his analysis of European situations is penetrating. It was, therefore, the more disappointing to read him denigrating Franco-German friendship as a complete farce ('As They Say in Europe', September 25). The unworthy and unfunny gibe about the promenade des Anglais reflected the insensitivity the writer brought to this important subject. One should hesitate to describe as farce the good state of a relationship whose deterioration contributed three times in a hundred years to European tragedies. The fact that both sides think it important to proclaim their friendship is in itself reassuring; there may occasionally be elements of exaggeration or insincerity: from what human relationship are they entirely absent? Likewise it would be surprising if motivation on both sides were always entirely pure and free from self-interest. But with all that the fact remains, the French and the Germans, or at least a large majority of those in both countries who think about such matters, wish to get on well with one another. Coming from a Briton, the statement that 'both find the British more interesting than they find each other' looks like distressingly smug Schadenfreude. Perhaps if the British frequently proclaimed their belief in Franco-British, or German-British friendship, preferably both, then those relationships might begin to exist.

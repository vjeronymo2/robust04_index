			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, accompanied by his  cabinet, made statements to the media and said certain details  about national security will possibly be made known today. Let  us listen to the Guatemalan president:    [Begin recording] [De Leon] [Words indistinct] in the same  building, he was my teacher, and was specially recognized as a  jurist. The Guatemalan people appreciated him greatly as a  lawyer. Finally, he was president of the Constitutional Court, a  mandate that was about to end. He did an outstanding job there,  not only during the 25 May incidents, in which we returned to  the institutional and constitutional order that had been broken  by former President Jorge Serrano Elias, but during recent  actions carried out by the court. He recently ruled that the  electoral and political party law was unconstitutional. [Words  indistinct] his actions as head of this court, the highest in  the country in charge of constitutional matters.    It has been a hard blow for me personally. I appreciated him  greatly; we were friends. And from the institutional point of  view, as president I regretted his death from the moment I  learned of it. I was not in the capital but I ordered the  necessary investigations and we hope there is sufficient  evidence to locate the criminals. We do not have the words to  express our sorrow. We cannot understand how it could have  happened to a person who loved peace and freedom for which he  fought.    Once again the Guatemalan family has to deal with an act of  violence. Guatemala is going through difficult moments from the  point of view of citizen's security and the government is  willing to take all the necessary measures to restrain this wave  of violence, which is adversely affecting all social classes. As  we said in the beginning, this is something for which we cannot  find the necessary words to explain [words indistinct] no matter  from where it comes.    [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] We do not know yet. The truth is that [words  indistinct] enough evidence. Today the Government Ministry,  through its experts, will reveal details of the unfortunate  incident. We cannot confirm or rule out anything [words  indistinct].    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] We do not really know what the reason was [words  indistinct]. [end recording]    The president said that up until now, this incident could  not  be described as a political crime, but that at 1600 [2200 GMT]  the Government Ministry will reveal the results of the  preliminary investigation.</p>

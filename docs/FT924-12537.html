			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / EC toxic waste accord is near AGREEMENT is likely at today's EC Environment Council on a new regulation to limit trade in non-radioactive toxic waste, after two years of negotiation. The new rules will prevent EC members from exporting toxic waste to countries outside the Community and the European Free Trade Association, a move designed to protect developing countries from becoming dumping grounds. The rules will also ban imports from non-European developed countries, although developing countries will still be allowed to ship waste to the EC and Efta for treatment. The stumbling block has been the issue of whether EC countries should have the right to ban imports of toxic waste from each other. The right to refuse imports is supported by Britain, which has backed the principle of national self-sufficiency in treating hazardous waste, and by France, which spent the summer in bitter rows over whether it could ban imports of German waste. However, today's council is likely to agree that Luxembourg, Portugal, Greece and Ireland should be allowed to export some waste to other EC countries as they produce too little to dispose of it economically at home. If the council reaches agreement, the EC will be able to ratify the Basle Convention, an international treaty governing trade in hazardous waste which came into force in May. Under the new rules, countries could maintain imports of waste within the EC and Efta. The UK last year imported 44,000 tonnes of hazardous waste, nearly half of it coming from Switzerland and Belgium. The council will also discuss an EC position on the 1987 Montreal Protocol, designed to reduce the emission of gases which could harm the ozone layer.</p>

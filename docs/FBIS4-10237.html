			<p>BFN     [Text] The Coordinating Body of People's Organizations  [Coordination des Organisations Populaires, COP] has reaffirmed  its support for the Governors Island agreement, the only valid  framework to get the country out of the crisis, according to  COP. It thinks the formation of an ad hoc government would just  plunge the country into even more chaos. Let us listen to an  unidentified COP spokesman:    [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] Our  position in COP regarding the ad hoc government that is being  discussed today is that this idea is not viable. It offers  nothing toward resolving the country's crisis. We in COP have  always said there is no solution but the Governors Island  agreement for resolving the country's crisis, because the  Governors Island agreement is an agreement of principle signed  by General Cedras and President Aristide in the presence of the  international community to resolve the country's crisis.    We think that so long as stalling maneuvers are aimed at  preventing the reactivation of the Governors Island agreement,  the country's crisis will never be resolved. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The Rimpac [Rim of the  Pacific] military exercises of the United States, Japan, South  Korea and other countries have come under fire in Burundi and  Mozambique.    The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association said in a statement  that it was an open secret that the U.S., Japan and South Korea  have been building up their tripartite military alliance from  long ago in an attempt to stifle the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, but they revealed its true picture as they  entered into a phase of real action this time. This is very  dangerous and belligerent, added the statement.    Noting that the United States has started a reckless war  game  around the Korean peninsula by instigating its followers under  the pretext of "nuclear suspicion" against the DPRK, thus  rendering the regional situation further strained, the statement  urged an immediate halt to it.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the DPRK in a statement said the United States is becoming all  the more undisguised in its intention to take military action  against Korea on any account through such a joint operation as  Rimpac military exercise.    The statement strongly demanded that the United States  ponder  over what consequences would arise from its adventurous military  action, stop it at once and accept the peace arrangement  proposal of the DPRK.    If the United States take the road of a war of aggression,  ignoring the desire of the Korean people and the world people  for peace, it will face condemnations and destruction, it warned.</p>

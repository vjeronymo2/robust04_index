			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Labour shrugs off SNP threat The Labour party yesterday declared its determination to beat off the challenge from the Scottish National party in the Monklands East by-election, due to take place on June 30 and caused by the death last month of John Smith. Labour has gone for a quick by-election in the constituency, which mainly comprises Airdrie, to the east of Glasgow, in order to try to prevent the campaign by the SNP from gaining momentum. It is defending a majority of 15,712 in what should be a safe seat, but fears the SNP will profit from the bandwagon effect generated by its success in last month's regional elections and its impressive victory this week in the North East Scotland Euro-seat. Yesterday Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, acknowledged that his party had 'an electoral mountain to climb' but that it had the wind at its back and had clambered some way up the hill already. Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said that the SNP could not be 'alternative Tories in the north-east of Scotland and then come down to Airdrie and be alternative socialists. That won't wash here'. The central belt of Scotland is much less promising territory for the SNP than the more rural north-east. However, it has the capacity to pour activists into by-elections and snatch victory, as it did when it won the Glasgow Govan by-election from Labour in 1988. In the regional elections the SNP won one of the two regional council seats in the constituency. It will exploit claims that a small clique of Labour councillors dominates Monklands district council. Labour's candidate is Mrs Helen Liddell, a former secretary of the party in Scotland who then worked for the late Robert Maxwell on the Daily Record, the Scottish subsidiary of Mirror Group Newspapers. The SNP on Monday night chose Mrs Kay Ullrich, a social worker and its deputy defence spokesman, as its candidate. The Tories have selected Mrs Susan Bell, a businesswoman who is vice-president of the Scottish Tory Reform Group. The Liberal Democrat candidate is Mr Stephen Gallagher, an NHS administrator.</p>

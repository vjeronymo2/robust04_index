			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: International Bonds: Warm reception for National &amp; Provincial five-year issue NATIONAL &amp; Provincial, the UK building society, was the latest to cash in on the appetite for sterling paper yesterday as conditions in the swap market improved enough to draw in a floating-rate borrower. Building societies are not flavour of the month in the bond market at the moment, but the pricing of N&amp;P's five-year, Pounds 150m transaction was sufficient to ensure a good reception. The bonds were priced to yield 65 basis points over five-year gilts, and with a steady gilt market tightened in later trading to a yield spread of 62-63 basis points. Banks involved in the issue reported strong demand from investors in the UK and from continental Europe, particularly Germany. N&amp;P's AA3 rating makes it one of the better credits in the building society world, but ratings in the sector generally have been under pressure: Woolwich was downgraded, following Alliance &amp; Leicester, and at least one other major society is on credit watch. The yield spread compared favourably with other similar building society issues, for instance the 60 basis point spread on a five-year Nationwide deal. However, most banks said the pricing was not over-generous, given the possibility of more building society deals following soon. The N&amp;P issue takes the total of Eurosterling bonds issued since the general election to Pounds 2.2bn. The amount would be far greater, but many fixed rate borrowers have stayed away in the hope of lower rates later in the year, while floating rate borrowers have been kept away by a lack of swap opportunities. The adverse conditions in the swap market eased slightly yesterday, though not enough to attract other borrowers. BNDES, Brazil's national development bank, returned to the international bond markets yesterday for the first time since last autumn with a Dollars 100m three-year deal priced to yield 3.7 per cent over US Treasuries. At below 4 per cent, the yield spread is lower than for other recent three-year Brazilian issues. However, banks involved in the transaction said they had little trouble in selling the bonds, given BNDES' good standing. The unrated bank is wholly owned by the Brazilian state, though its borrowings do not carry the state's guarantee.</p>

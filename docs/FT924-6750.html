			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Demerger appraisal curbs ICI CHEMICALS group ICI underperformed the market ahead of publication of a weighty piece of research from Smith New Court which is expected to hit clients' desks this morning. The 90-page document assesses the value of the group in detail and concludes that the planned demerger will leave the constituent parts with a joint value of 950p a share. That estimate is significantly lower than initial forecasts when the demerger was first announced in July. The research document values the chemicals side of the group at 350p a share and the pharmaceuticals side at 600p, giving a total capitalisation of Pounds 6.8bn. Smiths' chemicals team also believes that the demerger will have to be deferred for a year and the company will have to review its dividend policy. Analyst Mr Charles Lambert said; 'On the present evidence the demerger does not appear to offer any initial upside for shareholders.' The team argues that if the demerger does go ahead the chemicals arm will offer better value than the bio-science side which will trade under the new name of Zeneca from January. The stock closed 5 higher at 1037p yesterday. Drama in BT BT shares were enjoying another strong session and trading at 403p, their highest level this year, before the chancellor of the exchequer's statement in the House of Commons that the treasury intended another sale of BT shares next year. BT shares quickly turned down when the news filtered into the market just before the close. As the session ended the stock price settled only a half-pence higher at 396p with turnover accelerating sharply to end at 8m shares. The partly-paid shares were similarly boosted early on, touching 298p but came off equally rapidly to close the day only a penny harder at 292 1/2 p; turnover in the partly-paid was a lowly 3.6m. The goverment's holding in BT amounts to 1.352bn shares, or 21.9 per cent of the equity. When it decided to sell the second tranche of BT shares in 1991 the government said it would not sell more stock until the third and final payment on the second tranche had been paid. This payment falls due on March 3 next year. Although acknowledging that BT shares may fall in the short-term on the prospect of a flood of new shares into the market next year, specialists said there were three good reasons why BT III should go better than BT II. Firstly; after BT III there would be no overhang of government-held stock; secondly BT II was carried out under the threat of a change in government from Conservative to Labour; thirdly much of the regulatory risk is already thought to be in the price. One caveat, however, would be the worry that overseas investors would be more wary of moving heavily into the new shares because of the currency risk inherent in investments in the UK since sterling withdrew from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Thorn upset Shares in both Thorn EMI and W H Smith were hit on recurring worries over the state of trading in the world's music business. Thorn suffered the worst, the shares off 17 at 775p, as a number of brokers took a bearish stance reflecting on new industry figures which suggested that the growth in music sales was faltering in the first three quarters of the year. Mr Jason Crisp at Strauss Turnbull said: 'Thorn bought Virgin at the height of the market and paid too much for it, in what is obviously a declining market.' He reinforced his sell stance and said that the shares would have to fall a further 15 per cent before being attractive. Sentiment was little improved by speculation that sales at Our Price, the WH Smith music and video subsidiary, were weak and current trading sluggish. County NatWest cut its current year profit forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 105m after visiting the group and suggested that the interims in January would show a profits downturn. Smith shares retreated 5 to 453p. Positive comments on current trading from Ladbroke to selected brokers this week sent the shares forward for a second day. They rose 8 to 183p as UBS Phillips and Drew was said to have upgraded the group and County NatWest reinforced its buy recommendation on yield and rating considerations. Union Discount busy Shares in Union Discount, the discount house whose interests include Winterflood Securities, the specialist marketmaking firm, raced up 10 to 71p and prompted the group to disclose that it was involved in 'very preliminary stages' of talks that could lead to a bid for the group. The market immediately focused on Cater Allen, the second-largest of the quoted discount houses and known to have a near-three per cent holding in Union, as a potential bidder for the group. There were also suggestions that a European financial group could be interested in acquiring Union. Cater Allen, whose shares were marginally higher at 381p, is scheduled to reveal interim figures this morning. The BT III flotation news gave a strong push to SG Warburg, which was global co-ordinator to BT II in 1991 and is seen a strong favourite to do thesame job for the third tranche of BT. The life issues surged ahead after strong support from one of the leading UK integrated houses, with Legal &amp; General up 15 at 402p and Prudential 7 higher at 375p. Commercial Union's third quarter figures were well-received and saw the shares add 9 to 573p. Willis Corroon proved a major disappointment to the market with the 32 per cent fall in nine-months profits and a very disappointing post-results meeting triggering a steep slide in the shares which eventually closed 14 off at 174p, the worst individual performance of any Footsie stock. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries lifted 24 to 952p following meeetings between the company and investors this week. It was also suggested that negative reaction this week to a US supreme court decision involving BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp case might been overdone. The insurance side of BAT was further helping shares as the outlook for some insurers lightened slightly. The world's biggest mining group RTZ Corp fell 14 to 604p on talk that a US broker had a line of stock on offer. Wellcome was squeezed 16 higher to 998p on minimal turnover. British Airways rebounded 13 to 261p on continuing heavy turnover of 18m shares. The drinks sector was buoyed by a number of factors, not least of which was a relief factor from Whitbread, whose figures contained none of the feared black holes. Yesterday, they put on 11 to 432p. The sector, and the latter stock in particular, was further strengthened by news that the gaming board had increased the payout from fruit machines. Finally, the afternoon rumour that the Gatt talks had been settled gave a push to Allied Lyons, up 5 at 634p. The retail sales figures gave a shine to selected stores and food stocks. Sainsbury gained 9 1/2 to 487p and Tesco 8 1/2 to 236p in continued busy turnover of 9.4m. Publisher Reed International slipped 7 to 597p in response to a sharp fall in Elsevier on the Amsterdam stock exchange. Ink manufacturer Usher-Walker saw its shares jump 80 to 161p after an announcement of an agreed bid by Sun Chemical Corporation. Thames Television lifted 7 to 186p on strong rumours that an announcement about the financing for the new Channel Five would be made this week. Scottish Television fell 9 to 378p with Smith New Court said to have been sellers. Smiths' media team was up in Scotland talking to institutions. Chemicals company Courtaulds performed well after reporting half-year profits. Analysts were reasssured by the cautiously optimistic statement from the company. The shares ended 19 up at 489p.

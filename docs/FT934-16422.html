			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Newfoundland to privatise power unit NEWFOUNDLAND plans to follow the example of neighbouring Nova Scotia in privatising the Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Hydro Power generating utility in order to ease the province's severe financial pressures. The initial proposal is to sell Newfoundland Hydro to Fortis, a publicly-traded holding company which provides 85 per cent of the island of Newfoundland's power through its distribution subsidiary. Talks with Fortis are expected to take up to six months, but the provincial premier, Mr Clyde Wells, says that if a deal cannot be reached, another privatisation route will be found. Fortis also has interests in telecommunications and a property management unit. Newfoundland Hydro generates most of its power at the Bay d'Espoir hydro plant. The province's plan would effectively merge Newfoundland Hydro with the Fortis distribution company. The merged company would have assets of CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.35bn), capacity of nearly 2,000MW, annual revenues of more than CDollars 700m and more than 2,000 employees. After the merger it would be taken public. Mr Wells, himself a former Fortis chairman, said the new company would still be subject to regulated power rates. He wants to reduce the province's indirect obligations to Newfoundland Hydro, escaping a guarantee of the utility's CDollars 1.4bn debt. Newfoundland Hydro is planning to privatise certain activities to reduce debt. Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest utilities, has considered following a similar path.</p>

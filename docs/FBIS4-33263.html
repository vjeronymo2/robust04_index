			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Attempts to trespass the  residences of the Mexican and French ambassadors and other  reports of similar actions followed the occupation of the  Belgian ambassador's home, which is on its seventh day today.    Three Cubans unsuccessfully tried to break into Mexican  Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias' residence located in the  exclusive neighborhood of Miramar on Monday afternoon, according  unofficial reports.    A similar incident took place on Tuesday when four other  Cubans tried to break into French Ambassador Jean Raphael  Dufour's residence, also located in Miramar, which is west of  Havana. In that incident, security guards arrested two men and  two others fled.    Reports that were later denied of similar incidents in at  least four other missions circulated in newspapers this week  while the residence of the Belgian ambassador, Paul Vermiersch,  continues to be occupied by over 100 Cubans who are trying to  leave the country.    The building is surrounded by police while the authorities  of  both governments are holding talks to achieve a peaceful  evacuation of the house in exchange for a Cuban offer to refrain  from carrying out any reprisals against the asylum seekers.</p>

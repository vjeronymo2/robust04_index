			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Management: Protecting the secretary bird As more about Robert Maxwell's misdeeds and misbehaviour becomes known, everybody is asking: how could it all have happened? Why didn't his accountants, bankers and auditors stand up to him? And what can be done to make it easier to expose business tyrants in the future? A starting point could be to give more support to the company secretary. They are, or should be, privy to all the confidential deliberations and secrets of the board and the company. They are therefore in the best possible place to see malpractice at its very beginning. There is a great deal of ignorance of what the company secretary is or does, and the job description has traditionally been one of the most difficult to write. The secretary is the most senior executive in the company below board level. The secretary's status has changed greatly in the last 100 years. At the end of last century he was considered a mere servant, did what he was told, and had no authority to represent anything at all. In 1948 Parliament recognised him by statute, and that year's Companies Act provided for the first time that every company had to have a secretary. In 1971 Lord Denning treated the secretary as the chief administrative officer of the company, and the Companies Act of 1980 took another step forward in providing that every public company must have a properly qualified secretary, as defined in the Act. Today, the secretary is sometimes thought of as 'the conscience of the company'. Among his responsibilities, which include ensuring compliance with the law, is a duty to guide his board, collectively and individually. Most chairmen and directors do not have to be challenged. But there are exceptions, largely unknown outside a comparatively small circle. They contain the scandals of tomorrow. Company secretaries have mortgages, families and responsibilities. They know that the likely consequence of telling an overpowering chairman that he cannot do what he is proposing to do is the loss of their job. Tyrannical tycoons are, by definition, hirers and firers, not accustomed to being frustrated by employees and easily capable of removing the cause of the obstruction. Nevertheless, the secretary could be in the ideal position to stop, or at least reduce, the possibility of boardroom malpractice. But they do need the kind of legal protection given to directors and auditors. In principle, company directors and auditors can only be removed from their respective positions by a vote of shareholders in general meeting. A proposal to remove either of these officers has to be made to the company concerned by a shareholder, and the company must then give notice to all the other shareholders that such a resolution is to be proposed at an annual or extraordinary general meeting. The protection against removal goes further. Upon receiving notice of a resolution to remove a director or the auditor, the company must send a copy of that notice to the person involved. That person is then allowed to be heard at the meeting in his own defence, and also to circulate to all shareholders written representations on his own behalf, stating his case. This naturally means publicity, These statutory provisions are to safeguard independence. It is not to be supposed that if the law were altered there would be a spate of general meetings to remove secretaries. Indeed, the very opposite would be the case. The mere existence of legal protection would in itself provide the sanction against removal in public, and would give the secretary the security he at present lacks when advising strongly against what he knows or believes to be wrong. The emblem of the Institute of Qualified Company Secretaries is a secretary bird. I suggest that, for the benefit of the business world, it should become a protected species.

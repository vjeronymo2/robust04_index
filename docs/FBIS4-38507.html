			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 20, RIA -- At their meeting today  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin examined in detail the draft federal budget. They agreed  that by the second reading of the draft the State Duma Budget  Committee will work out proposals on increasing allocations to  the defense sphere, chiefly to hi-tech conversion production  processes. Most of the deputies insist that these allocations  be brought to 55 trillion rubles.    "Such reserves exist and there's no need to increase the  debit side of the budget," said Mr. Rybkin, informing the  deputies of his meeting with the Russian president, which lasted  more than an hour. He noted that allocations will also be raised  to servicemen's social needs, education, science, and culture.    According to Mr. Rybkin, the Russian president accepted the  State Duma's amendments to the draft law on the Constitutional  Court but refused to name the supposed candidacies to the  justices' vacancies, since the choice has not yet been made from  the numerous proposals.    Mr. Rybkin said the Russian president backed his proposal to  move the minieconomy agencies that have not yet left the former  State Planning Committee building now occupied by the Duma to  Lubyanskaya Square. There are many vacant premises there, noted  he.</p>

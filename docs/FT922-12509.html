			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Radical reformers gain more time for programme THE Russian parliament yesterday adopted a declaration which allowed the government to claim that it was free to pursue radical economic reforms after a week of confrontation with deputies, writes John Lloyd. 'This declaration gives the government the possibility of acting according to reality, and gives us more time. The question of resignation is now off the agenda,' said Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister. Mr Peter Aven, chairman of the committee on foreign economic relations, said the declaration allowed ministers complete discretion over the timing of measures to soften the blow of the reforms. He added: 'The reality is that the budget cannot afford these measures, and so we cannot do them.' Under the compromise, an earlier demand that a law on the structure and method of appointing the government be produced within three months was preserved. However, it will not need to be implemented until the beginning of December. This gives the president and government until then end of the year to continue on the same course without taking serious account of parliamentary pressure. However, Mr Aven said he expected new ministers would be appointed to the cabinet by the end of the Congress, expected to be on Saturday.</p>

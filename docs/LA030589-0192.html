			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN AM BOMBING;  </P> <P> UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY OF FLIGHT 103  </P> <P> To the ordinary eye, the tiny scrap of material recovered from the rolling  green hills near here looked like any other piece of charred metal.  </P> <P> But to bomb experts searching for clues in the downing of Pan American Flight  103 as it flew over Scotland from London to New York last Dec. 21, the pattern  of pitting and cratering on the metal suggested that it had been directly  exposed to a high-intensity explosion.  </P> <P> Investigators then pinned down -- they won't say exactly how, but their work  relies heavily on computers -- that the metal came from a radio-cassette player  that housed plastic explosives. Having determined that the cassette player had  been carried inside a piece of luggage, they are now trying to identify the  luggage and figure out who checked it onto Flight 103.  </P> <P> If they can, they will have completed an important step in fixing  responsibility for the deaths of the 259 people aboard the flight and 11  citizens of this peaceful Scottish market town, whose name comes from the  Celtic words for "a place of strength."  </P> <P> It is one of the great detective operations of the decade: the inch-by-inch  scouring of 845 square miles of the Scottish countryside by 11,000 police and  others for more than 10,000 fragments from the doomed aircraft; then the  sorting of the wreckage in "Shed No. 3," part of a British army ammunition  depot 18 miles southeast of here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Like Skeleton Dinosaur  </P> <P> Inside the shed, like paleontologists putting together the skeleton of a  dinosaur, workers wearing plastic gloves have inspected and catalogued 80% of  the plane.  </P> <P> In particular, by putting together shreds of twisted aluminum as small as 2  inches long, they have reconstructed much of the "igloo," or portable baggage  container, that they believe had been loaded into the forward cargo hold and  contained the piece of luggage that carried the explosives-laden cassette  player.  </P> <P> Intelligence agencies are conducting a parallel inquiry. The prime suspects are  no longer radical Palestinians seeking to abort the U.S. dialogue with the  Palestine Liberation Organization, but instead pro-Iranian groups with a  variety of possible motives, including retribution for the downing of an  Iranian Airbus by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf last July.  </P> <P> But the fact-gathering detectives in Scotland, fearful that preconceptions will  color their inquiry, have not even satisfied themselves beyond a shadow of a  doubt that the crime was a terrorist act.  </P> <P> "Any investigator has his or her favorite suspect," said Neil Gallagher, chief  of the FBI's counterterrorist unit. "It's critical that they do not allow the  investigation to be controlled by that."  </P> <P> Gallagher acknowledges that the determination that the radio-cassette player  carried the explosive heightens the likelihood that terrorists brought down  Flight 103.  </P> <P> The bombing was apparently carried out by "motivated, highly trained"  individuals and was not "a sporadic act," he said. "But that doesn't make it a  terrorist act."  </P> <P> Gallagher and others involved in the probe here and in Washington seem  confident that those responsible for the act will be identified -- eventually.  </P> <P> "Every day there's a new twist, a new development," Gallagher said, "which  makes me confident a solution will be found. We're in no sense of the word  stymied. Whether we get to court remains to be seen."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 64 Airliner Cases  </P> <P> The record on solving such crimes, however, casts some doubt on Gallagher's  optimism. Since 1968, there have been 64 cases of sabotage, bombing or  attempted bombing of aircraft worldwide, according to Karen Gardela, a RAND  Corp. research assistant. The vast majority have gone unresolved, she said,  particularly when the plane was destroyed.  </P> <P> Flight 103 seems a special case. More than two months after the plane was blown  out of the sky, many roofs of Lockerbie houses remain covered by tarpaulins.  Others show the telltale new tiles replacing those that had been damaged by the  wreckage of the flight.  </P> <P> Sherwood Crescent, where the main part of the fuselage smashed to the earth in  a ball of fire, is still barricaded. Workmen have filled in most of the  30-foot-deep gash in the ground. Somewhere underneath lies whatever remains of  the missing bodies and four houses that were obliterated.  </P> <P> What will become of the crash site remains undetermined, although some  residents oppose any memorial that will perpetuate the place as a ghoulish  curiosity.  </P> <P> The scope of the investigation constitutes a kind of memorial to the tragedy.  John Boyd, chief constable for the Dumfries and Galloway Region, where  Lockerbie is located, described the probe as "an international murder inquiry  on an unprecedented scale."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bodies on Golf Course  </P> <P> During what Boyd calls Phase 1 of the investigation -- the search for bodies --  victims were discovered over a 10-mile radius around Lockerbie. Scores of  bodies fell on a golf course near Mount Tilla, a hill behind the town.  </P> <P> Mountain rescue teams used dogs to search for bodies in the areas of heaviest  forestation and undergrowth. Police frogmen combed a huge reservoir a few miles  from the town, as well as smaller streams.  </P> <P> Despite the intense hunt, no trace has been found of six Americans, three  Hungarians and one Canadian from the plane and seven Lockerbie residents. Their  bodies, it is assumed, were virtually "vaporized," as one source close to the  investigation put it.  </P> <P> As bodies were found, eight civilian and Royal Air Force pathologists worked to  identify them, helped by orthodontists, dental records and FBI fingerprint  cards. In the grisly cases of two victims, Karen Lee Hunt, 21, of Rochester,  N.Y., and Mary L. Johnson, 25, of Wayland, Mass., their bodies were  misidentified in Lockerbie and sent to each other's family.  </P> <P> Their ages and general physical description were close, and their dental charts  were virtually identical. "I've seen them, and they had the same fillings in  the same teeth," said one source. The mistake was discovered after the Hunt  family became suspicious because the clothing from the body they received was  not anything they knew to be in their daughter's wardrobe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Belongings X-Rayed  </P> <P> Examination of personal belongings began with X-rays "in case of there being a  secondary explosive device," Boyd said. After personal property is conclusively  identified and determined to be unconnected with the bombing -- jewelry found  with the bodies of people not suspected of any connection with the bombing, for  instance -- it is being returned to relatives.  </P> <P> Some property from the crash is considered a health risk. Police Supt. Douglas  Roxburgh, who is in charge of the former chemical factory in Lockerbie where  investigators are storing and examining personal effects, said the material has  been exposed to a host of dangerous substances, including aviation fuel and  human body fluids.  </P> <P> "Area contaminated!" warn several signs at the former factory site. Inside, two  men, wearing white gowns and caps, surgical masks over their faces and rubber  gloves on their hands, sort through pieces of clothing.  </P> <P> Next came Phase 2: examination of the wreckage. Investigators faced the massive  task of finding and identifying fragments not only from the wide-bodied Boeing  747 itself but also from the 21 tons of cargo -- luggage and mail -- that took  off with the plane from London.  </P> <P> At Shed No. 3, a three-acre warehouse more than 200 yards long, each piece of  wreckage is carefully logged on a computer. Then the pieces are grouped --  wreckage from the cockpit goes to one corner of the shed, fragments from the  tail section go to another, and so forth.  </P> <P> From the physical evidence on the ground -- perhaps powder burns on luggage or  luggage compartments -- investigators determined that the bomb had been carried  in the forward baggage compartment.  </P> <P> For each piece of luggage, Gallagher said, investigators sought to determine  whether it had been on the first leg of Flight 103, a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt  to London, and then been transferred onto the 747 in London. Or had it joined  up with Flight 103 in London?  </P> <P> Next of kin were interviewed both to draw passenger profiles and to describe  what they knew about the luggage on Flight 103. Gallagher said agents asked for  such details as where passengers had been before boarding the plane, why they  were traveling, with whom they were traveling and whether they could have  carried the bomb onto the plane, wittingly or unwittingly.  </P> <P> "More than 20" of the 259 victims, mostly foreign men between the ages of 25  and 40, still have not been cleared of suspicion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pivotal Moment  </P> <P> Investigators are now focusing on matching the radio-cassette player with the  luggage that contained it. "This is the most pivotal part of the  investigation," one official said.  </P> <P> A conclusive answer would eliminate the time-consuming task of reassembling  each piece of luggage.  </P> <P> One source indicated Friday that investigators had narrowed the possibilities  to a single piece of luggage. Others said only that several shreds of baggage  that had been in direct contact with the bomb had been recovered and  identified, but that the hunt for the specific bag was still under way.  </P> <P> Investigators have indicated that, from the remains they have recovered of the  explosive device, it was detonated by a combination timer and  altitude-sensitive trigger.  </P> <P> If the bomb was boarded onto Flight 103 in Frankfurt, then a strictly  altitude-sensitive bomb might have been detonated in the pressure chamber that  luggage passes through at the Frankfurt airport. And if the bomb had survived  the pressure chamber, it might have gone off in the Boeing 727 during the  flight to London.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transfer Investigated  </P> <P> But an altitude-sensitive bomb with a timer -- a bomb set to explode, for  example, after two hours above 10,000 feet -- could have been loaded onto the  727 in Frankfurt but lain dormant until Flight 103 was 31,000 feet over the  Scottish countryside.  </P> <P> Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the bomb was transferred  to Flight 103 in Frankfurt or London from another carrier, possibly a Middle  East airline, that subjected its baggage to less stringent security than Pan  Am.  </P> <P> For all the meticulous legwork, investigators acknowledge that they still have  a long way to go to answer the ultimate question. Said one: "There is still not  a single piece of paper or evidence that says whodunnit."  </P> <P> The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a  group with close ties to Syria, has been mentioned repeatedly in speculation in  the press over suspects. Thirteen of its members were arrested in West Germany  in October with a Toshiba cassette player equipped with a plastic explosive  bomb and a detonator that would go off after a period of time at high altitude.  </P> <P> However, U.S. intelligence agencies have swung from early suspicion of radical  Palestinians to Iranian factions or pro-Iranian Lebanese as the main operatives  behind the bombing of Flight 103. Like a growing number of terrorist incidents  in the 1980s, Bush Administration officials say, the Pan Am bombing may have  involved operatives from multiple organizations.  </P> <P> Most of the analysis so far has been deductive rather than based on the  evidence. The focus on radical Palestinians, such as the PFLP-General Command,  has diminished simply because of timing.  </P> <P> The PFLP was originally suspected because of an obvious motive: to sabotage the  new U.S. dialogue with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. But Flight 103 was downed less  than two weeks after Arafat's dramatic announcement that he had accepted U.S.  conditions for talks. "The bombing had to already have been in the planning  stage then," said a Bush Administration source who asked not to be named.  </P> <P> Iran and its allies are now considered to be among the prime suspects,  counterterrorism sources say. Not only might they have sought revenge for the  downing of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. Navy last July in which 290 people  were killed, but they also might have been trying to sabotage the efforts by  moderate Iranian factions to create an opening to the West.  </P> <P> And the mass suicide bomb has been a terrorist technique popularized by Iran  over the last six years.  </P> <P> Bush Administration sources are increasingly talking of "state sponsorship."  But while investigators express confidence that they will uncover the identity  of the bombers, several concede that they may not find sufficient proof to seek  a criminal indictment.  </P> <P> Sgt. David Audley of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, a past director  of the International Assn. of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, speaks for  experts who believe those responsible will eventually be identified.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think that when a bomb goes off and detonates, the evidence is  vaporized and no one will ever find the pieces," he said. "That's not true.  It's just like someone standing on a city street and firing a gun in the air.  Somewhere, someplace, the bullet is going down."  </P> <P> This story was reported by Times staff writers Dan Fisher in Lockerbie,  Scotland, and Ronald J. Ostrow and Robin Wright in Washington.  </P></p>

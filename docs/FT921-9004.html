			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester advances by 27% to Pounds 184m CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, yesterday confirmed its reputation as the industry's star performer by reporting a 27 per cent increase, from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 183.8m, in pre-tax profits for 1991. It was the fifth year in succession that C&amp;G's profits have grown by more than 25 per cent. However, the balance sheet was dented by provisions of Pounds 108.4m against bad debts, up from Pounds 20.5m in 1990. More than half of the provisions were made against lending by Portsmouth, the troubled small society which C&amp;G took over in January last year. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, admitted yesterday that its bad debts had turned out to be much worse than expected. Other small societies which C&amp;G absorbed in 1990 accounted for 17 per cent of the provisions. Total assets rose by 28 per cent to Pounds 14.8bn, while mortgage lending was up by 22 per cent to Pounds 3.6bn. The return on assets was 1.39 per cent, well above the industry average. C&amp;G, already the lowest-cost producer in the mortgage industry, reduced its cost-income ratio from 27.6 per cent to 25.9 per cent. Mr Longhurst said that the performance showed resilience in a very difficult market. He issued a veiled warning to the government that unless it changes the legal limits on the amount of their funding which building societies can raise on the wholesale money markets, he may follow Abbey National and convert C&amp;G into a company. At present societies have an absolute ceiling of 40 per cent on their wholesale funding. The Building Societies Commission, the industry regulator, opposes raising the limit since if most of their funding came from the money markets rather than their members, building societies would effectively cease being mutual organisations. 'We do not subscribe to the view that mutuality is the only way forward for our industry,' Mr Longhurst said.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Dollar hits 16-month high against weakened D-Mark THE DOLLAR rose to a 16-month high yesterday on the back of a fast-falling D-Mark, weakened in the political aftermath of the weekend's state election in Germany. Sterling was also undermined as the US unit kept up its gains on hopes of an imminent end to the US recession. In Germany and abroad, the vote against the ruling Christian Democrats was seen as a further blow for Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, when the condition of the east German economy is causing increasing concern. The defeat in Mr Kohl's home state of Rhineland-Palatinate also removes the government's majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, which has the power to veto legislation. The dollar was also helped by comments from Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank director, who restated the bank's policy of following a monetary and not an exchange rate goal. Dealers took this to mean the Bundesbank did not intend to intervene heavily to stem the dollar's rise, although it is keen that the German currency should remain strong to help ward off rising inflation. Central banks have not been intervening to curb the marks recent falls with concerted dollar sales. This has added to market perceptions that the US authorities are happy to see the dollar strengthen further, and that the Federal Reserve is content with the current level of interest rates. As the Bundesbank is thought to be unwilling to stem the D-Mark's fall, the markets are expecting the currency volatility to last at least until agreements about interest rates emerge from this week's meeting of the Group of Seven in Washington. The dollar climbed to a Frankfurt close of DM1.7585 - its highest since the end of 1989 - and continued to gain in New York where it finished at DM1.762. German share prices fell back with the currency. On the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the DAX index shed 1.7 per cent to 1,571.91. US share prices were also weaker. Disappointment at the Federal Reserve's refusal to cut interest rates combined with profit-taking to leave the Dow Jones Industrial Average 37.87 lower at 2,927.72. The Dow has fallen more than 76 points since it reached its record 3,004.46 on Wednesday. There were also sharp falls in the pound - losing 3 cents in London to Dollars 1.6925 before edging back to Dollars 1.6955 in New York - and on London's equity market, where the FT-SE 100 index ended 29.3 lower at 2490.8. Sterling, which has been weakened by recent economic data suggesting that the recession has yet to touch its trough, is also becoming vulnerable to political uncertainty ahead of the local elections on May 2.

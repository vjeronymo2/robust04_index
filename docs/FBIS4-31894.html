			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the 14 June Romanian press review] </F>   [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/6/1994 -- The formalities  for the suspension of President Ion Iliescu from his office,  initiated by the National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party  [PNTCD], and the ample trade union movements planned for today  in Bucharest are the central topics of today's press. The  foreign news pages are dominated by commentaries on the results  in the elections for the European Parliament.    ADEVARUL writes in its editorial: "Among the premieres of  the democratic political life in this country the recent  initiative of the PNTCD to start the constitutional procedure  for the suspension of the president of the republic, counts,  from afar, as a spectacular one.(...) It comes against the  background of a general agitation fostered by contradictory  political statements, by confrontations bordering radicalism,  and by trade union actions threatening to overflow into the  streets. In such an explosive setting, the PNTCD's move, which  formally abides by the law, but comes from politicians only too  experienced not to know that they stand no chance of winning the  game, seems to be rather meant to add to the general tension  with the hope that the disruption it may cause to the present  political layout could give it the shape desired by them."    CRONICA ROMANA carries an article titled "A Romanian  Watergate?," which says: "The PNTCD's proposal to start the  suspension procedure will presumably bring the Romanian  political climate to the boil, and, at the same time, it will  clarify a number of political alliances.(...) Whatever its  practical consequences, this end of parliamentary season will  obviously be extremely tense and with a hard to predict  denouement."    VOCEA ROMANIEI, the government's paper, runs the commentary  titled "The Rightists' Anti-Presidential Syndrome," saying,  among other things: "A sudden revival of the right-wing attacks  against the president of Romania, Mr. Ion Iliescu, is, as it  appears, the tenor of the Romanian political life these days."  The paper says that the "morbid lust for destabilization at any  cost" will collide into the high wall of "a consolidated  democracy, based on a real reform in full progress, and which,  alas for them, is something completely different from the vain  revenging dreams of our post-communist right."    About the scheduled trade union actions in Bucharest, daily  ORA announces: "Today, four years from the events of June 1990,  the revolutionaries and the miners are on the same side of the  barricade."    TINERETUL LIBER carries the headline "The Capital on Alert,"  and reminds: "Today, 14 June, four years will have passed since  the bloodiest of the miners' raids, which put an end to the  marathon rally in the University Square. The capital of Romania  will again be the scene of wide trade union moves, to be joined  by the students, too, the great trade union confederations,  and... surprise, about 3,000 miners. And this is not the only  trade union action. Almost 110,000 teachers all over the  country continue their strike blocking the school year, and road  builders have announced theirs for tomorrow. It was perhaps for  this reason that Premier Vacaroiu has twice condemned the trade  unions, once on the radio and then on television, accusing them,  by what has become a set-phrase by now, of "destabilizing the  country."    CRONICA ROMANA writes: "Even if the prime minister accuses  the trade unions of trying to destabilize (Romania) through  their new actions, they said such threats no longer scare anyone  and therefore they are not going to give up."    DIMINEATA carries an article named "Putting on a Solidarity  for the Occasion, the Trade Unions Will Try Today To Force the  Hand of the Rulers," says: "The object of trade-unionism is not  only to claim (with or without aim,) but also to sustain the  economic construction so as to be able then to staunchly defend  the social order. The trade unions demand partnership, but it  is hard to believe that this is to be obtained by hollering in  the street. The aim would be much more readily reached if, with  dignity, they would pursue laying all the cards on the table.  And here, the employers' union and maybe the government are to  be blamed for part of the failure. As a rule, the middle way is  always the wisest, and, consequently, the best."    ROMANIA LIBERA devotes a special commentary to the events  four years ago, and finds that "four years have already passed  since the miners' guided invasion of Bucharest. Then, used as  instruments for developments of the gravity of which they were  not aware, they fully contributed to shattering the fragile  beginnings of Romanian democracy, and to shocking the world by  nightmarish images relayed by television networks. Nobody has  so far assumed the responsibility for what happened then, events  that had such bleak consequences, both at home and abroad, and  immediate and long-term effects."    EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has its own view of those days: "As time  passes, the thesis that the miners' action was unmotivated and  erratic has become the axiom of the entire Romanian society.  The only one who continues to justify the savageries of 14 June  is Ion Iliescu."    ORA devotes its editorial to the Sunday [12 June] television  interview of Premier Vacaroiu: "The appearance of the prime  minister on the television screens had the precise aim of  telling people: Look, we have steered Romania out of the  crisis, we have brought it to the point where the recovery is  about to start, and just now strikes, rallies, and  destabilization are being planned. People have understood how  the matter stands, they agree with him in principle, but they  wonder why he has to boast. The invitation to political  earnestness against attempts to destabilize should not be  speculated for the benefit of personal, party, or ruling  interests." [passage omitted]</p>

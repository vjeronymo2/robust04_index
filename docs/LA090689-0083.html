			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAUL OLDEN WILL ANNOUNCE UCLA FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Radio station KMPC has hired Cleveland Indians announcer Paul Olden to become  the new voice of UCLA football and basketball, beginning with the basketball  season.  </P> <P> Olden also will serve as the host of the station's weeknight "Sportsline" talk  show, beginning Monday, Oct. 23.  </P> <P> Olden is replacing Joel Meyers, who left the station to join NBC-TV as a pro  football announcer.  </P> <P> It was announced earlier that Bob Starr, who does the Ram radio broadcasts,  will also do UCLA football this season.  </P> <P> Olden has signed a multiyear contract.  </P> <P> Olden, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended Dorsey High School and Los  Angeles City College, was hired by the Indians before the current baseball  season.  </P> <P> Olden, who attended LACC at the same time as new USC announcer Pete Arbogast,  may be best known in Los Angeles for a question he asked Dodger Manager Tom  Lasorda on May 14, 1978.  </P> <P> The Dodgers had just lost to the Chicago Cubs, 10-7, in a 15-inning game in  which the Cubs' Dave Kingman had three home runs and eight RBIs.  </P> <P> Olden, working as a news assistant at KLAC, asked Lasorda: "What was your  opinion of Kingman's performance?"  </P> <P> Jim Healy, then at KLAC, used Lasorda's expletive-filled response on his show  the next day, and has used it many times since.  </P></p>

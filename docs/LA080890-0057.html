			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM TROUPE CLIMBS EVERY MOUNTAIN OF A CLASSIC  </P> <P> There's a production of "The Sound of Music" here acted entirely by people 5 to  18 years old. The auditorium is stuffy, and you sit on a folding chair. How  good can it be?  </P> <P> Pretty darned good.  </P> <P> Director Dan Halkyard has created a show with spontaneity and an admirable  absence of chaos, considering the two large alternating casts (80 children in  all) and the jitters of a second consecutive opening night.  </P> <P> Halkyard uses the small stage smoothly, relying on a red velvet curtain and the  talents of his young players to evoke the sweep and romance of this epic tale  of the singing Von Trapps, who escaped the Third Reich, on foot, over the Alps.  </P> <P> His players are up to the challenge. Jennifer Schlotterbeck, a high school  freshman, is the right age to play the flibbertigibbit postulate Maria. Because  her singing is lovely and confident, her acting warm and earnest, she is a  winning leading lady. In Patrick Johnson as Capt. Von Trapp, she has a strong  and handsome leading man.  </P> <P> Scott Staudt as the luxury-loving Max Detweiler and Laurie O'Remus as the  disapproving Sister Berthe both capture moments of real humor. Jannene Lowry  does very well as the ever-wise Mother Abbess, bringing gorgeous pitch and  plenty of power to "Climb Every Mountain," a big, daunting anthem.  </P> <P> In fact, all the young people playing adults, including Dyan Hobday as heiress  Elsa Schraeder, realize their roles admirably. They're a bit stiff as  grown-ups, but then being grown-up is a tough act at any age.  </P> <P> The kids who play kids do well too. The Von Trapp children, all seven, are  charming. And the marionettes who show up in "The Lonely Goatherd" add a  hilarious touch of improvisation, because you know something's always going  happen any time you put 19 children and 40 strings together in a small space.  The other cast looks promising just from the photos in the program.  </P> <P> There are some glitches in the sound system (the show is miked with recorded  orchestral accompaniment). But who can resist a dozen serious-faced, miniature  nuns, even if they are only singing along with the record?  </P> <P> 'THE SOUND OF MUSIC'  </P> <P> An Anaheim Cultural Arts Center Center Stage production of Rodgers and  Hammerstein's musical, directed by Dan Halkyard, with Jennifer Schlotterbeck,  Jannene Lowry, Patrick Johnson, Susanna Johnson, Dyan Hobday, Scott Staudt,  Rachel Pfeifer, Stephanie Haymond, William Ticknor, Glory Gray, Claudine  Francois and Jared Pfeifer. Vocal Director: Ann Graber. Costumes: Laurie  Holden. Scenic Artist: Patrina Pfeifer. Tickets: $8 for adults, $6 for seniors  and students. Continues Thursday through Aug. 12 at 7:30 p.m. at 931 N. Harbor  Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 491-7144.  </P></p>

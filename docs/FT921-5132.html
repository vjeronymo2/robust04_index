			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / House prices 'fall 1.1%' HOUSE PRICES fell 1.1 per cent last month, Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said yesterday. This is in line with a 1.2 per cent fall in an earlier survey by Nationwide. February was the third successive month in which Halifax recorded a fall of more than 1 per cent. It said there was evidence of growing activity in the market but it was held back by election uncertainties and bad economic news.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / End of negative equity forecast Continuing sharp falls in the number of households whose mortgage debts are higher than the value of their homes mean that negative equity should virtually disappear over the next two years, says a leading building society, Alison Smith writes. A Woolwich building society report forecasts that the number of families with negative equity should fall below 1m this summer - for the first time since late 1991. Woolwich, the UK's third-largest building society, said a small rise in house prices in the first three months of this year had contributed to releasing 50,000 borrowers from negative equity. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England, it found that negative equity cases were rare, and the number of cases in Greater London, the south-west, west Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside had also fallen. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, said the main factors causing this were increases in house prices and low mortgage rates. Home breakthrough, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: DAMAGE CONTROL FOR CAR ACCIDENTS  </P> <P> Car accidents. They can and do happen to anybody and everybody. One "happened"  to me earlier this week.  </P> <P> Of course, many people, when they get in a noninjury fender-bender, don't have  my kind of luck. I was on the Hollywood Freeway and slammed into the rear of a  shiny new BMW. The driver was an undercover police officer.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if you have to run into somebody, at least a cop knows about  traffic reports and things like that.  </P> <P> Lawyers and insurance adjusters always advise that the first thing you should  do -- after you've stopped the car and made sure you can walk -- is to get the  names and addresses of the drivers and witnesses, and the relevant insurance  information.  </P> <P> That's fine in theory, but with angry drivers on the freeway yelling at us to  get out of the way, the first thing we did was move the cars to the side of the  freeway.  </P> <P> And all my expensive legal training didn't really help much: I was still in  shock. I let the driver behind me leave without getting her name or address,  and didn't seek out other witnesses. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured.  </P> <P> What should you do if you find yourself in similar unhappy circumstances, aside  from just exchanging driver's license numbers and insurance policies? The best  source for legal information on this subject is the four-volume state Vehicle  Code, but that doesn't fit in your glove compartment.  </P> <P> Some insurance companies include guidelines about what to do and what to say on  the forms showing you have insurance that you must have in your car. Reach out  and read them before you get yourself into trouble.  </P> <P> Another source of information is the State Bar of California, which summarizes  the rules of the road in a free pamphlet called, "What Should I Do If I Have an  Auto Accident?" And it will fit in your glove compartment.  </P> <P> (Unfortunately, the pamphlet is out of print right now; however, the state bar  is revising it and it will be available again in a few months. It's available  in English, Spanish and Chinese.)  </P> <P> The pamphlet explains that you are required by law to stop whenever you are  involved in an accident, whether you hit a pedestrian, another car or a brick  wall. If you hit an unattended car, you are required to leave a note on the  car's windshield.  </P> <P> If the accident involves damage of more than $500 or if someone is injured or  killed, you must file a written report. You can get the form from the DMV.  </P> <P> In my case, even though there were no injuries, we had to wait for the Highway  Patrol to complete a report since the other driver was an on-duty police  officer.  </P> <P> Don't talk much about the accident at the scene. You may say something you  regret later -- something that is quoted back to you in cross-examination  during a personal injury lawsuit. You should be courteous, but you need not be  apologetic.  </P> <P> As soon as possible, contact your insurance agent and have him or her handle  the negotiations with the other driver and his insurance company.  </P></p>

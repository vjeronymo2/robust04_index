			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 317(a)(4) of the 1938 Act, the national acreage factor for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco for uniformly adjusting the acreage allotment of each farm is determined to be 0.90, which is the result of dividing the 1994 national allotment (384,386.97 acres) minus the national reserve (744 acres)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the total of allotments established for flue-cured tobacco farms in 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (426,268.80 acres).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 317(a)(7) of the 1938 Act, the national yield factor for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco is determined to be 0.9255, which is the result of dividing the national average yield goal (2,088 pounds) by a weighted national average yield (2,256 pounds).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Price Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers, at a level determined in accordance with a formula prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco, the level of support is determined in accordance with sections 106 (d) and (f) of the 1949 Act. Section 106(f)(7)(A) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support for the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco shall be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The level, in cents per pound, at which the 1993 crop of flue-cured tobacco was supported, plus or minus, respectively,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after taking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation to demand, of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period, is greater or less than:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (II) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to the marketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the year in which the average price was the lowest in such period; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco, in the index of prices paid by the tobacco producers from January 1 to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determination is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difference between the two 5-year averages (i.e., the difference between (A) (I) and (II)) is 0.5 cents per pound. The difference in the cost index from January 1 to December 31, 1993, is 1.6 cents per pound. Applying these components to the price support formula (0.5 cents per pound, two-thirds weight; 1.6 cents per pound, one-third weight) results in a weighted total of 0.9 cents per pound. As indicated, section 106 provides that the Secretary may, on the basis of supply and demand conditions, limit the change in the price support level to no less than 65 percent of that amount. In order to remain competitive in foreign and domestic markets, the Secretary used his discretion to limit the increase to 65 percent of the maximum allowable increase. Accordingly, the 1994 crop of flue-cured tobacco will be supported at 158.3 cents per pound, 0.6 cents higher than in 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

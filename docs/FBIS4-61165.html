			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimiras Zarovskis: "Love Story"] </F>   [Excerpts] Vilnius -- Polish President Lech Walesa has  paid a visit to Lithuania. It is several centuries since there  have been visitors of this kind here. The burden of history  weighed heavy on the leaders of the two states. [passage  omitted]    But there now seem to be signs of change.    Lech Walesa unexpectedly proved more peaceable than Algirdas  Brazauskas. In his speech the former spoke about the future.  While the latter engaged in diplomatic license: "Even now  Lithuania is not abandoning its principled position that Vilnius  and the Vilnius region only belonged to Poland between the wars  de facto but not de jure, and in 1939 Vilnius and the  neighboring territory was legally returned to Lithuania." This  statement was made in order to gratify his opponents who are  demanding that the fact of the Poles' occupation of part of  Lithuania's territory be recognized.    Nevertheless, a Polish-Lithuanian treaty was nevertheless.  The main point therein being recognition of the inviolability  of borders and the legality of the capitals "regardless of past  borders." That is, Poland has officially renounced its claims  to Vilnius and the Vilnius region and Lithuania has officially  secured its right to them. This can be seen as a great success  for Lithuanian diplomacy.    Lech Walesa's visit occurred without any excesses. That may  have been facilitated by his calm firm position: He has  repeatedly told Poles living in Lithuania that Lithuania is  their homeland, while Poland is their motherland.    Thus, the centuries-long misunderstanding between Lithuania  and Poland is being resolved. Lech Walesa said that by the year  2000, Polish-Lithuanian borders will cease to exist, and  Lithuanian Poles, indignant that Lithuanians have stopped  relaying Polish television, have been advised to simply buy  satellite dishes. Petty thieves celebrated this remarkable date  in their own way: They stole the Lithuanian interior minister's  official Mercedes in broad daylight.</p>

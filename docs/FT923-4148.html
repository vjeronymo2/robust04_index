			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sasol advances 11% SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals producer best known for turning coal into oil, yesterday announced an 11 per cent rise in net profits to R1.15bn (Dollars 410m) for the year to June 25, from R1.04bn a year earlier, agencies report from Johannesburg. Earnings per share advanced by 9.4 per cent to 202 cents from 184.7 cents and the annual dividend is being raised by 9.1 per cent to 78.0 cents from 71.5 cents. Turnover moved ahead by 3.8 per cent to R7.85bn from R7.56bn. Tax took R359.7m compared with R470.1m. The group yesterday said it hoped to at least maintain earnings in its current year, while new projects should help it achieve real growth from 1993/94 onwards. It said all divisions had embarked on a cost-cutting programme since no significant growth contribution could be expected from commissioning new projects in the current year and in view of possibly stagnant rand prices. Since almost all the group's local and export prices were determined in US dollars, the rise of the rand against the dollar recently was affecting revenue and profits, it said. International petrochemical prices would also influence results. 'Since chemical prices have weakened to the point where many leading international producers cannot fully recover cash costs, we do not expect prices to deteriorate any further,' it said. The group announced the go-ahead for three new projects worth R670m, bringing the value of projects approved and not yet commissioned to R3.5bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine, voted today at his polling station in the Tsentralnyy  electoral district in Kiev. At journalists' request he answered  several questions, in particular, those dealing with the urgent  tasks facing the new parliament of Ukraine and the future of the  Commonwealth of Independent States.    [Begin Plyushch recording] Urgent steps should be taken to  form a government which will take upon itself full executive  power and get down to what we call the stabilization of our  socioeconomic situation.    The urgent task, therefore, is to elect the head of the  government, to determine that he will be head of the executive  power -- I am in favor of a prime minister being head of the  executive power -- and charge him with forming his team within  the shortest possible period of time and getting down to  fulfilling his duties.    If this is done in parliament, the next issue will be to  introduce amendments into the law on the president, and  determine what kind of president Ukraine will need in future.  After that it will be necessary to pass the law on the plenary  powers of local bodies of power, in other words, the law  delimiting powers between the central executive power bodies and  local bodies; work toward that end is already being done by the  standing commissions of the current parliament. That is to say,  the next step should be to solve the issue of local regional  self-management and self-government. People in all oblasts have  already understood that there must be no dyarchy, and they want  and dream that the coming election in June will allow the  formation of representative executive bodies and make  territories controllable and manageable.    The CIS is necessary. From the very first day, Ukraine has  been within the CIS and today remains within the CIS. The CIS  will work as a Commonwealth of Independent States only when all  states want it to. For Ukraine alone to wish this would be far  from enough. If we had examples to show, as it probably seems  to some, that Ukraine has no full confidence in this  Commonwealth and hence the results in Ukraine [as heard], why  are there no results in those states which do have full  confidence? Take Kazakhstan and Russia, for example. They have  so much faith in each other that they consider themselves to be  in the closest possible [word indistinct]; however, the results  are the same.    This is why I favor the idea that [pauses] ... For example,  you remember that when we considered this issue in parliament I  read out a letter, an appeal to the Ukrainian parliament, from  [Yuriy] Shafranik, Russian minister of fuel and energy. There  has been little change since then. Specific steps are being  taken on the part of Ukraine, and you know that our Ukrainian  Construction Ministry has concluded agreements according to  which about 50,000 Ukrainian builders will work in Russia,  primarily at the Yamal and Surgut deposits. Our builders have  gone further; they will work not only at those deposits but have  already reached Krasnodar and Stavropol regions. And they  already have advantageous options.    Generally speaking, when they say that the construction  complex is ruined [pauses] ... In reply to a question, the  construction minister told me that 16,000 people have left their  concerns over the past two years, but 500,000 are ready to  fulfill any programs. That is to say, money is needed.    I believe the CIS is necessary as a commonwealth. We should  not lose the market under any circumstances. As for the  question of integration, it must be brought to a higher level, a  cut above. In the construction complex this is normal. There  are other (?industries) as well. Otherwise, people in Surgut,  Yamal and other northern regions of Russia would be concerned,  because they have no work there already. And if they have no  work there, they will come back to Ukraine. And where can you  immediately find work here? You know that in such localities,  like Zhovtnevyy and others, 40, 50, or even 60 percent of the  population are Ukrainians.    Therefore, for a whole number of reasons the CIS is  necessary, and I know that in the near future there will be  another meeting at chief of state level, and our president,  Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk], is going there with a whole  package of proposals concerning the further integration of our  national economy complex with the other countries. [end  recording]    [Announcer] You have been listening to an interview by Ivan  Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, which he  granted at his polling station. In reply to requests by  journalists, he answered several questions, in particular, those  concerning the urgent steps of the new parliament of Ukraine and  the future of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

As a result, this prevented the economy from overheating,  maintained rapid economic growth, and basically achieved the  planned targets.    In 1993, China came out on top of the rest of the world's  economies with a 13 percent economic growth rate and gained some  valuable initial experience in the pursuit of maroregulation and  control under the conditions of a market economy. The world  looked agape and praised China's success in economic  macroregulation and control.    In retrospect, economic operations over the last year went  through overheating and the attempts to get overheating under  control. In early 1993, macromonitoring and forewarning  indicators showed the national economy had entered the "red  zone" and "peaked" in June, which meant it had entered the  mid-level of the red zone. The macromonitoring and forewarning  system gave the "overheating" warning. The central and local  authorities took prompt and resolute measures to boost  macroregulation and control. Through structural adjustment,  they managed to reduce the overheating, maintained rapid  economic growth, prevented drastic fluctuations, and stored away  some strength for next year. Through rectification, the  financial and circulation sectors were markedly improved in  order and the good reformist momentum was preserved. Through  screening, the bubble economy was curbed and effective economic  growth was maintained. Overal economic operations in September  fell from the mid-level "red zone" in the first half of the year  to its lower levels and to the "yellow zone" (basically normal)  in October. Great changes have happened in China's  macroeconomy. Overall, it is developing in a healthy direction  and basically has the objective of sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development. This shows that it is necessary, as well  as possible, for the state to pursue further macroregulation and  controls under market economic conditions and rapid economic  development. A good start has gained some fresh experience for  the better pursuit of macroregulation and control.    First, the macroregulation and control based on the review  of  the situation was able to exploit the timing. Last year, based  on an objective and accurate analysis of the economic situation,  the central authorities resolutely and promptly unveiled a  series of macroregulatory and control measures. Decisions for  this round of macroregulation and control were made during the  peak of an economic cycle (in June). The measures themselves  were unveiled in July, in contrast with the past practice of  unveiling them when the economy hit the bottom. In this way,  macroregulation and control was able to seize the initiative,  cool down the economy in an orderly and steady manner, prevented  impetuosity and, more importantly, avoided the heavy losses that  come with a "hard landing" and drastic fluctuations. This shows  the scientific predictability and resoluteness of central  decisions.    Second, correct identification of targets for  macroregulation  and control and the areas for making breakthroughs. After  analysis, the central authorities determined the overheating was  local or confined to certain sectors and caused by confusion of  the economic order in some sectors, not a heating up on all  fronts. Therefore, they advised that boosting macroregulation  and control did not mean retrenchment across the board but a  structural adjustment. They stressed concentrating funds on the  procurement of agriculture and sideline products, normal  production in key state enterprises, key state projects, foreign  trade procurements and operations, and so on, trying as much as  possible to avoid "uniform and sweeping administrative  measures." They succeeded in minimizing the negative impact of  the macroregulatory and control measures. As a result of  correctly identifying the cause of overheating and confusion,  that is, overheated investment in fixed assets and the chaotic  financial order, and the analysis of factors prompting the two  to feed on each other, the central authorities chose rectifying  the financial order and controlling excessive investment growth  as the two main efforts, got hold of the key links, and enabled  the entire economy to develop healthily.    Third, endowing macroregulation and controls with the right  amount of force with an eye for flexibility. Unlike the "riding  roughshod over" and hard-landing approach in previous regulation  and control, this time a soft-landing and microscopic regulation  line of thought was adopted, with the objectives of suitably  cooling down the economy while not dampening motivation for  proper and rapid development in various sectors and controlling  economic growth, price rises, total investment in fixed assets,  loan scale, and money supply volumes with quantified targets.  In the construction sector, macroregulation and control was  aimed at strictly curbing new projects and prioritizing existing  projects according to industrial policies and construction  conditions. With the enforcement of the maroregulatory and  control measures, local project investment was brought under  effective control and decreased monthly from July onward. The  actual amount of work on construction projects for the whole  year rose by 22 percent, still within the normal range of  growth. The industrial production rate dropped steadily each  month between July and October, signalling a strengthening in  market regulation, as witnessed by normal production growth for  products still in demand in the market. When there was a  general shortage of funds among firms, regulation and control  was promptly relaxed; funds were injected, and firms were in  better shape by October. By November, the industrial production  growth rate had stopped declining, especially that of  state-owned industry where production grew 1.9 percentage points  from October. Production and sales rates rose further. The  November sales rate of all industrial products climbed further  to 96.25 percent after ending the June to September low-level  fluctuation.    Fourth, the adoption of integrated macroregulatory and  control measures and making sure that the measures adopted are  scientific. This time, emphasis was placed on combining  regulation and control with reform and opening up and  identifying rectification with reforms. Economic means were to  be the chief method, supplemented by legal means and pursued in  parallel with a strengthening of ideological and political work  to foster clean government, fight corruption, and crack down on  economic crimes. The regulation and control this time was  supplemented with necessary administrative measures, conducted  with equal attention to domestic and foreign markets, with  emphasis on the banking and financial sectors. In particular,  efforts were made to put the banking sector in order, taking  advantage of an adjustment in interest rates. As a result,  loopholes were plugged, formal channels established, and  residents' savings increased significantly. This way, various  banking and investment actions were standardized and capital  markets were assured of healthy development.    Fifth, an emphasis on a correct orientation, ensuring that  targets for regulation and control and media opinion were  coordinated. Under the conditions of a market economy, there  are many different interests, including the anticipations of  local governments, firms, nonprofitmaking bodies, and  individuals, which also play a direct role in changes in market  demand and supply. Examples include bullishness and purchase  decisions made in relation to inflation and value appreciation.  Expectations decide whether one is piling or selling stock, or  selling fast, or holding back. The vigor or laxity of  macroregulation and control will determine the expectations of  foreign businessmen and local governments. As a result of  paying attention to changes in psychological expectations,  timely efforts were made to come to grips with situations before  they became threatening. Media propaganda was boosted,  information provided for guidance, and policy transparency  increased to dispel unwarranted psychological expectations.  These were also effective macroregulatory and control measures.    In sum, in 1993, along with the strengthening and  improvement  of macroregulation and control, reform, opening up, and  modernization moved into a new dimension, gained initial  experience, and showed that strengthening and improving  macroregulation and control was an essential component of  economic work. However, to move the entire economy into a  sustained benign cycle we need the guarantees of an economic  structure, operating mechanism, and legal framework that are  able to meet the requirements of a market economy. In a sense,  macroregulation and controls can treat only the symptoms, not  the cause of the diseases. Under the existence of two parallel  structures, we have to further deepen reforms on all fronts if  we want to eliminate factors that cause drastic fluctuations in  the economy. Meanwhile, poor management remains a general  problem, which is even more easily neglected under market  economic conditions, as evidenced by the one-time mistaken  concept that we could do away with all kinds of overseeing once  prices were deregulated and the powers delegated to enterprises.  Therefore, we have not solved the problems deeply embedded in  economic operations and should watch out for them.    The main problems in current economic life are: The  excessive investment scale of current projects, irrational  structures, huge market price raises which have passed the  warning line, a fragile agricultural foundation, and so on.  Furthermore, problems such as irrational social distribution,  generally low industrial efficiency, lethargic state-owned large  and medium enterprises remain prominent. At present,  macroregulation and control should focus on: Preventing serious  inflation; maintaining suitable growth in fixed-asset investment  and money supply; strengthening agriculture in a down-to-earth  manner; enlivening state-owned large and medium enterprises with  effective measures; vigorously adjusting the economic structure;  and raising economic efficiency to ensure the achievement of the  targets for 1994 reforms and development in a smooth manner.</p>

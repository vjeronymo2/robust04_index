			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> REACTION TO 'OJAI LAW'  </P> <P> In response to the article "Ojai Law" on Sept. 20, I am sure "The Krishnamurti  People" rejoice, as I do, in businesses that advertise with beauty.  </P> <P> I fail to see this as "failure for Krishnamurti"!  </P> <P> I do complain, however. One of my complaints is about a small building  completely covered with signs -- 29 violations of the ordinance. I also  complain about the "clutter" of hanging signs in the Arcade. But I congratulate  the businesses in the Arcade whose signs are part of their facade.  </P> <P> ROY PATTON  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

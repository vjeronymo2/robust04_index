			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexico links with new trade zone - A framework pact for Central America MEXICO and the five Central American republics have signed a framework free trade agreement preparing the way for free trade in the region by the end of 1996. The framework accord provides common guidelines for the bilateral treaties that the six countries - Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica - are negotiating, enabling the respective agreements to fold into a common free trade pact by the end of 1996. The goal of 1996 was decided by six heads of state in Mexico last year, but might still be extended. The agreement marks a remarkable change in a region that for more than two decades has been torn by civil war, or split by bitter ideological differences. All five Central American presidents are democratically elected, keen on Central American political and economic integration, and together with Mexico, are pursuing orthodox, pro-free trade economic reforms. The overwhelming view in the region - from the former rebels in El Salvador to (most) rightists in Guatemala - is that the area's deep poverty and political instability are best countered through economic reform sponsored by the IMF and World Bank, rather than by revolutionary change or military repression. The average Central American earns about Dollars 2 a day. The agreement comes just as the Mexican government has concluded negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Canada. Mexican trade officials are currently meeting their counterparts from Colombia and Venezuela to make progress on their intended trade pact. Nafta provides terms for other countries to join the trade area, and optimists still hope that Latin America's array of trade agreements will eventually implode into a continent-wide free trade area, stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Last year Mexico and Chile signed a free trade agreement, while Brazil, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay intend to form a common market by 1995. The proposed Central American trade pact may exclude certain sensitive sectors, such as sugar, as was the case in the Mexico-Chile free trade agreement. The framework agreement gives longer protection to the less-developed countries in Central America, a sign of Mexico's desire to play the statesman, and turn itself into a regional power. Mexico and Costa Rica are already well advanced on their pact, which could be wrapped up by the end of the year. Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have agreed in principle to begin free trade in goods and financial services by 1993, and to form a common market by 1995. President Rafael Callejas of Honduras has said that the three countries plan to co-ordinate monetary and fiscal policies, and finance trade deficits with each other. The three Northern Central American countries have promoted a Central American parliament to pave the way for Central American political integration. The main aim of all Central American countries is to increase their trade with each other from the abysmal levels of the 1980s. The proportion of Central America exports to the region of the total fell from 20 per cent in 1982 to 14.4 per cent in 1990, as war and debt default took their toll on commercial relations and light industry. Honduras, flanked on three sides by El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, sent just 4 per cent of its exports to Central America in 1990. Still, the room for expansion is limited by the similarity of many of their exports - agricultural commodities, such as coffee, cotton, bananas and sugar, still form the bulk of the region's exports. While non-traditional exports are growing - particularly in textiles and yarn goods - these, too, are similar across the isthmus. Further, many Central Americans are fretting that Mexico's preferential access to the US will divert trade from the isthmus to Mexico. Nafta will give Mexico a decisive edge over Central America in textile exports since it scraps US quotas and tariff on Mexican textile exports, and requires that textile goods are produced from yarn made in a Nafta country to be eligible for preferential treatment. Similarly, the US will eventually scrap quotas and tariffs on Mexico's sugar exports - which, potentially, will displace Central America's sugar exports. The hope is that one day the Central American countries will be granted full tariff-free access to the US market, and the countries have clubbed together in part to show a common front. In the meantime they will at least have full access to the Mexican market, which, if Nafta is passed by the US Congress, is projected to expand rapidly. Deal revives Mexican sugar hopes, Page 22</p>

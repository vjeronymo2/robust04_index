			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell extends hostile bid for Arnotts CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday extended its hostile bid for Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, after failing to reach its target of 50.1 per cent of the shares. Campbell said holders of more than 14 per cent of Arnotts' stock had accepted its ADollars 9.50-a-share offer, taking the group's shareholding to just over 47 per cent. Campbell said the bid would remain open until February 5 to allow shareholders who have not accepted the offer to reassess their position. The bid values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 928m). 'This is our last and final extension and we are confident of continuing support from shareholders,' said Mr David Johnson, Campbell's Australian-born chief executive. Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts chairman, claimed some shareholders had been misled by Campbell's earlier statements that the offer would not be extended. He said the group was considering asking the Australian Securities Commission, the corporate regulator, to force Campbell to allow shareholders to withdraw acceptances. 'We have already been contacted by shareholders who claim that they were misled and wish to withdraw their acceptances,' he said. Arnotts said it had been assured by most members of the founding families, which owned some 26 per cent of the company when the bid was launched, that they would refuse to sell. Most financial institutions rejected the bid yesterday, including the AMP Society, Australia's largest stock market investor, National Mutual Life and Legal &amp; General of the UK. Campbell's increased shareholding will entitle the group to lift its representation on the Arnotts' board from two to three. However, a 1985 shareholding agreement between the companies means Campbell must acquire more than 85.1 per cent of Arnotts' shares before it can control the board.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: New regulations on 'policy' adverts ADVERTISING by central government and local authorities will for the first time be subject to a self-regulatory code of practice, the Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday. Regulations covering the advertising industry will be expanded to include public policy statements, but the ASA has stopped short of scrutinising 'advertisements whose principal function is party-political' for honesty and truthfulness. The decision was criticised yesterday by the Labour party and the Trades Union Congress. Mr David Hill, Labour's director of communications, said the code should cover advertising such as the Conservative campaign during last year's general election which highlighted what it called Labour's 'tax bombshell'. The TUC, which drew up a submission for the revised code, said the new rules were 'inconsistent'. Sir Timothy Raison, chairman of the ASA, said yesterday it had decided to exclude direct party political advertising from the code of practice because: Political parties are involved in appealing to the electorate and Sir Timothy questioned whether the ASA should 'have the right to judge those appeals'. There was already scope for a right of reply by opposing parties. The practicalities of the political arena would make it difficult for the ASA to intervene with sufficient speed. Mr Richard Wade, outgoing director-general of the Advertising Association and chairman of the ASA committee that drew up the extended code, said yesterday: 'We started out by wanting all political advertising brought within the code, but came to the view that party political advertisements are different in kind.' Advertisements promoting government policy - such as those from the Central Office of Information, one of the UK's largest-spending advertisers - will fall under the new rules. The expanded regulations, which come into effect on April 15, will also cover charities, lobbying groups, trade unions and other advertisers expressing opinions on issues in the public domain. Previously, the code excluded such advertising unless it made a direct appeal for funds. Advertising claims made by non-commercial bodies will now have to be supported by documentary evidence to back up facts, figures and assertions used in support of their causes.</p>

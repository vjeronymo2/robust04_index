In 1993, the city government licensed 81 foreign-funded  enterprises, which involved a combined investment topping 1.05  billion U.S. dollars and actually utilized 54.089 million U.S.  dollars. The enterprises earned a total of 22.8 million U.S.  dollars in foreign exchange last year.    According to Mayor Wang Fengqi, Baotou is China's largest  industrial city from among areas populated by ethnic minority  nationalities. He claimed that his city is an ideal place for  foreign investment, as it has a sound industrial foundation and  an ample supply of energy.    But he admitted that Baotou had remained a virgin land for  overseas investors until 1985, adding that there were only 23  foreign-funded enterprises by July 1991.    Starting in 1992, Baotou has accelerated the pace of reform  and opening-up in an attempt to improve its investment  environment. The city has since attached particular importance  to upgrading infrastructure such as telecommunications,  transportation and urban utilities.    Meanwhile the city government has promulgated a set of  preferential policies to attract overseas investment.    From January to September 1991, Baotou launched three trade  and investment fairs in Beijing, Hong Kong and the city, signing  17 joint and cooperative venture agreements, which involved a  total of 41.16 million U.S. dollars.    Last year Baotou launched a campaign to invite both domestic  and foreign investors to help exploit its rare-earth resources,  one of the major natural resources of the city.    The city has meanwhile sent business inspection teams to  Hong  Kong, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Mongolia and  countries in Southeast Asia. It has also set up liaison offices  in Shenzhen, Manzhouli and Erenhot to deal with foreign affairs  and nationals.    In the past three years the city government has trained more  than 300 local officials at various levels in a bid to better  arm them with advanced management and expertise. The move,  officials said, has built up a talent reserve for the  establishment of more foreign- funded enterprises in the city.    By the end of 1993 Baotou had registered a total of 157  foreign- funded enterprises, with 2.09 billion U.S. dollars in  foreign investment involved and 122 million U.S. dollars  actually used.    City officials said that the introduction of foreign funds,  management and technical know-how have saved many of the city's  enterprises from bankruptcy.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Tighter rules on pensions This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. THE chancellor also announced measures aimed at ensuring that tax relief to approved occupational pension schemes is given only when contributions are actually paid into pension schemes. The Inland Revenue said its long-standing view of the law was 'that an employer may have a deduction from profits for tax purposes only for sums paid into an approved occupational pension scheme'. Doubt has recently been cast on this view particularly following a Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP 24) issued in 1988.</p>

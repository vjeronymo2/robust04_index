			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish at  1650 GMT on 10 April carries on its 30-minute "100 Questions  to..." program a report about Professor Dariusz Rosati, the  government coalition candidate for the posts of finance minister  and deputy prime minister. The program, presented by Ewa  Michalska, opened with a video report showing people in the  streets being asked whether they know who Rosati is. Many do.  The video is followed by a profile on Rosati.    Afterwards Rosati answers journalists' questions concerning  his decision to withdraw as the candidate for the  above-mentioned posts. The first question is whether Rosati has  definitely made up his mind. Rosati replies: "Today the  situation is clear. I am not a candidate for the post of  finance minister because of well-known circumstances."    Rosati says he could not accept the post in a situation when  President Walesa was opposed to his appointment. Rosati now  intends to return to Geneva and resume his work for the UN  European Economic Commission. However, he does not completely  rule out the possibility that he may accept the job of finance  minister in the future. He says he does regret having gotten  involved in the controversy concerning his appointment. Rosati  explains that he never met President Walesa and did not have a  chance to discuss his proposals with him.    During the course of the discussion, the issue of Rosati's  work for the foreign-debt-servicing fund, FOZZ, is mentioned.  He says the FOZZ supervisory board, of which he is a member,  does not have much influence on the day-to-day running of the  fund, so he cannot be personally responsible for the FOZZ  shortcomings.    When asked to name his own possible recommendations for the  job of finance minister, he avoids mentioning any names.  Another question concerns the nature of his work in Geneva.  Rosati says that it was a research and analysis job.    Rosati also comments on a number of economic issues. He says  he is against state control over wages. He also thinks  President Walesa should not delay the signing of the budget.    One of the journalists asks him about the state of Rosati's  financial affairs. He does not hesitate to disclose that he  owns a house in Warsaw and two cars, and that he has $30,000 to  $40,000 in his bank account.    Rosati is asked about his possible priorities had he been  appointed finance minister. He says the most important things  are a proper medium-term economic policy, speeding up the  privatization process, restructuring the economy, and getting  rid of inflationary pressures.    At the end of the program, Rosati is traditionally invited  to  leave his signature on the program board, among many other  signatures left there previously by well-known personalities.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANGSTON HEARS SAME FLAT NOTES BY ANGELS, 3-1;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: BREWERS HAND HIM HIS EIGHTH LOSS IN 12 STARTS SINCE MAY 15. THE  ANGELS HAVE SCORED 15 RUNS IN THE 11 GAMES HE HAS LOST THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> With one minor variation, Mark Langston struck the same losing chord Monday as  he has so often this season.  </P> <P> His 3-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at Anaheim Stadium represented a change  from the 2-1 defeats he seemed destined to absorb, but the end result was of  prime importance -- and the loss was the same result he experienced in his  previous five decisions.  </P> <P> Rob Deer broke a 1-1 tie in the seventh inning with a home run to left, and the  Brewers added another run on a pair of singles around a walk as Langston (4-11)  took his eighth loss in 12 starts since May 15.  </P> <P> "The way I look at it, anytime you lose there's an error in your work,"  Langston said. "The home run to Deer, that's the situation I mean.  </P> <P> "I can't say it's not difficult, because it is. I can't say how much I want to  turn it around, but I can't dwell on it.  </P> <P> "I wasn't laying (the pitch to Deer) in, but I obviously was trying to throw a  strike. He was swinging in that situation. You expect it."  </P> <P> In the span since May 15, Langston has three no-decisions and one victory, June  5 at Kansas City. In his last six starts, he is 0-5 with one no-decision and a  4.14 earned-run average.  </P> <P> At home, the 29-year-old left-hander is 1-6 in nine starts, having won only on  April 11 when he combined with Mike Witt to pitch a no-hitter.  </P> <P> The Angels have scored 15 runs in the 11 games he has lost and had scored only  nine runs at the time of his departure. They got 11 hits Monday, and one Angel  was thrown out at the plate.  </P> <P> The loss ended the Angels' three-game winning streak and spoiled a memorable  night for rookie first baseman Lee Stevens, who got his first major league hit  in his first at-bat and drove in the Angels' only run in the fourth inning off  Ron Robinson (3-1).  </P> <P> Stevens was recalled from triple-A Edmonton late Sunday to take the place of  Wally Joyner, who went on the 15-day disabled list because of a possible stress  fracture in his right kneecap.  </P> <P> Using Joyner's glove because some of his baggage had been lost, the 23-year-old  power hitter had two singles and a double in his first three at-bats and  commanded enough respect for the Brewers to summon ace reliever Dan Plesac to  face him with two out and two on in the eighth. Stevens struck out, sending  fans scurrying toward the exits.  </P> <P> Stevens, who was batting .293 with 16 home runs and 66 RBIs in 90 games with  the Trappers, led off the second by lining a single to right off Robinson in  his first major league at-bat. Recognizing the importance of the feat, the  crowd of 24,643 rewarded him with a round of applause. The ball was thrown in  from the outfield for Stevens to save as a memento.  </P> <P> Stevens' glory was short-lived. He was thrown out stealing second, but trotted  back to the dugout to the accompaniment of scattered cheers.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel I'd be this successful. I felt it would be a learning experience  from Day 1," said Stevens, who singled in each of his first two at-bats and  doubled in the sixth before striking out against Plesac with the tying run on  second in the eighth.  </P> <P> "I feel like I can make something out of this chance they're giving me. I made  something out of my minor league experience and I will make something out of my  major league experience."  </P> <P> He also made a quick lunge to snare a liner by Dave Parker in the eighth that  Milwaukee Manager Tom Trebelhorn called, "as impressive to me as anything," but  was less successful in trying to score from second in the sixth after he had  doubled and Hill singled.  </P> <P> "I was really happy and excited (about the promotion). I didn't get a whole lot  of sleep (Sunday) because we were out celebrating our anniversary last night,"  said Stevens, who brought his wife, Kim, to the game. "It's been a nice week  for me. A nice present. . . . Hopefully, we'll get a win tomorrow instead of a  loss."  </P> <P> Not even Stevens' heroics could save Langston.  </P> <P> Through four innings, Langston had yielded one hit, on a ground ball that might  have been scored an error. Shortstop Dick Schofield cut in front of second  baseman Donnie Hill to play Bill Spiers' bouncer and fumbled the ball while  taking it out of his glove and throwing. But Langston wasn't ruffled, and he  ended the inning by getting Jim Gantner to tap the ball back to the mound.  </P> <P> Stevens made himself the new fan favorite in the fourth inning, when he drove  in the Angels' first run, then took second baseman Gantner out at second base  to avert a double play.  </P> <P> Winfield led off the fourth by beating out a bouncer to deep short. Lance  Parrish broke his bat, poking the ball through the hole between first and  second, moving Winfield to third. Stevens didn't wait to see any more of  Robinson's repertoire and grounded the first pitch into right field, scoring  Winfield.  </P> <P> When Hill grounded to short, Stevens barged into Gantner and bothered him  enough to make him throw too late to get Hill at first. Bichette ended the  inning by grounding into a double play.  </P> <P> The Brewers pulled even at 1-1 in the sixth. Gantner began things with a sharp  grounder that deflected off Hill's glove for a hit. He moved to second when  Robin Yount grounded a single through the left side and scored on Sheffield's  single to center on a two-strike off-speed pitch. Langston was able to bear  down and strike out Parker and do the same to Greg Vaughn on a 3-and-2 pitch.  Those were Langston's fourth and fifth strikeouts.  </P> <P> Stevens further endeared himself to the crowd by lining a double to left-center  field past the outstretched glove of Yount with two out in the sixth. But on  Hill's single to left, home plate umpire Mark Johnson signaled that Stevens was  out on a fine throw by Vaughn and a good block of the plate by catcher B.J.  Surhoff.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> With Wally Joyner on the 15-day disabled list because of a possible stress  fracture in his right kneecap and Lee Stevens at first base, the Angels used  their 89th lineup in 90 games. Should tests Monday on Chili Davis' lower back  show a problem, Manager Doug Rader's lineup juggling could intensify. Davis  wasn't available Monday, but word on his condition is expected today.  </P> <P> "You look at the Toronto ballclub and the talent they have and they don't have  a set lineup," Rader said. "If you use a set lineup, people accuse you of being  set in your ways and not imaginative. If you use a lineup you think is best on  a given day, people say you're tinkering too much."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten's Wicked Motives Viewed From His </F> Remarks in Australia"]    [Text] During his recent visit to Australia, Chris Patten  on several occasions made remarks in public that obviously  violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration.    During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten repeatedly  advocated that Hong Kong was an "international asset," and such  a concept gravely violates the most fundamental principle laid  down in the Joint Declaration. The most basic principle in the  Joint Declaration is that the recovery of Hong Kong is the  common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, the Chinese  Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty  over Hong Kong effective 1 July 1997, and the Government of the  United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to the  PRC effective 1 July 1997. This basic principle in the Joint  Declaration shows that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of  China's sacred territory, and by no means is it an  "international asset." Chris Patten said that the Chinese  side's criticism of his visit to Australia shows it is "playing  the international card" and "has a lack of understanding of Hong  Kong's role and importance in the world." According to Chris  Patten's logic, all cities that have an important role in the  world are inevitably "international assets." However, no one  would fail to see the important role of such cities as London  and New York in the world, can we say that those cities are  "international assets" too? Does it follow that all countries  may possess them and share their assets? Obviously, Britain  would not agree with that point, nor would the United States  tolerate it. Chris Patten's wicked motive lies in instigating  all countries to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs, thus impeding  China's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  by relying on international political forces.    During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also said:  "Britain has a moral obligation to Hong Kong after 1997," "the  idea that the Joint Declaration means to say that Britain will  no longer have moral obligations and interests in Hong Kong is  entirely contradictory." This is a distortion and vilification  of the Joint Declaration, which stipulates that British rule in  Hong Kong will terminate in 1997: where do British "moral  obligations" come in after 1997? Chris Patten's big lie can  fool no one. One has only to read the article, entitled, "Our  Basic Position on the Issue of Hong Kong," and its annotations  in volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  to have a clear picture that, in the course of the Sino-British  talks on the future of Hong Kong, the British side repeatedly  insisted on its position of prolonging its right to rule over  Hong Kong and maintaining British influence over Hong Kong after  1997. Nevertheless, the British side's stubborn position  deservedly met with the Chinese side's firm opposition. It was  under such circumstances that the British side had to sign the  Joint Declaration. On this point, Mrs. Thatcher recorded  clearly in her memoirs, "The Downing Street Years," in which she  said that on 14 October 1983, she sent a letter to the Chinese  side: "At this point, I have to make the decision that we shall  return sovereignty to China as well as the right to rule," "this  shows that we do not expect that power links between Britain and  Hong Kong will continue to exist after 1997, and Britain will no  longer have any obligations toward Hong Kong." Related  annotations in the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  also indicate that in the wake of the British Prime Minister's  letter of October 1983, "the British side has ascertained that  it would no longer insist on British rule nor would it plan for  any form of condominium, and has the understanding that China's  plan is founded on the prerequisite that sovereignty and right  of rule of Hong Kong in their entirety should be returned to  China after 1997. Thus, the removal of the main hurdle to  Sino-British talks began." Therefore, we can see that Chris  Patten's remarks that "the idea that the Joint Declaration means  to say Britain has no moral obligations and interests in Hong  Kong after 1997 is entirely contradictory" runs counter to the  true meaning of the Joint Declaration as well as historical  facts.    During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also threatened:  "If we think the Chinese are violating the solemn commitments  they have made in the Joint Declaration, we are sure to raise  this question in the international community...I am sure Britain  will inevitably make some choices." The truth is that the  British side has violated the Joint Declaration and its  commitment to converge with the Basic Law and the Sino-British  diplomatic understanding and accords, but Chris Patten went to  the Australia and made false countercharges against the Chinese  side in an attempt to confuse public opinion and shift the  responsibility to the Chinese side; at the same time, he  presented the British "choices" characterized by the "three  violations" to the international community to dupe people the  world over and fool them into giving their support. However,  all this is in vain. During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten  made many remarks which obviously violate the Joint Declaration;  in actual fact, he has only revealed the evil plots of the  British side in its attempts to thoroughly break faith with the  Joint Declaration. It would be helpful to the international  community and public opinion to have a clear picture of the  truth, and see through his hypocrisy. This being the case, the  "international card" Chris Patten played during his visit to  Australia can only help the British side in the opposite  direction.    As the Hong Kong governor who must be responsible for  maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and realizing a  stable transition in the last few years of the transition period  according to the stipulations of the Joint Declaration, should  Chris Patten have gone to another country to distort and trample  on the Joint Declaration, should he have stirred up trouble;  this shows that Chris Patten has not the slightest intention to  maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and to insure the  smooth transfer of government according to the stipulations of  the Joint Declaration. Whereas the British Government has given  a free hand to Chris Patten to talk a lot of nonsense in the  international community and spread remarks that obviously  violate the Joint Declaration. This also exposed the British  Government in its attempts to openly express its position of  refusing to implement the Joint Declaration to the international  community. Such a practice is rare in the history of  international relations and is amazing. Regarding this, we must  show grave concern. However, China's position of resolutely  safeguarding its sovereignty and implementing the Joint  Declaration will not move a bit. The British Government should  rein in from the brink of the precipice and should take  responsibility to publicly clarify Chris Patten's absurd remarks.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Home Office services get Pounds 150m increase - Police Funding for Home Office services will increase by Pounds 150m next year to Pounds 6.41bn, rising by a further Pounds 10m in 1996-97 and a further Pounds 150m to Pounds 6.57bn in 1997-98. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said provision for the police service would increase by 3 per cent next year, allowing police numbers to be maintained if chief constables, in consultation with police authorities, chose to do so. It would also permit police service reforms resulting from Sir Patrick Sheehy's review to be completed. 'By abolishing central controls on manpower, I am giving police authorities and chief officers much greater flexibility in the way they determine their spending priorities,' Mr Howard said. The 3 per cent rise, which will increase budgets in line with inflation, was given a cautious welcome by the Association of Chief Police Officers. 'There is no way that any police force could have afforded to lose money from its budget. We realise that the government is not going to throw money at public services and are prepared to work within constraints. However, the reality is that the demands upon the police are still increasing,' a spokesman said. Part of the increase is to meet the full costs of running a DNA database. Police powers to take DNA samples from suspects were widened by the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. Mr Howard said the new DNA database should be operational from March 1 1995. The government also signalled its intention to continue to increase the number of prison places. An extra 4,000 places will be provided by 1997-98. Almost 3,000 places would be built by the prison service but alongside this direct public expenditure on prisons the government is evaluating tenders for the first two privately financed prisons due to provide 1,200 places in 1997-98. Two more private prisons are planned in 1998-99, the first at Agecroft in Manchester. The new secure training centres for persistent juvenile offenders will also be built using private finance. Provision for the immigration and nationality department is planned to rise by 4 per cent next year to deal with increases in passenger traffic and asylum applications. Planned expenditure on legal aid will rise from an estimated out-turn of Pounds 1.33bn in 1994-95 to Pounds 1.46bn in 1995-96, Pounds 1.56bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 1.6bn in 1997-98. These figures represent a reduction in legal aid provision on expenditure outlined in last year's Budget. The Law Society said the reduction was a 'great disappointment'. Mr Russell Wallman of the society's legal aid directorate said the chancellor promised at the time he cut legal aid eligibility in 1993 that he would restore the cuts when the opportunity presented itself. 'The legal aid underspend of the last two years presented that opportunity, but instead of restoring the cuts the government has simply used the underspend to reduce legal aid provision,' he said. The government expects the numbers receiving legal aid to rise from 3.6m this year to 4.4m by 1997-98.</p>

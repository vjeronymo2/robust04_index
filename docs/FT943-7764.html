			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / As They Say in Europe: A tale of hits and myths - James Morgan on how the Jackal brought joy to editors' hearts You could feel the sense of relief. At last, the papers could ring the changes on the exhausting, grim stories that had dominated their news pages for so long. The arrest of Carlos the Jackal brought joy to every editor's heart. No matter that the man handed over by Sudan to the French was a bit of a bungler. No matter that his last escapade took place years before the end of communism. He was still the person remembered as the incarnation of international terrorism. The Frankfurter Rundschau said Carlos had moved through the international terrorist infrastructure in his earlier career like 'a fish through water'. But 1989 had created 'greater international transparency' which made it more difficult for him to hide behind 'progressive' regimes. The word that cropped up most often was 'myth' and the other Frankfurt daily, the Allgemeine Zeitung, made the most of the theme: 'A myth that has been detained is a myth no longer. That is the most important thing about the arrest of . . . Carlos.' (This might not be true: the detention of Napoleon probably enhanced the Bonapartist myth. One remembers the supposedly tragic, brooding figure on St Helena.) Madrid's El Pais called Carlos names which it might have eschewed had he been at large and at the top of his form. He was the 'joker of terror' and 'an armed dilettante'. But it, too, subscribed to the myth theory of the international killer; anybody who behaves like something out of a cheap paperback gains an aura of romance. In France itself, Le Figaro made its editorial a manifesto for the tough interior minister, Charles Pasqua. 'Every time he has had the job, he has pulled off a spectacular coup. He has now become kingmaker among the Gaullist contenders for the presidency in the election early next year.' Liberation reported that Sudan had been paid off with satellite pictures of the (Christian) rebels in the south of the country that enabled the (Islamic) government to wipe them out. Pasqua has made his name at home as the hammer of fundamentalist terrorism but, if Liberation is right, he is somewhat more flexible abroad. The Carlos story is one that reflects the continuing division of Europe. Although it was the east that provided his sanctuary for so long, Carlos is not well known there. His activities were hardly the stuff of news in the communist media; thus, his arrest had only a modest impact east of the Oder. Indeed, the Leipziger Volkszeitung managed to be wrong and banal in successive sentences: 'With the arrest of Carlos, a successful blow has been delivered against the nerve centre of international terrorism. But the world is still not safe from terrorist attacks.' Elsewhere in the former communist world, reports were straightforward, even dull. So, a commentary in the Prague daily Mlada Fronta Dnes seemed, at first, surprising. 'Justice has finally caught up with at least some of those who, in their time, mercilessly liquidated the class enemy,' it began. This, however, turned out to have nothing to do with Carlos but, rather, with charges against a 'former torturer' once employed in political prisons in Bohemia. The paper added: 'Bringing the perpetrators of communist brutalities to court is a more genuine contribution to the de-communisation of society than any well-meant but empty ideological appeal.' By comparison, the trial of Carlos will be virtually meaningless. In eastern Europe, the retired terrorist is not some glamorous figure in an exotic capital but the civil servant next door. In spite of its local preoccupations, the Interior Ministry in Prague rummaged through its predecessor's archives and revealed the less-than-glamorous truth about Carlos. The Czech news agency reported that the records showed Carlos visited Prague frequently from 1978 to 1986 on a South Yemen diplomatic passport. But all governments in the region were getting fed up with him and, gradually, he fell out of favour. They accepted him, only to pass him on as soon as possible to an ally. Being a myth, it seems, was not really all that much fun. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

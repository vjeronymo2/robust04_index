			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: The return of a rare breed - London's newest bond broking house AGENCY brokers are a rare breed in the bond markets. Fund managers have grown accustomed to dealing without commissions, trading at net prices with banks which act as underwriters and market-makers as well as brokers. But a growing band of specialists believes that it is time to bring back traditional independent broking skills to the fixed-income markets. The latest bond broking house to emerge, the London Bond Broking Company, was announced yesterday in London. It is not alone: bond broking houses set up so far in the 1990s include Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick and Sebbco in London, and Bridport in Geneva. All three were created on the same assumption: that investors will be prepared to pay for independent advice in a market where they have received research and advice 'free' up to now. London Bond Broking is run by three former employees of Phillips &amp; Drew, including Mr Stephen Lewis, a respected economist who left in 1988 to run his own research house. The company is 55 per cent owned by Albert E Sharp, a Birmingham-based broker. Sharp scored a big success in the late 1980s when it was one of the backers of Sharelink, one of the new breed of execution-only brokers set up to deal for retail investors, and it reckons it has picked another winner, given the growing interest of UK institutions in the bond markets. 'The age of the bond . . . has finally arrived,' said Mr Lewis yesterday. It was not long ago that the bond markets faced an uncertain future, as governments cut their fiscal deficits and companies found banks queueing up to lend them money at ludicrous rates. Investors prefered the racy profits apparently offered by the equity markets. That has all changed, says Mr Lewis - a view supported by recent pronouncements from institutions like Norwich Union and Legal &amp; General, which have turned their attentions to the fixed-income markets. Commission levels, though, are unlikely to return to what they were before the Big Bang reforms which swept them away London Bond Broking, which will focus initially on government bond markets, plans to charge 1/32 per cent, well below the  1/8 per cent that was once standard on bond trades. Higher commissions are available outside the government bond markets. Luthy Bailey, which specialises in less-heavily traded bonds, charges up to 1 per cent, though commissions average 0.1 per cent - still below the standard 0.2 per cent payable in the equity market.</p>

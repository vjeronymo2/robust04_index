			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by B. Geroski: "`Evidence' on Gligorov's Desk"] </F>   [Text] As we have discovered from a number of informal  discussions in the delegates' group of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for  Macedonian National Unity], yesterday a delegation of this  party, consisting of Ljupco Georgievski, president, Dosta  Dimovska, vice president, and Boris Zmejkovski, secretary  general, was received by Kiro Gligorov, president of the  Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FRYOM] just before the beginning of a new parliamentarian  session. The same sources claim that the president was  presented with "documentary evidence" of the state security  service's involvement in the latest events within this party.  <H5>  Denial </H5>   Allegedly, it was a "evidence" to show that the VMRO-DPMNE  had again been bugged, as well as a "document of the state  security service" in which some of the delegates of this  parliamentary group (the factionists) were mentioned under coded  names. Yesterday, Georgievski, Dimovska, and Zmejkovski were  hesitant about commenting on the meeting, and we were told to  wait for the statement expected to be issued by the president's  office. Nevertheless, we registered that they were not prepared  to submit this evidence in formal proceedings of the competent  parliamentary commission for control over the work of the state  security service, headed by the factionist Stoile Stojkov.    Georgievski reiterated his denial of the claim made by  Stojkov and Stefkovski that he had sent them to Gligorov to  discuss the flag. We have unofficially found out that such a  meeting was held with Stefkovski, Stojkov, Jordan Boskov, and  Tome Stojanovski. However, according to yesterday's version,  delegate Stojkov came out with his own initiative for replacing  the 16-pointed star on the flag with the double tailed lion.  <H5>  Claims </H5>   Yesterday we also spoke to the other side -- the delegates  Stojkov and Stefkovski. They both claimed they were still in  the VMRO-DPMNE and they were also sure that their option would  win in this party. Stefkovski said that they did not intend to  attack Georgievski and Dimovska, because they considered they  were not the actual leaders of the party, in which the alleged  leaders are Zmejkovski, Dinevski, Sokolov, and Florovski.  Stefkovski pointed out that in an informal discussion with  Georgievski they had agreed not to attack each other mutually,  but the leader broke the agreement in his interview for VECER.  Besides, Stefkovski claimed that, according to the party  statute, Georgievski could in no way be elected coordinator of  the delegates' group, because Article 30 paragraph 2 of the  Statute says that the leader and the deputy of the delegate  group are proposed by the president of the party (in this case  Georgievski proposed himself, the factionists claimed).    The general impression of your chronicler is that there is  total dissatisfaction within the ranks of the VMRO-DPMNE  delegates' group, but also beyond it, within the opposition  circles, because of the fact that the affair has acquired such  dimensions. They are now making rapid attempts to work out how  to correct what should have been corrected a long time ago, at  the time the people of this party decided to embark on fierce  mutual showdowns.  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  "Clarification of Legal Procedure" </H5>   Yesterday Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov received the  leaders of the VMRO-DPMNE at their request, that is, the party  president, vice president, and general secretary, Ljupco  Georgievski, Dosta Dimovska, and Boris Zmejkovski. Their  request for a meeting with President Gligorov was based on the  explanation that they wanted to inform him about the state  security service's attitude toward the opposition and that they  wanted to hand over to him documented evidence. According to  their claims, it had to do with telephone bugging and operations  of the state security service involving a number of VMRO-DPMNE  delegates.    At the very beginning President Gligorov emphasized that,  according to his constitutional and legal authority, he was in  no position to examine the involvement of the state security  service in internal party relations. By clearly defined  constitutional and legal authority, he expressed his firm belief  that questions of this kind had to be raised and dealt with  within the framework of the defined legal procedure. In that  sense, President Gligorov emphasized that, under the  Constitution, the only competent place to discuss information or  suspicions about the state security service's attitude toward  the VMRO-DPMNE was the Macedonian parliamentary commission for  control over the work of the state security service, and that  was the appropriate place to discuss documents related to  initiating proceedings with the competent bodies -- the public  prosecutor and the appropriate court. That is the only way to  avoid speculation or rumors surrounding such serious charges.  It is also the only way to safeguard the basic principles of  democracy, respect for the law and management of the authorities  in the republic.    President Gligorov also stressed that, in the present  preelection period, it was especially important to create a  democratic atmosphere and respect for the law as a permanent  political orientation in the republic. That will help to  reinforce the feeling inside and outside the country of respect  for the basic national interests and the maintenance of the  integrity of our country, in the face of either internal  conflicts or foreign pretensions. The VMRO-DPMNE agreed with  this appeal of the president's.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Getting into the swing - Fishing / Tom Fort meets a master caster In Scotland earlier this year, I met a master caster with the fine Scottish name of Willie Matheson. I was on the Beauly and trying, with my 15ft carbon rod, to propel my fly far enough to reach one of very few salmon in the river. Actually, I thought I was doing quite well. But his arrival put matters in perspective. I was using the overhead cast as I usually do, simply because it comes easiest. There is nothing wrong with the overhead cast assuming there are no trees, bushes, fences, grazing Highland cattle or other obstacles behind; and that a gale is not tearing over your right shoulder. In other words, it is a flawed technique. There is another method known as speycasting which, in one or other of its variants, enables the salmon fisher to overcome the problems associated with the overhead cast. Put very simply, the speycast involves creating a moving loop of line which, when unfurled, sends the fly across the stream. Its sublime virtue is that at no point does the line go behind the angler. Vegetation and lurking livestock are safe. It took Matheson to bring home the beautiful efficiency of the speycast. He is head gillie on the Beauly and knows how to deal diplomatically with duffers, so he was gentle with me. He also has, or had, a back so bad that he could hardly walk. He hobbled over, picked up my rod, eased out the line and performed a minor miracle. He swept the rod up on his left, across in front of his face, and punched it out on his right side. The loop flew across the river, straightened, and the fly broke the surface an incredible distance away. It was the economy and effortlessness of his performance which were so delightful. There was no exertion, no strain. It looked as straightforward as turning the page of a book. But it isn't. It is extremely difficult and let no one kid you otherwise. At least, that is my experience. With Matheson at my side, I tried. But the harder I tried, the more inept the results. The secret, of course, is in the timing - as with a cover drive in cricket or a three-iron approach shot in golf. Brute strength is of little help without co-ordination and that essential 'feel'. Willie was encouraging as he left me; keep at it, he said, keep practising. It's the only way. But you need a teacher, and the supreme one of our times is, beyond doubt, Hugh Falkus. Indeed, he is one of angling's great figures. Two of his books, Sea Trout Fishing and Salmon Fishing, have become standard texts, shedding light on what were once mysteries for countless anglers. His Freshwater Fishing - which he wrote with Fred Buller - is a wonderful storehouse of learning and sage counsel. For years, Falkus has been running casting courses near his home on the Cumbrian Esk. By most accounts, these were pretty gruelling affairs, for the man is not noted for indulgence and compassion. But, for those who could stand the pace, the experience was often formative. Now, the lessons barked across the water at his cowering pupils have been assembled in his new book called Speycasting: A New Technique, published by the great man's friend, David Burnett (Excellent Press, 103 Lonsdale Road, London SW13 9DA). The price of Pounds 25 is less than a tenth of the price of a new carbon salmon rod. The help it should give you in getting the best out of that rod makes it a sound investment. I do not intend to go into Falkus's new technique, partly because it defies simplification and mainly because I do not begin to grasp it - yet. The text is certainly no literary classic, nor should it be. The voice is that of an elderly, opinionated, irascible prep schoolmaster addressing a gaggle of more or less ignorant boys. But the unrelieved didacticism does not matter if the lesson is sound - which, I would guess, this is. The photographs, arranged mainly in sequences like stills from a film, give as fluid and vivid an impression of the techniques as a book could possibly provide. The great majority of them feature Falkus himself, white-maned, stern-faced, in an interesting selection of threadbare jerseys. I am told that he is now in poor health. So, if this should prove to be his last testament, it is a worthy one. Certainly, it has hardened my resolve to grapple with these disciplines. Practise, practise, practise - I can almost hear him saying it. Who knows: it might even, one day, turn me into a half-decent salmon fisherman.</p>

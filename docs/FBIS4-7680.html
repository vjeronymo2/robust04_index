			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dan Andronic and Radu Tudor: "KGB Is Behind the </F> Petromin-Forum Affair"]    [Text] EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has entered into possession of a  number of sensational photographs proving that both Adrian  Nastase, current executive chairman of the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania and Traian Chebeleu, counselor of  President Ion Iliescu, felt honored to be able to hold talks  with a person whom now they reject, namely the Greek shipping  tycoon Ioannis Alafouzos. [Article is accompanied by two  photographs, one showing, among other persons, Nastase and  Alafouzos, with the caption: "Adrian Nastase held talks lasting  an hour and a half with the Greek shipping tycoon Ioannis  Alafouzos. In those days they used to be friends;" the other  photograph shows Alafouzos shaking hands with Chebeleu, with the  caption: "Traian Chebeleu, all honey, amiably shaking hands  with Ioannis Alafouzos, whom, after a short while, he would be  denigrating!"]    The photographs were taken in 1990, at the official opening  of the Ermis company in Bucharest, when Adrian Nastase and  Traian Chebeleu chatted with Greek shipping tycoon Ioannis  Alafouzos. The difference between 1990 and 1994 is that in 1990  Iannis Alafouzos was one of the supporters of the Mitsotakis  government, which was very close to President Ion Iliescu's  heart. The moment the Greek shipping tycoon switched sides and  began to support Andreas Papandreou, the most bitter adversary  of Konstandinos Mitsotakis, both Adrian Nastase and Traian  Chebeleu changed their tune.    According to last-minute data in the possession of  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, one of the intelligence services --  definitely not the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service] -- has  elaborated a report that established that the KGB is massively  involved in the famed case of the attempted sale of the Romanian  strategic fleet, also known as the Petromin-Forum Maritime  affair.    As we already mentioned, the photographs date back to 1990.  About that year, in issue No. 533 of our daily, soccer player  Danut Lupu stated that he had to return to Greece because of the  pressure that had been exerted on him by the [Romanian] Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, led at the time by Adrian Nastase. He  explained having been pressured by the fact that "shipping  tycoon Vardinoianis, owner of the Greek Panathinaikos soccer  club, had large business operations in Romania."    The aforementioned intelligence service report proves the  incontestible links between the Greek shipping tycoon  Vardinoianis and the Moscow intelligence services, especially  the KGB, on the orders of which he initiated a massive operation  intended to purchase the 96 vessels belonging to Petromin.  Those 96 vessels represented an essential component of our  national security system.    The sum of $125 million with which the Greek shipping tycoon  Stelianos Katounis was to buy the Petromin fleet comes,  according to the cited report, from KGB funds, via shipping  tycoon Vardinoianis.    We would like to remind our readers that the following  persons were ardent supporters of striking a deal with the  Greeks in the famous attempted sale of the Romanian strategic  fleet: Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu; Paul Teodoru,  former minister of transportation, currently counselor of the  prime minister; Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, former  presidential counselor and former secretary of the Country's  Supreme Defense Council. According to information revealed by  other dailies, the whole affair was closely supervised by  presidential counselor Colonel General Vasile Ionel.</p>

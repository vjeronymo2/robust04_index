			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 28 May (MENA) -- The PLO Executive Committee,  meeting under the chairmanship of Yasir 'Arafat, today approved  the Palestinian National Authority's program of action for the  coming stage.    Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah said after the  meeting that the Committee introduced some amendments to the  program that the Palestinian National Authority Council had  discussed and approved last night. Ghawshah added that this is  an interim program that will be used until general elections are  held in the West Bank and Gaza.    He declared that the program demonstrates that the National  Authority will carry out its tasks through the concerned  departments in a spirit of national commitment and will rely on  Palestinian experts in various fields.    Ghawshah announced that the Palestinian National Authority  is  committed to all the agreements, treaties, and charters signed  by the PLO and that it will seek to implement the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, "the Gaza-Jericho  Agreement," as a first step toward the restoration of the  Palestinian people's legitimate rights.    He said the program approved today emphasizes Palestine's  Arabness and the National Authority's desire to nurture close  ties with the Arab countries. He noted that the program also  stresses the National Authority's adherence to UN resolutions,  particularly Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.    [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1810 GMT on 28 May reports: "The  Palestinian National Authority Council today appointed Dr.  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad a member of the Council and minister  of transport and communications. He is the 15th minister  named."]    [The MENA report continues: "Faysal al-Husayni and Munib  al-Masri remain members of the Palestinian National Authority  Council, but without portfolios. Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi has refused  to be a member of the Council even though 'Arafat offered her  the information portfolio. Sari Nusaybah has so far neither  accepted nor declined 'Arafat's selection of him as a National  Authority Council member. Faysal al-Husayni had formerly  announced that he wished to devote his time to the Jerusalem  issue and did not want to assume a ministerial post."]</p>

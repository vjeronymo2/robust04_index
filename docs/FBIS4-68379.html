			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rally In Front of Kirov"] </F>   [Text] The theme of the rally at the gates of the Kirov  plant was as follows: The government is not considering the  demands of the labor collectives and not paying attention to  their voice when drawing up state programs.    About 4,000 people participated in the rally, including  representatives of several of the city's enterprises. The  leaders of the association did not participate in the rally, but  Kirov's general director, Petr Semenenko, said that they were  sympathetic toward the demands of the trade unions and  considered them just.    The trade unions' demands are known: for the government to  develop an economic policy that would stimulate production. We  have a unique situation today: We have raw material, we have  production capacities, we have people, but nobody is working  because the government policy makes it disadvantageous to work.    In any case the militia was invited to the rally and there  were no excesses. The question now is as follows: Will the  government take the demands developed by the city's trade union  aktiv and supported by the rally seriously enough or will it  ignore them? If the government perceives the rally not as a  demonstration of force but as an ordinary political measure, we  will arrive at the situation that developed in Russia in 1905.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Second arrest in Schneider inquiry The Belgian investigation into Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Groupe Schneider, broadened with the announcement yesterday of the arrest of an Italian businessmen as part of a fraud inquiry involving Belgian subsidiaries of the electrical engineering company. Belgian justice officials said yesterday that Mr Valentino Foti had been detained on the same charges as Mr Pineau-Valencienne. The Schneider chairman, held in Brussels since his arrest on Friday, is charged with fraud and falsification of accounts. This follows an investigation triggered by complaints from minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two Belgian subsidiaries of the French company. Mr Foti, 60, appears to be linked to the investigation through his role in PB Finance, a shell company which used to have interests in mining. He was the majority shareholder in PB Finance, in which Schneider held a minority stake through Cofibel. Groupe Schneider sold its stake in PB Finance earlier this year and has firmly denied reports in the Belgian press which claim the company may have been involved in money-laundering. Mr Pineau-Valencienne and Mr Foti both presented themselves voluntarily in Brussels to make statements concerning an investigation into the management of Schneider's Belgian subsidiaries. They are both due to appear in court tomorrow when a decision will be taken on whether to prolong their custody. Industry observers in Paris played down the impact of the events on Schneider. 'The Belgian companies represent only 5 per cent of the Schneider group assets which would suggest that the financial effect of these complaints will not threaten the group as a whole,' said one market analyst. Shares in the company, which fell by 5.6 per cent on Friday following the announcement of Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrest, rose yesterday by FFr10 to FFr400. French businessmen and the media have reacted with dismay to Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrest. French prime minister Edouard Balladur telephoned his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, at the weekend to discuss the issue.</p>

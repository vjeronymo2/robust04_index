			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Fashion: The vim and verve of Versace - Actress Elizabeth Hurley caused a sensation when she wore Versace to a film premiere in London recently. At his Milan palazzo, Lucia van der Post talks to the Italian couturier about his work Gianni Versace, 47-years-old, Italian couturier to the rock and film star set, is used to brick-bats. Where Giorgio Armani, that other icon of Italian fashion, gets the fashion editors' plaudits - 'so refined, so restrained, so elegant' - Versace often leaves them gasping. 'Scarlet O'Horror' shrieked a recent headline. 'Tartwear' another one calls it, while 'vulgar', 'pornographic', and 'tatty' are epithets he has become inured to. He should care. On the day I visited him in his ravishing Milan palazzo, once the home of the Rizzoli family and now his home and office, his brother Santo (in charge of the counting house) interrupts to wave some figures at us. 'Last Saturday,' he tells me, 'we did the most business we have ever done in a single day in our shop on the Monte Napoleone.' Some L734.73m (Pounds 305,000) was taken at the tills. This is probably not unconnected with the fact that Elton John and Eric Clapton, two of Versace's most ardent groupies, famously given to rock-star style shopping extravaganzas, were in town. Nevertheless, it is impressive evidence that, in spite of the fashion editors' sneers, someone out there likes Versace. It is not just the rock and film-stars who keep Versace in palazzos. The small boy from Reggio Calabria who fell in love with designing ('Designing came to me,' he tells me. 'I didn't have to move.') while watching his mother stitching a little black dress in Reggio Calabria more than 40 years ago, these days commands an empire that turns over Pounds 400m a year. In spite of the recession, sales in 1993 were up 8 per cent over the year before and now there is talk of floating the company. Currently it is family-owned, shared between himself, his brother, Santo, and sister, Donatella. He has bought back his own perfume from the Yves St Laurent corporation. His Versus range, although started only four years ago, turns over L70bn a year and even as we speak sales expansion is planned in Russia and China. Santo seems confident that turnover can be doubled in the next three to four years and, in spite of the immense expense of launching a splendidly baroque-style marble palace shop two years ago, a new Versace outlet (this time for Versus, the younger range, and Istante, the . . . um . . . classic range) opens at 92 Brompton Road, London SW1 on June 16. His high-profile and international fame have all been achieved in an extraordinarily short time. For years he used to show just in Italy and at the ready-to-wear shows, and he did not embark on an haute couture collection until 1989. It was not a quiet debut. Rhine-stone studded dungarees and jeans were not what Paris had in mind when thinking of haute couture. Paris was shocked 'But it isn't couture,' they said as one. Gianni Versace was unfazed. Chanel, he reminds me, was equally denigrated when she first took to the catwalk and look where her reputation is today. Today he is generally credited with having generated new excitement, of having given couture a much-needed shot-in-the-arm just when it seemed to have run out of steam. Versace himself believes in the importance of haute couture. 'Couture has to update itself. It must be modern. If you do couture as I do it (modesty, you will have observed, is not a Versace trait) and as Lagerfeld and Lacroix do it, then most certainly it has a place today. But that Balmain approach to couture - the huge hat, the stiff woman, that is so demode. 'I use haute couture as a laboratory to experiment with new ideas. Because I am forced to do another collection I have to experiment and to change, to produce new ideas. There is a difference between a dressmaker and a designer who pushes forward into new areas. 'Couture is also very important for the craft - if we had no couture we would lose all those wonderful skills.' And indeed even his most ardent critics never deny the skills that go into the Versace collections - the cut, the exquisite embroideries and beading, the finish, the beautiful fabrics. Diana Vreeland, the great editor of American Vogue, was one of the first to recognise his talent. For years she said she used to go to Italy expecting to find someone to take the international stage but it wasn't until she came upon the work of Versace that she thought she had found it. 'I have never seen anyone,' she told him as she hugged him, 'drape a dress so well and in such little time.' He sees his clothes as vehicles which allow a woman to express herself and he cites Diana Vreeland as a marvellous example of a woman who made Versace clothes her own. 'She was 80 years old,' he said, 'and she used to wear a black sweater by Azeddine Alaia and black leather pants of mine and she wore them like no 20-year-old could wear them. 'I want to go back to cut,' he says. 'Diana Vreeland introduced me to the work of a wonderful English designer called Charles James - 'You know him? No? Oh, you must learn about him' - the inside of his dresses are as beautiful as the outside. I have never seen a French or American produce such beautifully made dresses. They are all about pure line and pure cut and this is what interests me now.' He is very respectful of the past: 'When you are born in a place such as Calabria and there is beauty all around - a Roman bath, a Greek remain - you cannot help but be influenced by the classical past.' Almost all his collections are filled with visual references to history  - Grecian motifs, baroque images, Etruscan symbols, Medusa's head. He loves to mix fabrics, juxtaposing leather with silk, cashmere with tweed, teaming jeans with brocade jackets, putting rhinestones on dungarees. Looking back over his collections there are bewildering sources of inspiration - part happy hooker, part hippie, part punk, part Grecian goddess, part sweet virgin - the references are endless and varied. Each collection tends to explore a theme which is not always immediately understood by the frock-fanciers in the audience. The bondage collection was about more than just trying to shock. Says Versace: 'It was my contribution to the debate about the freedom of women to appear as they want.' As always with Versace it was part theatre, part serious and part just sheer high spirits. New ideas seem to bubble up endlessly. 'Seven years ago,' he tells me, 'I was in Venice in a shop selling things for scuba diving and it so appealed to me that I sent my people to explore how to stitch without stitching, using a laser.' Before that he had discovered how to use metallic mesh by borrowing from techniques from aeroplane makers. Out of that he produced one of the most sensually draped evening dresses ever to grace a catwalk. But Versace never stands still. A few seasons ago he did something truly shocking - he went simple. Down the catwalk came exquisite exercises in flowing little columns, beautifully cut, unadorned, elongated vests and T-shirts. The press was overwhelmed. But it proved to be just another playful episode in the Versace story. This season it was back to vintage Versace, bib-fronted mini-dresses in PVC, references to punk and rock 'n' roll. At their best they are beautifully made. No one who saw the actress Elizabeth Hurley in the sculpted column of wool crepe erotically held together by safety pins could deny the precision of the cutting, the craft behind the form or doubt his ability to cut with skill and contour a dress exquisitely to the body. 'People,' says Gianni Versace, 'are very smart. The shoppers are the best judge. If you put the right dress in the window and they like it they buy it. Otherwise they don't. I have learned to trust the ordinary shopper.' He could also have added that these smart people must also be very rich, for a jacket can easily cost Pounds 1,500, a whisp of a mini-dress Pounds 2,000 and a full-blown evening stunner anything between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 10,000. He may be teaming silk brocade with denim jeans, decking them out with spangles, using safety pins on everything from handbags to slithers of wool crepe, beads on brassieres, jewels on teeteringly high-heeled shoes. In Versace's world nothing is ever very simple (though, confusingly, he claims to be so classic 'as to be almost boring') - he loves ambiguity, fantasy, complexity, combinations of apparently opposite elements. For good taste he cares not a jot and to judge Versace by the standards of so-called 'good taste' is entirely to miss the point. 'I don't believe in good taste,' he tells me, 'I don't believe in bad taste. I believe in quality and in fun, in things that make our life better or happier. What you like,' he believes, 'is good taste. A woman who is very sexy and fun is infinitely more appealing to me than one who is formally chic.' John Miles, Professor of Fashion and Textiles at the Royal College of Art, is in no doubt about his importance. 'He has such verve and vim. Take his new book Designs (published June 9 by Abbeywell, Pounds 42). It is filled with wonderful vitality and will probably become a classic for students.' Ultimately it is the element of risk that gives a Versace show its peculiar edge, its unique sense of danger. There is always the chance that he might come a tremendous cropper, that he might cross from the playfully erotic into the irretrievably trashy. In the risk, evidently, is the challenge, the excitement that is behind the Versace drive. As for Gianni himself, it is abundantly evident he is a happy man. He is laughing all the way to his opulent new house in Miami. Others may keep the good reviews, he will make do with the cheques.</p>

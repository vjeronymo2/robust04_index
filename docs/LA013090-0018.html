			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP'S PLAN FOR AMBASSADOR SITE  </P> <P> In commenting on Trump's lofty scheme for the old Ambassador site (Part A, Jan.  16), Robert A. Jones suggests the project overcome the ranking that has so long  plagued L.A. Boosterism: "biggest west of the Mississippi."  </P> <P> It can be done! -- by turning to advantage an equally onerous pricing policy,  "slightly higher West of the Rockies" (which even today sometimes crops up in  an ad in the New Yorker). All it takes is a towering building whose upper  stories are mounted on giant jacks. They would thrust Los Angeles' masterpiece  slightly higher than any other building, any other place, which tried to  surmount it.  </P> <P> It would be called, of course, the Wild Jack.  </P> <P> CHARLES T. NEWTON  </P> <P> Del Mar  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Who Pays for Peace Mission?"] </F>   [Text] Hopes of a speedy peaceful political settlement in  Tajikistan have proved unjustified on this occasion too. The  talks between the Tajikistan official authorities and the armed  opposition have been deferred. Nor did the recent meeting of  foreign ministers of Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and  Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] during which a desperate attempt was made  to set up the dialogue broken off after the murder of Tajik Vice  Premier Moyensho Nazarshoyev produce the expected results.  Incidentally, Nazarshoyev should have headed the government  delegation.    Naturally these unreassuring results in no way mean an end  to  attempts to set up the negotiations process with the opposition.  But, as Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stressed in Dushanbe  after meeting with his counterparts from the Central Asian  states, "...it is still too early to say when these efforts will  produce results and it will be possible to hold talks."    Seeking the culprits in this situation is a complex matter.  But some mass media seem to have been very successful here.  And, in accusing both the official authorities and the  opposition, they cite new culprits -- the military. Those  Russian servicemen who for two years now have been risking their  lives to "hold" the Tajik-Afghan border and fulfilling their  peacekeeping mission within the collective peacekeeping forces.  Frankly, it is hard to think of anything more absurd.  Moreover, stories have appeared that the "military lobby" is  allegedly using every effort to try to acquire the status of  peacekeeping forces under UN auspices in order to acquire  certain benefits....    Please, good gentlemen! The Russian 201st motorized rifle  division deployed in Tajikistan (nearly 6,000 men) has in fact  for two years been performing peacekeeping functions without  this status. We shall not list these functions -- KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA has been writing of them constantly since the very start  of the civil war in Tajikistan. Other central newspapers also  regularly report the complex situation of the Russian servicemen  who have found themselves at the epicenter of bloody events.    That is the first point. The second is that of the 16,000  Russian servicemen now serving in what are called trouble spots  only 1,200 (in the former Yugoslavia) have the official status  of peacekeeping forces. The others are as they say "simply  serving under fire." Expenditure on their maintenance and  backup has recently increased by a factor of 10-15 as was  reported 16 March at a press conference by Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev. And the money for this is found from the already  meager military budget. As a result many military programs,  primarily social programs, are being disrupted. Less housing is  being construction, the defense complex is in a fevered state,  and there is a lack of money for the most essential things for  the troops' normal functioning....    As for the further development of events in Tajikistan  itself, it may boldly be asserted that there is still a long way  to go until peace and calm there. Politicians, the Foreign  Ministry assured us, will do everything possible to ensure that  talks with the opposition take place. The military, come what  may, will ensure the conditions without which these talks are  not possible at all.</p>

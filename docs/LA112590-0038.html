			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> GET EDGE ON QUALITY IN BUILDING WITH PLYWOOD;  </P> <P> FINISH: THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO DISPLAY WORKMANSHIP MAKING THE ROUGH EDGES OF  BOARDS LOOK SMOOTH.  </P> <P> If you're building a piece of furniture, ripping some shelving from a sheet of  plywood or fabricating a countertop for plastic laminate or ceramic tile, the  way you finish the edges will reflect the quality of your workmanship.  </P> <P> Plywood got its name because thin layers, or plies, of wood were glued together  at right angles to each other, which provided stability and rigidity, in a  manufacturing process that yielded more usable wood from each log. However, the  process also resulted in a panel with a rough edge. Chipboard -- made by mixing  and compressing small chips of wood in an adhesive -- also has a rough edge  that requires special treatment.  </P> <P> You have many edge-finishing options that you can exercise, depending on the  project, your skill and your tools.  </P> <P> A very popular way to conceal the end grain is to miter the corners, as  illustrated in Figure 1. However, this requires a table or radial arm saw,  absolutely flat material and some skill on your part.  </P> <P> Probably the mostly widely used edge treatment -- because it's easier and more  economical -- is to fill the edge grain with a paste wood filler, sand the  filler smooth and repeat the application until the grain no longer is visible,  as illustrated in Figure 2.  </P> <P> Another technique that is faster but slightly more expensive is to glue and  nail decorative molding to the front (see Figure 3). This is an especially fine  technique when making a coffee table or decorative shelving.  </P> <P> If you are working with expensive hardwood panels, such as birch or mahogany,  and plan to show the natural grain and color of the wood, your edge treatment  should be to adhere a strip of the same type wood to the edge, as shown in  Figure 4. A contact adhesive is best, and the veneer should be at least  one-eighth inch wider than the thickness of the plywood. When in place, the  protruding edge of the veneer can be easily cut away with a plane, razor or  even sanded so it is flush with the top.  </P> <P> If you are building a kitchen countertop or making shelves that require  additional reinforcement, the edge treatment illustrated in Figure 5 is best.  Screw and nail straight white pine pieces, sand smooth and you are ready for  covering the surface and edge with ceramic tile or the most widely used  countertop material, decorative plastic laminate.  </P></p>

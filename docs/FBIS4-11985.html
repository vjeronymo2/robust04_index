The communique states that: The repetition of such futile  claims will not change whatsoever the fact that the three  islands belong to Iran.    In the communique, the Foreign Ministry stressed: Iran  continues to take the initiative in direct talks with the  Emirates and continues to ask this country -- rather than  resorting to a commotion that will have no result, let alone  that will cause greater complexity and will aggravate the  difficulties -- to prove its good will in bilateral talks  towards the clarification of any form of misunderstanding in the  form of the letter by Shaykh Zayid, the head of United Arab  Emirates to the president of Iran.    Also, regarding the issue of hajj, in the communique the  Foreign Ministry stressed the freedom of the press in the  Islamic Republic of Iran and regretted the inability of the  Council's statement to appreciate this fact -- and called on  Saudi Arabia to respect and implement the agreement between the  foreign ministers of the two countries regarding the number of  pilgrims and the administration the Disavowal of Infidels  Ceremonies, and that since the agreement was reached after the  meeting of foreign ministers of Islamic countries in Amman, it  called on Saudi officials to act towards better administration  of this important divine duty, instead of breaching promises and  creating difficulties in the execution of this Muslim's  pilgrimage.</p>

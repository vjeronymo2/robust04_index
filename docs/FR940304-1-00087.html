			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rebuttable Presumption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For consideration of rebuttable presumptions, the Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers stated that incremental payback, not cumulative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payback, are the appropriate payback for standards. (Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 64).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the legislation requires that payback be considered from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level compared to the base case, DOE believes that only cumulative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payback may be used for the rebuttable presumption determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the other impacts of appliance conservation standards on energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, consumers, manufacturers, and other factors were determined by comparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections under the base case <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  with the projections under the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The base case assumes implementation of the conservation standards that were set by the Act for central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps and furnaces and by Department of Energy rulemaking in the case of refrigerators-freezers and freezers and small gas furnaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Standards Decision Making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Natural Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed the Department's standards selection criteria. Both Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Defense Council and the Rocky Mountain Institute stated that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deciding the economic justification of standards, the Department should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempting to maximize the economic benefits to consumers, but should instead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be maximizing energy savings. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16; Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Department recognizes that the basic statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direction to set standards is to achieve the ``maximum improvement in energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency that the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically justified'' (section 325(l)(2)(A). DOE notes that the economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of standards on consumers is only one of the factors the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers in reaching its decision to set conservation standards. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors include impacts on manufacturers and on national benefits and costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, regarding consumer benefits, while the minimum consumer life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost point is selected as a trial standard level, and in many cases, the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent standard level that the Secretary determined was economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified coincided with that level, several of the proposed standard levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have life-cycle costs that exceed the minimum life-cycle cost. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximizing consumer benefits does not take precedence over maximizing energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Resources Defense Council further stated that in deciding on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels, the Department must first consider the most stringent level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of efficiency, i.e., the ``max tech'' level, and if it is economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified, DOE must set the standard at that level. If it is not economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified, DOE must then consider the next most stringent level, and if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically justified, set the standard at that level. (Natural Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defense Council, No. 13 at 17).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does consider candidate standard levels in this manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in making its determination as to whether a standard is economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justified, the Department considers both: The benefits and costs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level under consideration relative to the base case; and how these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits and costs compare to the benefits and costs of other standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed by the Department in the technical support document for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently the costs and benefits of all candidate standard levels are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed in comparison to the base case. However, it is possible that more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct comparisons of the impacts of different standard levels may be useful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the above, the Department specifically solicits comment on whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any incremental perspectives would be useful and valid in the determination as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to whether a particular standard level is ``economically justified.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Florida Energy Office stated that after considering all relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs and benefits over the life of the appliance, the Department should set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards at the highest levels that are cost-effective to the nation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Florida Energy Office, No. 42 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN HISTORY, A SAGA OF IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> After reading the editorial letters "Westminster Vietnamese and Former CIA  Chief" (April 23), I was totally disgusted at a few negative letters  criticizing an ethnic group: the Vietnamese in Orange County.  </P> <P> Being one of the "boat people" a few years back and now a U.S. citizen, I am  very proud of my adopted country, the United States, as the country with the  greatest history of immigration.  </P> <P> Our ancestors, as well as our people today, have welcomed millions of  immigrants from the poor countries, war torn lands and even our former enemy  countries, to come over here to fulfill their American dreams. Because this is  the land of freedom and opportunities, the land of liberty and justice, we are  proud to call ourselves Americans.  </P> <P> DINH NGUYEN  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

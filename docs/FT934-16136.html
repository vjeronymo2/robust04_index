			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Ukraine's currency plummets TRADING on Kiev's currency exchange was suspended yesterday after Ukraine's interim currency, the karbovanets, plunged 10 per cent to 18,700 to the dollar from 17,000 last week, Reuter reports. 'The currency exchange committee stopped the trading session to prevent the collapse of the karbovanets,' said the market's spokesman. He said that bankers lobbying for the repeal of regulations blamed for the currency's decline were due to meet Mr Yefim Zvyagilsky, acting prime minister, later in the day. Under current rules, enterprises must sell half their hard currency earnings at a fixed rate, which has stood at 5,970 since mid-August.</p>

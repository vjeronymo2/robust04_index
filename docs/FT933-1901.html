			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Poor prospects seen for incomesin east Europe IT will take 35 years for eastern European incomes to reach even half the level of average western incomes under current predictions for economic growth, Mr John Flemming, the chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said yesterday. His sober prediction came as the EBRD issued its annual economic outlook, which examines the pace of economic reform in eastern Europe, four years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. With the economic fortunes of east European countries varying enormously, the bank refrains from proscribing a single solution for transition to market economies. But with all east European countries experiencing a contraction in their economies in the past three years, ranging from a fall in GDP of 19.4 per cent in Georgia to 3.1 per cent in Belarus, the report warns that overall recovery may be slower than previously hoped. Although most economists agree that growth will resume in 1994, predictions vary wildly, Mr Flemming said. Ukraine, which some economists believe will see its GDP collapse by a further 10 per cent next year, represents the gloomy end of the spectrum. More optimistically, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary are predicted to have growth rates of around 4 per cent. But since the economies of the OECD countries are forecast to grow by 2 per cent, even 4 per cent growth in eastern Europe will not allow the region to catch up with western Europe for many decades, Mr Flemming added. 'What is needed to close the gap is the growth we have seen in the Pacific rim,' said Mr Flemming, citing China's economic growth rate of 10 per cent, 'but no one is predicting that type of growth in eastern Europe.' Little fall is predicted in inflation levels, which run from the low 'teens' in the 'success stories' such as Poland to 1,000 per cent in Russia. As a result, the report suggests the punitively high levels of effective marginal labour and capital tax rates create 'dismal prospects for private investment. . . that have not been widely appreciated.'

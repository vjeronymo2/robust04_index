			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Observer: Dunn does it again Martin Dunn will be reprinting his calling cards - yet again. The one-time deputy editor of Rupert Murdoch's The Sun was late last year being wooed by Mort Zuckerman to edit his New York Daily News. At that time he was editing another Murdoch tabloid, Today, from which position he duly resigned only to be informed - by fax - that Zuckerman had decided that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to have yet another British editor in New York after all. Things looked decidedly sticky for Dunn until Murdoch came to the rescue and offered him the Boston Herald. Four months on, Zuckerman has had a change of heart and enticed Dunn to the Daily News with an offer that was perhaps worth waiting for. A figure of Dollars 1.5m over three years is mooted. At the News, Dunn will compete head-on with his predecessor at the Boston Herald, Ken Chandler, who edits the New York Post - which just happens to have been saved from extinction by his old benefactor: Rupert Murdoch.</p>

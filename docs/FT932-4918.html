			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television The story of the breakfast television company TV-am seems typically British. Launched by the 'Famous Five' under a policy a bit like that of United Artists, it ran into trouble when the BBC beat it onto the air with a more popular programme. Bickering broke out among TV-am's prima donnas, ratings were appalling, and the sinking ship had to be saved by the famous rat: Roland. Then, when TV-am became the most profitable company in the ITV network, the disastrous Thatcherite auction system was introduced and the most Thatcherite company of the lot lost its franchise. FT media correspondent Raymond Snoddy tells the story in Storm In An Egg Cup (7.20 BBC2) a programme originally shown during the evening called 'TV Hell'. Horizon which follows (8.00) goes for the biggie: information technology. Half the US workforce is now employed in the business. Do we need all this information or is it really a matter of the computer people needing to sell it? Panorama considers another very modern industry: genetic testing.</p>

In a statement issued in Islamabad yesterday, he  called on all Afghan parties to initiate the process of dialogue  for national reconciliation. He said the need of the hour is  peace, understanding, and reconstruction in Afghanistan, so that  the valiant people of that country could benefit from the fruits  of the holy war. The foreign minister said Pakistan is of the  firm view that the military triumph of any one faction over the  other will be of a transient nature, and it may further  exacerbate regional, ethnic, and linguistic tension and may  undermine Afghanistan's unity and regional peace. He said it is  very important for all regional countries, especially for  Pakistan, to ensure that civil war is replaced by peace in  Afghanistan. He said we believe this objective can be achieved  through the process of negotiations and broad consensus. Sardar  Asif Ahmad Ali said he is ready to visit Afghanistan if the  Afghan leadership responds positively.</p>

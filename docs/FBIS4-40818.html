			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Following the two hour long talks and a dinner  reception at the sumptuous villa of the head of the Italian  Government today, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists:  Silvio Berlusconi is the most interesting man I have ever met.  The conversation between the two men was very cordial and  fruitful. Berlusconi accepted the invitation to come to Moscow  on an official visit. In the course of the visit Russia and  Italy will sign a friendship and cooperation treaty. According  to Italian diplomats, the treaty envisages the kind of political  and economic cooperation which Russia has only with Germany.  Berlusconi assured Chernomyrdin that he would support Russia in  her effort to join the group of seven developed nations, and  generally do his very best to make Russia a leading country in  the world scene.    In reply to the flattering remarks by Chernomyrdin,  Berlusconi said that while engaging in personal cultural  development he read more Russian than Italian writers. Today  the Russian prime minister, who is now staying in Milan at the  invitation of the Italian state oil company Eni, also took part  in the 19th world congress on natural gas.</p>

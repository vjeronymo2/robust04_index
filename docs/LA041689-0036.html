			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT ON THE TRAIL OF NOMADS IN MOROCCAN DESERT  </P> <P> For centuries the fiery sands of the Sahara have been called the "Garden of  Allah."  </P> <P> Those traveling by camel caravan along its ancient trails may see this desert  as a gigantic cathedral of scintillating beauty and grandeur.  </P> <P> Its dome is the azure blue of a cloudless sky. Under the rays of a torrid sun,  the hundreds of gigantic sand dunes are transformed into altars of shimmering  gold.  </P> <P> In the night, beneath a star-flecked sky, an ominous wind may blow across the  sandy wastes in tones low and vibrant like those of a mighty organ magnified a  thousandfold.  </P> <P> For many, the lonely and foreboding Sahara is their only home. Although the  life of a desert nomad is cruel and primitive, untold hundreds of caravans are  still following dusty trails from one oasis to another.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Colorful Wanderers  </P> <P> Of all the desert wanderers, most colorful are the Tauregs, more popularly  known as Blue Men because the indigo that they use to dye their robes rubs off  on their bodies and gives them a bluish cast.  </P> <P> A matriarchy, the tribe is governed by its older women. Tales of their past are  handed down from mother to daughter. Some of these stories sound incredible.  </P> <P> The Tauregs believe they are the descendants of the survivors of the Lost  Continent of Atlantis and are destined to roam the desert until such time as  Atlantis one day rises from its watery grave. Then they can return to their  ancient homeland.  </P> <P> Although I have visited Morocco many times, I decided to return again and learn  more about this tribe.  </P> <P> Flying first to Marrakech, I journeyed south by bus to the small town of  Goulimine, where I had been told the Blue Men occasionally dispose of their  livestock and make purchases before setting out again across the Sahara.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Town on Desert Rim  </P> <P> Goulimine, on the rim of the desert, is made up of a few dirt streets and  one-story pink adobe buildings. There is little motor traffic, but moving about  are burros, camels, goats and sheep, their plaintive cries breaking the  stillness as they wind their way toward the camel market held each weekend in a  walled square on the outskirts of town.  </P> <P> The desert people need little to survive -- sugar and salt and a few other  items that they buy at the kiosks with money from the sale of their animals and  hand-woven rugs.  </P> <P> During weekends Goulimine is a meeting place for desert tribesmen of the south  and sharp-eyed white-robed businessmen from the north, who wheel and deal with  the nomads.  </P> <P> While wandering through the camel market I stopped at a kiosk where a Taureg  woman was selling rugs. She spoke Spanish, having spent much of her time in  Tan-Tan on the Spanish Sahara.  </P> <P> The Tauregs speak a language called Shelha, the origin of which is lost. At  first Fatma eyed me suspiciously, but after I bought one of her rugs she became  more responsive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Four Days by Camel'  </P> <P> I told her I wanted to visit a Taureg encampment. After a bit of coaxing she  invited me to join her on a trip to the oasis of Kazir. How far? She shrugged  and replied: "Four days by camel."  </P> <P> Early Monday I was on a camel heading southeast. Abdel, Fatma's husband, led  the way, followed by their two young sons, Mohsen and Ahmad.  </P> <P> Suddenly we entered another world of shimmering sand dunes that glistened like  molten gold under the first rays of the sun.  </P> <P> The ride was anything but pleasant. Until I learned to relax and sway with the  erratic movements of my camel, I felt as if I was churning about inside a  cement mixer.  </P> <P> Three days later we arrived at Kazir. Scattered among the date palms were  several goatskin tents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scattered Tribes  </P> <P> No one knows just how many Tauregs there are, but they run into the tens of  thousands and are scattered throughout Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt and  Sudan.  </P> <P> They are the best cameleers, and are one of several Berber tribes whose  ancestors lived along North Africa's Mediterranean coast but who migrated south  to the desert.  </P> <P> The men are tall and slender, with strong angular faces. The women are  extremely attractive, some with Mongolian features. Centuries ago the Taureg  tribesmen were feared by other nomads as bandits of the desert. They are no  longer hostile, though they remain aloof.  </P> <P> Unlike most Moslems, the women bare their faces. The men wear a black muslin  tagilmust, or turban, wound several times around their heads and draped across  their noses, providing protection from the Sahara sun as well as the tiny  particles of sand that seem to permeate the desert air.  </P> <P> According to this tribe's legends, the Tauregs once lived on a lush island  called "Atlantiki" -- or Atlantis -- with green valleys surrounded by  snow-covered peaks.  </P> <P> They were a happy, carefree people, and counted among them artists, sculptors,  poets, philosophers and skilled artisans who excelled at delicate filigree work  with silver and gold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Link to the Past  </P> <P> If there is a single link between past and present, it might be in their folk  dance, the quedra. From childhood every woman in the tribe learns the sensuous  movements of this dance, which is performed only upon the knees.  </P> <P> Their graceful arms and flicking fingers seem to convey the secret message of a  bygone era. As the dance progresses the body sways and writhes, while the  dancer's long hair is tossed wildly about the face.  </P> <P> Finally, exhausted, the dancer slumps forward and remains motionless for  several moments.  </P> <P> According to Amin, the quedra was the most popular of all the dances performed  by their ancient queen's palace dancers during their sacred festivals. Its  origin and meaning are mysteries.  </P> <P> I stayed with the Tauregs four weeks. While the men tended their animals the  women kept busy by gathering brush for firewood, preparing meals, taking care  of the children and drawing water from a communal well.  </P> <P> Most important, they spent countless hours at small, crude looms, weaving  colorful rugs that they would sell at some distant village.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Goulimine can be used as a base of operations while exploring southern Morocco.  Fly into Marrakech or Agadir. From either city it's a few hours' drive by  rental car through some fascinating countryside to Goulimine.  </P> <P> The town is almost deserted during the hottest months (June through August).  The best time to visit is from October through March. Visit the Saturday or  Sunday market, where nomadic tribes, including the Blue Men, sell their  livestock.  </P> <P> Goulimine has no deluxe hotels but the 27-room Salam is clean and comfortable  and close to the camel market. The Pension Ere Nouvelle has 12 rooms (and its  food is a little better). Expect to pay between $20 and $35 at both. Newest  hotel is the Mauritania, which averages about $30 to $45 a night.  </P> <P> If the hotels in Goulimine are full, you can stay in nearby Tiznit at the El  Minzah, which has a small pool, the Tiznit or the Mauritania (different from  the Mauritania in Goulimine). Prices average between $20 and $30.  </P> <P> Royal Air Maroc flies into Tangier, Marrakech, Fez and Casablanca from most  major U.S. cities.  </P> <P> Train service throughout Morocco is generally excellent. It's reliable, and  food is often available.  </P> <P> Take a camel ride. On weekend nights you'll be able to watch the Taureg women  perform the quedra, either at your hotel or at a restaurant in Goulimine,  Rendel-Vous des Hommes Bleus.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Morocco, contact the Moroccan National  Tourist Office, 421 N.

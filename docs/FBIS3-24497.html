Trofimov; </F> UDC 681.325.5:621.3]    [Abstract] Features of employing  A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/] semiconductor compounds,  specifically cadmium sulfide-selenide, in a form of thin-film  photodetector structures, are examined for different elements of  optoelectronic processor. A technology was developed in the  Belorus Academy of Sciences for obtaining thin-film photo-  resistors based on cadmium sulfide-selenide, which includes: a  cathode three-electron scattering on direct current and high  frequency voltage of a cold-pressed target, activation of photo-  sensitivity by thermal processing of films in the original  batch, photo-lithographic operations for obtaining the required  topology of micro-elements on thin-film of cadmium  sulfide-selenide and In - A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/], Al -  Ti - A[.sup]II[/]B[.sup]VI[/] contact systems. Thin-film  photo- resistor structures 0.5-2.0 m thick can be formed  with  this technology on different substrates with a sufficiently high  photoelectric quality. Experimental data are provided,  supporting the feasibility of application of thin-film  photo-resistors based on cadmium sulfide-selenide for modeling  and development of three-dimensional opto-electronic processors.

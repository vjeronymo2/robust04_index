			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: FAMOUS FOR 15 MINUTES MY YEARS WITH ANDY WARHOL BY ULTRA  VIOLET (AVON: $8.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> This chronicle of life among the denizens of Andy Warhol's famous Factory holds  a morbid fascination for art historians -- and readers of People. Former  "superstar" Ultra Violet (nee Isabelle Collin Dufresne) delves beneath the  vapid surface of Warhol and his hangers-on to reveal the underlying reservoirs  of vacuousness.  </P> <P> "Famous" offers plenty of drugs and sex (although you have to read between the  gender lines for the latter), and famous names drop like dead moths from a  porch light.  </P> <P> Warhol and his gang seem to have been driven by a desperate, almost  pathological need for publicity: not recognition for any artistic achievement,  but appearances in newspaper gossip columns, as if a few lines of smudged ink  in a tabloid somehow validated their existence. "A day with no mention of  ourselves (in the papers) is a lost day," she declares. Ultra Violet inverts  Hannah Arendt's famous dictum and shows her readers the mind-numbing evil of  banality.  </P></p>

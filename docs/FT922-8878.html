			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / European Bonds: Portuguese paper loses its shine AMONG the higher-yielding European bond markets, Portugal has been the clear winner over the past month. But the shine on escudo bonds has become tarnished in the past fortnight, and may lose further lustre in the weeks ahead, writes Richard Waters. The rush by international investors into Portuguese bonds at the start of April, prompted by escudo's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS on the wide band, wiped nearly 1 percentage point off the gross yield on five-year, fixed-rate bonds. Although there were plenty of people predicting Portugal's ERM entry at the end of its six-month presidency of the EC, it did not stop the rush. Since the middle of April, however, things have been different. The 12.5 per cent gross yield on five-year bonds has widened to around 12.75 per cent as the initial excitement has eased. International investors are banned from buying higher-yielding floating-rate paper, a ruling introduced last summer and extended this year to keep international speculators out of the market. The yield could be set to rise further: after the 20 per cent withholding tax, the current net yield is close to the 10.88 per cent available on 10-year Spanish bonds. Should the latest figures from Spain show inflation much below 7 per cent, investment in Portugal will begin to look expensive.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: No say on funds to Tories Thank you for your excellent reporting of the Tory party funding fiasco ('Tories unsettled by funds secrecy', June 21). I would add that it is also widely assumed that company donations are made with the approval of shareholders. From my own experience, this is totally false. For I have written, as a shareholder, to four companies which donate large sums of money to the Tory party, seeking an opportunity to vote on ceasing donations. In all cases my request has been rejected on the grounds that the Tories serve companies' economic interests best. Leaving aside the democratic rights of shareholders, such claims are extremely dubious given the economic shambles the country is now in after 14 years of economic mismanagement. Indeed, I would go further and say it is because the Tory party is so excessively funded that we are now so badly governed. For if the events of the last 12 months tell us anything, it is that a party that can buy its way to permanent power will become tired, complacent, incompetent and unfit to govern. Keith Darlington, 24 Wycombe Road, Gants Hill, Ilford, Essex IG2 6UT</p>

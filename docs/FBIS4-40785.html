			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Makovsky] </F>   [Excerpts] Ukraine has offered to sell Israel missile-  launchers for Israeli satellites, participants in a meeting  between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres said in Kiev yesterday.    Peres said Israel would consider the offer.    Amid a dispute over the Jewish Agency's aliya activities in  Ukraine, Peres and Ukrainian leaders agreed yesterday to set up  cultural centers in each other's countries. [passage omitted]    Peres told reporters yesterday that while anti-Semitic  incidents have occurred in Ukraine, he was convinced that  Ukrainian leaders were genuinely trying to combat this  phenomenon.    In his talks in Kiev yesterday, Peres' Ukrainian counterpart  also suggested that the two countries establish consulates in  Haifa and Odessa. Ukrainian leaders also extended invitations  both to President 'Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  to visit Kiev.    Bilateral agreements were signed in the areas of investment,  taxation, police, science, and culture. [passage omitted]    [A report by Hemi Shalev on page 12 of Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in  Hebrew on 16 June adds: "Ukraine offered to try to use its good  relations with Damascus to create yet another channel of  communications between Israel and Syria.    ["Ukrainian President Kravchuk told Peres that his country  considers Israel `a strategic neighbor,' and that he hoped the  agreements Peres will sign today would provide `a firm legal  basis' to the relations between the two countries."    [The report notes that Peres complained to his Ukrainian  counterpart about Ukraine's votes in the United Nations and  other international organizations, and that the Ukrainian  foreign minister replied: "I never dreamed that I would be  hosting in Kiev an Israeli foreign minister who would voice his  complaints and would also manage to convince me. You must  understand that getting used to our independence and getting  over the past takes time."]</p>

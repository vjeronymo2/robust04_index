			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> New Passion Play: Christians from around the world gathered over the weekend in  Oberammergau, West Germany, for a new version of the centuries-old Passion Play  about the suffering of Jesus, rewritten to cut out some of the anti-Semitic  passages and images.  </P> <P> The performance also marked the end of a tradition and sparked controversy. For  the first time in the play's 356-year history, the role of the Virgin Mary was  played by a married woman, Elisabeth Petre. In the past, only unmarried women  were allowed to act as the mother of Christ. Director Christian Stueckl had  faced a barrage of criticism over his casting of Petre. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Obituary: Grand old man of gardening - Robin Lane Fox pays tribute to Arthur Hellyer ARTHUR Hellyer, who died on Thursday afternoon, was the grand old man of English gardening, a position which he occupied with characteristic modesty, kindness and generosity. His honours were of the highest: he received the MBE in 1967, and the Victoria Medal of Horticulture from the Royal Horticutural Society. Admired internationally for his many works of reference, he was one of the great gardening editors in the world of magazines. It was very much in the later stages of an already famous career that in 1959 he became gardening correspondent for the FT. He met his weekly task without interruption. He was never a man for unpunctual copy or a week off. He belonged to a veteran school where the standards demanded professionalism without fuss. His long life took its distinctive turn after early fears of fatal illness. Born in 1902, he left Dulwich College, south-east London, aged 13 when diagnosed as having tuberculosis. After being advised to work outdoors, his first job was growing tomatoes on the Channel Island of Guernsey. Then he moved to a farm on neighbouring Jersey. The islands were linked to his family through his Uncle Ernest, who was Jersey's state auditor (Arthur once joked to me that he might have been a little too investigative for some of his readers on the FT). It was Ernest who owned the Jersey garden, about an acre in area, which Arthur inherited in 1956. But his main home lay in Sussex, where he turned 7 1/2 acres of woodland and derelict ground at Rowfant into an imaginative, beautifully-planted design. One garden would have been enough for most of us but Arthur managed two, without any hint of strain. From the Channel Islands, he graduated to the world of journalism. In 1929, he moved to Amateur Gardening, his natural home for the next 38 years. He edited this great British institution from 1944-67 but still found time for the gardens, three children, a devoted marriage, a score of important books and fine photography, not to mention his distinguished articles for Country Life and the FT. Arthur's style was unmistakable: clear, informed, accessible to any plain reader but always alert to a new technique. Then there were those golden moments when experts were proposing something without persuading Arthur that they knew the answer. His wife, Grace, whom he married in 1934, was the mainstay of this generous life, herself a botanist and the ideal sounding board for each week's written pieces until her death in 1977. Daughter Penelope then took on this role. With their help, he never forgot that he was writing for people who knew so much less. Through his own work, meanwhile, his range was universal, He and his wife ran a fruitful market garden for several years; during the droughts of the mid-1970s, they did a memorable 'double act' for the FT on the glut of cucumbers and their recipes for the best cucumber soup. Simultaneously, Arthur was writing assured historical articles with an eye for great gardens' style, changing design and social context. He brought dozens of lesser-known places to a wider audience, in Country Life as well as the various RHS journals. Journalism is said to be a catty profession, and there was ample scope for tricks from the resident old tom cat when I was appointed in 1970 as a completely unknown second string with the brief of writing mid-week. The deputy editor drew the task of taking us to a London restaurant where Arthur greeted me by saying that my recruitment was great news for gardening and the FT's commitment to it. He went on to ask Lord Drogheda, the FT's chairman who died in 1989, whether he was having a good year. When his lordship began discussing quarterly profit, Arthur said he meant a good year for the camellias following his own recent visit to the Droghedas' garden to give his free advice. Even Arthur had his favourites in the world which he knew universally. I think of the hardy fuchsia Brilliant; the blue hydrangea Vicomte de Vibraye; a viola called Wellsiana, which was kept alive exclusively through his efforts; the mysterious white climbing rose which an old nurseryman gave him in the 1920s, and which he sent me to run up a tree; and the freesias which he and his wife grew with such skill and fondness. Not that he ignored the rest of this paper. While we all read his gardening columns, he would be an avid reader of the main business of the FT. For 22 years, this newspaper inadvertently employed two gardening columnists who were mad-keen followers of the market without either confessing it to the other. Their results, no doubt, reflected their differing characters: Arthur's, I guess, were sceptical and sensible, but I also suspect that he liked a gamble and that some of them were as bad as mine. Since 1921, he had supported the Gardeners' Royal Benevolent Society, where he served on the council - one of many such public roles. His final brief illness was spent in their care, surrounded by flowers from the dozens of friends whom he always attracted. A few days ago, Penelope brought him camellias and some stems of willow from the garden, but one of this country's sharpest judging eyes had not lost the flare which served the RHS for so long. The willow, he told her, was not up to much; and as for the camellias, they must be Lady Clare, although they had no label. Penelope already has begun a nursery of her own at Rowfant, much to his pleasure: her hope is that the garden will open to the public eventually, preserving the style and skill which Arthur and his wife stamped on it. The loss to his two sons and daughter is partly ours and all his FT readers will send their sympathies. The length and breadth of his life made him the most influential and respected writer on gardening of his time.</p>

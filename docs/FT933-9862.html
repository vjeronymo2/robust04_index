			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Moscow sticks with reforms THE divided Russian government yesterday stuck to its middle-of-the-road reform course, throwing out command-style economic plans from Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy prime minister. But it also approved credit expansion targets which exceed those agreed with the International Monetary Fund. At an expanded cabinet meeting attended by heads of Russia's 89 regions and republics, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin presented and received approval for a medium-term programme which forecasts economic recovery in 1996. He warned that 'government leaders' at odds with cabinet policy would have to step down, although it was not clear whether he was referring to Mr Lobov or to Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical finance minister, who has attacked a botched monetary reform endorsed by the prime minister. Mr Sergei Vasiliev, head of the government centre for monitoring economic reform and one of the programme's authors, said 'it neither added nor subtracted anything' to reform. The cabinet, however, adopted a resolution setting credit growth at 30 per cent in the third and fourth quarter. This compares with targets of 20 and 15 per cent agreed with the IMF. The programme, however, still aims to cut inflation and the budget deficit to levels agreed with the Fund. Reformers drew at least some comfort from the rejection on the eve of the cabinet meeting of an alternative programme which would have re-imposed centralised economic planning. It was drawn up by Mr Lobov, who was appointed by President Boris Yeltsin to appease conservatives before the unexpected referendum victory in April. Yesterday's parallel sessions of the cabinet and parliament had been billed as a potential showdown between conservatives and reformers. The most dramatic event of the day was parliament's decision to suspend Mr Yeltsin's latest decree overriding parliament's cancellation of his measures to speed privatisation. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, promised swift but unspecified 'counter-measures'. And despite calls by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary chairman, for the punishment of those 'guilty' of the central bank's crude monetary reform, parliament passed the mildest resolutions on the bank-note operation, saying it was understandable.</p>

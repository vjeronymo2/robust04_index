			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: FOOTBALL IS A BIG KICK FOR MARTIN  </P> <P> As a goalkeeper in soccer, Tres Martin's performance is measured by saves.  Martin, 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds, was an All-Pacific Coast League selection last  season.  </P> <P> As a lineman on Orange High School's football team, Martin's success or failure  usually can't be measured so tangibly.  </P> <P> But it was hard not to notice Martin's performance Friday night when he  recovered three fumbles in the Panthers' 15-0 victory over Villa Park.  </P> <P> Strong defensive line play by Martin, the Times' Athlete of the Week, and J.R.  Sauni, who also recovered two fumbles against Villa Park, has helped Orange  shut out two of its four opponents. The early-season success for Orange (3-0-1)  is a remarkable turnaround for a team that was 2-8 last year and has had only  one winning season in the decade.  </P> <P> Orange's success also can be attributed to new Coach Tom Meiss, who stresses a  gang-tackling defense, and the new defensive responsibilities Meiss has given  Martin.  </P> <P> Before Meiss took over this season, Martin, a senior, strictly was an offensive  lineman. Meiss said Martin's height allows him the leverage to control the line  of scrimmage, and he often knocks down passes because "he instinctively knows  when to go up."  </P> <P> Playing on the defensive line also allows Martin to play with more abandon than  on offense. "On defense you grab whatever you want, whatever you can," he said.  "You kind of turn into an animal. It just kind of puts a little rush into you."  </P> <P> Martin, who can kick a soccer ball the length of a soccer field, also is  punting for the first time this year. However, he finds that kicking on the  football field is not as easy.  </P> <P> Meiss, who calls Martin "Thunderfoot," said it has been difficult having a  lineman punt. "In practice he never gets a punt more than 20 yards," Meiss  said. "It just drives me crazy."  </P> <P> Fortunately for the Panthers, Martin, who has had a few punts of more than 50  yards, has kicked well in games. He said his goalie instincts take over when he  is under pressure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Mark Flatten of Pacifica caught six passes for 186 yards and three touchdowns  in Pacifica's 35-8 victory over La Quinta Friday night. Flatten also  intercepted two passes as Pacifica won its first game of the season.  </P> <P> Brandon Howald of Corona del Mar scored four goals, including three in the  third quarter, as the Sea Kings defeated Long Beach Wilson, 10-4, in the final  of the South Coast water polo tournament Saturday.  </P> <P> Rob Johnson of El Toro caught seven passes for 131 yards and two touchdowns in  the Chargers' 44-25 victory over Tustin Friday. Johnson, who also is El Toro's  backup quarterback, completed three of four passes for 39 yards and a  touchdown.  </P> <P> Doug Weaver of Fountain Valley had 14 receptions for 199 yards and three  touchdowns as the Barons came back from a 21-0 deficit to defeat El Modena,  22-21, Thursday. Weaver also caught a pass from Willy Puga for the two-point  conversion that won the game.  </P> <P> Tres Martin  </P> <P> Orange High School  </P> <P> Position: offensive/defensive lineman, punter  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-2, 220, Senior  </P> <P> Last Week: Martin recovered three fumbles in a 15-0 victory over Villa Park  Friday.  </P> <P> Season: Martin, who recovered a fumble in the Panthers' season-open ing shutout  of Chino, is part of a defense that has allowed one touch down and two field  goals in four games.  </P></p>

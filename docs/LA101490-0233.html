			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAURICE SENDAK  </P> <P> We read with great interest "The Dark World of Maurice Sendak," (Sept. 16.) but  felt there was one major omission. Through Oct. 28, Sendak's paintings and  drawings for the L.A. Opera Co.'s production of "Idomeneo" will be exhibited at  Every Picture Tells a Story, 836 N. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles.  </P> <P> LEE COHEN  </P> <P> EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

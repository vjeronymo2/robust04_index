			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: BBL insurance talks left open DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert have acted to dampen speculation about its strategy in the insurance business. It announced yesterday that it was open to insurance collaboration with any of BBL's large shareholders, as long as they met certain criteria. The bank yesterday held a board meeting - billed as 'D-Day for BBL' in one Belgian newspaper - to decide between two proposals on collaboration in the lucrative area of 'bancassurance' from rival insurer-shareholders. However, it neither accepted nor rejected the two sets of proposals, one from Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), and one from Royale Belge and Winterthur of Switzerland. Instead, BBL said it would create an insurance subsidiary, specialising in car and fire cover, to add to its existing life insurance subsidiary. Prospective partners would be able to take a stake in the new company, but BBL would retain control. Since last month, when the bancassurance talks began to attract attention, BBL has been at pains to stress that commercial links should be considered separately from any movement in its fragmented share register. 'The bank is negotiating with the insurance companies to act together in the insurance field,' a spokesman said. Royale Belge, together with its controlling shareholder - the French insurer, UAP - owns 11.72 per cent of BBL, and Winterthur has 4.78 per cent. ING, which controls 8.6 per cent, has never commented on rumours that it wanted to bid for the whole of BBL.</p>

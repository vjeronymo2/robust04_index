			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMING ARTS CENTER WOES NO SURPRISE  </P> <P> The woes of the Orange County Performing Arts Center ("O.C.'s Arts Center Has  Fallen on Hard Times" by Mark I. Pinsky, Nov. 29) come as little surprise. I  subscribed to one of the opening series, my seats downgraded when a  contribution letter sent to me with my order acknowledgment went unfulfilled.  </P> <P> We sat "in the rafters" in an almost empty section; the acoustics were not as  good as what we were expecting. We are called six to eight times a year for  donations.  </P> <P> We support the arts. We think nothing of attending the Hollywood Bowl or the  Shubert or Ahmanson. We thoroughly enjoy South Coast Repertory, both Mainstage  and Second Stage. But did the population numbers warrant another performing  arts center? Or was it artistic and political egos competing with Los Angeles?  </P> <P> SUSAN KNIGHT  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

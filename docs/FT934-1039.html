			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (1): Year of opportunities ahead - Next September, Swedes will vote in a general election. Some time in 1994 they will also decide whether or not to join the European Union Sweden, a country once so confident of its destiny, is facing a new year full of challenges and choices. After three years of recession, in which the economy has shrunk by more than 5 per cent, a return to modest growth seems likely in 1994. But the pace of recovery and, above all, a reversal of unemployment now running at about 14 per cent of the workforce, will depend greatly on the extent to which there is a rekindling of confidence in the still slumbering domestic economy. In September next year, Swedes will vote in a general election. They will select either the vigorous market reform policies of prime minister Carl Bildt's right-centre coalition or a return to the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, with its commitment to preserve the essentials of the welfare state it constructed over the past 30 years. During the course of 1994, Sweden will also decide whether or not it should join the European Union. Negotiations on accession are scheduled to be completed by March 1. If the timetable is stuck to, the issue will be put to a referendum by the end of next year. As 1993 draws to a close, the pointers do not look, at first sight, very encouraging for Mr Bildt and his conservative Moderate party. Opinion polls have given the Social Democrats more than 50 per cent support. They also show a persistent hostility towards joining the EU, despite support for membership from the leading government and opposition parties. Other issues have been interpreted as showing that Swedes are not responding to Mr Bildt's impassioned call for a reformed Sweden to become a full and enthusiastic participant in the development of a more integrated Europe. Early this month, the senior management and shareholders of Volvo, the country's biggest and best-loved manufacturer, staged an unprecedented rebellion against a plan to merge the company's car and truck operations with state-owned Renault of France. The main opposition was concerned with the structure of the deal - but it also attracted an emotional objection to a foreign takeover that bodes ill for those campaigning for EU membership. Sweden's environmentalists, with the support of the coalition-member Centre Party and apparently many voters, are meanwhile trying to block plans agreed with Denmark to build a road and rail bridge from the southern city of Malmo, across the narrow Oresund, to Copenhagen. Mr Bildt, however, gives no impression of being down-hearted. He believes that there is a broad acceptance in Sweden of policies designed to cut back the role of the state in the economy, despite the pain of recession. Confident of a 'robust recovery' over the next two years, Mr Bildt says conditions in the economy will be improving perceptibly by the time the election is held, sufficient to ensure another non-socialist majority in the Riksdag (parliament). Then, the intention is to build on the steps already taken to reduce public spending - through measures such as cuts in unemployment and sickness benefits - and to open up the state-dominated service sector to private business. The public sector in Sweden still accounts for close to 70 per cent of gross domestic product. 'What remains is to bring down the overall level of taxation - in terms of social costs and VAT,' says Mr Bildt. 'Public consumption is going down faster than expected, but of course much remains to be done, particularly in the public health sector. On the budget deficit, a robust recovery is going to do quite a lot, but not enough.' The prime minister admits, however, that he is concerned about the appetite for more liberalisation among an electorate which long ago grew accustomed to the generous levels of state welfare afforded by the 'Swedish model'. 'I am afraid that when the economy starts to do better, a lot of people are going to ask 'Well, do you need these policies of reform any longer?'' he says. This is what the Social Democrats are out to exploit. The party is by no means advocating a complete return to the policies of the past. It acknowledges that the balance between public and private sector in Sweden became unsustainable. It was the Social Democrats who, when last in office, launched reforms to cut the country's previously huge income tax burden. But, under the leadership of former prime minister Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrats are firmly committed to retaining the essentials of the welfare state. The party emphasises the need to foster private sector industrial growth but opposes steps taken by the present government such as the abolition of taxes on dividends. 'I don't think the problem is the public sector,' says Mr Carlsson. 'Really the problem today is that we have such low demand. You can say that it is because there is such insecurity in the public sector - people don't know what will happen to their state pensions, or what will happen when they are unemployed - that people now save much more. One of the best stimulations of the economy today would be if we create some kind of clarification about the social securities.' The intensifying election battle has considerably complicated the issue of Sweden's application to join the European Union. Although it was the Social Democrats who, in a break with traditional party policies, lodged the application in 1991, there are deep divisions in approach to the question between the opposition and Mr Bildt. The Moderates see membership as essential for Sweden's future economic prosperity, but they also see it as a means to shift Sweden decisively away from its previously aloof strategic stance. In the post-cold war world, they want to place Sweden at the centre of the EU's political, economic and strategic development. Mr Bildt says the logic of Swedish neutrality 'has gone' and instead Sweden should help bring a 'northern perspective' to the development of western Europe's strategic and defence policy. The Social Democrats, meanwhile, are deeply split over EU membership. A majority of their supporters oppose joining, not least because many are still strongly attached to neutrality. The thrust of Mr Carlsson's advocacy of membership concentrates on the perceived benefits Sweden could gain from wider policy co-operation in the fight against unemployment. With opinion polls showing support for membership at little more than 25 per cent, and opposition around 45 per cent, it is clear to all sides that winning approval for membership in the promised referendum will require changing opinion within the Social Democrats. This makes choosing a date for the referendum extremely difficult. Assuming the negotiations on an accession agreement are completed, the government would ideally favour a vote in June, or simultaneously with the general election. But the Social Democratic leadership does not want to have to try to persuade a sceptical party to support a 'Yes' campaign at the same as it is fighting an election. Mr Carlsson wants to wait until after the election. 'We must prove to the people that we can solve their daily problems better inside the EU than outside. That takes time and if we lose this referendum it will take 10 or 20 years before it can be brought up again,' he says. Mr Bildt fears, however, that the 'No' campaign, led mainly at present by marginal left-wing and environmental groups, will gain in strength the longer it has to organise. It is one of the circles he must try to square in 1994.</p>

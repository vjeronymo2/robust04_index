Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress, praised Sichuan, the most populous province  in China, for making impressive economic achievements in recent  years.    "I'm sure Sichuan will achieve greater economic development  in future," he said in a group discussion about premier Li  Peng's government work report with NPC deputies from the  province.    He said that with weapons factories, steel plants and a  railway network built in the early 1960s, Sichuan, including its  leading manufacturing center of Chongqing, has a sound  industrial base.    Therefore, Sichuan will be able to continue to expand its  economy on that base, said Qiao.    Sichuan should accelerate the development of township  factories and a diversified economy suited for hilly areas to  spur the growth of its rural economy, he said.    Land-locked Sichuan Province, Qiao told the deputies, has  its  own advantages for attracting overseas investors, such as its  rich natural resources, cheap land and labor, and low prices.</p>

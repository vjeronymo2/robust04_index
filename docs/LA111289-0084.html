			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HUNTINGTON BEACH PROPOSAL FOR GOLF COURSE  </P> <P> I can't quite understand why there is opposition to the proposed municipal golf  course planned for a few acres of abandoned oil fields and some foreclosed  mushroom fields in the vicinity of Ellis and Golden West streets in Huntington  Beach.  </P> <P> Could it be that a few members of the affluent horse crowd or a small handful  of joggers who are using the area illegally are the vocal protesters? This area  is posted as off-limits to all.  </P> <P> I know that the few transients who occupy the existing sheds and lean-tos would  like to keep it as it is. My suggestion is, keep your daughters away from this  area.  </P> <P> To the bird watchers and nature lovers who would like to keep the Ellis and  Golden West area as it is, be careful. You might catch a virus, which one  police officer described as a case of passive nuisance.  </P> <P> What a tremendous opportunity to convert this useless tax burden to an extended  greenbelt that would provide recreation to a potential 13,000 golfers, or 7% of  the residents of the city. And this is all unsubsidized and self-supporting,  which is something more than other Central Park users can say.  </P> <P> DICK OSTERLIND  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Barclaycard to build Pounds 45m HQ on business park site Barclaycard, the credit-card issuer owned by Barclays Bank, is to spend about Pounds 45m on building a new headquarters at the Northampton Business Park, Paul Cheeseright writes. The headquarters will bring together, on the outskirts of Northampton, staff split between three leased buildings in the town centre. Barclaycard's 2,600 employees make it Northampton's largest employer. Barclays said contracts had been exchanged for the purchase of 18 acres at the business park, where the asking price for land is Pounds 350,000 an acre. Northampton Business Park is in the hands of the receiver, Mr Robin Addy of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Mr Addy was appointed by a consortium of banks, not including Barclays, when UK Land, the property company developing the park, collapsed in 1991.</p>

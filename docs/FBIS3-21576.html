"Information of this kind is extremely confidential as  shipping such freights entails necessary security measures," he  told Interfax-Ukraine.    "It would be desirable if people handling these processes on  both sides did not create tense situations in future," Shmarov  said. He added that "professionals did their best to ensure the  security of the shipment and make sure the freight arrives at  its destination by the shortest possible route."    Ukraine has not received nuclear fuel from Russia as  envisioned in the trilateral statement by the U.S., Ukrainian  and Russian presidents. The only thing the Ukrainian leadership  received was a telegram from Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin stating that the Russian government would start the  supplies before the end of this month.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Waste Management advances by 51% WASTE Management International, the UK-quoted group, yesterday reported a 51 per cent increase in profits in its first reporting period after its Pounds 405m global share offering in April. Pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 62.7m on sales ahead some 30 per cent at Pounds 382m. Some 18 per cent of the sales increase came through organic growth and the remainder through a number of acquisitions. When Waste Management, the Chicago-based group, sold 20 per cent of its international operations in the share offering it said it would use the warchest to take advantage of opportunities arising from tightening environmental regulations in Europe and growth in Asia. Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive of WMI, said yesterday that nothing had dampened enthusiasm about the opportunities and that the continuing recession in the UK had increased the potential possibilities as companies tried to dispose of non-core waste businesses. During the six month period, WMI bought Marvin, a storage, handling and chemical waste treatment facility in Great Yarmouth; SPAT, in France, which provides eight operating landfill sites for the group; and agreed to build, own and operate a waste-to-energy facility at Gutersloh, Germany. Mr Falkman also said the group had also agreed a joint venture with Bimantara of Indonesia to build the country's first hazardous waste treatment plant. Earnings per share emerged at 10.6p, up 36 per cent over the period.</p>

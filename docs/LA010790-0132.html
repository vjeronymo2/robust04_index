			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING CHILDREN  </P> <P> The commentary "We Could Give the Gift of Life This Christmas" (Op-Ed Page,  Dec. 24) outraged and dismayed me. To allow 40,000 children to needlessly die  daily is literally beyond belief! But even if we do not respond to this  unnecessary condition on humane grounds, it well behooves us to look at it from  a selfish stance.  </P> <P> High child death rates mean high birth rates; the poverty which promotes these  death rates forces millions to over-exploit their surroundings just to survive;  poverty provokes instability and violence; poverty perpetuates itself. It sows  the seeds of social problems. We feel the results of all of this in our own  country. So for either selfish or unselfish reasons, we must realize that  children are indeed dying for us to learn this.  </P> <P> BARBARA URSCHEL  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

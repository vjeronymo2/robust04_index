			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manmohan Sharma: "In the forthcoming </F> Elections in States, Local Parties Will Play Consequential  Roles"]    [Text] The regional parties will play a decisive role in  the eight vidhan sabha elections scheduled during the next one  and a half year. Just like the influence of the major national  parties is decreasing, the influence of regional parties is  increasing. The Congress (I) was in a bad situation during the  recent elections and lost Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.  The dream that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] had of emerging  as a national party was broken by these elections. The influence  of the communist and Marxist parties is limited to a few  localities, and they are not in position to claim the rank of  national parties. During the last few decades, the influence of  regional parties has definitely increased. Victory of Mulayam  Singh's Samajwadi Party in a huge state like Uttar Pradesh also  points to this change. The regional parties in northeastern  states have been enjoying control for a long time. According to  scholars, one reason for the increased popularity of these  regional parties is lack of interest by national parties in  local problems. The people start supporting their local parties  in order to resolve their problems.    Often, unbalanced distribution of development projects also  encourages regional emotions. Haryana was created because of  this. At present, regional parties are leading campaigns for  separate statehood for Bundhelkhand, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, and  Uttrakhand. It is our country's misfortune that five decades  have passed since our independence and, instead of considering  ourselves Indian nationals, we call ourselves Punjabi,  Rajasthani, Kashmiri, Dogri, Himachali, Malayali, and Kannada  residents. The louder the discussion of conceptual unity, the  harder the selfish politicians incite the emotions for  statehood, casteism, and regionalism to strengthen their vote  banks and obtain a position. There are many leaders in the  national unity commission who want to divide India over  language, caste, and religion.    Background of Regional Parties: The regional parties have  played an important role in politics since independence. The  Election Commission divided the regional parties into two  categories. Some of these are recognized parties and others are  merely registered as parties. The Election Commission recognizes  a party whose candidate get a certain percent of votes in an  elections. If a party succeeds in getting five percent of total  votes in four or five states, it is considered a national party.  According to Election Commission records, there are 261 regional  parties, and 30 of these are recognized parties. When a party  does not receive a specific percentage of votes, the Election  Commission cancels its recognized status.    According to an Election Commission report, 51 parties took  part in the 1952 election, however, only 20 of these did get  their representatives in the House. Fifteen of these were  regional parties. These included the Akali Dal, National  Conference, Hindu Mahasabha, Tamil Nadu Dalit Party, Ram Rajya  Parishad, Jharkhand Party, Common Wealth Party, Scheduled Castes  Federation, Kisan Kamgar Party, Karantikari Samajwad Party, Lok  Swaraj Sangh, Lok Paksh, Forward Block, Madras Muslim League,  and Travancore and Tamil Nadu Congress.    Their number went down to 13 by the second elections in  1957.  They won 39 seats. These included new and small parties such as  Dravida Munetra Kagzam, Congress Sudhar Simiti, Loksewa Sangh,  Muslim League, and Purvi Bharat Janjati Union. In the 1962  elections, 14 small parties succeeded in sending a  representative to Parliament with a total of 31 seats. The new  parties among these were: Ganatantar Parishad, Republican Party,  Nutan Gujrat Janata Parishad, and All India Hill Leaders  Congress.    The same situation prevailed during the 1967 elections. The  main change was the emergence of DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]  in Tamil Nadu which won 25 seats in the Lok Sabha. The DMK won  the government in Tamil Nadu. The reason for the DMK popularity  was the increasing approval of the anti-Hindi movement there.  Anna Durai created the difference between the Aryans and  Dravidians and floated the ideas of the superiority of  Dravidians and atrocities committed by the Aryans. Later the DMK  was split. M.G. Ramachandran rebelled against Karunanidhi's  policies and founded the ADMK [Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam].  At present, ADMK leader Jayalalitha is ruling Tamil Nadu. It is  a paradox of Indian politics that the ADMK which was established  on the hatred for Aryans and Brahmans is controlled by  Jayalalitha who is a Brahman herself. She is a daughter of a  dancer and an actor who worked in the Mysore royal court.    The people have complained about Telangana and royal limits  that the Nizam and the Andhra rulers had always ignored their  progress. In 1971, the Telangana movement became aggressive and  created a new regional party called the Telangana Praja Simiti  which won 10 seats in 1971. It got 14.43 percent votes in that  election. There was a polarization in Assam also. The new  regional party, the All India Hill Leaders Conference, ran for  elections and won one seat. Three other regional  parties--Peoples Democratic Party, Plain Tribal Council, and  Hill State Peoples Democratic Party--did participate in the  election, however, all their candidates lost their election  deposits. The Vishal Haryana Party led by Rao Vir Bhadar Singh  participated in the elections and won three seats.    The All India Arya Sabha participated in the Haryana  elections, however, its candidates lost. The Kerala Muslim  League and Kerala Congress ran for elections in Kerala. Both  parties won two seats each. The Akali Party ran for elections in  Punjab. It pitted its candidates at twelve seats, of which 11  lost. In Maharashtra, the Republican Party of India (Gaekwad)  won one seat with Congress Party's support. The Republican Party  of India (Khobergade) also ran for elections, however, all of  its 15 candidates lost. The Shiv Sena ran for elections over the  question of Hinduism and lost election deposits in 3 of the 5  seats. In West Bengal, three regional parties--Bangla Congress,  RSPSP [expansion not given], and the Muslim League--each won one  seat. The Sanyukta Govan, the Lokpaksh, and Maharashtra Gomantak  Party emerged in Goa. The Maharashtra Gomantak Party won the  majority there under the leadership of Mr. Dayanand Bandodkar.    The DMK was badly shaken in the 1977 election. It lost 24  out  of its 25 Lok Sabha seats. The ADMK emerged as a new force and  won 19 Lok Sabha seats. The Kerala Congress was divided into two  groups. The Manipur Peoples Party established government in  Manipur. The Ramrajya Parished was totally wiped out. Thus, 22  regional parties ran for elections in 135 constituencies and 13  of these parties won 52 seats.    The Election Commission issued registered symbols to 27  regional parties in the 1980 elections. Among these Kuki  National Assembly (Manipur), Peoples Congress (Mizoram), Sikkim  Congress, Tripura Upjati Yuva Morcha, Sikkim Janata Party, and  Telagu Desam were the parties. In 1984, the Telagu Desam emerged  as a major opposition party in the Lok Sabha with 29 seats. The  other parties remained in the same position.    The Andhra Pradesh government moved to the Congress Party  from Telagu Desam in 1987. In Punjab, the Akali Dal formed  government under the leadership of Mr. Surjit Singh Barnala. The  hurricane led by Chowdhery Devi Lal in Haryana wiped out the  Congress there. The Congress (I) took back the government in  Haryana in 1990.    The Telagu Desam is preparing to win the government in  Andhra  Pradesh again. Orissa's chief minister, Biju Patnayak, seeing  the weak condition of the Janata Party is organizing a small  regional party called Utkal Janata there. The Akali Dal in  Punjab is divided in to 16 groups. Recently the Langowal group  and the Talwandi group have merged. The Akalis have learned from  their experience in the past that they won whenever they  collaborated with the Jan Sangh. Perhaps, that is why the Akali  leader Prakash Singh Badal had strongly endorsed the Bharatiya  Janata Party during the recent elections. He has also  contributed to Bhairon Singh Shekhawat's winning the government  in Rajasthan. If these two parties form a coalition in Punjab,  the Congress (I) will be in grave danger there. As for Haryana,  three years ago when Bansi Lal had formed the Haryana Vikas  Party, it appeared the he was going to win the election.  However, the people in Haryana supported the Congress (I) in his  stead and elected Bhajan Lal to the government. Chief Minister  Bhajan Lal and his administration helped Chautala to defeat  Randip Singh, son of the dissident leader Shamsher Singh  Surjewala, in the bye-election in Narvana. Bansi Lal  collaborated with the BJP, however, their joint candidate could  not even salvage his election deposit. They could not help the  BJP candidate win in the Kalka bye-election. Later, his party  was divided thanks to Bhajan Lal who moved several of their  legislators and the lone Lok Sabha member to his side. There is  not doubt that the Bhajan Lal government in Haryana is on shaky  ground now. The Congress (I) did not fulfill the promises it  made to the people. Because of the disorganization in  electricity supply, the state is losing 2.5 billion rupees.  There is a major outcry in southern Haryana because of scarcity  of water. The people are cursing the day when they voted for the  Congress (I). If Bhajan Lal fails in doing a miracle, the  Congress (I) definitely will be wiped out in the next election.  The people in the state are leaning toward Uncle Chautala again.  The number of people attending his public rallies is increasing.  The Samajwadi Janata Dal is becoming regional in nature now.    Bangarappa Forms the Congress Party: Until now, it was  believed that the Congress (I) was very strong in south India.  However, this situation changed when Bangarappa, the former  Karnataka chief minister, rebelled. He has spoiled Congress (I)  high command's sleep by forming a new regional party, the  Karnataka Congress.    Bangarappa was expelled from the Congress (I) once before,  however, political contingencies forced the party to take him  back. Bangarappa is very popular among the Dalits and backwards  in the state. There is no doubt that his government was  notorious for corruption, unfortunately however, corruption has  become an integral party of our country's lifestyle, and the  voters do not pay much attention to it.    Bangarappa joined the politics in 1962 as a disciple of Dr.  Lohia. Later, he changed parties depending on which way the wind  blew, and enjoyed the fruits of being in government. Being from  the Lohia school, he is hard working and aggressive. His fracas  with his party leaders are common. Most of the Lohia disciples  are very liberal about their eating habits. They do not care  much for their clothes either. Bangarappa is different from them  in this area. He likes to wear spotless white clothes and plays  badminton. He also likes to jog. He used to jog for three  kilometers daily even when he was the chief minister.    He rebelled from the Join Socialist Party in 1963 and joined  the revolutionary group of the that party. In 1977, Dev Raj Urs  brought him into the Congress Party. They did not stay together  for long. In 1979, when Urs broke up with Indira Gandhi and  established Congress Urs, Indira Gandhi had Bangarappa run  against him to diminish his influence.    He could not get along with Indira Gandhi either. In 1982,  he  established a new party named Karantiranga with Dev Raj Urs in  Karnataka and won the elections by collaborating with the Janata  Party. He disagreed with the leadership later over the question  of appointing the chief minister. He resigned from the  Karantiranga and joined the Congress Party. He became the  opposition leader. In 1989, the Janta Dal lost the government  and he become the chief minister of Karnataka. Rajesh Pilot,  Sita Ram Kesari, and Buta Singh played a major role in getting  him into the government. Soon after he became the chief  minister, the Congress (I) legislators began to rebel against  him. Activities of the dissidents increased under the leadership  of Veerappa Moily. Reportedly Narasimha Rao had encouraged the  dissidents. Kerala's Chief Minister Karunakaran also wanted his  favorite person as the chief minister of Karnataka. Bangarappa  openly opposed the prime minister in the Kaveri water dispute.  This led to increase in the tension between the two. The  dissidents accused Bangarappa of the serious crime of amassing  billions of rupees illegally. It is said that Bangarappa, in  order to get the prime minister's support, tried to get his son  Prabhakar Rao to his side. The prime minister endorsed him in  the beginning, however, when the campaign against Bangarappa in  the newspapers became very strong, the Congress (I) high command  had to remove him. Veerappa Moily was his successor.    In the budget session of the vidhan sabha, Bangarappa levied  some serious accusations against the government of his own  party. In response, Moily assigned the Classic Computer fraud  case to the CBI to trap Bangarappa. The CBI searched  Bangarappa's house also and this made Bangarappa angry. He  blamed the prime minister for the recent defeat of the Congress  (I) in northern India. He also accused that Narasimha Rao was  playing into the hands of the BJP, and that he failed to protect  the Babri Masjid. He called Narasimha Rao a scorpion. He was  expelled from the Congress (I) because of it.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bank unveils Fnac sale terms Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, yesterday announced the terms of its FFr1.9bn (Dollars 359m) deal to sell a controlling stake in Fnac, the French music and book retailer, to Mr Francois Pinault, the entrepreneur. The deal, which coincides with the publication of a French parliamentary inquiry into the causes of Credit Lyonnais' financial problems, involves Artemis, the Pinault family holding company. Artemis is buying the bank's 64.6 per cent stake in Fnac for FFr3.065 a share, valuing the whole of Fnac at FFr3bn. However, Credit Lyonnais must first offer the Fnac stake on the same terms to Generale des Eaux, the French utility with which it collaborated last year to buy Fnac from GMF, the troubled insurer. Generale has 30 days to decide whether to exercise its pre-emptive rights over the shares. Mr Pinault, who made his name in the 1980s by turning his family's timber business into the vast Pinault-Printemps retail group, has for months been manoeuvring to take control of Fnac, one of the best-known names in French retailing. He tried to acquire Fnac last year when GMF put it up for sale, but was outbid by Credit Lyonnais and Generale des Eaux. However, Credit Lyonnais's deepening financial problems - it incurred a net loss of FFr6.9bn in 1993 and has secured the French government's support for a FFr44.9bn rescue package - have forced it to sell assets. The Fnac deal is the latest in a series of high-profile acquisitions by Mr Pinault, who is one of Credit Lyonnais' most prominent clients. Pinault-Printemps has been selling assets in order to reduce debts. However, Mr Pinault himself has been expanding his personal interests through Artemis. Two years ago, Artemis acquired a junk-bond portfolio from Credit Lyonnais as part of a debt-rescheduling agreement. Mr Pinault last summer bought Chateau Latour, one of Bordeaux's most prestigious wines, from UK drinks group Allied-Lyons, for FFr690m.</p>

Garcia, 60, had presented her credentials to the Honduran  Government 14 days ago and had returned to Colombia to present a  book entitled "Petition for Protection, Opening to Democracy."    The police reported the diplomat was traveling from the  coffee-producing area of Calarca, her hometown, to Santa Fe de  Bogota in the company of her sister Ruby Garcia, the Colombian  consul to Mexico, who was injured.    Ruby Garcia said a four-wheel drive vehicle blocked the path  of the car in which they were traveling, and two men came out of  it, and one of them shot the ambassador, who was taken to a  clinic in Ibague where she died.    The circumstances surrounding the attack on Ambassador  Garcia  are unclear. The police said robbery could have been the  motive, but murder was not ruled out.    Garcia, a Liberal, was governor of the western Department of  Quindio, where Calarca is located. She was also a member of the  Lower Chamber of the Colombian Congress. She lost her seat over  a scandal about alleged irregular activities favoring her  hometown's Culture House.    For more than 30 years the diplomat's political life was  characterized by her combativeness, which was reflected in  strong speeches, vigorous decisions, and constant clashes with  her adversaries.    Her body will reportedly be taken to Santa Fe de Bogota in  the next hours for an homage at the Congress of the Republic,  political friends of the murdered ambassador said.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 1 March carries in its  regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the continuing  fighting in the republic. Reception is fair.    Describing the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says  that  "the town is still in shock after yesterday's massacre of  civilians. A direct howitzer shot hit an ambulance killing four  civilians and mutilating 11, three of whom were children." He  says that "this was not enough for [Bosnian Serb military leader  Ratko] Mladic's butchers, and the shelling of the center of  Maglaj continued well into the night. Hundreds of howitzer  shells and mortars landed on the town. One person was killed in  the shelling." Sermic says that "the fierce shelling of Maglaj  continues today. Early this morning the aggressor launched a  powerful infantry attack on the southeastern part of the front,  in the (Siprage)-(Strajista)-Lijesnica direction. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters repulsed this attack, but the  aggressor has now launched a new attack, which is under way at  the moment."    In his report from Brcko, Hamid Deronjic says that "another  enemy tank has been destroyed on this front. The heavy  concentration and increased movement of the enemy armored and  mechanized vehicles, registered yesterday, enabled our fighters  to score a few points. The artillery of the 108th Motorized  Brcko Brigade again excelled, as yesterday afternoon at 1630 it  fired a precise shot and completely destroyed a T-34 chetnik  tank together with its crew. So yet another in the whole series  of Serb tanks on the Brcko front has been turned into a heap of  useless iron. During the night the aggressor fiercely shelled  the defense lines and civilian targets on the free territory."  Deronjic says that "there have been further clashes among  various groups of the Serb aggressor's army on the Brcko front.  Last night on the Cadjavac-Sumari direction the chetniks  exchanged mortar and small arms fire."    Reporting from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "Bihac and  Cazin suffered further destruction overnight. Insane, bloody,  bestial -- is there a word to describe the onslaught by chetnik  multiple rocket launchers, howitzers, tanks, and Vis? Thousands  of shells were fired overnight at [word indistinct], (Gornji  Troholj), [words indistinct], and (Srdjani). The industrial  zone of Bihac has been under the fiercest attack overnight and  this morning." He says that "the chetniks attempted further  breakthroughs but in vain as the heroes, the defenders, present  an impenetrable wall. Milosevic and Karadzic must finally  understand this."    Amila Salihbasic reports from Olovo that "the [Serb] enemy  attacks continued last night. The largest part of the artillery  that was withdrawn from around Sarajevo is now in use in the  chetnik positions around Olovo." She says that "the first day  of March has been marked by several mortar explosions, while  enemy infantry has intensified small arms fire at the defense  lines."    Sead Custovic reports from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st  Corps that "the population of the (Vrezani) area were woken up  this morning by powerful explosions of chetnik heavy artillery  shells. Early this morning the aggressor from (Sovrsko Brdo)  fired dozens of shells from an ESP [not further specified], and  120-mm and 82-mm mortars at the region of Vrbovik. Soon the  chetnik artillery in Podlugovi was activated, and a hill gun  shelled (Podzupce). It must be stressed that certain positions  from which shells are being fired are within the 20-kilometer  zone around Sarajevo, from where the artillery pieces should  have been moved long ago."</p>

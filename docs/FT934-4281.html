			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke postpones FID decision - Long handover period has led to confusion about future direction The Ladbroke group is believed to have drawn back from its announcement earlier this week that it would definitely take advantage of the new foreign income dividend scheme. The group is thought to have decided to postpone a final decision on whether to make use of the scheme until it has had time to discuss the matter with its shareholders. Ladbroke announced last Wednesday that it would take advantage of the foreign income dividend (FID) scheme when paying its 1993 final dividend in early July 1994. The announcement was one of the factors which led to the group's share price falling from 171 1/2 p at the start of trading on Wednesday to 145p yesterday. Using the scheme would result in a significant loss to pension fund investors because FIDs, unlike conventional dividends, do not carry a 20 per cent tax credit which tax-exempt investors can reclaim. The confusion over whether or not Ladbroke had made a final decision on FIDs appears to arise from a senior management hiatus at the group, following the announcement last September that Mr Cyril Stein, the veteran chairman, was to retire. Mr John Jackson, the new chairman, and Mr Peter George, the new chief executive, do not formally take up their positions until January 1. The long handover period has led to some uncertainty as to the group's future direction. The revelation this week that discussions were taking place over the future of Mr Michael Hirst, head of the Hilton International hotels subsidiary, is believed to have arisen from the same confusion. Mr Hirst is regarded as an outstanding hotel operator but the group had decided that a new senior manager was needed to work alongside him to exploit one of the world's best-known brand names. While discussions were going on, Mr Hirst sold 125,000 Ladbroke shares. The group said Mr Hirst sold the shares for personal reasons. The sale was announced on Budget day, four days after it had taken place. This created the impression that the group was trying to hide the share sale and also forced a premature announcement that discussions were taking place about his future. The new leadership at Ladbroke is expected to take steps to improve its communication with investors and the press in an attempt to avoid such mishaps. It is thought that many in the group now accept that its traditional reticence has led outsiders to assume the worst about its fortunes. Among other changes likely to take place is a more active property disposal programme.</p>

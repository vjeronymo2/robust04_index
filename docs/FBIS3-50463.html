			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, Jan 1 (AFP) -- An unexpected  "declaration of war" accompanied by the violent takeover of  three or four municipal offices was launched this Saturday by  the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) [Ejercito Zapatista  de Liberacion Nacional] in the southern state of Chiapas, which  borders on Guatemala and is one of the poorest states in Mexico.    The members of the previously unknown EZLN emphasized in  their proclamation, which was distributed among residents and  posted on the walls of buildings and the occupied  municipalities, that "we are aware that the war we have declared  is a last resort, but it is a just one."    In the proclamation, which was distributed in San Cristobal  de las Casas, where the rebels seized the municipal palace, the  EZLN asserted that "the dictators have been executing an  undeclared, genocidal war against our people for many years.  That is why we are asking for your determined participation and  support for this decision of the Mexican people, who struggle  for labor, land, roofs, food, health, education, independence,  freedom, democracy, justice, and peace."    "We declare that we will not stop fighting until we attain  these basic demands for our people by forming a government for  our free and democratic country," the proclamation highlighted.    The information on guerrilla actions in Chiapas,  approximately 700 km south of Mexico City, is confusing. There  are no details on the number of EZLN rebels participating in the  actions, on the results of the takeover of municipal officers,  or on any possible victims. It is known, however, that there  have not been any confrontations between the rebels and the Army.    The Zapatistas -- taken from the name of Emiliano Zapata,  one  of the most important heroes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution --  stated: "We are the product of 500 years of struggle;" we are  men "who have not been allowed to have the most elementary  training so we can be used as cannon fodder and so they can  plunder the wealth of our fatherland without caring whether we  starve to death."    "But today we say: Enough! We are the heirs of the  forefathers of our nation. We, the dispossessed, number in the  millions, and we call on our brothers to join us as the only way  to avoid starving to death due to the insatiable ambitions of a  dictatorship that has lasted more than 70 years, headed by a  clique of traitors who represent the most conservative and  turncoat groups."    This is the first time in almost 20 years that an uprising  by  a Mexican guerrilla group has been publicly known. However, a  few months ago there was information that rebel training camps  were being established in Chiapas.    The EZLN "War Declaration" states the following six points:    1) Advance toward the country's capital city, defeating the  Mexican Federal Army, and allowing liberated people to freely  and democratically elect their authorities.    2) Respect the life of prisoners and hand over the injured  ones to the International Red Cross.    3) Initiate summary trials against Mexican Federal Army  soldiers and political police who have taken courses in foreign  countries on "charges of treason to the fatherland."    4) Form new ranks with all Mexicans who manifest their  desire  to join our just struggle, "including those who, being enemy  soldiers, surrender without fighting our forces."    5) Ask for the unconditional surrender of the enemy  headquarters prior to combat.    6) Suspend the looting of our natural resources in areas  controlled by the EZLN.    The ideological affiliation of the Zapatistas, as well as  their real force, is still unknown. However, it is said they  are mostly Indians, although an eyewitness told AFP that there  are some men with fair skin and light eyes.</p>

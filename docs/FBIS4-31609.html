			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Ratko  Mladic, chief of staff of the army of the republic of Srpska,  tonight told Serb Radio's Sarajevo Studio that Muslim and Croat  forces again failed today to comply with the cease-fire on  Bosnia-Herzegovina's front lines. The heaviest attacks on the  republic of Srpska were launched in the Brcko area. There were  also enemy provocations on other front lines, Mladic said.    "We are going to continue our full compliance with what we  agreed to in Geneva, i.e. to refrain from offensive operations  and we are going to tolerate their attacks as long as they are  not a serious threat to the republic of Srpska and the Serbian  people," the chief of staff of the army of the republic of  Srpska said. He also said that the army of the republic of  Srpska "will not allow enemy forces to enjoy their leisure."    "We are following all their efforts to consolidate their  ranks within this month of cease-fire and to arm themselves and  prepare offensive operations, something they hinted at even  before their arrival in Geneva," General Mladic said.</p>

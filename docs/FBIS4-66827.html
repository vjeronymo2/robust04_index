			<p>CSO     [Text] Until the discovery of oil and the reliance on its  sale, the agriculture sector in Iran was considered one of the  nation's productive sources of revenue. The makeup of Iran's  population and its concentration in the rural areas made it  possible for most of the nation's active manpower to be employed  in the agriculture sector. However, when the nation became  inundated with oil, attention to this sector decreased day by  day. With the implementation of improper policies and the  adoption of guidelines and policies that were not compatible  with the ways and traditions of the people of Iran, and with the  rampant growth of assembly industries, Iran was gradually  transformed from a producer of agricultural and food projects to  a major importer of these kinds of crops.    In the years prior to the triumph of the Islamic revolution  the nation's income from the sale of oil was $25 billion per  year, while Iran's population was 36 million at most. Today  Iran's population is about to exceed 60 million, yet the foreign  exchange revenues from the sale of oil are about half what they  were before the revolution.    It appears that it is now vitally necessary to make a change  in economic structures, especially in the agriculture sector, in  view of the background that has been sketched.    Although during the First Five-Year Plan, with  implementation  of the Pivotal Wheat Project, production of this product  increased, bordering on 11 million tons per year, considerable  quantities of wheat, rice, cotton, meat (both white and red) and  even dairy products are still purchased abroad.    On the one hand, increased food production meets domestic  needs and prevents the expenditure of limited foreign exchange  to import food, and on the other hand, in view of the very high  added value of many food industries, if the country becomes a  food exporter a significant amount of foreign exchange will also  be obtained in this way.    On the other hand, the world's food industries are  considered  strategic and sensitive. The industrial and imperialist nations  sometimes use them as pressure levers. The secretary of  agriculture under President Jimmy Carter stated plainly that  America's most cutting weapon after military weapons is food and  agricultural industries and crops.    In the second half of the 20th century it has been seen  numerous times that the West and especially America have made  practical use of this leverage to advance their goals in the  world.    To become familiar with the problems and issues in the food  industry, the obstacles to developing conversion industries in  the agricultural sector and ways to increase the production of  food for consumption and export in the country, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I  held separate interviews with several insiders and experts in  the food industry sciences and industries, the results of which  you will read below.    The major place of the agriculture sector in economic  development and the gross national product is concealed from no  one, because even the world's most advanced industrial nations  have never considered themselves to be without need of growth in  the agriculture sector. Many economic experts believe that  self-sufficiency in the production of agricultural crops and  products is the preliminary to other technological and  industrial and, in general, economic progress.    Likewise, many of the world's economists consider  agricultural products to be the most realistic kind of product  because the wheels of production in this sector never stop, due  to the ease of access to such tools of production as land, solar  energy, and water.    Many of the world's underground resources, ores, and metals  have a limited life. Their extraction stops after a period of  time because these mines and resources such as oil, copper,  iron, aluminum, rock coal, precious stones and the like can  never be renewed and extracted again after they are used, and in  the future there will be no more resources to take their place.  However, agricultural resources can be renewed. As long as work  is done on the earth and as long as land, solar energy, and  water exist, the production of agricultural crops will continue.    In its present economic circumstances, our country has no  choice but to give more attention to the agriculture sector to  get away from reliance on limited and fluctuating oil revenues.    Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni, president of both the Food  Sciences College and Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society,  announced that there are more than 2,000 active food industries  producing units in the country. He said: Because of its varied  atmosphere and its 12 different climates, its productive soil  and its adequate light, Iran produces some of the best quality  agricultural crops in the world, crops such as Jaharom lemons,  bam citrus, Rafsanjan and Damghan pistachios, Mashhad melons,  and Khuzestan dates. Just as is apparent from Dr. Hoseyni's  remarks, Iran has no problem with the production of agricultural  crops, and the God-given and natural resources in the country  are considered a suitable ground for any kind of agricultural  activity. In his view however, numerous causes have kept our  country from using all its capacities and talents in the  agricultural sector.    In his view, there are currently weaknesses in the  management  of some of Iran's food industries because the managers in this  industrial sector usually do not have the needed specialist  skills and efficiency. At the same time, however, there are also  managers who manage their producing units at the level of an  international institution in accordance with world standards.    It appears that the lack of modern machinery and the  distance  in terms of technology between Iran's food industries and the  other comparable producing units in the world are considered two  of this industry's problems, yet if basic and fundamental  measures were taken to equip and rebuild the food industries,  our country would be able to compete with many of the world's  exporters in the production and export of various foodstuffs.    Activity in the production and export of food must be done  with care and precision, because otherwise in the long term it  is possible that the nation's food exports could suffer a severe  blow. For this reason, on the one hand we must plan to  understand the international markets and on the other hand, by  standardizing the production of consumer food products  domestically and maintaining constant quality control, we must  take our place in the international markets and especially in  those of neighboring and Islamic countries.    Hoseyn Vakili has a doctorate in commercial management. In  this regard, he adds: Some of the world's markets are eager for  Iran's food products. In developing our exports, we must not  covet all of the international markets, because this is quite  dangerous, and it is not even economical. For example, in all  the Islamic nations, whose populations total more than 1  billion, there are customers for food and canned goods made in  the Islamic Republic of Iran. Our exporters must put their  greatest attention and emphasis on the markets in the Islamic  nations.    Dr. Vakili, who was recently chosen as the official in  charge  of the Iran Canned Goods Cooperative Company, discussed the  necessity to liberate the nation's economy from its reliance on  oil revenues. He said: Iran's economy, which has certain  industrial distinctions compared to the other nations in the  world, can plan for exports of metallic and nonmetallic  products, food products, and handicrafts. Ultimately, with a  variety of foreign exchange-producing incomes from various  sources, the reliance on oil revenues will gradually be reduced.    At the same time he warned that the fever for exporting  nonoil goods is high now and every exporter, especially in the  food industries, is trying to export his products while adhering  more or less to acceptable international standards, in order to  earn foreign exchange. This is considered dangerous in  international trade, because when first developing nonoil  exports, if we do not observe predetermined standards,  indicators, and regulations, it is possible that our products  could be permanently excluded from the competition among  comparable goods, which are superior on international markets,  and they will lose the ability to compete.    Therefore if we do not take international standards into  consideration with regard to our country's export goods and  products, we will be cut out of the international markets in the  near future, and we will not find it easy to get back in. It is  perhaps for this reason that it is necessary to set standards  for export products. If the nation's exporters do not adhere to  international regulations and laws to standardize their  products, not only will they get nowhere exporting, they will  also damage the credibility of Iran's export products and goods  on the international markets.    In the near future, competition on the international markets  will be more complicated, with most nations joining the GATT  accord. Naturally nations will have to think about themselves in  this confusing world market. While making the necessary decision  about whether or not to become a part of GATT, they will be  seeking suitable markets for their export goods.    On the other hand, studies that have been done show that the  added value of the food industries compared to other producing  and economic units is quite high, and this is considered one of  the undeniable benefits of this industry. A simple comparison  between the revenues and expenses of the food industries with  those of oil shows that investment in these industries is much  more economical than in the oil sector and comparable areas.    Dr. Hoseyni, chief of the Society of Specialists in the Food  Industries and Sciences, says in this regard that one ton of  exported oil earns about $80 in foreign exchange revenues and  consumes about $10 to $20 in foreign exchange, and consequently  a maximum of about $60 to $70 in foreign exchange comes into the  country, but a ton of export tomatoes sells for at least $500  and only consumes $70 in foreign exchange. Therefore, the  country receives about $430 for every ton of tomatoes it exports.    Likewise, the price of a ton of concentrated fruit juice on  the international markets is about $1,300, and it consumes no  more than $300 foreign exchange. Consequently the country  receives about $1,000 for every ton of concentrated fruit juice  it exports.    Although these revenues are significant, packaged  agricultural products have not been exported and these goods  cannot have that much revenue. For this reason, investment in  the conversion industries in the agricultural sector is  important. Statistics show that 30 to 50 percent of the food  produced in the Third World and in Iran is destroyed between  harvest and consumption. The Fruit and Produce Union has  announced that of the 15 million tons of fruit and summer  vegetables produced in the country annually, about 4.5 million  tons is destroyed in various ways between harvest time and  consumption. In this same regard, Fereydun Golafra, manager of  the specialist journal KESHAVARZ, writes in an editorial in  issue 170 of this journal: While every year about 400,000 tons  of tomatoes is processed by our nation's conversion industries,  only about 6,000 tons of tomato paste is exported, mostly in  cans. This weakness is due to the fact that the ability to  package and even produce tomato paste in Iran is less than what  it should be.    For example, a country like Italy alone can produce about  350,000 tons of tomato paste per year, packaged in small cans.  Some of the tomato-paste-producing units in this country have  the capacity to produce more than 70,000 tons per year, yet the  largest tomato-paste-producing factory in Iran only has the  ability to produce 12,000 tons per year.    Due to this very shortage of packaging and conversion  industries, our country, despite its extensive resources for  producing tomato paste, is unable to participate actively in  international markets, and it even drives away customers because  of its inability to answer their needs. Ultimately, the world  markets do not even open an account for tomato paste and other  Iranian food exports. Golafra noted that last year Iran lost a  32,000-ton tomato-paste deal with Libya because it could not  answer the customer's need in time.    The manager of the journal KESHAVARZ also noted that in the  future our country will need to have a presence on the  international markets more than it does today in order to be  able on the one hand to reduce food product losses and on the  other hand to be able to return to vegetable and fruit growers  the earnings of their labors, thereby helping the economy to  prosper.    He also recommended that to increase food exports the  government must insure all export contracts.    It appears that this recommendation can be given attention  and have an effect on the development of nonoil exports,  provided that the exports are regulated and done in such a way  that they do not damage the credibility of the nation's products.    Some other experts believe that the main problem with Iran's  food industries is the weakness of its packaging and shipping of  goods.    Behruz Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the  Iran Food Industries and Sciences Society and executive director  of Behruz Food Industries, is one of these people. He said:  Packaging has various advantages, including the fact that in  preserving the food, helping with the distribution and sale of  the goods, facilitating storage and shipping, increasing the  amount of marketing and providing the necessary information and  instructions for the proper use of the package's contents have a  strong effect on the customer.    He explained that the world's food packaging and  preservation  industry is 180 years old, but in Iran this industry has no more  than a 60-year history. According to a study by experts, about  7.2 million tons of the 15 million tons of agricultural and farm  products produced in Iran can be sent to market in packaged  form. Before the canning industry appeared, in the old days many  Iranian families spent the spring, summer, and fall storing some  of the food they needed such as jams and vinegar pickles for the  winter. Sometimes in the cold regions such as Azerbaijan they  fried meat in animal fat and kept it as stew in special crocks  for consumption later and in the winter.    Now, however, with the growth in the population, the  increase  in the number of urban residents and changes in lifestyles from  rural to urban modes, the traditional ways of preserving food  are also gradually being forgotten. Therefore, to make the best  use of food and keep it from spoiling and also to find  international markets, while we should pay attention to  traditional methods such as drying vegetables for domestic  consumption, more attention must also be given to the conversion  and canning industries.    Based on statistics from the Food and Agriculture  Organization (FAO), Americans convert to canned goods 90 percent  of their tomatoes, 79 percent of their olives, 65 percent of  their green beans, 62 percent of their green peas, 54 percent of  their sweet corn, 41 percent of their asparagus, 55 percent of  their pears, 75 percent of their apricots, 50 percent of their  peaches, and 40 percent of their apples, but according to the  executive director of Behruz Food Industries, for various  reasons such as the lack of packaging and canning industries in  our country, every year at least 300,000 tons of apples (30  percent of the entire crop), 50 percent of the grapes, and  400,000 to 600,000 tons of citrus fruit (25 percent of the crop)  were destroyed.    The production of packaged and canned food in Iran is so  insignificant that nothing is left for exports. According to the  statistics from Iran Customs, in the period between the years  1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989] and 1369 [21 March 1990-20  March 1991] an average of $7 to $10 million in packaged food was  exported. According to these statistics, 90 percent of Iran's  food exports were not packaged.    Thus, with a simple calculation it can be seen that in the  area of food industries our country has not had the necessary  development and progress at all. In this regard, however, one  keep in mind the important point that the level of consumption  of packaged food in Iran does not have to be as it is in the  West, because basically the tastes of the people in the East and  especially Iranians do not resemble or have points in common at  all with Westerners.    The people in our society in the rural areas and even in the  northernmost points in the cities will not consume packaged  foods as long as they are not forced to do so. They prefer to  purchase their food fresh and cook it themselves, although these  kinds of packaged foods claimed their place in the Western food  basket years ago. Despite the difference between the tastes of  our people and those of the West with regard to the consumption  of packaged and canned foods, it cannot be claimed that the the  food packaging and conversion industries in the agricultural  sector have grown sufficiently in Iran. Every insider in the  food industries gives reasons that are obstacles to the growth  of the food and conversion industries in Iran. Some believe that  the collection of taxes on export food and also the heavy  tariffs on the needed imported machinery and equipment are among  the major obstacles to growth in the conversion and food  industries. In the same regard it is said that export foods are  only 50 percent tax exempt yet export goods are exempt from the  payment of all taxes.    On the other hand, a number of insiders in the food  industries also consider the import of foreign food, which is  sometimes unsanitary and lacking in standards, is also one of  the problems in this sector. According to the view of these  people, along with the means, which are being made available for  food producers and exporters, the paths for importing beverages,  chocolates and in general all the foods whose counterparts are  produced at higher quality inside the country must be blocked.  Of course, this not be done in such a way that the possibility  of competition is eliminated and that domestic food producers,  despite having undesirable products, are content and satisfied  in a market they dominate and in which there is no competitor.    The shortage of currency in circulation and investment are  among the other existing problems of those working in the food  industries. As the result of the unification of the foreign  exchange rate the price of raw materials and imported machinery  has risen sharply and this has caused the currency in  circulation to be insufficient to meet the needs of the owners  of this industry. Apparently so far the banking system has not  supported the food and conversion industries as much as it  should either.    Likewise, due to the obstacles in the path of production,  investment in our country has always been more in the services  and commercial sectors than in the other sectors society needs.  For this purpose, and to develop food conversion industries and  increase nonoil exports, the commercial banks should grant  credit facilities at low profit rates to encourage investors so  they will build factories for the packaging and conversion  industries in the agricultural sector.    Elsewhere in his talk, Forutan discussed the necessity to  activate the Export Guarantee Fund and to coordinate food export  and import laws and regulations in a way that is appropriate for  the current requirements. He said: The shipping problem is  considered another deterrent to the development of food  industries, because due to the susceptibility to spoilage for  these kinds of materials, they must be moved inside and outside  the country in the shortest time possible. However the high cost  of shipping, especially via aircraft, on the one hand and on the  other hand the lack of the necessary refrigeration at the ports  and points of departure, are bringing producers up against  increasing problems.    It is also absolutely necessary to create centers for  research and study in the food industries sector. By organizing  and unifying the research under way in the food industries,  wasted time and energy can be prevented to a great extent and  this work can gradually become valuable.    Food industries research units can be guided and supported  by  the government in all the food industries units with the  cooperation of food science colleges. If these units are  equipped with the necessary tools and if they do not remain  uninformed of the research and achievements of other comparable  research institutions in the world, they will be able on the one  hand effectively to teach and train food industry specialists  and technicians and on the other hand to increase the country's  ability with regard to food exports and to develop  competitiveness on international markets compared to comparable  products. In any case the problem of packaging in Iran's food  industries is not merely a matter of art, design, attractive  packaging, and quality printing. The main problem is the weak  technology and lack of advanced equipment in this sector of the  industry.    Mehdi Mojahedi, member of the board of directors of the  Khorasan Union of Compote and Canned Goods Factories, said that  Iran's production of many agricultural crops is much greater  than its domestic need. He described the conversion industries  as a powerful arm in the agriculture sector. He said: Due to the  lack of packaging industries, a large amount of the food  produced in Iran goes out of the country without packaging and  without authorization via the nation's western, eastern,  northern, and southern borders, so that unofficial exports of  food are several times greater than the exports done officially  adhering to the rules and regulations through points of  departure to official markets.    In any case, although during previous years the food and  conversion industries sector has been ignored, now the nation's  executive officials have realized this industry's importance in  answering the needs of domestic consumption and also its role in  earning foreign exchange. For this reason, with the decisions  that have been made, one may hope that during the Second  National Five-Year Social, Economic and Cultural Development  Plan, the food and conversion industries will grow and develop  more and find their place in society's economic affairs.    According to Dr. Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyni, chief of the  Society of Specialists in the Food Industries and Sciences and  Majles deputy, 350 billion rials in loans for the development of  food industries has been allocated from Note 3 in this year's  budget bill.    He discussed the quality of Iran's agricultural crops. He  said: Fortunately, due to the high quality of its agricultural  crops, Iran always has the potential of producing large amounts  of food exports. For example, Iran already has regular customers  in advanced countries such as Germany, Switzerland, England and  a few other countries for its pistachios, canned goods (tomato  paste, pickles, tuna fish, and other things), mayonnaise, and  various kinds of dried fruits, despite the fact that it is very  difficult to compete in these markets and all food exporters are  making efforts to establish themselves in the European markets.    With all this, our country still must seek to find new  markets throughout the world and especially in the Islamic  nations and in the region and it must obtain its appropriate and  rightful share of the world economy. To keep from falling behind  our competitors on world markets, we must give more importance  to research, and along with that we must not neglect to equip  and rebuild the machinery in our producing units to create  variety and innovation in packaging.    Dr. Hoseyni, chief of the Food Sciences University, proposes  in this respect that with regard to the food industries, the  training of technicians and the research it does, our country  should be in continuous contact with countries like England,  Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, Italy, France, and Japan, which  have made significant progress in the food industries. He called  upon Iranian food industries specialists living outside the  country to correspond with the Society of Food Sciences and  Industries Specialists, to participate in the relevant  congresses and seminars having to do with food inside the  country and to make their findings available to the food  industries and those working in it.    Along with the efforts the government and the public are  making to develop food industries, one must not forget one very  important point and that is that the food industries in every  region of the country must be appropriate for that region's  potential, because otherwise the costs of moving agricultural  crops will be very high.    As was said, in some of the nation's fruitful provinces the  food industries are a suitable basis for development and growth.  In view of the fact that each agricultural crop is harvested at  a specific time of the year, the necessary proportion must be  created between the size of food crops and the conversion  industries.    In a province like Khorasan with its relatively vast size,  some agricultural crops, orchard produce and summer vegetables  are produced in abundance and in superb quality. For this reason  the development of the conversion industries in such provinces  must never be overlooked.    According to Mehdi Mojahedi, member of the board of  directors  of the Khorasan Union of Compote and Canned Goods Factories, in  this province there are already 55 major units producing compote  and canned goods, 10 of which have been recently established,  and all of which have the governor-general's approval. Although  the production of some agricultural and farm crops in some  provinces is much greater than the provinces themselves need,  one must realize that a number of regions in our country, due to  their geographic position, do not have the ability to produce  significant agricultural crops.    In some population centers like Tehran, the people are  strictly consumers and with the exception of a few farms on the  outskirts, there is effectively no particular crop produced in  this province. Therefore it is necessary to make maximum use of  the producing capacity of the various provinces, raise the  profitability of agricultural lands, make use of agricultural  and orchard machinery and to the extent possible to consolidate  lands to increase returns.    Shahrokh Zahiri, executive director of a major food industry  unit, which has been active in this area for almost two decades,  emphasized the need to make use of skilled and expert manpower  in this sector of industry. He said: Food producers must have  knowledge of this work in order to produce the ideal product and  at the same time they must prevent the negative propaganda  against domestic food industries.    At the same time, to the extent possible, domestically made  machinery must be used to develop and equip the food industries,  so that while creating the resources for the growth of industry,  the departure of foreign exchange will be prevented. Behruz  Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food  Industries and Sciences Society, noted in this regard that so  far various experts from Asian and European countries have  visited the Iran Food Industries factories at this society's  invitation, and have been impressed by the positive performance  of the machinery made in Iran.    He believes that we must have a national motivation for the  work we do, leave the "nonrenewable mines" for future  generations and to make maximum use of renewable resources such  as the agricultural sector, fisheries and manpower, which can  neither be renewed nor preserved for future generations.    Forutan added that it is very important to package food for  domestic and foreign consumption, because every consumer item  such as food, carpets, cloth, canned goods, and other things  must attract the eye of the consumer and get his attention.    Iran's geographic and strategic position and our country's  position on the globe, which is about the same distance from  both East and West and has numerous Muslim nations as neighbors,  confers a valuable privilege on those who live in this land.  Forutan, a member of the board of directors of the Iran Food  Industries and Sciences Society, noted that shared religious  affiliations, ease of access to the region's markets and similar  tastes are among the factors that give Iranian products special  distinction in the markets of the Islamic nations, and all of  these factors can be used to develop exports and earn foreign  exchange.    Mohammad Ashkuri, formerly executive director of the "One  and  One" Food Production Factory is active even now in the  production, installation, and start up of food machinery and  equipment. He assessed Iran's existing technical potential. He  said: Iranian technical experts in the manufacture and  installation of machinery to produce food products have grown to  the point that sometimes they can take complicated foreign or  domestically made machinery and install it in other countries.    He emphasized the need to use God-given and natural  blessings  such as the varying climates in the different regions of Iran.  He said: With the exception of the nation's northern regions, in  the rest of the provinces we have sunny weather about 300 days  out of the year, and we must not overlook the situation that few  countries enjoy other than ours, which is that the average  production of various kinds of fruit in Iran is greater than the  established international per-capital level.    He emphasized that more than 84 percent of the raw materials  needed by the food industries are produced in the agricultural  sector. For this reason, Iran's food industries should be  supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the other  ministries should be active in relation to this sector solely in  construction and industry affairs.    Continuing his remarks, Ashkuri said that to the extent we  are able we should build the machinery needed by the food and  conversion industries inside the country, but if we cannot we  must import some of them, because no country in the world can  produce all the equipment it needs on its own.    However, what has not been discussed very much up until now  is how to revitalize and make better use of of the traditional  methods of preserving and keeping food in Iran.    Iranians have long had various methods for keeping  vegetables, fruit, and even dairy products and meat, some of  which cost very little and have also passed the test in terms of  hygiene. Those working in the country's food industries should  not completely promote Western methods of keeping food. They  should also do research and study on traditional methods of  keeping food in Iran, and they should make changes in the  traditional ways of drying vegetables, seeds and grains, because  by drying some fruits and vegetables, not only are their special  characteristics not diminished, but also sometimes with the  actions and reactions that take place, the amount of vitamins in  these kinds of crops sometimes even increases.    Therefore, even if it is necessary to develop the conversion  industries to reach export food markets, we should not plan for  the people inside the country in the same way as for foreign  markets and put products on the domestic markets that are  suitable for the tastes of others.    The final point is that some export goods such as saffron,  licorice, henna, and other things, although apparently slight in  volume, command a very high international price, higher than the  price of the products and crops that are made from these  products. For this reason, now that the world's most desirable  saffron is produced in our country, we can also produce the  subsequent products that are made using these raw materials and  sell them on the international markets with very high added  value.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME REALTORS, TEAMWORK PAYS;  </P> <P> PARTNERING: WITH HIGHER PRICES, MORE LISTINGS AND DEMAND FOR SERVICES, IT PAYS  MORE AGENTS TO SPLIT THE WORK.  </P> <P> A doctor and his wife had filed for divorce, but continued to live in their  Beverly Hills mansion, the wife in one wing, the husband in the other, while  the house was up for sale.  </P> <P> Listing agent Bobbie McCall of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young, who got along  better with the wife, recalled, "If I got lucky and the husband wasn't there, I  could show the whole house, but if he was there, I could only show her side."  </P> <P> McCall tried to get the estranged couple to reach a compromise, but they  wouldn't talk to each other. "I was caught in the middle," McCall said, so she  turned for help to her "partner" in the office, September Kimble.  </P> <P> "It was easier for me to work with the husband," Kimble recalled. "So I showed  his side of the house and Bobbie showed the wife's."  </P> <P> When an offer came in, Kimble went to one restaurant for the doctor's  signature, while McCall went to another restaurant for the wife's. "And we made  the deal," Kimble said.  </P> <P> For partners Kimble and McCall, who have worked together for the past eight  years on 80% of their transactions, this was another example of "partnering"  paying off.  </P> <P> Partnering, the teaming up of two or more agents or brokers, is a growing  phenomenon in the residential real estate business of Southern California,  particularly in the high-end markets.  </P> <P> Among the reasons:  </P> <P>  -- With a slowdown of the market, there are more listings to be serviced.  </P> <P>  -- Sellers, especially of luxury homes, are demanding more service.  </P> <P>  -- An increased number of real estate documents and threatened lawsuits have  made it difficult for an individual realtor to handle the workload.  </P> <P>  -- Escalating crime has made it unsafe to be on some streets alone at night,  some women agents point out.  </P> <P> But perhaps the most important reason that partnering has increased sharply in  recent years is that high Southland prices have made commission splits more  feasible.  </P> <P> There are two types of partnering.  </P> <P> One is the classic variety. Partners do most or all of their business together,  pooling work and dividing profits 50/50, like Debra Berman and Pat Kandel, who  sold $50 million in homes last year at Jon Douglas Co.'s Marina del Rey office.  </P> <P> The other is a joint-venture type arrangement in which partners team up on a  deal-by-deal basis, like Joyce Rey, who has, by her own count, nearly 10  partners on separate 50/50 deals at any given time. Rey is co-founder and  general manager of Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills, which only handles  $1-million-and-more homes.  </P> <P> Commissions on the sale of such houses are big enough for each partner to take  home a sizable sum. A top agent who is a 50/50 listing partner would make, for  example, about $35,000 on a $4-million deal.  </P> <P> The full commission probably would be 5%, or $200,000, and that would be  divided 50/50 between selling and listing agents. Of their $100,000, the  listing partners would get 70%, or $35,000 each, and the listing brokerage firm  would get 30% for phone, advertising and other expenses. Real estate companies  generally get 50% from agents who are not top producers.  </P> <P> But even a top producer selling nothing but expensive homes could fail when it  comes to partnering, because there are other factors besides high prices and  commissions that make it work.  </P> <P> A big factor is volume. Because the commission is split, the sales and listings  volume of each partner should be as high or higher than it was before the  partnership was formed, said Perry Cross, who has been partnering for 10 years  with his wife, Anne, at Jon Douglas Co.'s Studio City office.  </P> <P> Michael Alley, who has partnered with Patty Chiarodit at Ramsey-Shilling in  Toluca Lake for three years, said, "Because we're partners, we have to double  our efforts."  </P> <P> Berman and Kandel each came into their partnership five years ago with 15  listings, and since then, they've maintained an average of 30.  </P> <P> "Our income has definitely increased because of partnering," Kandel said, "but  I don't think partnering is for everybody."  </P> <P> As Jack Sammons of Fred Sands Realtors, Sherman Oaks, explained it, "I had a  partner for three years, but I fired her, because I was doing all the work."  </P> <P> Another drawback: "You can lose your identity," Kandel said.  </P> <P> She and her partner heavily promote the entity Berman-Kandel, and clients often  mistake one of them for the other. But it amused them when they got some  correspondence addressed to Mr. Berman Kandel.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, brokers felt  </P> <P> partnerships were not a successful pattern," said Jon Douglas Co. General  Manager Lou Piatt, "because we thought of them as two people trying to cut down  on effort by sharing the work, so the productivity of one would be divided by  two.  </P> <P> "But we have several extraordinary partnerships now where people . . . are  </P> <P> far more successful than they were individually. Success has to do with the  chemistry of the relationship and the commitment."  </P> <P> Berman and Kandel stress this in seminars that they give regularly. They spoke  at the National Assn. of Realtors convention in Dallas in November and before a  group of 1,000 real estate agents in San Francisco last May.  </P> <P> "Partnering is definitely a trend," Kandel said. "There is a lot of interest in  it."  </P> <P> "But a lot of people partner for the wrong reasons," Berman added. "Some just  want to take more time off."  </P> <P> A partner can take off more time without worries, knowing that there is another  agent or broker who is just as involved in a deal, Kandel said, "but both  partners must be willing to work equally hard and do such unglamorous jobs as  putting up "For Sale" signs and knocking on doors.  </P> <P> "And a partner shouldn't be brand-new to the business," said Kandel, who had  sold homes for 11 years before teaming with Berman, who was equally  experienced. "People should be able to hold their own without using a partner  as a crutch."  </P> <P> But, ironically, that's how the idea began.  </P> <P> Partnering started in the late 1960s with a summer program for junior brokers  at Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate in Los Angeles, said Jay Haskell, who  worked for Coldwell Banker at the time but is now president of the Seeley Co.  </P> <P> The program placed a junior broker, called "a rookie" or "a runner," under the  tutelage of a senior broker. After a year of training, the rookie could earn  commissions, splitting them with the senior broker. Until then, the rookie was  paid a minimum salary.  </P> <P> Ron Rader, executive vice president of the Klabin Co., an Inglewood-based  commercial real estate firm, said, "The first time I was a partner on a  transaction was with a senior broker in our office. I did all the grunt work  like ordering signs and mailers, but when it came down to the fine points of  the deal, the senior partner negotiated it.  </P> <P> "We called it an 80/20/50 split; I did 80% of the work, he did 20%, and we  split the commission 50/50, but I wouldn't have had access to such a big deal  without the senior partner."  </P> <P> The same process goes on in residential real estate offices, where partnering  began as a "mentor program" years after it started in commercial real estate.  </P> <P> Cecelia Waeschle of Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills said, "When I first got my  real estate license in 1980, I gave up half of any commissions I would earn to  work in a mentor program in Beverly Hills, but I got incredible training."  </P> <P> In a recent deal as a partner with Joyce Rey, Waeschle proved true one of the  lessons she learned in that training. It was, she said, that "there is no free  ride in partnering: If you don't get the client, you must put in the hours."  </P> <P> By going into the office on Labor Day, Waeschle found a house for some buyers  whom Rey had obtained as clients. "Partners should be willing to go the extra  mile," Waeschle said.  </P> <P> Pasadena realtor Jane Caughey, who has been partnering for nearly five years  with Kelly Brock at Podley, Caughey &amp; Done, agreed.  </P> <P> "I couldn't do nearly as much business on my own as with a partner, because  we're both willing to go the extra mile," she said, "and with so many listings  now, four legs are better than two."  </P> <P> With a slowdown in the market, there has been an increase in listings and a  longer period for homes to sell, resulting in a greater demand for service.  </P> <P> Rick Merrill, regional president of the Prudential California Realty, cited the  "buildup of inventory" as a reason for the growth of partnering, which he  claims is more common in high-priced areas of Southern California than anywhere  else in the country.  </P> <P> "The closer you get to Brentwood, Bel-Air and Beverly Hills, the more  partnering you see," he said, estimating that 30% to 50% of the deals in those  communities are partnered.  </P> <P> The higher the selling price, the more practical it is to split the commission,  noted several partners, though some -- like Darlene Todorvich and Margaret  Hathaway at Century 21/The Lidle Co. in Covina -- sell some homes priced at  $100,000.  </P> <P> Most Southland home prices are well above the national average, however, and  that is why competition among realtors here is keen.  </P> <P> "Because of the prices, agents go into listings with as much talent as  possible," Merrill said. "A high producer will team with a superstar agent  because the high producer realizes that the competition also includes a  superstar.  </P> <P> "But another factor is that some of our better agents are so busy that they  will partner to spread the work around. With more listings, our best agents are  busier satisfying customers than before. For the past 18 months, listings  weren't on the market that long, so the amount of service was less."  </P> <P> Sellers of high-priced homes expect more service anyway, said James R. Gary,  owner/broker of a Woodland Hills-based realty firm who does joint-venture deals  with two partners.  </P> <P> "A movie or TV executive in Calabasas Park is going to expect an agent to  provide services that are more commensurate with the price of his property. So  the agent is going to do a whole lot more for his money, like hold more open  houses and do more advertising," he explained.  </P> <P> Listing agents of luxury houses, from the San Fernando Valley to San Marino to  Tustin, are expected to be present for every showing, he said, "and oftentimes,  this requirement is put into writing."  </P> <P> The listing agent's presence is required, high-end realtors say, to demonstrate  features, be a buffer between the seller and potential buyer and/or buyer's  agent, protect valuables and prepare the house for showings.  </P> <P> "You can't just let a potential buyer's agent loose in a 10,000-square-foot  house," Gary remarked.  </P> <P> It took him an hour every time he prepared to show a $3-million Calabasas  house, which was about that size. "I would prepare the staff, open the drapes,  turn on the lights and fountains," he said.  </P> <P> Gary also says that partners can help each other process the many real estate  documents. "Over the past 10 years, we've seen an exponential increase in paper  work with every sale," he said.  </P> <P> Pat Hug of the George Elkins Co. in Newport Beach agreed: "The amount of paper  work needed to put together a deal is 95% greater than it was when I left real  estate in 1982. That's one reason I got together with Linda."  </P> <P> Impressed with Hug's energy and experience, Linda Taglianetti, a 13-year  veteran in selling houses, persuaded Hug to leave retirement four months ago to  become a 50/50 partner, though Hug had worked mainly on her own for 25 years.  </P> <P> "I don't like details," Hug said. "I like negotiating and showing, but Linda is  like an attorney. She knows the documents inside and out." In these litigious  times, Hug conceded, she is more confident having Taglianetti as a partner.  </P> <P> "It is also safer to have a partner if you have to go out at night," said  Covina agent Margaret Hathaway, who has teamed with Darlene Todorvich for five  years. "I think there are more partners now because of the safety factor."  </P> <P> Beverly Hills agent Bobbie McCall remembers waiting until 2 a.m. for a client  to get back from a party to sign a deal. "I wouldn't want to do that alone,"  she said.  </P> <P> Debra Berman recalls completing three transactions one night, with the last  appointment starting at 10 p.m. "Partnering made it so much easier," she said.  "We called our husbands, and they felt . . . we were safe because we were  together."  </P> <P> "There are some scary times when I'm glad to have my partner with me," said  Nadine Bartholomew, who teams with Nancy Short at Turner &amp; Associates in  Laguna Beach. "Like today, when we knocked on a door (for a listing) and this  kooky fellow invited us in. I'd never knock on a door alone."  </P> <P> Bartholomew and Short have been partners for 18 months, but they have been  friends for 15 years.  </P> <P> Alice Helm and Virginia Johnson, who work at Mike Glickman Realty in Sherman  Oaks, also have been friends longer than they've been partners, and they have  much in common. Both are mothers with several grown children.  </P> <P> Helm and Johnson also have differences, however, which they have learned to use  to their advantage in partnering.  </P> <P> "Everybody loves Virginia," Helm said of her partner of 12 years. "She's sort  of a mother image. So when there is something tough to do, like reduce a  client's price, I have to do it."  </P> <P> "Alice is good at that," Johnson observed.  </P> <P> When Bartholomew and Short go to get a listing together, they see "who relates  better with the client," Bartholomew said. "Inevitably, one of us gets along  better, so the client has a choice." Clients then work more with one of the  partners than the other.  </P> <P> As Sandy Khadar of Hanu Reddy in Irvine, who isn't partnering now but did for  three years, explained: "If you don't have a personality that fits a client,  you can have the client work with the other partner."  </P> <P> Danny Bibb, who works on a deal-by-deal basis with Stefanie Grody or Stella  Shirar at Grubb &amp; Ellis in Newport Beach, said, "With us you have a choice  of working with a man or a woman, and that's ideal, because males and females  may have different perspectives."  </P> <P> "Some clients relate better to a man, others to a woman," said Joe Babajian,  who has joint-venture partnered with Judy Cycon for nine years at Fred Sands  Estates in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "Kathleen's strengths are my weaknesses," is the way Dorothy St. Amour  described her 14-year partnership with her sister, Kathleen Van Sant-Fisher of  Rancho Santa Fe Properties in San Diego County.  </P> <P> "But we approach business the same way," Van Sant-Fisher quickly added. "We  both enjoy working hard, we're enthusiastic and have a sense of fair play."  </P> <P> Pasadena realtor Kaughey said, "Partners, especially those who split the work  and profits 50/50, need to be simpatico in their approach."  </P> <P> And they often think alike, said Rose Borne, who has been a 50/50 partner with  Marilyn Nelson for five years at Stan Herman &amp; Associates in Beverly Hills.  </P></p>

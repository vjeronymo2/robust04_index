In a change from the previous over-elaborate formalities,  more and more Chinese, who are leading a better and more  efficient life, are turning to faster and more economical ways  of conveying their greetings.    In Guangzhou, which has the most telephone users among all  cities in China, many people dialled to express their good  wishes on New Year's day this year. A few simple words on the  phone easily bring people closer despite the distances between  them.    Central China's Hunan Province opened a greeting wire  service  during the New Year festival and cut fees for trunk calls by  half.    In Dongshan Island, southern Fujian Province, the number of  calls sent by local villagers to their friends and kin in Taiwan  increased by half over the previous years.    During China's traditional Spring Festival, sounds of pagers  could be heard everywhere in large cities. Digits appearing on  pagers indicated all kinds of good wishes.    In Taiyuan, capital of northwest China's Shanxi Province, it  was counted that during the Spring Festival, the pager system of  the city's telecommunication bureau sent over 100,000 greetings  each day.    In the past, telegrams told people of emergencies. However,  many post offices have opened telegraph greeting services.  Along with telegrams, people could also receive gifts, such as  flowers or cakes, which were sent at the request of their  friends.    A young man who was in love with a girl but was too shy to  say it, sent a greeting telegram and a bunch of flowers on New  Year's day. Since then he has sent a greeting telegram as well  as a rose to her every day. The telegrams helped him to show  his affections.    Officials said that the booming of the greeting wire service  comes with the booming of the country's telecommunications.    Last year, 18 cities widened their handling capacities of  telecommunication systems.    In Taiyuan, the capacity of the city's telephone network has  reached 304,000.    With the improvement of living standards, more and more  people ask for modern communication channels. As a result,  experts say, greeting wire services are bound to become even  more popular.</p>

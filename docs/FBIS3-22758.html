Dr. Nu'man Jalal, chairman of the committee and Egypt's  permanent delegate to the Arab League, said that the committee  has prepared a paper that it will present to the next session of  the Arab League Council, due to be held on 27 March. The paper  contains a plan to coordinate Arab efforts through various  international forums with a view to stressing the importance of  creating a zone that is free from mass destruction weapons in  the Middle East.    Dr. Jalal said that the plan incorporates various elements  in  the Arab position, foremost of which is the desire to end the  arms race in the region and its security and economic  repercussions. Resources currently used to stockpile arms should  be diverted to boost economic development programs and modernize  the region's economies, Dr. Jalal stated.    Dr. Jalal added that the committee stressed the need for all  the countries in the region to be treated equally, with no  exceptions made for any.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES  </P> <P> Also on the kid beat: NBC is looking into the prospect of a tyke version of  "Saturday Night Live," complete with an ensemble cast, ages 9-15, in the "SNL"  format. Tentative title, according to a source: "Saturday Morning Live."  </P> <P> NBC is mum on the project, but a well-placed source says the show would  probably be taped before a studio audience, to avoid problems with a young cast  performing live. Two young adults would also appear as regulars on the  half-hour show.  </P> <P> Also in the offing: a parade of NBC kid favorites, such as the "Cosby Show"  youngsters and ALF, as guest hosts, along with grown-up stars.  </P> <P> One proposed recurring bit: "Baby Terminator," a tot who inadvertently wreaks  havoc in the adult world.

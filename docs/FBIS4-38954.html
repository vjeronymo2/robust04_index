			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol June 2 TASS -- The Crimea's local  parliament disagreed with President Yuriy Meshkov when the  latter announced on Thursday that following the latest changes  in the situation on the peninsula, the issue of government  formation was no longer as urgent as before. Therefore, Meshkov  said, he did not insist on immediate approval of government  ministers, but suggested that presidential decrees be given the  force of law in full compliance with the results of the March 27  republican referendum.    "I believe this proposal need not any discussion, since it  reflects the people's will and should be put to vote right now.  The more so as this is critical to the Crimea, for it enables  to promptly respond to the fast-changing situation in the  republic and about it", the Crimean president noted.    The draft law on legislative acts passed by the president  provides for endorsement of presidential decrees on issues not  regulated by the republic's legislation and parliament.  However, many speakers at today's parliament session pointed  out that the draft law contradicted the Crimean Constitution and  allowed the president to put his decrees into force not waiting  for parliament to approve them. Furthermore, Meshkov has not  yet signed the Crimea's restored Constitution of May 6, 1992,  which for this reason cannot be considered effective at the  moment.    After heated debates, the majority of lawmakers representing  the Rossia faction voted to remove this issue from the agenda.    The parliament passed a decision on a three-kilometer-wide  zone along the coast of both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov,  in which land plots can be allotted only with parliament  approval. It was also decided to set up a temporary commission  to examine all the plots allocated in this zone in the period of  1992-94 to ensure compliance of their acquisition with law.    After that, lawmakers got down to debates over the structure  of the Crimea's new parliament.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News focus" by Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- When Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa meets Chinese leaders during his trip this  weekend, he is expected to speak more frankly on the human  rights issue than his Japanese predecessors, though in softer  tones than U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who  visited China earlier this month.    "We are very much interested in the question" of China's  human rights, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said,  confirming that the issue will be on the agenda in Hosokawa's  meetings with President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin  and Premier Li Peng between March 19 and 21.    "We are in a position to offer the Chinese Government  friendly advice" on the human rights problems, the spokesman  said.    He did not elaborate on what this "advice" would be, but  government sources have suggested Japan is likely to call on  Beijing to urgently tackle the problem "in an internationally  understandable way," without mentioning specific cases such as  the recent detainment of prodemocracy activists.    Following the intense exchanges on human rights during  Christopher's trip to Beijing last weekend, the Japanese  Government is in a quandary over the extent to which Hosokawa  should refer to the problem.    Japan, which has traditionally taken a different approach on  human rights issues from Western countries, is torn between the  United States and China.    Hosokawa agreed to Christopher's request to bring up the  human rights issue in his talks with Chinese leaders.    Christopher told Japanese leaders last week the U.S.  considers improvement in the human rights area as an important  condition to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status to  Beijing and called for Japanese support in pushing China's  leadership to improve its human rights records.    Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Ronghi told Hosokawa in  Tokyo last month he does not think it appropriate to link  China's human rights record to the renewal of MFN status.    China's MFN status, which must be extended every year under  U.S. law, ends in June. Washington has linked further extension  this year to a "significant overall improvement" in China's  human rights record.    Japan, whose ties with Washington have soured during the  past  month over trade disputes, does not want to upset the U.S.  further in either the political or security arenas -- the other  two main areas of bilateral relations -- and thus wants to avoid  seeming too restrained in persuading China on human rights  improvement.    But Japan also does not want to upset Beijing, which insists  that human rights are an internal affair, by pushing the issue  too hard lest it damage Sino-Japanese relations.    Tadashi Ikeda, the incumbent deputy foreign minister and  former director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs  Bureau, explained the nature of Japan's approach on human rights  in the February issue of "GAIKO FORUM," a monthly magazine on  diplomacy.    Japan considers "confrontational approaches" on human rights  problems ineffective, and regards an approach which takes  account of a country's social, economic and political situations  as more realistic, Ikeda wrote.    Since Western countries have themselves developed in those  areas over a long period, Japan thinks it unrealistic to urge  developing nations to ensure human rights immediately or put  pressure on them, he wrote.    It was this policy which led Japan to break with its Group  of  Seven (G-7) partners and resume official loans to China in 1990  after the G-7 had announced sanctions against Beijing at the  Paris summit in July 1989 following the military crackdown on  the prodemocracy movement at Tiananmen Square the previous month.    In August 1991, then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was also  the first leader among major developed countries to visit China  since the Tiananmen Square incident.    Foreign Ministry officials said the expression Hosokawa is  to  use in calling on China to improve its human rights record is  not yet decided.    Hosokawa told his aides he wants to say what he "ought to  say" concerning the matter, suggesting that he would speak out  on the issue more frankly than the previous prime ministers from  the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), according to government  sources.    Since assuming the premiership last August, Hosokawa has  been  trying to break away from nearly four decades of LDP traditions  and develop more originality -- in everything from the way he  gives news conferences to expressing apologies for Japanese  actions during World War II, which was something of a taboo for  his predecessors.    Using strong expressions or not, Hosokawa will urge China to  improve its human rights record by suggesting that Beijing could  better win international support and understanding for its  economic reform policy if it convinces other nations of its  desire to improve internal problems, including human rights, the  sources said.</p>

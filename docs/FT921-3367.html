			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A modern battle to keep museums competitive - Nick Garnett visits the Museum of Army Transport in Beverley, a business with a special collection of problems and advantages THE VIEW from Teddy Penn's office window encapsulates a rather curious contrast. The massive Early English and Perpendicular architecture of Beverley's magnificent minster looks down on artefacts associated more with violence than with the good of the spirit. A Saladin armoured personnel carrier, a camouflage-green Bedford army lorry and an Army snowcat in operational white. In this small Humberside market town, the Museum of Army Transport looks incongruously large. Stretched over three acres of a former tannery, two of the acres covered in, the museum houses 120 vehicles, some captured booty from the Gulf war and what is claimed to be the last of the largest (or at least the fattest) production aircraft built in Britain. Surrounding the site are miles and miles of fields and the North Sea. 'Many people thought it wouldn't survive,' says Penn who has managed the museum since it was set up in 1982. 'They thought I was a lunatic.' The venture not only casts light on the operational headaches of setting up and running a museum. It also shows perhaps the only way of attracting public funding and no-cost labour to a business project. The museum is a company, limited by guarantee, but with charitable trust status. It attracts Pounds 100,000 a year from Beverley council and can call on more than 60 non-paid local volunteers to supplement its paid staff of 20. One exhibition on the supply of equipment to Russia through the Middle East during the Second World War was researched, put together and physically built by an unpaid volunteer. 'Museums do need to make a profit though because they have to purchase exhibits,' says Penn. Unfortunately, the Museum of Military Transport never has, underscoring the sometimes precarious financing of museums. Purchasing exhibits was not an issue when the museum started. It already had them. Historic military vehicles had been brought together at the nearby Leconfield army base but space was short and the former tannery site in proved attractive. Almost all the museum's equipment, from early military steam trains to a 1940s mobile bakery sent out on active service to the Falklands, is still owned by the Royal Corps of Transport. Penn, a 63-year-old former lieutenant colonel, negotiated the lease with the development company which owned the site. The local authority payed for the lease (Pounds 74,000 in the first full year) and the RCT loaned the collection. The museum's management council is composed of two people from the army, two from the local authority and eight elected by the museum's 60 'members'. Since the start, the Army has expressed little interest. 'It has always been a matter of unhappiness that we haven't had Ministry of Defence recognition.' It took just six months to get the museum up and running even with only Pounds 3,000 available, apart from the lease money. The now defunct Community Programme funded by the Manpower Services Commission provided 75 people and the commission also paid for building materials. Last year the museum attracted 100,000 people. Its total 'income' was Pounds 300,000. This included a Pounds 93,000 council grant which exactly matched the yearly rent the museum has to fork out. Entrance fees contributed Pounds 120,000, the rest came from the museum shop (books, toys, aircraft models), the cafeteria and space rented out for conferences and lectures. A workshop which handles outside contracts nestles at the back of the museum. One project is to restore Pink Panthers - garishly painted desert Land Rovers once used by the SAS. 'You can buy a reasonable one in the UK for about Pounds 8,000, providing you can find them because only 70 were built,' says Wally Dugan, a volunteer restorer. 'The owner has a buyer in the US where they sell for about Pounds 37,000.' The Museum of Military Transport's outgoings show why small museums often find their backs to the wall. Apart from the rent, wages soak up another Pounds 90,000 or so. Yearly insurance premiums are Pounds 10,000, heating and light Pounds 25,000, office costs Pounds 10,000 and advertising Pounds 25,000, mainly through regional newspapers and radio stations. Such museums can easily tip into crisis, a point underlined by what happened at the end of the 1980s. Penn left to run a local training company for two years. During this period, he says, wage costs got out of hand and a decision to put the cafeteria out to food contractors backfired when it started racking up losses. Penn returned two years ago though he is now working for free. He had been earning Pounds 8,000 a year as museum head, supplementing a similar-sized Army pension. The museum is back on an even keel in spite of the recession which has cut customers. The total last year was about 25,000 down on three years ago. The venture must also raise a large chunk of cash to cover-in its sole aircraft exhibit, the dumpy Blackburn Beverley transporter. 'We have to put a hangar around it or it won't last,' says Penn. 'We've raised Pounds 20,000 so far.' He is fond of the truncated whale shape and the poem written about it: 'So beware you budding birdmen Lest you drop an awful clanger Don't fly Blackburn's pet abortion Better try to fly the hangar.' Penn believes the museum has a duty to restore equipment, undertake research and provide help with the school curriculum. 'I like to think we are also a bit of a science museum.' He is wary of treating the venture as a hobby. 'You can get too carried away. You know, saying it would be a lovely museum if only you didn't allow people in.' Penn is not an aficionado of military vehicles and enjoys running the museum as a business rather than 'museumology' for its own sake. He has learnt a few marketing tricks in the process - which might help him in his quest for employment outside the museum. Takings from school trips in the shop alone three years ago were greater than the total take from school visits last year. In January, Penn scrapped entrance fees for school visits and school numbers jumped by a 50 per cent. Museums like Beverley will always suffer from one weakness. 'They are not businesses where you can demand a high price for their products.' (Adult entrance fees are Pounds 2.50.) But they have some advantages. 'It's like a big family here.' A lot of fun too, especially during the live vehicle demonstrations the museum holds in the summer. 'Finding an unused car and rolling a tank over it is always good for a laugh.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Son Chae-kyu] </F>   [Text] Washington, June 9 (YONHAP) -- Although Jimmy Carter  has taken pains to stress that he will be visiting North Korea  in a private capacity, the former U.S. President's trip is  drawing keen interest as it could lead to a breakthrough in the  nuclear impasse.    In announcing his planned visit to Korea, Carter made no  mention of the nuclear dispute. But it was obvious he intends  to take up the question with North Korean President Kim Il-song  when he said he hopes to "discuss the important issues of the  day with the leaders of the area."    He also could act as "a messenger" between the leaders of  South and North Korea since he said he plans to visit Seoul  following his stay in Pyongyang.    Despite efforts by Carter himself to play down the  significance of his trip, official expectations in Washington  are apparently running high as a White House spokesman told  reporters, unsolicited, that Carter is expected to meet Kim  Il-song. Moreover, the State Department confirmed that it has  already briefed the former President on the nuclear issue.    Such high expectations are also based on Carter's experience  as a peace mediator in Panama, Nicaragua, Sudan and the Middle  East.    Some Korea watchers in Washington point out that Pyongyang  has shown a sympathetic attitude toward Carter and therefore, if  there is anyone best suited to helping resolve the North Korean  nuclear row, it must be the former U.S. President.    On the other side of the coin, however, is a sizeable body  of  opinion in the U.S. Capital that too much significance should  not be attached to Carter's visit. Commentators in this camp  note that Carter's trip is being realized at "Pyongyang's  initiative" and not Washington's.    In order, perhaps, to discourage the public from expecting  too much, Carter himself noted in his statement that North Korea  has issued many invitations in the past, making it clear the  upcoming visit has not been "hastily arranged" for any  particular purpose.    One State Department official involved in the dispute over  North Korea's nuclear program said there have indeed been  suggestions in some quarters that Washington send a special  envoy to Pyongyang.    But the official said he wanted to make it unequivocally  clear that the question of sending a special envoy to Pyongyang  has not been studied.    Nevertheless, any new attempt to resolve the issue appears  to  be worth watching as the United States is experiencing  difficulties in putting together a Security Council resolution  on economic sanctions and North Korea is reacting strongly  against moves by Washington and its allies.</p>

He said the fakes had been confiscated by 30 local  law-enforcement officers during a week-long crackdown on the  illegal trade in tiger bones and rhinoceros horns last September.    China has strictly banned transaction, transport and use of  rhinoceros horns and tiger bones, which were used in making  traditional Chinese medicine.</p>

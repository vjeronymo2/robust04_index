			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera from Central Park in </F> Caracas; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] ...to be able to modernize government structures; to  make Venezuelan democracy stronger through the participation of  the people; and to incorporate institutions and ideas that have  developed within the context of dramatic recent changes at the  national and international levels.    We, therefore, believe constitutional reform is essential  for  today's Venezuela. At the same time, however, we admit and  proclaim that the success of constitutional reform must be based  on whether it manages to understand and address the concerns,  aspirations, desires, and needs of the nation. This is why  prominent academic institutions are insisting on the need to  discuss all topics related to this fundamental problem. It is  essential that this be done in order that the idea of reform can  thrive. This will also enable the reform to revitalize and  strengthen the democratic institutions that were confirmed when  the Venezuelan Constitution was approved on 23 January 1961.    At times, I confess, it seems as though this topic is absent  from the overall larger issues that trouble the people. Also,  the issue of constitutional reform is frequently precluded by  the questionable aspiration to convene a Constituent Assembly.  This issue has to be seriously and objectively studied. We must  look at prior cases and examples that can guide us in reaching a  decision. We must take into account the fact that our country's  historic experiences clearly indicate that every attempt that  has been made to resolve Venezuela's problems by breaking its  institutionality have led to situations, and frequently very  quickly, that were sometimes worse than the ones they tried to  correct.    This is the situation that must be confronted today. In this  sense, we must also remember and remind the Congress of the  Republic that it must base its conduct and actions on two  indispensable pronouncements: Reforms must be necessary and  timely, and they must correspond to the Venezuelan people's  larger concerns within the context of today; also, according to  the text of the 1961 Constitution, the overall reform of the  Constitution has to be submitted to a popular referendum, and  the people have to be the ones who decide whether it is approved.    Therefore, Congress is not the arbiter of those institutions  that must be reformed when the reforms are prepared solely in  accordance with Congress' own views and interests. In terms of  constitutional reform, Congress must interpret the people's  will. The reform that has been discussed, prepared, and adopted  in the legislative chambers, through the complicated process  stipulated by the Constitution, must be submitted to the people  for their approval and ratification. I sometimes have the  impression that legislators lose this perspective. In turn, I  believe it is necessary for them to remember the fact that the  work they are going to carry out is completely useless if the  people decide not to approve it. They have to adopt a position  that truly represents the people's concerns, aspirations, and  wishes.    When we assumed the task of preparing the reform bill,  accepting the legislative chambers' mandate that established a  unicameral commission, we strongly endorsed this position. We  did this because the initial proposal to approve a new  amendment--a third amendment to the Constitution--gradually  changed to an overall constitutional reform, primarily because  of the dynamic march of events in the country. We have  emphasized this to the legislators, and we want to do this again  now.    I sincerely believe this task is unpostponable. My modest  opinion is that we should continue the initial process started  during the previous constitutional period, because the  Constitution establishes that once the reform process has been  initiated, it must follow all of the procedures established for  the approval of laws. Therefore, once the process, required by  the Constitution, starts....

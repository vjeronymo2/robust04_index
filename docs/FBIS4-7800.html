			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Michel Viatteau] </F>   [Text] Knin, Croatia, April 5 (AFP) -- Both separatist Serb  forces and Croatian troops were respecting Tuesday [5 April] a  day-old ceasefire in the breakaway republic of Krajina, UN  Protection Force [UNPROFOR] officials said here.    UNPROFOR's Colonel Geroge Oehring, who visited the area  Monday, when the truce began, said the withdrawal of heavy  weapons had almost been completed ahead of the Tuesday morning  deadline set for this pullout.    "The withdrawal of weapons occurred and is still occurring.  Most importantly, we had guns silent this night, first time  since last September," said the Canadian officer, the UN  military commander for the area.    According to the agreement which took effect Monday morning,  Croatian army forces and secessionist Serbs had until 0700 GMT  Tuesday to withdraw all their heavy weapons from an agreed area.    The ceasefire accord between the two sides was reached last  month after negotiations at the Russian embassy in Zagreb,  ending some two years of war in the region.    Oehring said Serb weapons still in the area near Licka were  not completely withdrawn because of technical problems -- the  Serb separatist forces underestimated the amount of time it  would take to move the weapons.    "The ceasefire is working, it is a cause for celebration,"  said Oehring. "Both sides are seriously following the  agreement," he added.    By Friday, April 8, the two sides should have established a  demilitarized zone two kilometers (1.2 miles) wide. UN forces  will patrol this zone, Oehring said.    He confirmed that the Croat airport at Zadar-Zemunik, closed  because of Serbian artillery fire, had been reopened to civilian  flights. Regular flights from Zagreb to Split were to resume  soon, he said.    Separately, UNPROFOR civilian affairs coordinator Enrique  Aguilar and EU military observers' chief Jean-Pierre Thebault,  said they hoped the two sides would meet in the next few weeks  to discuss economic cooperation.</p>

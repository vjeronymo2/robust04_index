			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Accountancy rules attacked Leading accountants yesterday criticised regulations published by the government as part of its pledge to reduce the audit requirements for smaller limited companies. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales attacked the government for failing to consult adequately before issuing draft guidelines which it said had resulted in 'bizarre transitional arrangements'. Its financial reporting and accounting group said the regulations were silent on the appointment, removal or resignation of the 'reporting accountant' who would take the place of the auditor. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has also written to the DTI saying the regulations would require the reporting accountant to perform detailed work which would all but nullify any attempts to reduce the regulatory burden.</p>

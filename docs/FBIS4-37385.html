			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait, 20 June (KUNA) -- Admiral Sir Benjamin  Bathurst, chief of the Naval Staff of the British Royal Navy,  said here today that the British presence in the region will  continue as long as there is a need for it.    He described the Kuwaiti naval base in Ras al-Qulaya'h as  "one of the most advanced in the world."    Bathurst told a news conference that the aim of his current  visit to Kuwait is to continue developing strong ties between  the two countries in the defense field, especially in the naval  sphere.    Bathurst, who is visiting Kuwait as part of a Gulf tour  which  will include the Sultanate of Oman and the United Arab Emirates,  stressed Britain's strong commitment to continue protecting Arab  Gulf security in the future and to continue its military  presence as long as the situation requires it.    This morning Bathurst met Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad  al-Hamud al-Sabah and Major General 'Ali al-Mu'men [name as  received], General Chief of Staff. [passage omitted]    The British Royal Navy chief of staff said his talks with  Kuwaiti officials concentrated on issues related to Kuwaiti  naval forces and Kuwait's intention to buy patrol boats. He  stated that the talks also dealt with joint exercises. The  British-Kuwaiti exercises, he said, will take place in September.    "We have to take every opportunity to carry out joint  exercises. I hope that joint exercises with Arab Gulf  Cooperation Council states and coalition forces will take place  in the future," the British naval commander said.    "There was an emphasis on training members of the Kuwaiti  naval forces in the United Kingdom. I welcome the presence of  members of the Kuwaiti Navy at technical courses, from the  highest to the lowest levels."    Bathurst clarified that the talks gave him the opportunity  to express the United Kingdom's support for Security Council  resolutions on sanctions against the Iraqi regime.    "The Iraqi Navy still has some capabilities, particularly  missiles, which still pose a threat, but the situation will  remain under control as long as we are cautious and maintain our  presence in the region," Bathurst said.    "The United Kingdom will continue to raise the issue of  Kuwaiti prisoners at the Security Council."    He said the talks also dealt with the conflict in Yemen and  stressed Britain's support for Security Council Resolution 924,  calling for an immediate cease-fire and the sending of  international observers.    Bathurst is expected to leave Kuwait for Britain tomorrow  morning, ending his Gulf tour. [passage omitted]</p>

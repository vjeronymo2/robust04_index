During the meetings, he said the United States will  make a decision on the resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic  trade talks which were broken off at the recent Japan-U.S.  summit after examining a package of measures to open the  Japanese market which Japan plans to map out during this month.    At his meeting with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Secretary of  State Christopher said: While the United States has been working  on the reduction of its federal budget deficit, Japan has yet to  fulfill its responsibility for cutting its trade surplus with  the United States and expanding imports. What is important is  the visible trade result. I hope that Japan will take measures  in wide areas.    The U.S. secretary of state also indicated that the United  States will make a decision on whether to resume the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, which remain suspended, after  examining the package of measures to open the Japanese market  which Japan plans to map out during this month. In response,  Prime Minister Hosokawa said: We are fully aware that Japanese  and U.S. economies are in a difficult situation. The government  is doing all in its power to map out a package of measures to  open the Japanese market to reduce Japan's trade surplus with  the United States.    At the meeting prior to the Hosokawa-Christopher meeting,  Foreign Minister Hata expressed a sense of crisis in the  Japan-U.S. relations. Foreign Minister Hata and Secretary of  State Christopher agreed on the following point: The Japan-U.S.  relationship is an allied relationship based on the security  arrangements, and both Japan and the United States have common  responsibility for the world prosperity. The two countries  should seek to resolve issues pending between them through  dialogue in order not to heighten tension between them in the  economic area.    During the meeting between Foreign Minister Hata and  Secretary of State Christopher, the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear development was raised. Foreign Minister Hata  said Japan highly appraises tenacious effort by the United  States to hold talks with North Korea. Japan would fulfill its  responsibility as a UN member if talks on nuclear inspections  end in failure. In this way, the foreign minister indicated that  Japan would cooperate with economic sanctions to be imposed by  the UN Security Council.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Telegraph begins to feel price pain: Pre-tax profits slip 12% to Pounds 30.3m in first half and Conrad Black acknowledges 'severe effects' of the cuts Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph, said yesterday that price wars in the UK's national newspaper industry represented the company's biggest challenge since its move from Fleet Street eight years ago. 'We look forward to meeting that challenge,' said Mr Black as he announced a 12 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 30.3m, from Pounds 34.6m, although the 1993 interim figures were helped by the sale of investments. The price-cutting war launched by Mr Rupert Murdoch's The Times has eaten into Telegraph profits. The decision to counterattack, by cutting the weekday price of the Daily Telegraph to 30p, cost the group Pounds 1m in the six days of the change included in the six months accounting period to June 30. A further Pounds 1m was spent on a voucher scheme - a form of discounting used before the price cut. In addition, Pounds 8m was spent on promotion during the period to protect the Daily Telegraph's circulation against the 20p Times. Mr Black acknowledged yesterday that the 'severe effects' of the cover price reduction would be reflected in group results in the shorter term, and promotional costs to support the titles would continue to be significant. 'We are dedicated to maintaining the quality of our products and the pre-eminence of these products in the newspaper advertising industry,' said Mr Black. Since the Daily Telegraph cut its price, circulation has increased from about 993,000 to 1.07m. Mr Black added that areas had been identified where costs could be saved. Promotion expenses, for example, would be reduced in the second half. Mr Stephen Grabiner, the Telegraph's managing director, said the irony was that the new readers were largely the young people the Telegraph had tried and failed to attract in the past. 'We could end up with a better readership profile as a result of this. That is the only good news there is now.' Mr Grabiner added that the company could not 'afford to blink' in the price wars. The drop in UK circulation revenues of around 4 per cent was offset by good results from the John Fairfax newspaper group in Australia, an associate company. The contributions from associates more than doubled from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 11.8m. Operating profit at The Telegraph was down by Pounds 3.5m at Pounds 20.3m. Earnings per share were 15.8p. This compared with 13.4p excluding the effects of investment sales and 16.6p including them. The interim dividend remains unchanged at 5.5p. John Fairfax results, Page 22</p>

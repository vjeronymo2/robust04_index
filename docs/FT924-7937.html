			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Royal Insurance cuts losses by 60% to Pounds 83m FURTHER evidence of a recovery in the UK insurance sector emerged yesterday when Royal Insurance, the composite (general and life) insurer, reported reduced losses for the nine months ending September 30. Pre-tax losses were cut by 60 per cent to Pounds 83m compared with Pounds 214m in the same period of 1991. General insurance losses of Pounds 96m (Pounds 207m) were offset by higher life profits Pounds 38m (Pounds 37m) and a lower interest burden Pounds 25m (Pounds 44m). The announcement prompted a positive reaction from the markets and the share price rose by 21p to close at 247p. The company's performance in the third quarter was substantially better, with pre-tax losses cut to Pounds 4m as against Pounds 117m last year when it made heavy provisions for mortgage indemnity losses. Improvements in the domestic UK market underpinned the result. General insurance losses in the nine months fell to Pounds 57m, from Pounds 227m. In the third quarter, for the first time since June 1990, the company produced a pre-tax profit on general insurance of Pounds 16m, compared with a loss of Pounds 123m a year earlier. For the nine months, domestic mortgage indemnity business continued to be a problem area, but losses fell to Pounds 136m from Pounds 173m. Losses on personal motor insurance fell from Pounds 28m to Pounds 2m, as a result of higher premiums, reduced exposures and lower claims frequency. Losses from commercial property policies rose Pounds 1m to Pounds 27m, mainly due to the impact of the IRA bombs in London last April. Elsewhere, US business produced a Pounds 12m profit compared with a Pounds 14m loss last year, in spite of the impact of hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. Total group losses from these events are estimated at Pounds 35m. Royal UK lost Pounds 2m from the hurricanes, mainly due to claims from Grand Metropolitan, whose Burger King buildings in Florida were damaged. Royal International recorded a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m against Pounds 4m in 1991, but profits at Royal Canada fell to Pounds 22m, from Pounds 31m, and pre-tax losses at Royal Reinsurance rose from Pounds 11m to Pounds 41m. Royal has reduced staff numbers worldwide by 2,500 since the beginning of the year, with 1,170 jobs cut in the UK. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Italian SE to launch options on MIB index The Italian stock exchange is planning to introduce a range of options contracts over the next year, including new options on individual shares which make up the MIB index. Mr Attilio Ventura, chairman of the exchange, said that there were also plans to introduce options contracts on the exchange's new stock index future which is based on the MIB index. Trading in the stock index future itself is set to begin on November 28. The new options on individual shares will be exercisable any time during the life of the option. The options on individual shares quoted on the Milan bourse, known as premi, are typically of short duration and are exercised at maturity. Mr Ventura said the new derivatives products were being introduced as part of efforts to increase liquidity following a big increase in interest from overseas investors. Daily trading volumes in Milan have increased sharply in recent years. Trading in all the new derivatives products will be screen based. The exchange is also planning to introduce a secondary market for small and medium-sized companies. Earlier this week NatWest Markets introduced a market in warrants related to each constituent part of the MIB - made up of the shares of 30 leading companies - and said it would create a liquid secondary market by publishing 'live' two-way prices on Reuters.</p>

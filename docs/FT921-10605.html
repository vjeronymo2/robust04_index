			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Washington to replace United Nations envoy MR Thomas Pickering, the highly regarded US envoy to the United Nations, is to leave his post this summer to become ambassador to India  - a move which has surprised observers in New York and Washington. He will be replaced by Mr Ed Perkins, the 63-year-old director general of the Foreign Service. Mr Perkins, who is black, will move into a high-visibility post, one of the few top foreign policy jobs occupied by minorities in the Bush administration. Mr Pickering's three-year posting was due to end in the summer, but many diplomats thought he might have been asked to stay on. The ambassador, a former US envoy to Israel and El Salvador, played a key role in securing passage of UN resolutions against Iraq. It seems, however, that he had too high a profile for the taste of Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, who jealously guards every inch of territory in foreign policy. Officials close to Mr Baker have suggested that Mr Pickering was too quick to claim credit for administration successes and also discussed policy too openly. But this view is dismissed by Mr Pickering's supporters.</p>

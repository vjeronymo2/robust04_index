			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democracy Party Deputy Nizamettin Toguc by </F> Guido Olimpio in Italy; date not given: "Turkey: Six Kurdish  Deputies May Face Capital Punishment" -- first two paragraphs  are CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] Turkey is stepping up the pressure on the Kurds.  Six DEP [Democratic Party] deputies have been stripped of  parliamentary immunity and imprisoned. The Army has unleashed  harsh repressive measures in the Kurdistan region in order to  block the offensive which the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  -- the anti-Ankara guerrilla movement -- is expected to launch  in the spring.    Nizamettin Toguc, DEP deputy for the Batman region, stated:  "My six colleagues are risking the death sentence, and are  being treated like members of a terrorist group. Their sole  crime is having stood up for the Kurds." After being seriously  wounded in a terrorist attack last September, Toguc is now in  Italy to publicize his people's tragedy.    [Olimpio] Is the Turkish Government's hard line inspired by  the military?    [Toguc] That is correct. The generals have never stopped  meddling in politics and have brought a lot of pressure to bear  on the authorities. It was the Security Council that drove  parliament to deprive the deputies of their immunity.    [Olimpio] Is Turkish Prime Minister Mrs. Tansu Ciller again  playing the Kurdish trump to offset internal problems?    [Toguc] The government is grappling with a profound crisis.  The state's coffers are empty, particularly because of the war  in Kurdistan. The government is in the difficult position of  having to demand further sacrifices from the people, and having  to meet the military's requests for more funds.    [Olimpio] What do you think of the upcoming local elections?    [Toguc] If these had been free elections, we would have  supported them wholeheartedly. However, in order to prevent us  from taking part in the vote, the state has attacked the DEP.  Dozens of activists have been arrested, bombs have been planted  in the various parties' headquarters, and candidates have been  intimidated. This is why the DEP has decided not to take part  in the elections, and has requested the people to abstain.  [Toguc ends]    An even harder line was adopted by the PKK, which warned  candidates not to run in the elections: "Those who do not obey  this order, will pay a high price," came the message. The  resistance's dictate was accompanied by a diplomatic offensive  which led PKK leader Abdullah Farhat's brother Farhat Ocalan to  Moscow. According to Lebanese sources, Farhat was received by  head of foreign counterintelligence Primakov, who promised to  provide support and weapons.</p>

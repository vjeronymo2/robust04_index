			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3M, BILLBOARD ARTIST IN DISPUTE;  </P> <P> ART: HE SAYS THE COMPANY IS CENSORING HIM BY BACKING OUT OF A DEAL TO ERECT AN  ANTI-TOBACCO INDUSTRY BILLBOARD.  </P> <P> "Who's burning America?"  </P> <P> That's the question Los Angeles artist Charles Sherman has been longing to ask  Southland residents for the past three months. But according to Sherman, a  major corporation is trying to stop him.  </P> <P> Sherman signed a contract in June with 3M National Advertising Co., a  subsidiary of the Minnesota-based 3M Corp., to erect an anti-tobacco industry  billboard at Crenshaw and Washington boulevards. And while local 3M officials  approved the project and cashed his check in August, the 43-year-old artist  claims the company is attempting to back out of the deal.  </P> <P> "3M reserves the right to refuse to display any message in which the content or  the presentation is in questionable taste," said Peter D. Bear, manager of  government and community affairs at the Chicago headquarters of 3M National  Advertising. "In its present form, Mr. Sherman's artwork is just too  controversial."  </P> <P> In June, Sherman designed a 12-by-24-foot billboard that depicts a massive  American flag being ignited by a glowing cigarette. Initially, the singed flag  surrounded the inscription: "JESSE HELMS IS BURNING AMERICA." To the right of  the flag, Sherman printed the following text: "JUST SAY NO TO TAXPAYER  SUBSIDIES TO THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY."  </P> <P> Sherman said he created the piece because he believes American taxpayers are  being duped by Helms' anti-NEA obscenity stance.  </P> <P> "I wanted to get people thinking about who's really burning the nation,"  Sherman said. "Is it a few NEA-financed artists who create controversial  pictures judged obscene by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)? Or is it Helms himself,  the most visible congressional (supporter of) the tobacco industry, a business  whose products have been linked to the deaths of more than 390,000 Americans  per year?"  </P> <P> 3M National Advertising, which owns 300 billboards in Los Angeles and 2,700  more across the nation, is no stranger to the arts. Last year, the firm's  parent company contributed nearly $3 million to arts, media and cultural  groups. The 3M-affiliated McKnight Foundation -- named after former 3M chairman  William L. McKnight -- also recently announced plans to donate an additional  $28 million to arts-related organizations in the Minnesota area.  </P> <P> But three weeks ago, the billboard firm enraged local art activists when  executives in the Chicago headquarters declared guerrilla artist Robbie Conal's  West Hollywood anti-censorship billboard "too controversial" and ordered it to  be taken down.  </P> <P> Conal's billboard -- which depicted an acidic portrait of Helms with a caption  that read: "ARTIFICIAL ART OFFICIAL" -- was reinstalled the next day upon order  from the same officials who had demanded its removal.  </P> <P> Conal, who plans to put up a second art billboard after his current piece on  Santa Monica Boulevard comes down in November, said he supports Sherman in his  battle with 3M.  </P> <P> "Giant corporations are very touchy about their self-image," Conal said.  </P> <P> "One of the things I learned from my experience with 3M National is that you  really have to hone your angle of attack. It almost requires the delicate touch  of a Zen archer to get your concept past the corporate inspectors," he added.  </P> <P> Sherman first met with 3M National field sales representative Christine Edwards  on June 26, submitted a mock-up of his design and wrote the company a $1,705  check.  </P> <P> On July 19, 3M wrote Sherman a letter requesting alterations in his design. The  letter, accompanied by Sherman's uncashed check, explained that when Edwards  sought approval from 3M's legal counsel she was informed by "constituents at  the corporate office" that Sherman's text for the billboard was "too  controversial." Sherman was told if he eliminated the anti-Helms saying that 3M  National would be "more than glad" to display his message.  </P> <P> Sherman sent 3M a new mock-up, resubmitted his check and authorized 3M's final  fax proposal of his design Aug. 14. His check was cashed in Chicago on Aug. 17.  </P> <P> Two weeks later, Sherman said he received a call from Dennis LeBlanc, director  of advertising at 3M National's Woodland Hills office, demanding he remove the  burning American flag from his design because of the current Middle East  crisis.  </P> <P> "This has absolutely nothing to do with the trouble in Iraq," Sherman said.  "It's just a case of one big corporation being afraid to step on the toes of  another. The tobacco industry is one of their biggest clients."  </P> <P> Neither LeBlanc nor Edwards could be reached for comment, but Bear said that  rejection of Sherman's design had nothing to do with the Middle East.  </P> <P> "3M is not opposed to displaying messages that criticize the tobacco industry,"  Bear said. "We believe that the image of the burning flag is likely to be  highly offensive or distressful to viewers."  </P> <P> Bear said he has instructed the Woodland Hills office to reimburse Sherman for  his cashed check plus interest.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to censor the content of the man's message or pass judgment  on his art," Bear said. "There may be a universe of other possible ways for an  artist to get that particular political or social idea across. But in Mr.  Sherman's case, his design is clearly something that we are not going to  display."  </P></p>

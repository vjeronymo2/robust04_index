Mr  Kriel was speaking to National Party workers in East London at  the start of a three-day tour of the border. He said he  telephoned Gen Holomisa who is also an African National Congress  [ANC] candidate last week and said the NP wanted to open an  office in Transkei.    "He said I must put it in writing, which I did." In return  he received a message in which Gen Holomisa listed "all  thoughts" [as received] of preconditions. "He said we must give  more vehicles for their police force and sought out all thoughts  [as received] of other issues. That is not levelling the  playing fields. That is not democracy. That is pure blackmail."    Mr Kriel said he was still considering how to deal with the  situation. The most likely route would be through the  Independent Electoral Commission, but he would discuss this with  his National Party colleagues first. He said he had written to  Gen Holomisa in his capacity as vice-chairman of the National  Party in the Western Cape.    "When it suits (Gen) Holomisa he's an independent state and  he can do exactly what he wants. But as soon as he needs  something, then we are responsible." If Gen Holomisa had  organised his country better he could have bought the vehicles  he needed. Mr Kriel said negotiations with Transkei on a joint  investigation into the Heidelberg tavern killings were  continuing but "I don't think progress has been all that great".    He still believed Transkei was a haven for the Azanian  Peoples Liberation Army [APLA]. Even though the Pan-Africanist  Congress [PAC] had said it was suspending the armed struggle  there were still "loose cannons" running around over which the  PAC and APLA had very little control. "I believe they are still  using Transkei as a safe haven."    He rejected the Transkei demand that the territory's police  should be allowed to interview those responsible for the South  African Defence Force [SADF] raid on an alleged APLA base in  return for allowing South African Police into the territory to  investigate the Heidelberg killings. The Umtata raid was a  "legitimate military operation" to capture criminals and the two  could not be compared.    Referring to the people killed in the SADF raid, he said:  "It's also a debatable point as to whether they were so-called  children. I've seen children of 14 or 15 years running around  with AK-47s. So a child can be dangerous."    Mr Kriel had brief talks on Thursday morning with a  delegation from the Border Chamber of Business on security in  the region. He is to meet later on Thursday with the King  William's Town town council and Berlin farmers to discuss the  same issue. On Friday he travels to the North-East Cape.</p>

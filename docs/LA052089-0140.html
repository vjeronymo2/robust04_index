			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM CHANGES PLAN IN TIME FOR 3-1 VICTORY  </P> <P> Anaheim High School Coach Dave Torres' scouting report on Capistrano Valley was  that the Cougars were a good fastball-hitting team.  </P> <P> So Torres decided to start Robert Fernandez, a breaking-ball pitcher, in a  first-round Southern Section 4-A playoff game Friday at Anaheim.  </P> <P> Well, Fernandez threw a lot of breaking pitches, but very few were strikes in  the 1 1/3 innings he lasted.  </P> <P> Pete Gonzales, a junior who throws only fastballs, replaced Fernandez in the  second and allowed no runs and two hits in relief as Anaheim won, 3-1, in front  of about 400. So much for scouting reports.  </P> <P> The Orange League champions will play Cerritos Tuesday in the second round.  </P> <P> Fernandez allowed a walk and single in the first, but got a double-play  grounder to get out of a jam. In the second, Fernandez walked the first two  hitters, got a strikeout, but hit Chris Lugo to load the bases. He then walked  ninth-place hitter Chris Lyons to force in a run.  </P> <P> Gonzales was then called in and got Mike Lavin to hit into an inning-ending  double play.  </P> <P> "I was pumped when I was warming up," Gonzales said. "I was hoping for a double  play, but I just wanted to come in and throw strikes because we have a good  defense."  </P> <P> Gonzales (5-4) four strikeouts and walked three in the final 5 2/3 innings.  Anaheim had five hits but scored three unearned runs, thanks to three  Capistrano Valley errors.  </P> <P> "We played poorly today," Capistrano Valley Coach Bob Zamora said. "First we  slumped with the gloves, then the bats. I don't want to take anything away from  Anaheim but we handed them the game."  </P> <P> Anaheim scored two runs in the second. Capistrano Valley pitcher Mark Mosebrook  walked Ryan Jara to start the inning, then got Jose Gonzalez to hit into a  force play. Danny Castro then singled to left field and Cesar Rojo walked to  load the bases.  </P> <P> Mosebrook (9-4) struck out Fernando Castro for the second out and appeared out  of the inning when Sammy Serna hit a ground ball toward second baseman Lyons.  But Lyons bobbled the ball then threw high to first as Gonzales scored.  Mosebrook then walked Joe Perez to force home the second run.  </P> <P> Anaheim (18-9) scored its final run in the fourth.  </P> <P> Rojo reached second on a throwing error by shortstop John Mackay and scored on  a single by Fernando Castro. Capistrano Valley ends the season 16-10.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE HOSPITALS;  </P> <P> MEDICARE MORTALITY RATES: 72 FACILITIES TOP PREDICTIONS  </P> <P> More than 70 California hospitals had significantly higher than predicted death  rates for Medicare patients between 1986 and 1988, and 28 institutions in the  state had significantly lower than predicted death rates, according to an  analysis of the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration's third annual report  on Medicare mortality at the nation's hospitals.  </P> <P> Among the 72 California hospitals with higher than predicted rates were  California Medical Center and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Los  Angeles, Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys, Humana Hospital in  Westminster and two Kaiser Foundation hospitals.  </P> <P> Facilities with lower than predicted mortality rates included City of Hope  National Medical Center in Duarte, Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic in La  Jolla, seven Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA  Medical Center in Los Angeles and UC San Francisco.  </P> <P> HCFA's report was made public Wednesday. The analysis of the report was  prepared by Michael Pine &amp; Associates Inc., a Chicago health care  consulting firm that was a consultant to HCFA on the preparation of its report.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Pine, the president of the firm, made available to The Times a list  of the California hospitals with the highest and lowest overall mortality rates  for Medicare patients for the three-year period, as compared to their predicted  death rates.  </P> <P> The statistics reflect the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who  died within 30 days of being admitted to the hospital, whether as hospital  patients or after discharge, as compared to its predicted percentage.  </P> <P> A hospital's predicted mortality rate takes into account characteristics of its  patients that predict their relative risk of dying, such as age, sex, chronic  diseases and previous hospitalizations.  </P> <P> The mortality information "is not a direct measure of the quality of care, but  it is a valuable tool to identify potential problems for review and action by  hospital administrators and medical staff," said Louis B. Hays, HCFA's acting  administrator. Hays said consumers should "consult their physicians when  evaluating the report on a particular hospital."  </P> <P> Hospitals should "begin to incorporate not only this data but also statistical  techniques in day-to-day quality improvement activities," Pine said.  </P> <P> The statistics allow a hospital's actual performance to be compared with its  expected performance but they are not intended to be used to make comparisons  between institutions. In addition to overall death rates, the HCFA report  includes data on common causes of death in the elderly, such as heart disease  and strokes.  </P> <P> HCFA also released the results of studies which it said demonstrated the value  of the report as an indicator of the quality of medical care.  </P> <P> For example, HCFA said that hospitals with high mortality rates are more likely  to have quality problems identified after detailed case-by case reviews than  the average hospital.  </P> <P> On the other hand, hospitals with low mortality rates are more likely to have  favorable characteristics, according to a report by Medical College of  Wisconsin and HCFA researchers published in today's New England Journal of  Medicine.  </P> <P> Compared to the average hospital, these favorable characteristics include a  higher percentage of physicians who are board certified specialists, a higher  percentage of registered nurses, higher occupancy rates, and better  availability of high-technology equipment.  </P> <P> But the researchers cautioned that these findings, which are based on "patterns  of performance in a large number of hospitals," do not imply that a detailed  review of a specific hospital with a high mortality rate will find quality  problems.  </P> <P> As in previous years, hospital associations downplayed the significance of  HCFA's data, while consumer groups applauded its release.  </P> <P> "The mortality data only tells you a very little bit about the quality of care  that is delivered," said Carol McCarthy, president of the Chicago-based  American Hospital Assn.  </P> <P> Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Health Research Group in Washington,  said the federal government was "clearly moving in the right direction" but  should continue to improve the annual reports by including data on individual  surgeries and medical illnesses, as well as on individual physicians.  </P> <P> The 14-volume report is based on a computerized analysis of about 10.5 million  Medicare admissions at nearly 6,000 acute-care hospitals during 1988.  </P> <P> The 1988 report is similar to the two previous reports, although HCFA said the  statistical methods have been "refined and improved." For example, the  percentage of emergency cases and transfers from nursing homes are taken into  account. Such patients are at greater risk of dying than the average Medicare  patient.  </P> <P> Mortality data for 1986 and 1987 have been reanalyzed with the improved  techniques. These results are included in the new report, as well as summary  statistical information on each hospital's services and staffing. Mortality is  listed for "all causes" as well as for 16 individual "diagnostic categories."  </P> <P> Hospitals were given a chance to review their statistics in advance and provide  explanations, which were published as part of the report. About 1,360  hospitals, or 24% of the total, prepared such comments, compared to 51% of the  hospitals when the report was released in 1986.  </P> <P> In general, hospitals with higher than expected mortality rates defended the  quality of their care. The most common explanations included the high-risk  nature of their cases or discrepancies in their data.  </P> <P> "Hospitals initially felt threatened by the publication and commented in  response to that apprehension," HCFA officials said in a written statement made  available to reporters. "Hospitals now realize that the publication is perhaps  of greater use to them than they originally believed. Rather than taking the  time to object, hospitals have studied the results."  </P> <P> Thomas Morford, executive director of HCFA's Health Standards and Quality  Bureau, which prepared the report, said that hospitals with consistently high  Medicare mortality rates would be scrutinized by federal survey teams and  Medicare watchdog organizations such as California Medical Review.  </P> <P> "We don't take punitive action because (a hospital has a high mortality rate,)"  Morford said. "When presented with this information, I say let's look further."  </P> <P> Such a survey of King Hospital in Los Angeles, based on its high 1987 mortality  rates, discovered scores of patient care deficiencies and led to a threatened  cut-off of federal funds. On Monday, the federal government, citing a "dramatic  turnaround" at King, said Medicare and Medi-Cal funds would be continued.  </P> <P> The report, "Medicare Hospital Mortality Information, 1986-1988" can be ordered  from the Health Care Financing Administration, Health Standards and Quality  Bureau, 2-D-2 Meadows East Building, 6325 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21207,  or by calling (301) 966-1133.  </P> <P> Steinbrook reported from Los Angeles and Vickers from Washington. Times  researcher Tracy Thomas in Los Angeles assisted in preparing this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MEDICARE DEATH RATES  </P> <P> These California hospitals had the highest and lowest mortality rates for  Medicare patients as compared to their predicted death rates between 1986 and  1988, according to an analysis of U.S. Health Care Financing Administration  data by Michael Pine &amp; Associates Inc., a Chicago health care consulting  firm. The HCFA data was compiled earlier this year and made public Wednesday.  Pine &amp; Associates was a consultant to HCFA on the preparation of the  report.  </P> <P> The data reflects the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who died  within 30 days of being admitted, whether as patients or after discharge. The  national average 30-day mortality rate is about 12%.  </P> <P> This list of high and low mortality rate hospitals, which was prepared by Pine  &amp; Associates, differs in some instances from the report released by HCFA,  although it is based on the same data. This is because different statistical  techniques were used and data for the three years was combined.  </P> <P> Hospitals listed in boldface type had statistically significant high or low  mortality rates for 1988, as well as for the entire three-year period.  </P> <P> An asterisk indicates hospitals that sent explanatory comments about their data  to HCFA.  </P> <P> HIGHER THAN EXPECTED MORTALITY RATES  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.63IN:2.00IN:1.89IN:1.67IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>

A value of "1" is  average. A value over "1" is above average. A value under "1" is below average.  </P> <P> The "% Higher" or "% Lower" than expected statistic is a comparison of the  hospital's actual and predicted mortality rates. The predicted mortality rate  takes into account characteristics of individual patients. These include age,  sex, principal diagnosis, other chronic illnesses, previous hospitalizations,  emergency or non-emergency admission status, admission source, such as a  nursing home or hospital transfer, as well as the number of patients treated at  each hospital. If a patient was hospitalized multiple times, only the last  admission for each year was included.  </P> <P> Southern California hospitals with more than 1,000 cases over the three-year  period are listed, as well as hospitals from other parts of the state with more  than 3,000 cases. There is a less than a one-in-1,000 probability that a  hospital would be listed as having a high or low mortality rate because of  chance alone, according to the study's authors.  </P></p>

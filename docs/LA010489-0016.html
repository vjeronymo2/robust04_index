			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAFAT REMAINS A TERRORIST, ISRAELI OFFICIAL SAYS;  </P> <P> AS PROOF, NEW FOREIGN MINISTER ARENS CITES THREAT AGAINST MODERATE ARABS  </P> <P> A threat by Yasser Arafat against Palestinians who propose a lull in the Arab  uprising is proof that Arafat still clings to terrorism, Israel's new foreign  minister, Moshe Arens, said Tuesday as he once again rejected calls for talks  with the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> Arens, who spoke at his first press conference since taking office two weeks  ago, criticized both the United States and European countries for entering into  talks with the PLO and said Israel would prefer isolation to changing its mind  on the issue. The former Israeli ambassador to Washington promised that new  peace proposals are on the way from Israel but have not yet been finalized.  </P> <P> Arens' comments came in response to a Kuwait News Agency report from Saudi  Arabia on Arafat's position on the intifada, as the revolt is known in Arabic.  According to the report, Arafat warned that "any Palestinian leader who  proposes an end to the intifada exposes himself to the bullets of his own  people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor of Bethlehem  </P> <P> Arafat, the PLO's chairman, mentioned no names, but the comment seemed to refer  to Elias Freij, the longtime mayor of Bethlehem. On Christmas Day, Freij  proposed a truce between Israel and the Palestinians who for more than a year  have been fighting Israeli rule on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Upon being informed of Arafat's warning, Freij, who is considered a leading  moderate on the West Bank, withdrew his suggestion.  </P> <P> "The decision of the PLO does not support my proposal," he told the Jerusalem  Post. "I fully respect the decision of the PLO that the time is not right to  make such a suggestion."  </P> <P> Freij, an Arab Christian, insisted that his life is not in danger. "It's not a  threat. I didn't do anything wrong. I made a suggestion in good faith."  </P> <P> Arens, speaking in heavily American-accented English, took a harsher view. He  accused Arafat of "threatening with extinction any Palestinian who talks about  the possibility of a cessation of acts of violence."  </P> <P> Pressed on whether Israel itself would make some positive gesture should  leaders in the occupied land offer a truce, he replied: "I prefer not to  address this specific question.  </P> <P> "We have already seen that anybody who voices opinions of this sort puts his  life in danger because of the threat of terrorist action against them. I think  at this point we better leave it as it is."  </P> <P> Israel is not tempted to call a truce on its own, Arens added.  </P> <P> "The government of Israel doesn't have to propose any truce because the  government of Israel is not initiating any violence in Judea, Samaria and  Gaza," he said. Judea and Samaria are the biblical names for the West Bank  region.  </P> <P> Arens is scheduled to travel to Paris this week to attend an international  conference on chemical weapons. He is expected to meet with several European  foreign ministers, a circumstance that will give him the chance to voice  displeasure at their contacts with the PLO.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 13-Year Ban Ended  </P> <P> Arafat has gained the ear of Western governments through his avowed  renunciation of terrorism and his explicit recognition of Israel's right to  exist. Last month, the United States ended a 13-year ban on public contact with  the PLO, based in part on Arafat's renunciation of terror.  </P> <P> "We are convinced that establishing contact or, worse yet, extending  recognition to the PLO cannot possibly promote peace in the Middle East," Arens  declared. "It is bound to encourage extremism and further acts of violence."  </P> <P> The owlish former aeronautical engineer made it clear that Israel will not  follow the diplomatic trend.  </P> <P> "We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease the sense of  isolation . . . if they are steps that would endanger the state of Israel," he  said.  </P> <P> Arens commented ironically on reports that Washington turned to the PLO for  help in locating saboteurs who blew up a Pan American jet in the air over  Scotland last month. "If we search the world for an organization that had  experience and competence in terrorist acts, and especially in blowing up  airplanes, you could probably not find a better address than the PLO and Mr.  Arafat," Arens remarked.  </P> <P> While on the subject of terrorism, Arens evaded a question about whether  attacks on soldiers by rebellious Arabs fit Israel's definition of terrorism.  </P> <P> "I think that when there is a deliberate attempt to kill civilians we are  dealing with terrorism, regardless of where it takes place and regardless of  under what circumstances it takes place," he said, leaving aside the issue of  clashes with the military.  </P> <P> The Israeli government has been promising to unveil a new peace formula since  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir took office for a new four-year term last month.  On Tuesday, however, Arens spoke only of "interim arrangements" that might lead  to resolution of the conflict. In Israeli political language, "interim  arrangements" mean limited political and social autonomy for Arabs on the  occupied land.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Will Take Some Time'  </P> <P> In any case, Arens said that new Israeli ideas will come slowly. "This is a  process that will take some time," he advised.  </P> <P> Arens took time out to reject proposals that would push Israel back to its  borders that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel routed invading  Arab armies and occupied both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The postwar  frontiers gave Israel needed space for defense, Arens contended. "It is  impossible to envisage the security of Israel without defensible borders," he  said.  </P> <P> Arens' opening remarks to reporters took the form of a state-of-diplomacy  message. While commenting adversely on foreign contacts with the PLO, he  pointed to several bright spots in Israel's relations abroad.  </P> <P> Despite Washington's PLO contacts, he described relations with the United  States as outstanding. He also said that Israel virtually considered itself a  member of the European Community.  </P> <P> He said that Israel "appreciated" the permission to emigrate granted to Jews by  the Soviet Union and hoped that it presaged renewed diplomatic ties between the  two countries. "There seems good reason to expect significant improvements in  the relationship between the two countries," he said.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel after the Six-Day War.  </P> <P> Arens also expects to meet with China's foreign minister in Paris. The Chinese  also have no diplomatic links with Israel.  </P> <P> Arens will not be the only Israeli carrying on some form of diplomacy in the  coming weeks. Four members of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, intend to  travel to Europe soon to meet with officials of the PLO. The four Israelis are  all considered left-wing doves.  </P> <P> "We have to speak to the Palestinians directly and reach peace with them  through compromise," said Knesset member Lova Eliav, a member of the  center-left Labor Party. Labor is a junior partner in the Israeli ruling  coalition led by Shamir's rightist Likud Party.  </P></p>

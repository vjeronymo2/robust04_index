			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Britain's zinc production industry put up for sale THE UK'S zinc production industry, which has a turnover of Pounds 150m and employs about 850 people, was put up for sale yesterday when Pasminco of Australia announced it hoped to dispose of its European assets. These include the Avonmouth smelter in the west of the UK, the only domestic source and main supplier of refined zinc in Britain. Pasminco recently completed a Pounds 10m expansion at the smelter, taking its annual capacity to 105,000 tonnes of zinc and 50,000 tonnes of lead bullion. Pasminco also owns three companies at Bloxwich in the West Midlands that make a number of zinc alloy products and take in the Impalloy division, Europe's leading supplier of zinc protectors for cathodes. Analysts suggested that Pasminco should have no difficulty selling the UK assets, which have improved significantly in the past few years, but said there were substantial question marks over its other European asset - a 50 per cent shareholding in a 200,000-tonnes-a-year zinc refinery at Budel in the Netherlands. Budelco, which is jointly owned with Billiton, the mining and metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, is one of the world's biggest and most cost-competitive electrolytic zinc smelters. However, the management has given itself until the middle of this year to decide whether to invest about Fl 300m (Pounds 90) on plant to reprocess waste material or to close down. The smelter will no longer be able to store jarosite, an iron-bearing waste product from electrolytic smelting, from 1995. More than 600 are employed at the smelter, on the Belgian-Dutch border, and discussions have been going on with the Dutch authorities about its future. Budelco identified a technology for processing the jarosite into an inert slag suitable for use in the construction industry but said the tight environmental conditions required by the Dutch authorities would make it 'financially unattractive'. Pasminco, which was formed in 1988 when North Broken Hill Peko and CRA pooled their zinc and lead interests, announced it intended to sell its European assets to reduce debt and to concentrate on its Australian interests after revealing a net loss of ADollars 118m, including abnormal and extraordinary losses. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, is advising on the divestment programme. Analysts said there were no obvious buyers for the European assets although the Marc Rich international commodity trading organisation based in Zug, Switzerland, might be interested, as well as Japanese groups such as Mitsui, which already has zinc smelting expertise, and Sumitomo. Germany's Metallgesellschaft, which seems likely to close its Meggen zinc smelter soon, was another company mentioned as a possible buyer.</p>

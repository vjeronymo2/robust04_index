			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Portillo blunts PM's drive for unity on 'back to basics' The government's attempts to end the controversy over Mr John Major's 'back to basics' programme ran into fresh difficulties last night. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, led a concerted cabinet campaign to restore intellectual coherence to the call for a return to traditional values. But his emphasis on a common sense approach across the range of government policies was followed by a sharp attack from Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, on critics of Britain's national traditions and institutions. Despite clearance for his speech from Downing Street, Mr Portillo, a leading cabinet right winger, faced charges from some on the Tory left that he was flouting Mr Major's authority. But the prime minister's office rejected as 'malicious fiction' reports last night that Mr Major had launched an outspoken attack on right-wing members of the cabinet during private conversations which took place earlier this week. Referring to a 'new British disease', Mr Portillo castigated critics of the monarchy, parliament and the established church. He blamed what he called the anti-establishment chattering classes for spreading the 'poison of pessimism' which undermined national self-confidence and respect for British institutions. Mr Portillo told an audience of the rightwing Conservative Way Forward Group that our 'our mission must be to rebuild national self-confidence and self-belief'. He said: 'We need to assert the value and the quality of the British way of life and of British institutions.' Mr Hurd sought to disentangle the central message of 'back to basics' from the private lives of ministers and Conservative MPs, by insisting that it represented a 'commonsense' approach to the much wider concerns of the electorate. His emphasis on the government's drive to improve standards in schools, to nurture the economic recovery and to redouble the fight against crime was echoed in speeches and interviews by several other cabinet ministers. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, also joined Mr Hurd in urging the government's supporters to 'keep their nerve' during the present storm. Setting out the line agreed by the cabinet in an effort to rescue the 'back to basics' programme, the foreign secretary said politicians should not set themselves up as the arbiters of personal morality. Nor should the personal failings of some politicians be mistaken for the fortunes of the government, said Mr Hurd. Mr Hurd's confident exposition, however, did little to disguise the debate still raging in the cabinet and in the Conservative party concerning the extent to which the government should set a moral tone for the nation. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, and Mr John Patten, the education secretary, are among those in the cabinet who believe a programme promoting the difference between right and wrong cannot avoid touching on individual morality.

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Bentsen aims to revive G7 policy forum THE US will try to revive policy co-ordination between the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, President-elect Bill Clinton's choice for Treasury secretary, indicated in a Senate confirmation hearing yesterday. The G7 had 'fallen into disrepair,' he said. Members needed to hold more frequent, informal meetings and put together 'a growth policy that would expand the economies of all seven countries'. He said he favoured private negotiation rather than public bullying. He would like to see G7 summits get back to their original economic purpose rather than serve as public relations exercises for world leaders. Mr Bentsen received fulsome tributes from Democratic and Republican members of the Senate finance committee, which he has chaired for the past six years. In a sign of respect the committee voted unanimously to recommend his nomination before asking any questions. Mr Bentsen, 71, said the overriding goal was 'to put our economy on course so every American has the prospect of a life-enriching job and a personal chance at the American dream'. He would strive for 3 per cent, or better, growth of gross domestic product. He signalled that a balance would be struck between new investment and fiscal restraint. There had to be a 'very major emphasis on deficit reduction' but it was also vital to spur more long-term investment, mainly in the private sector. An investment tax credit was being seriously considered. However, he favoured an incremental credit that would provide relief only for investment above a certain level. This would be difficult to design but offered 'more bang for the buck'. Mr Bentsen parried all specific questions on taxes, spending and economic policy with the stock response that Mr Clinton had not yet made final policy decisions. In an interview with public television broadcast on Monday evening, Mr Clinton said his campaign pledge of halving the budget deficit over four years could be met only by making deeper cuts in public spending than planned last summer. 'We're going to have to cut more in other places. . . than we would have thought. . . because the deficit's gotten bigger.' He stopped short, however, of reaffirming the commitment to halve the deficit. AP adds: The Democratic-controlled Senate is aiming to complete hearings on all of Mr Clinton's cabinet nominations in time for them to be voted on by the Senate shortly after he is inaugurated next Wednesday.</p>

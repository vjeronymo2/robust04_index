			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, June 15 (AFP) -- A new round of peace  talks between the Cambodian government and the radical Khmer  Rouge guerrillas adjourned here Wednesday, and government  officials were almost unanimously pessimistic about the outcome.    In his opening address, King Norodom Sihanouk's  representative, Nhoek Chulong, who is hosting the talks at the  city's Royal Palace, warned that if the two sides failed to  reach a positive result the king would refuse to call for any  further sessions.    But despite this, the morning meeting broke up with the two  sides failing to reach an agreement on a proposed ceasefire.    "We will continue tomorrow," Mak Ben, who often serves as  the  Khmer Rouge's spokesman, said as he left the palace.    Nhoek Chulong stressed the king's request for a simple "yes  or no" answer to the ceasefire proposal.    The government side, which also consisted of Cabinet  Minister  Sok An and parliament representative Toh Loah, agreed to the  ceasefire and suggested a starting date of June 30.    In a statement released to the press, senior Khmer Rouge  delegate and former ambassador to China Chan Youran said the  Khmer Rouge "were most delighted to have a ceasefire" and that  it should be strictly controlled by a "committee or technical  group."    But he refused to give a simple "yes or no" answer.    "I think the Khmer Rouge still do not agree to the ceasefire  schedule proposal," Sok An said.    Senior government representative and Interior Minister Yu  Hokkri echoed the sentiments of most of his colleagues when he  said he was "not at all optimistic" about the eventual outcome  but was going along with the talks in accordance with the king's  wishes.    The Khmer Rouge, who control some 10 to 15 per cent of the  country, boycotted last year's UN-supervised polls and have  since continued a guerrilla struggle against the government  installed by the polls.    The talks follow a previous unsuccessful round hosted by the  king at his residence in North Korea last month.    On the agenda for Thursday's session is the even more  problematic issue of the king's proposal for political  concessions.    Under this, government posts would be given to "acceptable"  members of the Khmer Rouge, provided the guerrillas open up  their zones and merge their fighters with the national army.    Government officials said a major stumbling block was the  Khmer Rouge's conditions for going along with the king's plan.    Chan Youran said the Khmer Rouge would comply with the  king's  proposal if the government agreed to what the guerrillas called  their "minimum political platform."    A senior government official said this entailed scrapping  the  existing government and parliament and introducing a new power-  sharing arrangement with the radicals.    That is considered quite out of the question by Phnom Penh,  as it would mean the two-billion-dollar UN mission which laid  the foundations for a democratically-elected government would  have been in vain, he said.    "There is no way we can accept this," he declared.    Other government members accused the Khmer Rouge of  deliberate obfuscation and suspected the guerrillas were only  presenting a facade of interest in the peace talks in order to  buy time.    "I don't believe there will be a positive result but let us  wait and see what happens tomorrow," Yu Hokkri said.    Co-premier Hun Sen recently said that the only way the Khmer  Rouge problem could be solved was through a combination of  social development to improve the lives of the country's  impoverished rural majority and also though military pressure.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg SG Warburg faced two problems in the half-year to end-September: falling revenues and rising costs. Shareholders will be encouraged by yesterday's promise to remedy both. But they may be mystified about exactly how the investment bank plans to deliver. On the cost side, Warburg is not planning to reduce staff. And though bonuses will be lower this year than the bumper payments made last year, there is no indication that the remuneration system will change. Warburg continues to pay its staff more than rival British merchant banks. But given its global ambitions, it will be hard pushed to cut remuneration much below the levels of its big US competitors. The only concrete cost-cutting measure Warburg would point to yesterday was its intention to curb investment in information technology. On the revenue side, the bank's main hope is that dealing profits - the half year's black spot - will rebound. Certainly, bear markets cannot last forever. But Warburg's poor performance continued long after bond markets collapsed in February. It takes a leap of faith to believe that the group's return on equity over the medium term will average the 15-20 per cent it thinks reasonable. But the vagueness of Warburg's plans for improving its performance does not mean the shares are overvalued. When the group's 75 per cent stake in fund management group MAM is stripped out, the banking business is being valued by the market at only Pounds 535m. One would have to take an extremely gloomy view of its prospects to argue that it is worth less.</p>

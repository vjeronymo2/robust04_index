			<p>CSO     [Text] Larnaca, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] IRNA -- Last  Wednesday the Cyprus Government expelled 30 Iranians, several of  whom had just arrived at Larnaca Airport the same day.    One of the expelled Iranians, Reza Payami, said: The reason  for expelling this group still has not been announced by the  Cyprus police.    He said their expulsion was likely related to a theft that  took place two weeks ago at a household appliances store.    Another of the individuals expelled said without giving his  name: I was arrested by the Larnaca police as soon as I reached  the airport.    He also claimed that the airport police tried in various  ways  to take the $1,800 he had away from him.    He said that he was forced to sell some of his household  furnishings to make his trip to Cyprus possible.    A number of these expelled Iranians, citing deception or  extortion of Iranians seeking work in Cyprus, asked Iran's  embassies to cooperate with Iranians seeking work in various  countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In various meetings with officials of the Greek  Cypriot side, Western diplomats are issuing indirect but clear  threats for measures that could be taken against our side if we  reject or obstruct the implementation of the confidence-building  measures. These threats relate mainly to the financial situation  of the country, which they warn will be hurt by certain moves  that their countries will make.    According to our information, beyond the threat for gradual  recognition of the pseudostate in the occupied areas which--as  they say--will not be prevented, they also talk about the  withdrawal of UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]. They stress that  such a development would cause a climate of insecurity in  Cyprus, which could easily hurt the country's main financial  source, tourism!    Let us recall that clear reference to UNFICYP's withdrawal  was repeatedly made by the UN secretary general in his reports.    Officials from our side who talked with foreign diplomats  confirm that especially the United States and Britain indicate  everytime their determination to impose the confidence-building  measures. And this is the meaning of their indirect but clear  threats.</p>

The officials said the drug had been concealed in tins of  milk powder, coffee, mashed potato, and orange juice in the  luggage of Victoria Muthen Katnu. The names of her companions  were given as Hadija Ndope Saidai and Naima Nyakinywa. All three  were scheduled to fly to Nairobi by an early morning Kenyan  Airways flight yesterday.    Subsequently, the customs officers searched the Bandra  residence of Dr Kalu Ojiewu, the alleged supplier of the heroin.  Dr Ojiewu reportedly attempted to escape by leaping off the  balcony of his first floor flat at plot number 51 on 29th road,  but was overpowered and held.

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / That's no way to treat a Lady - or is it?: Alerted by the rattle of teacups in the home counties, Rachel Johnson hears about changes to a very English institution It is a story to which only Barbara Pym, or perhaps Joanna Trollope, could do full justice. No Aga saga, it concerns The Lady, that gentlewoman of the racy world of female magazines, and the fluster that is attending her belated arrival into the 20th century. While other women's magazines compete ever more vigorously to reveal the secrets of sexual attractiveness or style and acoutrements of the modern woman, The Lady's imagined reader sits, needlepoint forgotten on her lap, dog at her feet, curtains drawn tightly against the mild home counties night. Gripped by the latest instalment of The Rector's Wife, she barely feels tired after a hectic day. Church flower rota, Help the Aged lunch and the health club have all lent a glow to cheeks already weatherbeaten by daily gardening. At first glance, The Lady has barely changed direction since the 19th century. 'The Lady will be essentially English, and the subjects will be treated from an English point of view,' the first issue declared in 1885. Its aim, 'to provide information without dulness (sic), and entertainment without vulgarity; and to be at once useful and necessary without ceasing to be bright and lively.' But appearances can be deceptive. Although the magazine is English and genteel as ever - its mix of household tips, recipes, fashion, gardening and acres of classified nanny-to-cottage advertisements remain intact - changes are afoot. The first edition of The Lady was launched in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, the proprietor and editor of Vanity Fair. His elder daughter, Sydney, became Lady Redesdale and mother of the Mitford sisters, and her governess became editor for 30 years. The magazine remains in the hands of the Bowles family, and there have been only eight editors in its history. Since 1891, when Bowles sold its unlikely stablemate Vanity Fair, The Lady has occupied the same corner offices at 39 and 40 Bedford Street, London. Decked out in a livery of mahogany panelling and eau-de-nil paint trim, the building sticks out like a Merchant Ivory film set among the diners and hamburger joints of Covent Garden. But when the wind is blowing a certain way, the 20th century intrudes and The Lady's fragrant flower-filled offices reek of fat from the kitchens of neighbouring FatBoy's Diner. The wind is blowing that way today. Three years ago a new editor arrived, Arline Usden, from the racy world of Woman magazine, where she was beauty editor, and Successful Slimming, where she was editor. Joan Grahame, the seventh editor, was due for retirement after being in the job since 1971 but died during the crossover fortnight that followed Usden's appointment. 'It didn't have a layout. It didn't have an art department. It didn't have an editorial structure. It had girls, not necessarily trained, throwing things on pages,' said Usden, throwing a nervous glance towards her open office door. Her bosses are Ron Bulloch, the white-haired general manager of 20 years - an average stint on The Lady, where the head of the classified ads has been in the same job for 30 years - and his assistant, David Richards. In a cautious interview, at which a secretary takes notes, Bulloch makes one thing clear: the changes Usden has introduced will be quite sufficient for the time being. She appointed an arts editor, staff writers, a home economist, introduced spots of colour in food and fashion spreads, and changed the covers. Although The Lady is still the only magazine on the rack to feature a vase of daffodils on its front, the covers are brighter and better photographed than they used to be. She made the pagination more suitable for a weekly than an annual. The magazine used to start in Roman numerals, for the classified ads, until the contents page, when it would lurch to page 353 (if it was August). Current editions start at page one and proceed from there until the inside cover at around page 80: always the reader special offer - from Wellington boots to a three-tier steamer. Her innovations include more features and a 'Favourite Things' column at the back, for celebrities with granny-appeal, such as Nigel Havers, to reveal their fondness for roast chicken and gardening. All very innocuous, one might think. But Usden wants to go further. The magazine opens, and always has, with more than 20 pages of small advertisements. Usden wants to banish the classified adverts to the back, institute a proper contents on page 3, and introduce full colour. But the old guard wants the advertisements to remain to the fore and wants to keep The Lady's editorial content as traditional as possible, and ensure that Polson's cornflour, Sunlight Soap and Cash's nametapes advertise in 1995 as they did in 1885. 'We are very schizophrenic. Our readers divide into those who buy it for the ads and who don't read the magazine and those who buy it for the magazine but don't read the ads,' says Usden For it is undoubtedly to The Lady that those seeking nannies, housekeepers, companions - and even housemen and butlers - turn. According to a Reading University survey, more than a third of high-earning families in some areas employed either a cleaner or a nanny. Usden does not undervalue the advertisements; but she wants to make The Lady competitive with other magazines in appearance and content. 'We are the only magazine without full colour,' she sighs. So it will be The Lady readers who decide. The doughty gentlewomen of the home counties, who subscribe and write Letters, the magazine's most famous feature. Amanda Dukes has been editing these gems - around 100 of them a week - for several years. A typical spread will kick off with a letter asking for a recipe for lamb stew (to which a Meat Marketing Board recipe will be offered); and continue with household tips (how to remove candlewax from velvet curtains) and 'where can I gets'. 'Where can I get directoire knickers - an item of long acetate underwear - is reasonably common,' says Amanda Dukes. Every letter is answered, the gardening ones by Classic FM's Clay Jones. And these readers, one darkly suspects, are the type that value continuity, however dull, above stylishness. As one wrote to Arline Usden in February, 'your magazine is clean and wholesome . . . an oasis of good taste in an ocean of tat. Thank you.' Jan Waddell, the special offers editor, thinks The Lady's old-fashioned formula serves its readership exactly what they want. 'We don't have a female bias like most other magazines. We have gardening, travel, wine, finance. We don't do things on sex and women's insides. Our readers aren't interested in how many orgasms you've had this week.' For readers who prefer Middlemarch to the Camomile Lawn, the genteely impoverished do-gooders, there can be no contest. The Lady has changed enough, and even Arline Usden knows it. She will move gently, if at all, from here, so that The Lady will give its readers no cause to tut-tut fiercely over their Rich Tea and morning coffee.</p>

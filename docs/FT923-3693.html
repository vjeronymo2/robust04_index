			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Earnings rise 73% at Burns Philp BURNS Philp &amp; Company, the diversified Australian food technology group, is holding its annual dividend at 15.5 cents a share after a 73 per cent rise in net profits to ADollars 92.1m (USDollars 65.76m) in the year to June, from ADollars 53.3m 12 months earlier, writes Bruce Jacques. The result, achieved on a rise in sales to ADollars 2.43bn from ADollars 2.35bn, was helped by im-proved earnings from its Australian hardware operations and higher interest income on proceeds of the sale of its interest in QBE Insurance Group, its former associate. Profits from the company's core food and fermentation division fell 4 per cent to ADollars 62.4m, but hardware earnings rose 8 per cent to ADollars 22.8m. Investment division earnings were up 47 per cent at ADollars 6m. Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, expects the company's main food businesses to make steady progress this year. He also indicated the company was 'fairly advanced' in discussions to buy into the eastern European yeast market and into a privatised business in Russia.</p>

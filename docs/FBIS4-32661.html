			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "Ever Narrower Circles"] </F>   [Text] [Italian Foreign Minister] Antonio Martino and  [Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi could in principle be  satisfied with what they managed to get in Corfu. At this  meeting of the heads of the European Union, on which occasion a  new European flag bearing 16 stars was first raised (Norway,  Finland, Sweden, and Austria have signed admission agreements),  Rome has after all made a few steps that will make Italy, at  least in the foreseeable future, more important in this newly  enlarged society than it was during its relentless "political  purgatory" within the circle of the former Twelve. The meeting  of "the Magnificent Seven" (the most developed industrial  countries in the world) will soon be held in Naples, at which  Russia will be completely swamped by the economic and political  embrace of the West, and Italy at the moment also chairs the  CSCE. Berlusconi will thus not find only his own television  stations crucial this time, as he will be all over the  television screens as a leading global diplomat. In Corfu he  even managed unexpectedly to tip the scales of the diplomatic  trade over the election of the new president of the European  Commission, in which even the Germans -- who only recently took  it rather coldly -- had to give in to the European parliamentary  games over Berlusconi's neofascist allies. Now PANORAMA claims  that the Twelve have agreed to support Italy with its constant  designs on Slovenia, and Italy has again been discovering what  already seemed irretrievably lost: the mentality of the winner,  though the most important players are being kicked out of  diplomacy (Fini) and the soccer field (Pagliuca).    In this political and media atmosphere Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino is visiting Sarajevo, Zagreb, and Belgrade this  Monday and Tuesday [27-28 June]. Rome has suffered quite a lot,  being pushed out of the global remodeling of Bosnia-Herzegovina  with contemptuous dismissal, with even Turkish soldiers accepted  as part of the blue helmets, while Clinton expressly forbade the  Italians to do the same. In the Balkans the Italians have  suffered an unexpectedly large number of victims (European  observers and journalists), but have received hardly any profit  through sales; they are now among the loudest in the  preparations for the reconstruction of Sarajevo, and some claim  that the final plan for the division and rearrangement of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be sealed at the Naples meeting of the  wealthiest nations. Martino arrives in Belgrade as the number  one CSCE man, who might persuade Milosevic to let European  observers go to Kosovo after all, while he comes to Zagreb as a  neighbor, who will continue to drive Croatia crazy with the  "hot-cold" policy whenever he deems it necessary. In parliament  he thus rejected any stories about Italian territorial  aspirations toward Slovenia and Croatia, promising -- as Granic  described to a half-empty parliament -- "to abide by the  European norms and agreements," but it is precisely those  "European norms" that could bring more long-term headaches to  Zagreb than the frivolous flirting of certain Italian circles  with [Krajina's] Borislav Mikelic, the expert on all sorts of  salami. Within a strictly diplomatic framework, Rome cannot  harm Croatia, which only aspires to the Council of Europe, as  much as Slovenia, which already hopes that it has squeezed its  foot in the door of the European Union, but Rome can keep lead  both countries by their noses to the applause of the European  lobbies with constant references to the protection of minorities  and free movement of capital, people, and ideas.    Those who support a similar observance of European standards  in Istria constantly challenge Zagreb, while Zagreb can not  silence Istria without alienating Europe, so Croatian diplomacy  in that respect keeps chasing its own tail in ever narrower  circles. Among other things, the Statute of the County of  Istria has just been officially rejected because of some  unwelcome multicultural and multilingual ideas, and at this  moment only political dreamers could visualize that in the  foreseeable future they could muster a majority in the Croatian  parliament to agree to a new natural return of Italian property,  and even vote for a law that would enable Italians -- or any  foreigners -- to buy Croatian real estate. Croatian politics  still adores Europe in principle, but only in the way that it  does not become pregnant [as published], and to what extent this  titillation from the other side of the Adriatic can be  unpleasant was best shown by two heated speeches by Tudjman, in  Podgora and Pazin, which, in some Italian circles, have caused  surprise, shock, mockery, and rejection with barely concealed  abhorrence. Anger and bitterness about "Cypriotization" and  UNPROFOR are growing in Croatia, while Italy is enjoying a  summer renaissance, so Mate Granic will, in his talks with  Antonio Martino, have to invest a lot of good will, patience,  and generosity to persuade his guest that it does not always pay  to be pig-headed about everything because of a little political  noise on either side of the Adriatic.</p>

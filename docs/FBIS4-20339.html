			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Zhao Zhiyuan (6392 1807 6678) </F> and Cui Tiemin (1508 6993 3046): "Underground Great Walls and  Buttresses -- Liaoning Province's Civil Air Defense Works Become  `Gold-Producing Precious Lands'"]    [Text] The underground civil air defense works, which up to  now had been mysterious and silent, are, under the impetus of  the market economy, slowly opening wide their thick and heavy  gates. According to what was revealed by a relevant quarter,  52.3 percent of the underground civil air defense works in  cities throughout Liaoning have played a role in economic  construction, in 1193 posting an output value of 750 million  yuan and a profits tax of 110 million yuan.    After liberation, particularly since the beginning of the  sixties, because of the necessity for making preparations  against war, Liaoning in succession invested huge sums of money  in the construction under cities of an enormous concealed system  for air defense, forming a huge underground space complete with  water, electricity, and air conditioning facilities. However,  because of the complex international situation over the past  several years and other reasons, for these underground works it  was a case of building at one place, closing at one place, and  letting one place remain vacant. After reform and opening up to  the outside world began, particularly against the background of  the trend toward relaxation in the international situation and  the putting into practice domestically of the market economy,  civil air defense departments at all levels throughout the  province, in line with the principle of "integrating peace and  war, and serving the economy," gave full play to the  superiorities of underground works in being warm in winter and  cool in summer, in having wide spaces, and in being near cities;  they opened up, one after another, to society the greater part  of the civil air defense works, thereby making the fast-asleep  underground treasure caves battlefields of economic  construction. Now, the civil air defense works throughout the  province have already become more than 20 sites of commodity  production and business activity. The underground business  conducted by Shenyang and Fushun cities, the underground  processing and cold storage of marine products done by Dalian  and Dandong cities, and the facilities of some other cities for  underground aquatic breeding, planting, stockpiling, and  recreation are gradually developing into a special industry. The  underground market located in front of Shenyang's North Railroad  Station has a business area of 23,000 square meters and an  annual customer flow rate of more than 7 million persons; last  year its volume of business was more than 70 million yuan,  becoming a big part of Shenyang's business landscape.    In the process of turning civil air defense works toward the  market and service economies, civil air defense departments at  all levels insist on making the requirements for preparation  against war number one. They strictly manage and safeguard the  works for society's by letting them out and other forms, in  order to ensure that the works can at any time be put to use for  air defense; thus they have achieved a benign cycle in lwhich  the "caves" are used both to create wealth and to support  themselves.</p>

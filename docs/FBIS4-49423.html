			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- China regards serious  copyright infringement as a felony subject to criminal  punishment. The National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee Legislative Affairs Committee today submitted its  draft decision on punishing copyright infringements to the  Seventh Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee for  examination.    At the request of the meeting of the NPC Standing Committee  chairman and vice chairmen, Gu Angran, chairman of the NPC  Standing Committee Legislative Affairs Committee, explained the  draft decision at the session today.    Gu Angran said: Ever since the Copyright Law was drawn up in  1990, it has played an important role in protecting authors'  copyrights and their copyright-related interests, in promoting  the development of socialist culture and science, and in  promoting socialist ethics and material progress. However,  certain lawless elements, in order to reap huge profits, have  acted rampantly in pirating books, audio and videocassette  tapes, and computer software. Their piracy not only has  seriously infringed on the rights and interests of the authors  and copyright holders but also has upset the normal order of the  market of socialist culture and economic activities and has  disturbed the development of the nation's economic relations and  trade, as well as cultural and scientific exchange and  cooperation with other countries. Such serious copyright  infringements must be punished as a crime. GATT also demands  that domestic laws must have provisions for punishing  infringements of intellectual property rights.    Gu Angran said: Under this draft law, the following serious  copyright infringements are considered as crimes: First, they  fall under any one of the following copyright infringements for  purposes of making profits, and the amounts of unlawful income  are quite substantial, or the case is serious in some other  respects: 1) reproducing the copyright holders' works without  their permission; 2) publishing others' copyrighted books; and  3) reproducing audio and video products without their producers'  permission. Second, marketing apparently pirated products  mentioned above for purposes of making profits, and the amounts  of unlawful incomes are quite substantial. This includes  exporting or importing and marketing apparently pirated products  mentioned above, and the amounts of unlawful incomes are quite  substantial.    As for penalties for copyright infringements, Gu Angran  said:  Because copyright infringements are primarily for unlawful  economic interests, the infringers, in addition to being  deprived of their personal freedom, must also be harshly  penalized economically. Based on Chinese law's penalty for the  infringement of industrial property rights as well as foreign  countries' criminal sanctions against copyright infringements,  the draft decision provides that infringers shall be sentenced  to prison for up to five years, criminal detention, and/or fines  according to the amounts of their unlawful incomes or the  seriousness of their cases. The draft decision also provides  that all the pirated products, unlawful incomes, materials,  tools, equipment, and other assets used by units or individuals  for copyright infringements shall be confiscated. If a unit has  been found guilty, the unit shall be fined and its  administrators and other personnel directly responsible for the  crime shall be punished according to the aforementioned  regulations.</p>

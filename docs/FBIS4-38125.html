			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, June 27 (AFP)--Iraq now has the capacity to  export more than two million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil,  its oil minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad said in an interview  published here on Monday.    Iraq will also demand an output quota "at parity with Iran,"  currently 3.6 million bpd, from the Organisation of Petroleum  Exporting Countries (OPEC) when UN sanctions are lifted, Jawad  told the MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SURVEY (MEES).    A United Nations embargo on Iraqi oil exports was imposed  following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq's  production quota was set at the same level with Iran's quota in  July 1990.    Jawad said Iraq had met UN resolutions to destroy its  weapons  of mass destruction, the condition for the lifting of the  embargo.    "We feel that we will soon return to the market," Jawad told  the specialist newsletter published in Cyprus during an  interview in Vienna.    "We can export more than 2 million bpd now. The export  outlets are ready. We sustained heavy damage, but we have  repaired around 90 per cent of the damaged facilities," he added.    Jawad said Iraq could export between 1.2 and 1.3 million bpd  through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which has a capacity of 1.8  million bpd, and 1.2 million bpd through the Mina' al-Bakr  export terminal on the Gulf.    Repairs on the nearby Khawr al-Amaya terminal would be ready  in the next few months to provide an initial export capacity of  600,000 bpd, al-Habubi said.    "We can also resort to exporting by trucks through Turkey  and  Jordan, as we did during the eighties. Hence the fact that we  cannot use the Iraqi-Saudi pipeline will not affect our export  capacity during the initial export stage."    The minister said Iraqi officials have visited Italy,  Ukraine  and France recently to discuss joint oil projects, but said  there had been no negotiations yet with Japanese firms.    Jawad said Iraq would "give priority to those companies  which  have held negotiations with us during the embargo," after  sanctions were lifted.    Iraq discussed with Ukraine the construction of a spur line  from the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline to Turkey's Black Sea coast,  from where oil could be exported to the Ukraine.</p>

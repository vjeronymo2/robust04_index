			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE DANGEROUS TRUTH IN 'CHAD'  </P> <P> Though the pen may be mightier than the sword, sometimes they work in  conjunction with each other. One word, casually inserted into a foreign  correspondent's story, can kill.  </P> <P> Neal Bateman (Jim Phipps), a wire service stringer who has just been expelled  from Uganda, is afraid that one of his words has -- ever so indirectly --  slaughtered an entire village.  </P> <P> In "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre  Stage, playwright Mark Lee amplifies Neal's anxiety into an examination of the  importance, the difficulty and the danger of truth-telling.  </P> <P> It's an evergreen subject for playwrights, but Lee's specifics are fairly  fresh, and he handles his chosen themes with considerable agility. This play is  likely to get a buzz going in the brain.  </P> <P> But it's not as likely to set the heart pumping. Neal's story is told -- or  revealed -- in retrospect, after he has been expelled from Uganda, in the  relative safety of the home (lots of barbed wire and beer bottles, designed by  Kent Dorsey) of the wire service's Nairobi correspondent (Richard Kneeland). A  Ugandan refugee, Christina (Cheryl Francis Harrington), hired by the  correspondent as a prostitute for Neal, is the character who gets him to  divulge what happened.  </P> <P> For a moment, when Christina recalls her own reason for leaving Uganda and then  realizes the potential peril of being seen with Neal, we begin to feel the heat  of the situation. Harrington has the presence and the inner fire to make the  most of this moment.  </P> <P> Generally, though, this is a reflective play, an inquiry into events of the  recent past -- events that are not re-enacted on stage.  </P> <P> As such, an undue burden is placed on the actor playing Neal to carry us along  on Neal's mental journey -- or at least so it appears in Adrian Hall's staging.  Actor Phipps has mastered Neal's nervous demeanor -- the correspondent  describes him as a gazelle -- but he hasn't visibly opened himself up to the  fuller dimensions of the role. We don't see him progressively inching closer to  the truth, or finally acknowledging it in his gut.  </P> <P> Also, Lee has written a couple of lines for Neal that simply don't ring true;  would this gun-shy young man really ask two prostitutes to chant "om" in order  to give him the time to say something to his host? Well, maybe so; Lee was  there -- he was himself a wire service stringer expelled from Uganda.  </P> <P> To a lesser extent, the play also follows the older correspondent's journey  from being the completely detached observer into acceptance of his own share of  responsibility for what happened. But while Lee paints the first part of this  journey almost to excess, establishing this man as an observer and interrogator  -- and loner -- of the first order, his eventual acceptance of responsibility  feels like an afterthought.  </P> <P> Regardless, Kneeland has a convincingly scruffy, devil-may-care air about him,  marred only by occasional swallowed lines, sacrificed to the dictates of  arena-style blocking (the blocking is also a problem for the "freeze frame"  that ends the first act; those of us on one side of the theater literally  couldn't see it).  </P> <P> The correspondent's jaded sensibility is shared by the older of the two  prostitutes, well portrayed by Rose Weaver. Lee has drawn interesting  generational parallels here between two very different classes of people.  </P> <P>  One of Lee's points is that the editors of Western publications aren't very  interested in Africa and the daily events there -- unless it can be dressed up  in highly dramatic imagery or in thumb-sucking pieces about "the big picture."  Neal began his job with fantasies of writing dispatches under sweeping  headlines like "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad," but he has found that the reality  is more complicated -- involving many little murders instead of massive  military ventures -- and that not many of his editors care about such things.  </P> <P> So it's ironic that Lee's play really isn't about the many little murders among  Africans either; it's about the ethical quandaries faced by Western journalists  within Africa. Of course that's probably what Lee felt most qualified to write  about. Still, it's as if he assumed that the people who select plays, even at  enlightened theaters like the Old Globe, would be no more interested than  Neal's editors if he focused on the Ugandans rather than the Westerners.  </P> <P> This assumption may be incorrect. At least in this production, when Christina  recounts what happened to her in Uganda, it's more gripping than anything that  Neal has to say. Neal's story is important -- this play is essential viewing  for journalists. But like the correspondent in the play who missed an  assassination because he was busy with his own affairs, Lee may have missed the  best story in Uganda.  </P> <P> In Balboa Park, San Diego, Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., (March 28-29  and April 10 at 7 p.m.), Sundays at 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2  p.m., through April 15.

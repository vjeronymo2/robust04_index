			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> A CALL FOR THE WILD;  </P> <P> AS NEWEST PARK PLANS ITS FUTURE, MOST VISITORS SAY LET IT BE  </P> <P> The nation's youngest national park has barely taken its first steps and  already visitors are worrying like overprotective parents about the future of  its soaring mountains, 4,000-year-old trees and mysterious caves.  </P> <P> Al Hendricks, supervisor of Great Basin National Park in eastern Nevada, said  that more than 600 people commented on a proposed 10-year management plan and  most called for restraint in improving the park.  </P> <P> "The comments we received tended quite heavily toward protection and  preservation," Hendricks said of the plan that was supposed to go to Congress  this month, three years after the 77,109-acre park's dedication on Oct. 27,  1986.  </P> <P> "For the most part, people are not looking to build water slides, pave things  over," he added, saying several people commented that "they didn't want Great  Basin to turn into a Yosemite, which is overdeveloped. There's even a bank in  Yosemite. It's practically a small city."  </P> <P> "People like things mostly the way they are at Great Basin and we hope to keep  it that way."  </P> <P> Attendance is still small at the park, even though its 75,000 visitors last  year represented an 83% increase over the 41,000 visitors in 1986. Hendricks  said park attendance is expected to be remain at about 75,000 this year. By  contrast, more than 3.3 million people crowded into 761,757-acre Yosemite  National Park in 1988.  </P> <P> "We are remote," Hendricks explained. "You kind of have to think twice about  getting in the car and driving out here. But it's worth it. It's one of the  last preserved places in the Great Basin."  </P> <P> Responses to the management plan were compiled for the final plan document,  which will not be ready to submit to Congress for about another year, despite  this month's proposed deadline.  </P> <P> Most agree with Hendricks about conserving the natural beauty of the park.  </P> <P> "Great Basin is a gem: a small glimpse into the past that hasn't been trampled  by the hand of man," said one anonymous visitor commenting on the plan. "I  believe we should make every effort to preserve it as a testament to the old  American West."  </P> <P> "Please do not go on a building spree, paving over paradise to put up parking  lots," another said.  </P> <P> "If it's not broken, don't fix it," implored one Great Basin National Park  lover.  </P> <P> "Please change as little as possible," another said.  </P> <P> But amid the anti-development comments collected in 1987 were statements from  recreational-vehicle enthusiasts and urban dwellers who want creature comforts  more than backwoods hardship when they commune with nature.  </P> <P> "If you make Wheeler Peak campground inaccessible to us we will lose all  interest in Great Basin National Park," one operator of a 22-foot mobile home  responded.  </P> <P> "Our RV was dirtier after a short visit to the park in June than in the rest of  our 6,000-mile trip," complained one visitor. "Please pave major roads and camp  areas. You have so much land that more should be developed."  </P> <P> Hendricks said the plan would emphasize preservation of the park, but also  would include some new campgrounds and access ways for visitors.  </P> <P> "You have to try and accommodate as many people as you can," he said.  </P> <P> Ranchers will be included in the park plan despite numerous negative comments  that cattle and other livestock should be run out.  </P> <P> "Congress put into the law that grazing would be allowed and unless they change  the law there's nothing we can do about it," Hendricks said.  </P> <P> Great Basin was the 49th national park dedicated in the United States and the  first to receive the designation in 15 years.  </P> <P> Highlights of the park include 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak, second in Nevada only  to 13,140-foot Boundary Peak; Lehman Caves National Monument's square-mile  spectacle of limestone formations, and acres of 4,000-year-old bristlecone pine  trees, grotesquely contorted from battling wind, sand and ice over the ages to  become the oldest known living things on Earth.  </P> <P> Steep-walled glacial lakes and narrow canyons also are among park features that  include Lexington Arch, a 70-foot-high, 83-foot wide stretch on which Indians  left primitive drawings.  </P> <P> The tiny town of Baker is the closest residential area to the park and has two  small motels with about a dozen rooms. The larger town of Ely, about 70 miles  away, has more amenities such as shopping and more motel rooms.  </P> <P> "We're a ways off the beaten track," Hendricks said.  </P> <P> Park operators submitted four proposed 10-year management plans for Great  Basin. They range from leaving most of the park alone to developing miles of  new roads, shuttle services and parking lots.  </P> <P> Nearly three-fourths of the people who commented on the plan said they  preferred two proposals that did not include much new development.  </P> <P> Those two alternatives call for construction of a Great Basin interpretive  center at Baker Ridge, access roads to the facility, and a 100-car parking lot  for those visiting Lehman Caves.  </P> <P> But the proposals do not include new developments or maintained roads for  vehicles further into the park's unspoiled areas.  </P> <P> Two other alternatives propose more deep-park vehicle access, including public  roads leading to 11,658-foot Mt. Washington, and generally prefer a much more  modern approach to managing the park.  </P> <P> "Most of the facilities we have now were built back when Lehman Caves became a  national monument in 1922, so we do actually need some updated facilities,"  Hendricks said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, a third of the public comments urged park operators to relocate  all housing, maintenance and administration facilities from the park to Baker  to better preserve Great Basin.  </P> <P> "We got comments on the far side of preservation and development," Hendricks  said. "We just have to find a middle ground."  </P> <P> Most respondents said they wanted to see access to such areas as Strawberry  Creek, Snake Creek, Big Wash and Lexington Arch, which already have some roads.  But they do not want maintained roads to Big Spring Wash, Decathlon Canyon and  Mt. Washington, to which people usually must hike.  </P> <P> Most want limited service camping in areas such as Wheeler Peak, Upper Lehman,  Lower Lehman and Baker Creek, which already have some campgrounds. But they  don't want campsites at Lehman Flats, Big Spring Wash, Decathlon Canyon or Grey  Cliffs.  </P> <P> "We want another four campgrounds in the park because now we don't have enough  space," Hendricks said. "We're also working on getting the water system up to  snuff.  </P> <P> "Whatever improvements we make, though, a lot of the park is going to remain  mountainous territory available for hiking. I wouldn't say the park is exactly  like it was in 1922, but it's close, pretty preserved."  </P> <P> On other issues, about two-thirds of the respondents to the 10-year plan  opposed hang-gliding and snowmobiling in the park. About one-third said that  cross-country skiing routes should not be maintained.  </P> <P> Most said fishing should be allowed, but only on a catch-and-release basis, and  that hunting should be strictly forbidden.  </P> <P> The reintroduction of elk in the park should be encouraged, most of those  commenting said, and predator populations should be left alone to control mule  deer and other wild herds.  </P></p>

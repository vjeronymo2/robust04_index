			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Israel wants to hold on to Golan listening post ISRAEL is poised to negotiate with Syria on a phased withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights in coming weeks, but will insist on making the area a demilitarised zone and keeping an electronic listening post there once Israeli troops depart, an Israeli negotiator said yesterday. Mr David Kimche, a former top Foreign Ministry and intelligence official who is now an Israeli delegate to the multilateral Middle East peace talks, told a press conference that Israel was convinced Syria's President Hafez al-Assad was intent on a deal with the Jewish state and would be spurred towards detailed negotiations by the imminent agreements between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. But he said both sides would prefer to implement such an understanding gradually, with Syria normalising relations in steps over several years, while Israel moved off the Golan Heights, which it occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Mr Kimche's analysis, based on intelligence accounts of recent political deliberations in Damascus, was that Mr Assad was not ready to move rapidly to full normalisation. Equally, Israel would need a phased agreement like that under which it handed Sinai back to Egypt in the late 1970s, leaving behind a multinational peacekeeping force. This would enable it to safeguard the security of its northern regions, which Syrian forces on the Golan threatened during the 1960s, and deal with the Israeli settlers who have since built homes and farms on the strategic heights. The extent of any Israeli withdrawal is likely to remain the principal bone of contention in what is universally expected to be the toughest part of the bilateral Arab-Israeli talks still to come. Syria will insist Israel commits itself to a complete pullout, while Israel would prefer to make a declaration in principle of Syrian sovereignty over, and demilitarisation of, the Golan, leaving details such as the composition of any multi-national observer force to be sorted out subsequently. 'We will have to decide whether we can do that (withdraw completely) - and if so, how we are to be compensated from the point of view of security and settlers,' said Mr Kimche, stressing that the modalities of withdrawal had yet to be broached in the negotiations. 'But I cannot see by any means that we would agree to Syrian soldiers going back to the Golan.' Israel's Golan electronic listening facilities were its 'eyes and ears on what's going on in Syria,' he said. He added Israel might agree to a third party - such as the US - taking over the listening post, provided Israel had access to the information. Mr Kimche said that although Mr Assad had evidently been angered by the PLO's failure to consult him on its deal with Israel, this would help him also make peace. He also said Israel would withdraw fully from territory in south Lebanon provided the PLO and Syria undertook to curtail attacks on Israel's northern border by the Islamic militant group, Hizbollah.</p>

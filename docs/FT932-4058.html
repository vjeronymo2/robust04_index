			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Central banker appointed THE composition of the Bank of Italy's four-man directorate was agreed yesterday by the governing council, five weeks after Mr Antonio Fazio became governor. The new member of the central bank's executive body was named as Mr Vincenzo Desario, chief supervisor since 1983 and the most likely choice in terms of seniority. Mr Desario, 60, becomes one of the two deputy directors. He joined the Bank of Italy in 1960 and has spent most of his career on the inspection side. He replaces Mr Fazio who in turn replaced Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi when he became prime minister. The confirmation of Mr Lamberto Dini as director-general suggests that the authorities have been unable to find in the short term a suitably prestigious post for him either in Italy or internationally. Mr Dini was a contender to take over from Mr Ciampi as governor; but he was passed over in favour of his younger colleague, Mr Fazio. The fourth member of the directorate, and the third in rank is Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, who has held this post since 1984.</p>

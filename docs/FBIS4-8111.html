			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric from Knin] </F>   [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Marinko Gajic, assistant  commander of the General Staff of the Serbian Army of Krajina,  has said that members of infantry units had withdrawn by 0900.  There have been minor problems in western Slavonia and the  assistant commander of the Serbian Army of Krajina expects them  to be solved during the day. So far, nothing has been heard from  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], whose units are going to be  deployed between Krajina and Croatian infantry units who have  moved apart by one kilometer each.    The first meeting of the central joint commission, attended  by Lieutenant General Bertrand De Lapresle, UNPROFOR commander  for the former Yugoslavia, is under way in Turanj, near Karlovac.    The second meeting of the first session of the republican  assembly is under way in Knin at the moment. It has been  learned that the report by the negotiating team to the peace  negotiations held in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb is also going  to be discussed at the session. It has also been learned that  the proposal on prime minister designate and the new government  had been taken off the agenda and that this is most probably  going to be discussed on 20 April.</p>

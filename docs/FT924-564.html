			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / International Company News: Restructuring helps Isuzu cut back loss for year to Y23.5bn ISUZU Motors, the Japanese vehicle maker with close links to General Motors of the US, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Y23.5bn (Dollars 191m) for the 12 months to the end of October. The result was an improvement on the previous year's loss of Y48.4bn and a sign that its restructuring programme is making an impact. The company recently announced plans to stop production of passenger cars and to concentrate on commercial vehicles. It will also make recreational vehicles for Honda, which will be allowed to market passenger cars though Isuzu dealers. Isuzu's sales rose 4.6 per cent to Y1,198.7bn for the year, while the after-tax loss was Y12.7bn, against a previous loss of Y47.2bn. The company hopes to break even this year at the net level, but is forecasting a Y13bn pre-tax loss. The company, which has trimmed its force of temporary workers and streamlined the components supply system, reported a fall in sales of large trucks and buses. But there was an increase in demand for smaller trucks and buses, and a 10 per cent increase in sales of engines and other car parts. Isuzu last week announced a plan to commission GM, which has a 37 per cent stake in it, to produce medium-sized trucks in the US from early 1994 as part of an expanded partnership between the two. 'We are hoping for a rapid economic recovery and an improvement in the business environment,' Isuzu said. But the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported yesterday that domestic vehicle production in November was down 9.3 per cent from a year earlier. Truck production in November was down 13.9 per cent - the 16th straight month of a year-on-year decrease. Fuji Kiko, a Japanese vehicle component maker 23.8 per cent owned by Nissan Motor, has acquired FFV Autotech, a Swedish auto component maker for Y500m, Reuter reports from Tokyo. FFV Autotech - which produces steering components for Volvo, Saab-Scania, and Renault - expects net profits of SKr87m (Dollars 12.6m) in 1992.</p>

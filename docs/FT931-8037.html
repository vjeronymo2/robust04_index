			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Citicorp chief paid Dollars 1m bonus for profits rally MR JOHN REED, chairman and chief executive of Citicorp, is being paid a Dollars 1.035m bonus for 1992 due to the US bank's improved performance, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuter reports from New York. His salary will stay the same at Dollars 1.15m. The filing said Mr Reed, who was paid no bonus for 1991 and 1990, was being given the bonus in recognition of the success of his two-year revamping plan to return Citicorp to health. Citicorp produced full-year 1992 net profits of Dollars 722m, after a loss of Dollars 457m in 1991. But Mr Reed was only awarded 90 per cent of his targeted bonus, reflecting work still to be done at Citicorp.</p>

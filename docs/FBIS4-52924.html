			<p>BFN     [Text] A special report from the Battambang-Sisophon  portion of Route 5: The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK] crushed the invading forces of the two-headed government  in Mongkolborei, completely liberating the Mongkolborei township  and bridge.    At 0400 near dawn on 15 May the NADK and people attacked the  invading forces of the two-headed government in Mongkolborei  township from three directions. The first prong engaged the  enemy at the Mongkolborei Bridge. The second prong hit their  position in the Mongkolborei market. The third attacked the  defense networks protecting the Mongkolborei township along the  Mongkolborei River south of Route 5.    As initial results: 1. We completely destroyed the position  defending the Mongkolborei Bridge and destroyed the Mongkolborei  Bridge itself.    2. We destroyed the position of the invading forces in the  Mongkolborei market and completely liberated the market.    3. We crushed the invading forces and the brutal authorities  of the two-headed government along the Mongkolborei River from  Bat Trang to Rohat Toek.    The NADK and people are carrying on the attack against the  invading forces and brutal authorities of the two-headed  government both on and along Route 5.    The strategic transport line of the invading forces from  Battambang to Sisophon and from Sisophon to Poipet which for  months has been intermittently closed is now completely cut off.  In whole units, the invading troops are fleeing in all  directions, trying to return to their homes and loved ones,  especially those who have been forcibly sent by the two-headed  government from Oddar Meanchey, Siem Reap, and Preah Vihear.  The brutal authorities are also running for their lives. Those  who were forcibly drafted have pledged to the people that they  will no longer serve the leading puppets of the communist  Vietnamese and the Americans against their own nation and  people. They said they have seen with their own eyes and heard  with their own ears that the alliance headed by the United  States has overtly colluded with the communist Vietnamese and  their stooges in the two-headed government in trying to do away  with our nation. Our people both in the countryside and the  cities as well as those living elsewhere must unite and fight  most vigorously to defend our nation and race and save it from  being wiped out by the aggressors, be it the communist  Vietnamese, the alliance, or their running dogs in the  two-headed government.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DO-IT-YOURSELF: LET CERTIFIED EXPERTS JUGGLE ASBESTOS  </P> <P> This column is called "Do-It-Yourself," but this time it is about something you  shouldn't try on your own: removal of asbestos from the home.  </P> <P> Exposure to the one-time miracle mineral, used for lightweight fireproofing and  insulation, is now known to cause serious health problems.  </P> <P> And if you live in a home built before 1978 -- when asbestos was prohibited --  it's likely that asbestos-containing materials are present.  </P> <P> That does not mean you should tear your house down, or even that you are being  exposed to anything harmful. In many cases, the asbestos-containing products  are perfectly safe and should be left alone. They create problems only if  damaged or disturbed.  </P> <P> But because Orange County homeowners are great remodelers, you should know just  where asbestos is likely to be found -- and what the rules are regarding its  safe handling.  </P> <P> Knocking down walls, removing ceilings, ripping up linoleum or asbestos tile  flooring and extending heating ducts all can create asbestos-exposure dangers.  </P> <P> Material containing asbestos is most dangerous when in a friable state -- a  broken, crumbled or pulverized condition in which asbestos-laden dust is  released.  </P> <P> No one is now legally responsible for checking for the presence of asbestos  before a project begins. But as of Jan. 1, a new South Coast Air Quality  Management District rule will require professional contractors to test for the  presence of asbestos before starting demolition or remodeling work and to  ensure that workers and others are not exposed to asbestos during the project.  </P> <P> Peter Reum of Enkay Engineering, a Santa Ana-based, asbestos-removal contractor  -- one of fewer than 200 statewide that have been licensed by Cal-OSHA --  emphasizes that handling the material -- whether to remove it or seal it off --  is best and most safely left to professionals. Do not do it yourself.  </P> <P> The material is dangerous because it is made up of tiny, microscopic fibers  that can easily be inhaled and become lodged in the lungs, causing asbestosis  -- a debilitating respiratory ailment -- and several types of cancer.  </P> <P> While there is a definite link between these diseases and workers who have had  a high lifetime exposure to asbestos, little is known about the low-level  effects of the material. Still, state and federal law operates on the principle  that even very little is way too much.  </P> <P> For the typical county resident, the most immediate problem might be in your  fireplace. Asbestos was widely used in cement logs for gas fireplaces and,  worse, was the principal ingredient in the false ashes that were spread beneath  the logs to make the display look realistic.  </P> <P> If you have a pre-1978 fireplace log set, have it tested for asbestos and, if  it is present, hire an asbestos removal firm to clean out the fireplace.  </P> <P> Asbestos can be found in more than a dozen applications in the home. It was  widely used to insulate heating ducts and in sprayed-on acoustic ceilings until  barred in 1978 and was a popular ingredient in linoleum and vinyl floor tile,  in wallboard joint compounds and patching plasters, in the tape used to seal  the joints between heating ducts and heat registers, in roofing felt and tar,  and in the gaskets of some stoves and furnaces.  </P> <P> In older homes, asbestos was also a commonly used material in the cloth-covered  insulation on electrical wiring. It was used to insulate hot-water pipes and as  a lining for wooden electrical fuse boxes.  </P> <P> Fortunately, relatively few homes in the county have old-fashioned steam or  oil-fired basement heating systems, eliminating one common source of asbestos  exposure: decaying gaskets in furnace doors and damaged insulation around pipes  and boilers.  </P> <P> But asbestos was also commonly used to insulate overhead heating ducts.  "Removing damaged duct insulation is the most common residential job we do,"  Reum said.  </P> <P> Before the 1950s, most heating ducts were insulated with an asbestos-lined  paper. From the '50s through the early 1970s, air-cell insulation was almost  universal in the heating industry -- and most of it contained asbestos. In the  mid-70s a new product, Alumasbestos, came into use.  </P> <P> In all of its forms, asbestos duct insulation can become friable, either  through deterioration or from damage that rips the paper, plastic or aluminum  outer coatings and exposes asbestos to the air.  </P> <P> Another common use for asbestos in the home was in ubiquitous spray-on  acoustic, or "cottage cheese," ceilings. In most cases, those ceilings are safe  -- as long as the homeowner uses a little common sense.  </P> <P> Do not sweep or dust or paint them with devices that will knock the material  loose, and do not vacuum up particles that fall down. Reum recommends using a  moistened paper towel to pick up loose particles, which then should be sealed  in a plastic bag for disposal. He said that an airless spray gun is the safest  tool to use in painting such a ceiling.  </P> <P> If your acoustic ceiling is damaged, or if you are remodeling and need to  remove it, have samples tested from several areas of the ceiling in each room  in which it appears to determine whether asbestos is present.  </P> <P> "You should take several samples," Reum said, "because sometimes, depending on  how the stuff was mixed, one area can be asbestos-free while another will have  a high concentration."  </P> <P> Inspections for asbestos can be done by Cal-OSHA approved asbestos abatement  and removal contractors and by industrial hygienists. All will involve testing  of material, Reum said, "because no matter how long you've been in this  business, you can't tell just by looking at something whether it has asbestos  or not."  </P> <P> A few rules of thumb to follow if you contract an inspection:  </P> <P> Do not deal with an outfit that tries to frighten you into having work done.  High-pressure tactics, in asbestos removal as in most any other field,  generally signal a shoddy operation.  </P> <P> Get several estimates before you hire a firm for removal or abatement work. A  recent job involving removal of about 300 square feet of sprayed-on acoustic  ceiling material in two rooms brought bids of $950, $1,000 and $2,400 from  three Orange County-based asbestos contractors. And the high bidder on that job  was the low bidder, by a factor of 50%, on a job calling for removal of  exterior wall shingles.  </P> <P> Do not assume that just because a material has asbestos, it must be removed.  Many asbestos-laden materials are safe. Linoleum and vinyl-asbestos floor tile,  for example, is dangerous only if you are ripping it up or for some reason want  to sand it. And undamaged acoustic ceilings are usually best left alone.  </P> <P> Floors and ceilings containing asbestos can also be covered over, on floors  with plywood and new flooring and on ceilings with dry-wall gypsum board and  new plaster or paint. Ceilings can also be encapsulated by spraying a chemical  agent that bonds with the asbestos fibers and seals them in plastic coating.  </P> <P> Asbestos consultants, asbestos removal and abatement contractors and industrial  hygienists are all listed in the Yellow Pages.  </P> <P> Are you handy? Do you install your own skylights, French doors and electric  lighting, or build your own bookshelves, gazebos, brick walls or wine cellars?  If you have completed -- or are in the midst of -- special projects around your  house, share them and your expertise.

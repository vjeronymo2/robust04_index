			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FT. LAUDERDALE DEFEATS NOMADS TO WIN U.S. TITLE  </P> <P> The Ft. Lauderdale Strikers scored three consecutive second-half goals and  defeated the San Diego Nomads, 3-1, in the first National Pro Soccer  Championship game Saturday night at Spartan Stadium.  </P> <P> The match was the first outdoor national professional championship game since  the North American Soccer League folded in 1985. The Nomads were representing  the nine-team Western Soccer League, the Strikers the East Coast's American  Soccer League.  </P> <P> A crowd of 8,632 watched the teams play to a scoreless first half before the  Strikers broke the 90-minute match open.  </P> <P> After spotting the Nomads a 1-0 lead at 73:13 on a goal by forward Jerome  Watson, the Strikers surged offensively, much as they had done all season. Eric  Eichmann, a U.S. national team player and hero in the United States' recent 1-0  victory over Soviet power Dnepr, scored the tying goal on an assist by Ricardo  Alonso just 1:01 after Watson's goal.  </P> <P> Troy Edwards put the Strikers ahead, 2-1 with his first goal of the season at  84:40, assisted by Marcelo Carrera and Pedro Magallanes.  </P> <P> Ft. Lauderdale put the Nomads away when Carrera, his team's offensive leader  throughout the match, drove a shot into the back of the net at 89:00.  </P> <P> The goaltenders dominated the first half. Ft. Lauderdale's 14-year U.S.  professional Arnie Mausser and San Diego's Jeff Duback, of the U.S. national  team, combined for 14 saves.  </P> <P> Mausser, an imposing force at 6-feet-4, 200 pounds, twice stopped San Diego  forward Paul Wright in one-on-one situations.  </P></p>

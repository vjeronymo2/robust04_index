			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Feltrim Names may face greater losses MORE THAN 1,000 Lloyd's Names may face insurance losses of nearly Pounds 700m, well above the level of losses that had been feared, according to a market report. The Names, individuals whose personal assets back the insurance market's capital, are members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847, which specialised in catastrophe reinsurance before they ceased to trade at the start of last year. Between 1987 and 1990 the syndicates were swamped by claims from a series of hurricanes, explosions and other disasters. Their losses had been expected to total Pounds 289.3m. A report prepared by the present managers of syndicates 540/542 and 847  - which include many hard-hit US and Canadian Names - says, however, losses may be bet-ween Pounds 477.5m and Pounds 691.4m. Losses for the 1989 year alone are now estimated at between Pounds 227.5m and Pounds 298m, compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 147.7m. The Lloyd's of London insurance market announced a Pounds 2.06bn loss for 1989 in June. Mr Tony Berry, involved in the administration of the syndicate since it ceased trading, says he has uncovered evidence of lax management controls and inadequate reinsurance arrangements. He said: 'The state of the reinsurance system was indeed a sight to behold and has been a major task to sort out.' Human errors seemed to have run at an 'unacceptably high level' and controls 'were clearly inadequate'. He added: 'I feel devastated at the results these syndicates are producing and the manner in which they have arisen.' The news is bound to fuel the anger of Names on the two syndicates, who are awaiting the results of a separate investigation into Feltrim, led by Sir Patrick Neill QC. Sir Patrick, asked to head the investigation last year, has taken longer than expected to report. The report might be presented to the Lloyd's council, the market's governing body, next month. Names, who are delaying any legal action until the report is completed, fear further delays. The syndicates' accounts for the 1987 to 1990 years have still not been closed because of continuing uncertainty about the pattern of future claims. The present management took over administration of the syndicates on behalf of Lloyd's when the Feltrim agency ceased trading. Names on the syndicates are being sent copies of the report this week. Other syndicates specialising in catastrophe reinsurance have also produced heavy losses for their Names. Even taking into account the revised estimates, the Feltrim syndicates have still not performed as badly as a group of syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency. Gooda losses amounted to Pounds 491m in the 1989 year and are expected to produce further heavy losses in 1990.</p>

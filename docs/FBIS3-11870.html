Fernando Botero, Samper's campaign manager, believes  Pastrana  offered the vice presidency to several Liberals in what he  called a "cunning electoral maneuver," but none of them were  willing to side with him.    Meanwhile, Humberto de la Calle Lombana, Liberal vice  presidential candidate, said Ramirez is a young and intelligent  man, but an absolutely beatable candidate.    Samper's official position on the Pastrana-Ramirez slate was  outlined on 19 March -- the same day the Conservative ticket was  announced -- through a statement issued by Samper's campaign  manager.    According to the Liberals, the choice of Ramirez should  generate three reactions from the public. First, Pastrana's  decision "signifies his own explicit acknowledgment of the huge  failure of the supraparty strategy he announced with much hoopla  the day he was nominated."    The statement added: "Second, Colombians must be fully aware  that, by law, Ramirez is unqualified to be a vice presidential  candidate or, under the very remote chance of a Conservative  victory in the 8 May elections, to occupy the vice presidency or  the presidency of the Republic. Without belittling Ramirez's  personal and professional qualifications, it is more than  obvious that he was until yesterday a government minister, and  this obviously makes him ineligible to run for the vice  presidency."    The Samperist viewpoint contends that Colombians now have  two  alternatives which radically oppose one another.    One alternative is the Liberal ticket which, according to  Samper, "represents a serious and experienced team that is  deeply committed to the people and social capitalism."    The other one is "the inexperienced Conservative  Pastrana-Ramirez ticket, which exemplifies fruitless,  uncontrolled capitalism in the current electoral process."    Its conclusion is that "all of this proves that Pastrana is  unable [biche] to assume the serious responsibilities demanded  by the Colombian presidency."    Ernesto Samper's campaign also asserts that the difficulties  Andres Pastrana encountered when trying to find a running mate  convey a lack of leadership and reduce his chances of winning.  It notes that Pastrana offered the nomination to "many  Conservative [as published] members," but was unable to get a  positive answer.    Another source said: "The truth is that Pastrana offered  this  candidacy to many prominent Liberals, but none would commit to  this cunning electoral maneuver of hiding a wolf -- a  Conservative candidacy -- in the sheep's clothes of a Liberal  vice president."    In the eyes of Samper's team, this is the last nail in what  it calls "the coffin of supraparty sophism that Conservatives  tried to use to deceive public opinion, which today is  completely aware of the foundations of the Samper and Pastrana  candidacies."</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Son rises in the east for Hanson Is Hanson about to drop its simple strategy of being a company 'over here' that also does rather well 'over there'? The Anglo-American conglomerate, is joining the rush eastwards by opening a Hong Kong office. The attack on Asia will be led by Mr Robert Hanson, 33-year-old son of the chairman, Lord Hanson. He will chair Hanson Pacific, which will be run by two new appointments to the group, Mr Simon Hsu, a former investment banker, and Miss Yuen-Cheng Ng, a US-trained lawyer. The subsidiary is intended to develop opportunities in Asia, but is unlikely to cause an immediate shift in the source of profits. Hanson expects the potential is largely for joint ventures for subsidiaries, such as Peabody Coal, SCM Chemicals, Cavenham Forest Products and Imperial Tobacco. The last is already looking at ways to develop in China. The new office will supplement Hanson's interests in Australia, which include coal and titanium dioxide, and where Mr Anthony Cotton, a Hanson high-flier, has been sent to sort out Hanson's 40 per cent owned Renison Goldfields. So far Mr Hanson's success as a corporate strategist has been limited. As a main board member, his current role is to look for opportunities in Europe. In October 1992, he implied that the group's next sizeable deal would be on the continent. He had hardly spoken when Hanson launched a bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, a largely UK company. When that failed, the next move was a classic Hanson-style US acquisition, buying Quantum Chemical last September. Since then, Hanson has been selling rather than buying businesses to cut its heavy debt. Mr Hanson's new responsibility will give a chance to revisit haunts he frequented in 1986-88, when working for the Hong Kong subsidiary of NM Rothschild, the merchant bank. His Hanson's appointment is not full time, and he will retain his European role, working with Mr Christopher Collins, another main board director and the husband of a niece of Lord Hanson.</p>

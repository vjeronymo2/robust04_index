			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> political correspondent Udi Segal "following the prime  minister's meeting with Pope John Paul II" at the Vatican on 17  March -- recorded]    [Text] [Segal] We asked Prime Minister Rabin about his  meeting with Pope John Paul II and whether the pope intended to  visit Israel in the coming weeks or months?    [Rabin] The pope said that he hoped to visit Israel soon. I  do not know exactly what he meant by soon. At any rate, he did  not mention any dates.    [Segal] What importance do you attach to your audience with  the pope?    [Rabin] The pope is the religious and spiritual leader of  hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Pope John  Paul II decided to establish relations between the Vatican and  Israel 45 years after the state's establishment. I thanked the  pope for his courageous stand against totalitarian regimes, such  as Nazism and Communism, and for his war against antisemitism.  I asked him, as someone with influence over hundreds of  millions of people, to support the Middle East peace process and  to do his best to persuade elements in the Arab world to return  to the negotiations. We obviously spoke about the need to put  an end to the wars and the bloodshed which causes terrible  suffering to all the parties, and especially to Israel. We  spoke about those who had not returned from the battlefield and  the soldiers who were still missing in action. I did not  mention any names but I assume that there are continuing  contacts between Israel and Vatican officials who may help  locate Israeli MIA's.    [Segal] You are returning to Israel this evening. Did your  visit to Washington contribute to the promotion or resumption of  the negotiations with the Palestinians or the Syrians?    [Rabin] It is still too early to sum things up. There has  been a delay in the negotiations. We discussed a series of  steps, some of which have already been carried out and others  which we shall implement in the future, as is the case with  regard to the United States. This, in order to put the talks  back on track as soon as possible. We cannot ignore the fact  that the State of Israel, through the military government and  the civil administration, is responsible for the security of the  entire population. We have always been proud of this fact and  stated it publicly. In the wake of what happened, we already  took action and shall take additional steps in the future.    [Segal] When asked which steps he proposed to initiate,  Prime Minister Rabin refused to elaborate, merely explaining  that they would be on two levels, both guaranteeing the security  of the Palestinians in the territories as well as enabling them  to return to the negotiating table.    I asked Mr. Rabin if it was not time to defuse what he  described as the time bomb in Hebron? The prime minister  replied that he would not dismantle the Jewish settlement in  Hebron because that would constitute a violation of the Oslo  agreement. Rabin, nevertheless, used very sharp words when he  described the Jewish settlement in the heart of the Arab town as  stupid.    [Rabin] I do not want to link the issue of the Jewish  settlers remaining in Hebron to other matters. As prime  minister at the time, I prevented settlement activity there  because I knew what the results would be. From the security  aspect, the Jewish settlement in Hebron was established in what  I would describe as a stupid manner. The settlements are not  concentrated but rather spread throughout Hebron. Whoever did  things that way was endangering the lives of the Jewish  residents.    [Segal] In the interview, Rabin also hinted at the  possibility of restrictions on settlers carrying weapons in Arab  population centers, including Hebron.</p>

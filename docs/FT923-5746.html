			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / The Property Market: Ain't no cure for the summertime blues  -There is no seasonal respite The property industry's summer lull was deceptive. While its movers and shakers escaped to the Cote d'Azur, the heat was still on in London. Market commentators have stopped talking about recovery in 1993 and, instead, wonder if forecasts of a recovery in 1994 are too optimistic. The anxiety is shared by the equity market, where property shares have plumbed record depths. At the start of the summer property analysts believed that rents might stabilise over the next year as the economic recovery took hold. Yields had stopped rising and seemed likely to harden in line with falling bond yields. Optimists suggested that the recovery in the values of property such as retail warehouses and supermarkets were harbingers of a broadly-based improvement. In early June, Mr John Ritblat of British Land, one of the UK's largest property companies, cheered the market by declaring that 'for the first time since 1989 we think we have seen the worst'. But over the summer, support for the market has been dragged down by increasing concern about the economy as a whole. As prospects for a reversal in employment trends deteriorate, so does the likelihood of a stabilisation of rents. Concern too over ratification of European Monetary Union and the recent volatility of leading currencies has discouraged those who believed that yields will come down with interest rates. Even those who do not believe in a link between property yields and interest rates remain pessimistic. Mr Chris Turner of stockbroker BZW, for example, says that yields will remain high because there has been a 'fundamental shift in investors' perceptions of the value of rental streams', as a result of oversupply, the shortage of credit, decline of the institutional lease and the fall in inflation. A lack of market confidence has been widespread. A recent poll by Gallup for Chartered Surveyor Weekly found that fewer than half the country's senior property directors and fund managers believe there will be any meaningful recovery in the market before the second half of 1994; a quarter believe recovery will not take place until 1995 or later. In a separate poll, fewer than half the bankers surveyed by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, believe there could be a recovery in the next year. Commentators have also downgraded their market forecasts. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, expects further falls in average capital values of 11 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 1993. BZW, another broker, reckons capital values will fall by 10 per cent this year and 6 per cent the following year. But capital values for different types of property will tumble by different rates. BZW forecasts that office values will decline by 14 per cent and 7 per cent in 1992 and 1993 respectively, while retail property values will fall by 6 per cent in both years and industrial property by 6 per cent and 5 per cent over the same period. Just as variations exist in different sectors of the market, so it is a mistake to generalise about locations and quality of property. For instance, the provincial office market is relatively robust, according to St Quintin, a chartered surveyor. With the exception of Glasgow, the largest regional office centres have a relatively small supply of new space. Rental growth averaged 7.7 per cent in Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1990 and 1991. Some analysts believe there is even a case to be made for the central London market. Applied Property Research (APR), an independent research group which has been pessimistic about the central London office market since 1987, has changed its view. APR's Mr Geoff Marsh suggests that supply and demand for the relatively small number of large high quality buildings in the West End has already balanced out. Even in the City, Mr Marsh says that well-located, modern buildings could be taken up much faster than analysts suggest. 'My instinct is that things have hit bottom,' he says. This belief that the top end of the market is nearing recovery is not shared by all. Kleinwort Benson, a broker, says a shortage of modern office space in the City is unlikely to arise till well into 1995. In any case, the outlook for the market as a whole is still poor, with a particularly dismal outlook for old buildings, in the Docklands or on the City fringes. The dominant role played by the central London market in the portfolios of the large property companies explains in part the abysmal performance of the companies' share prices. With the largest property companies valued at half their prospective asset values and on average yields of more than 9 per cent, the market is in uncharted territory. 'The buyers for recovery have burned their fingers too many times and there are no buyers left to take over the running,' said Kleinwort Benson earlier this month in a company bulletin. At some stage, the property share market will see a sharp correction. However, given the stock market's traditional ability to anticipate a recovery in property values by at least 18 months, its present condition is hardly encouraging for the underlying property market. The message from the economy and the stock market is clear: all bets are off for a recovery in the property market for well over a year.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ IPD MONTHLY INDEX  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Monthly change (Index based at Dec 1986 = 100)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                 Jul 1992      Jun 1992      Changes IPD             167.85         167.68         0.18 Retail          155.61         154.81         0.80 Office          159.55         160.17        -0.62 Industrial      233.28         233.01        -0.27  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (4): Polymath of many colours - Michael D. Higgins, minister for arts, culture and the Irish language, believes in offering a wide range of cultural choices Poet, political scientist, sociologist and socialist, university lecturer and now minister for arts, culture and the Irish language, Mr Michael D. Higgins is one of the more colourful figures to have entered the upper echelons of Ireland's political establishment in recent years. He is a liberal thinker, author of two well-received books of poetry and renowned for his erudite and impassioned Dail speeches. Mr Higgins has given a surge of confidence to Ireland's arts community since his appointment to the cabinet in January 1993, his first ministerial post. With an annual budget of more than IPounds 50m, he has increased government funding for the Irish Arts Council by 25 per cent and secured pre-production tax breaks and IPounds 16m in funding for the film industry over the next four years. He is now turning his attention to the music and multimedia industries. 'I want an active rather than a passive cultural policy, which is open to diversity and which creates a cultural space to fill the narrowing of the economic space,' he says. He quotes approvingly from Edward Said's latest book Culture and Imperialism, and says he is a firm believer in cultural development as a stimulant to economic development. He says people across Europe will have to adjust to greater work flexibility and make more use of their leisure time in order to deal with unemployment. 'If we have enhanced cultural activity, there will be more alternatives to use that spare time and people will be more willing to make those adjustments.' He points to the success of the Irish film industry as proof that cultural promotion also creates jobs. He is known for arguing his views forcefully with his EU counterparts in the European Cultural Council, but he became more widely known outside Ireland earlier this year for his lifting of the two decade-old broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. 'I took a lot of flak from all sides for that, but it was done in the context of the public's right to information and the political censorship issue. I revoked the ban not to facilitate Sinn Fein but to facilitate the public,' he says. A desire to give people a wide range of cultural choices underpins his arms-length approach to the government-funded arts bodies which come under his remit. These must have autonomy with responsibility, he says. It is for government to help create 'the cultural space' within which broadcasters, artists, writers and musicians have the freedom to innovate. The public, he insists, does not need to be told by government what to think. The growing international acclaim of Irish actors, directors, writers and musicians, bolstered by a string of recent successes with Oscars, the Booker prize - even a third successive win at the Eurovision Song Contest - shows how far Irish cultural policy has come from the dark days of the 1930s when writers such as Joyce, Synge and Beckett, chose exile in order to get published. Today they would be given grants and live tax-free. As Mr Higgins finishes his lunch a man comes over to shake his hand. 'I liked your last book of poems, Minister. Keep it up,' he says. Mr Higgins confesses he has written 'only four and a half' in the past 18 months. Nonetheless, Joyce would have been impressed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Moscow on Tuesday Russia and Moldova began the  ninth round of their talks on determining the status of Russia's  14th Army and fixing the time for its withdrawal from  Trans-Dniestria. The adviser to the president of the  self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniestria, Stepan Kitsak, is  taking part in the talks as an observer.    Trans-Dniestria's Secretary of State, Valery Litskay, told  Interfax's correspondent that the status of observer will not  allow the adviser to Trans-Dniestria's president to interfere in  the process of talks, but his stand remains unchanged -- the  14th Army can be withdrawn from Trans-Dniestria only when the  region's political status is determined.    The leaders of Trans-Dniestria believe that the decree  issued  by the president of the self-proclaimed republic, Igor Smirnov,  to place the 14th Army under Trans-Dniestria's jurisdiction will  not hinder the process of talks; it will only remind members of  the official delegations that there is a third party.    "Solution to this problem will require a lot of time and  many  rounds of talks yet. The trouble is that Russia, Moldova and  Trans-Dniestria are seeking to accomplish different strategic  tasks. They must join their efforts in the main direction --  determine Trans-Dniestria's political status -- and only after  that begin to speak about withdrawing the 14th Army in concrete  terms. The talks on removing the Russian army from the area  will remain just talk without taking a cardinal decision on the  status of Trans-Dniestria," Litskay told INTERFAX's  correspondent.</p>

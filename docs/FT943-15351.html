			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Trusts with real appeal - Gillian O'Connor discovers how a professional analyst picks them Picking unit trusts often seems harder than picking individual shares - perhaps not surprising, as there are more than 1,500 authorised UK trusts to choose from. Fund Research analyses trusts for professional financial advisers. We asked managing director Peter Jeffreys how he picks the good ones. Question. What percentage of unit trust funds do worse than the market? Answer. At least three-quarters of all funds normally do worse than the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Q. How useful are historic performance tables in picking future top performers? A. Only one in five of the funds in the top quarter of a five-year league table are likely to remain in the top quarter over the next five years. For my money, that's not good enough. Q. Is there an alternative selection method? A. We use a combination of quantitative analysis and qualitative appraisal. Only 15 per cent of funds pass the initial statistical screening. This breaks the five-year periods down into five separate one-year periods in order to find the funds which do consistently well. If you give each of those one-year periods an equal weighting in your analysis (as we do in our retail guide*), you improve the odds. That gives you a one in three chance of picking a fund which will be in the top quarter in future. Our actual selection method is weighted towards the last three years. To get through our screen, a fund has to have an average percentile of 37.5 or better, with the later years counting more. Q. Once a fund gets through the initial screen, what then? A. We divide funds into A, AA and AAA. The statistical analysis accounts for 40 per cent of the overall rating. Our assessment of the fund manager carries 30 per cent. The fund management group and team account for the remainder. Q. What are you trying to find out about the manager? A. First and foremost, whether it was luck or judgment that produced the good performance. Was it produced responsibly? Was it produced by a high-risk strategy or a low-risk strategy? What types of company was he buying and what was his buying like? Has he done serious research - either himself, or using his house analysts or stockbrokers' analysts? Has he satisfied himself of the security of the company he is buying before he buys it - or is he just buying on the basis that it looks good and the story sounds good? But the manager is only part of the management group. We also look at the resources, disciplines and the investment process. Is it a disciplined process or ad hoc? If, in two or three weeks' time, somebody says to him: 'Why did you buy that', will he know? Q. You prefer a disciplined process? A. We find it works best. There will be a structure - a top down process. Currency, politics, economics, what impact that has on the economy, on sectors and the types of companies which will do well. Q. But I thought that Fidelity, for instance, tended to work from the bottom up: identify a company and then try to find reasons why you are allowed to buy it. A. Yes indeed, and Templeton's the same. Mark Mobius, their emerging markets specialist, is rigorous in his defence of the bottom up approach. We have run numbers over a full market cycle of top down versus bottom up, and find that each tends to do better in one part of the cycle. The bottom up approach does better at the end of the cycle. Q. So, should investors switch from one fund manager to another as the cycle progresses? A. If the investor has got the ability to detect when in the market cycle it is right to make that kind of switch. But we encourage investors to take a long-term view and back a particular approach for the full cycle. Q. And do you prefer fund managers to take a long-term view, too, or can they act as traders? A. In 25 years in the business, I have not met any consistently successful traders. So, I am a little suspicious of trading activity for the sake of trading activity. But there are certainly times in the market cycle when it is appropriate. Say, at the extremes of the market cycle. But remember, it is possible for someone to invest for the long term and still end up with a portfolio turnover of 100 or 200 per cent because things happened more quickly than he expected and he had to respond to events. That's quite understandable, particularly in the current market environment where you've got massive volatility, a lot of it now induced by derivatives and by people who are not really investors. Q. Soros &amp; co? A. No, they are investors. But there are a lot of people on the fringes who are going in with very sophisticated quantitative models to exploit anomalies created by investors. Q. Does unusually high turnover normally produce a poor performance? A. We've done some work on that, and it showed very little correlation between high turnover and poor performance. Q. How does the size of a fund affect its performance? A. A fund has to have critical mass. It doesn't matter how good the fund manager is, if you've got a 9 or 10 per cent expense ratio against you every year, it quickly moves you down the performance scale. But the paradox is that, at the other end of the scale, a fund can get too big so that it ceases to perform well. Take Fidelity's Magellan fund in America, now worth Dollars 30bn. Its performance now is not what it was in 1980 when it was a Dollars 200m fund. Q. So, what size will allow a fund to perform well? A. Where a fund manager has reasonable flexibility to trade, whatever he decides is his unit of size. Say it's a Pounds 300m fund and he wants to invest in units of, say, 2 per cent: ie, 50 holdings of Pounds 6m apiece. He needs to be aware of how long it will take him to buy - or sell - that unit. Obviously, if it's a blue chip stock, it's going to be easy; but if it's a mid-cap stock, it might take him a bit of time. But size as such doesn't frighten us. Look at Perpetual or Schroders, both of which have seen massive increases in funds under management over the past two to three years. We feel comfortable about both. What we ask ourselves is whether the fund's size is now such that it can't replicate its past performance. Q. So, are you saying that it is hard to perform at either Pounds 5m or Pounds 1bn. A. Actually, at Pounds 5m you can get some good performances. But when we see a Pounds 5m fund with a good performance, we ask ourselves how much of that superior performance is due to the smallness of the fund. Was it being piggy-backed by bigger funds in the group? Were all the new issues being poured into this fund? Q. Are there any pointers the investor can usefully consider when looking at new launches? The fund management group or the fund manager himself, for instance? A. Definitely. Has the fund manager got relevant experience. Is he a greenhorn straight out of university or the analysts' department? One of the times to watch out is when a particular segment of the stock market suddenly becomes fashionable. And a group with no previous expertise in that field decides it has to launch a fund, and it doesn't matter who manages it. That doesn't always work] Emerging markets have been a classic over the past few years. Q. What are the signs of a bad fund manager? A. Someone without discipline, and without a thorough investment process. Anybody who has not read Galbraith's The Great Crash. *The Unit Trust Analysis Guide, Pounds 162 a year. Telephone 071-404 4233 In the chart, the higher the consistency ratio, the better the fund's performance as measured by its consistency relative to its competitors.</p>

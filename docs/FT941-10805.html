			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / More help urged for bright pupils Bright children must be given more help in school to score even higher marks, Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, said yesterday. He said teachers must ensure that all pupils, including the brightest, are set challenging work, and one teacher in each school should be given responsibility for co-ordinating provision for gifted children. Schools must have a clear and coherent policy, set out in the school prospectus, explaining how they intend to identify exceptional ability, he added. A report published by the Department for Education was being sent to schools and colleges.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: Telephone numbers Sir, In quoting from my recent analysis of the distribution of telephone numbers in the UK Hugo Dixon (Technology, May 22) omits to mention that the figures are simply computer projections. Nevertheless I have good reason to believe that both the projected figures, and the unmistakeable trend they display, are sufficiently close to the true situation for them to be valid for the purpose of analysis. Should BT consider that any of those projected figures are in any way misleading, it is always open to it to produce the true figures in support of its case.

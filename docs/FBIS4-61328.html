			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 04, BNS -- All political forces in the  Lithuanian parliament agree that the value-added tax, which came  in to effect May 1 replacing the general excise tax, is  necessary, members of the parliament's Budget and Finance  Committee told reporters Wednesday [4 May].    The overall price increase should reach around 7 to 9  percent, and although prices for some goods will go even higher,  more than half of all prices should remain the same, said social  democrat Audrius Rudys.    Rimantas Stanikunas, head of the State Prices and  Competition  Service, said higher bread prices, which should go up by around  20 percent, will be the worst experience for consumers. He said  the service and bakeries in Vilnius will try to keep bread  prices as low as possible.    Members of the Budget and Finance Committee, all of whom  represent different political parties, said prices should jump  only once. In their words, some store owners may use the  opportunity to inflate prices. But the competition service said  it will take strict measures against enterprises which will  ungroundedly increase state-controlled prices. The lawmakers  said all other prices should be regulated by the market.    Rudys said the price increase is "the price to be paid for  proper order in the tax system." He said producers and sellers  will avoid non-registered payers of the value-added tax.  Besides, the lawmaker said, the new tax will also help collect  other taxes which are now concealed.    Rudys noted, however, that not enough effort was made to  explain the essence of the new tax to the public, while  explanatory work usually takes more than a year in other  countries.    The new tax is expected to increase budget receipts by 2 to  3  percent. Lithuania's 18-percent tax is smaller than in a  majority of European countries where the value-added tax is 18  to 21 percent, and as much as 25 percent in Denmark.</p>

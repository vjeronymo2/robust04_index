			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "News Review" column: "Adams and the </F> Alliance"]    [Text] The disgraceful decision by President Clinton to  grant a visa to one of the world's leading terrorists (whose  public front is to pose as the IRA's peace-loving political  apologist, a propaganda act of Orwellian proportions swallowed  enthusiastically by gullible American journalists) is only a  blip in the never-ending story of the Ulster troubles. But it  speaks volumes for the manner in which Mr Clinton chooses to  conduct American foreign policy and the sorry consequences it  has had for the Anglo-American relationship.    The president was advised by his secretary of state, his  attorney general, his ambassador in London, his consulate in  Belfast and even by the director of the FBI that there should be  no visa for a man who talks peace but practices terror. Mr  Clinton chose to overrule them on the pretext that Mr Adams'  visit would help the peace process (though quite how it was to  be furthered by allowing the greatest obstacle to peace to  grandstand, largely unchallenged, for 48 hours on America's  airwaves was never explained). This was a shamefaced deceit:  the president already knew from his own intelligence reports  that Mr Adams has no intention of signing up to the Anglo-Irish  peace accord. But Mr Clinton had the Irish-American lobby to  assuage.    Some 40 members of Congress, including two of its most  powerful senators from the Irish lobby, Edward Kennedy and  Patrick Moynihan, wanted Mr Adams in and Mr Clinton needs their  votes for his current political priority, his controversial  healthcare reforms (Mr Moynihan has been a critic of the reforms  and, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is in a key  position to thwart them). So, for the sake of domestic  political advantage, the president opened the gate.  Presidential aides even coached Mr Adams on the weasel words of  peace he should mouth to give the president cover for his  shameful decision. The fact that it meant slighting America's  closest ally and plunging the special relationship into its  worst crisis since Suez counted for nought.    The harsh fact for Britain is that in Mr Clinton's  Washington  that relationship does indeed increasingly count for nothing.  This is an administration which, when it thinks of foreign  policy (and that it does rarely), thinks of Asia. It does so  because its foreign policy objectives are almost entirely  conditioned by its domestic agenda. Candidate Clinton summed up  his domestic priority with these watchwords: "The economy,  stupid." Today, Japan is the yardstick by which America judges  its economic success. The central thrust of Mr Clinton's  international economic policy is at the heart of his foreign  policy. He wants to open up the burgeoning markets of the  Pacific Rim, particularly Japan, to American products, services  and investment. Foreign policy is as much about job creation  for Mr Clinton as it is about diplomacy. He thinks a lot about  the economic opportunities for America in Japan, China, South  Korea and Vietnam; he thinks very little about Europe -- and  almost not at all about Britain.    This is bad news for Europe because so many of the foreign  policy challenges it faces, such as Bosnia and Russia, cry out  for the leadership of an involved, confident American president.  But Mr Clinton is not interested. It is particularly bad news  for Britain. As the European country closest to the United  States we have the most to lose from American disengagement. It  is a plight made all the worse by personal rancour between  Downing Street and the White House. It still rankles with Mr  Clinton that Conservative Central Office worked with the Bush  campaign during the 1992 election; and there is no forgiveness  from the president or some of his closest advisers that the Home  Office, at the behest of the Bush campaign, searched its files  for the time Mr Clinton was at Oxford to see if there was  anything juicy (there wasn't). "Bill Clinton does not have a  great fondness for John Major," a senior presidential aide told  THE SUNDAY TIMES this week, with evident understatement. A  White House foreign policy adviser was more blunt: "Clinton  hates Major."    It was perhaps inevitable that there would be some cooling  of  the special relationship after Margaret Thatcher, who was a  towering world figure and enjoyed especially close relations  with Ronald Reagan and George Bush. It is inconceivable, for  example, that Mr Adams would have won his visa during the  Thatcher years. "The departure of Thatcher means that Britain is  less on the American mind these days," says one senior White  House official. "She was consulted on almost everything.  Clinton does not really care what Major thinks, and never  thinks of asking him. Major had to struggle to get a 10-minute  bilateral meeting with the president at the NATO summit." The  White House is also well aware that Mr Major is a prime minister  in deep domestic trouble, which only adds to his lack of clout  in Washington.    Mr Major's particular problems in Washington, however, only  give personal edge to greater forces that are pulling Mr  Clinton's America away from Europe. It is, perhaps, inevitable  that any American president, with the end of the cold war, would  want to look east, where economic growth is often in double  digits and growing affluence has created a gigantic market of  several billion new consumers, rather than a sclerotic Europe,  self-absorbed with its own problems, such as Maastricht and the  European exchange-rate mechanism (unintelligible to most  Enropeans, never mind Americans), and wallowing in a recession  which has only reinforced the American view that, on the brink  of the new information age, Europe is in the dark ages.    Of course, long-standing transatlantic ties cannot be undone  overnight. America and Europe are not about to cast each other  adrift. The Anglo-American relationship may be less than  special these days, but both countries remain bound by cultural,  economic, intelligence and nuclear ties; and events could easily  reverse Mr Clinton's eastward-looking strategy. There is at  least an even chance within the next few years of a more  authoritarian regime in Moscow, which would make the security of  East Europe less secure; and there is the probability of serious  strife between Russia and the Ukraine. Either would force  Washington to look to Europe once more as the frontline of its  national security, and breathe new life into the Atlantic  alliance. In the meantime, Britain's politicians would be best  employed giving some thought to where exactly this country's  future lies, in a world in which the special relationship has  diminished, but close relations with a Maastricht-style Europe  are still suspect.</p>

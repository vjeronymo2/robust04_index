			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and Yevgeniy </F> Sovetskiy]    [Text] Tuva, 15 Jun -- The Russian president today arrived  in Kyzyl, the capita of Tuva, from Blagoveshchensk, and has  called for Russia's economic and social problems to be solved by  the combined efforts of the center and the regions.    Before meeting Boris Yeltsin, Kaadyr-ool Bichelday, chairman  of the Tuva Republic's parliament, told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that the local authorities and population expect  understanding of the region's special character to be shown  during the visit. The leaders are counting on the president  helping to solve the republic's transport problems. "If life in  Tuva used to be dependent on vehicle wheels, then that has now  changed to steamship propellers, since the use of wheels would  mean doubling the costs of cargo transportation," Kaadyr-ool  Bicheldey said.    Bicheldey sees Yeltsin's visit to the republic as a  continuation of the policy of passing control over both the  economy and politics from the state to the regions. Here, the  parliamentary chairman described the existing contradictions  between the constitutions of Russia and Tuva as "a matter to be  agreed upon."</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (7): Small but powerful grouping - The Keidanren has an influential role in corporate life AT THE apex of Japanese corporate life stands the Keidanren, which is sometimes erroneously understood in the west to be the country's largest business grouping. It is, in fact, remarkably small, representing only some 900 companies - but they are 900 of the biggest, and its influence is immeasurable. Its budget is some Y3bn a year, less than a third of that for the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce alone - that organisation is part of the Japan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which represents 1.5m mainly small firms. The Keidanren, or Japan federation of economic organisations, has proved adaptable over its 47-year life, but it has three main enduring functions. To lobby government and the bureaucracy on behalf of big business. It has recently been pressing for measures to ease industry's plight as Japan enters recession and the high yen hurts export earnings. Some help then came in a Y6,150bn economic stimulus package unveiled by the new government this month. To tell big business what government and the bureaucracy is thinking. In recent years the Keidanren has been one main conduit, along with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, through which exporters have been prevailed on to restrain their drive for market share in particular sectors abroad, such as cars in Europe, and to open their component purchasing to foreign products, such as US semiconductors. It has also pressed the case among companies for greater environmental awareness. To represent the interests of Japanese business abroad. In recent years the organisation has scaled back its often unwieldy fact-finding tours and given its overseas missions more focus. To act as 'link-man' when disaster strikes. The bankruptcy of a company which is listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange is a rare and unsettling event. In order to calm investors' fears, the organisation at such times becomes a facilitator in a merger whereby a stronger group will bail out the stricken company. Jobs are thereby also preserved. Until this summer, the Keidanren had a fifth role, as collecting agent for corporate contributions to political parties, the vast bulk of which - some Y13bn a year - went to the Liberal Democratic party. But when the LDP lost power following a general election in July, in which the receipt by politicians of tainted funds was a core issue, the federation announced that it would stop this practice. The move marked the end of an era for the Keidanren, which was formed in 1946 in the first year of the US post-war occupation of Japan. Washington among other things wanted to dismember the zaibatsu, the close-knit families of companies which had oiled the military machine. The Keidanren participated in the emergence instead of the keiretsu, an only modestly looser arrangement of interlocking minority shareholdings which binds loyalties within a group - comprising, say, a bank, an insurance company, a chemical manufacturer, an engineering company and others - to the present day. And, within a decade, it had also become a key political player, presiding over the founding of what Japanese call the '1955 system' of politics which broke down only with this summer's election. In that year, the trade unions were in the ascendant, and the left and right wings of the Socialist movement came together in parliament and threatened to establish a lasting majority. The Keidanren acted as marriage broker to unite the then separate Liberal and Democratic parties into a conservative bloc which was to rule Japan for 38 years. The corruption scandals which eventually brought down the LDP were not just a feature of the 1990s, but emerged recurrently from its early years in power. The Keidanren adopted its role as funding conduit after an outcry of public distaste during one election in which companies each endorsed a particular local LDP candidate, for whom their workforce in many cases came under pressure to vote. But following a series of defections from the LDP's parliamentary ranks which started last year, there emerged a choice of centre-right parties. As Mr Kazuo Nukazawa, a Keidanren managing director, puts it: 'We helped the LDP because it was the only party which upheld free enterprise. Now there are others.' Severing the financial tie with the LDP has helped the Keidanren, which until now specified what each company or industry association should pay the party, secure the ear of the new seven-party coalition government. Notably, Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, its chairman, was appointed by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, to head an advisory panel charged with finding ways to promote deregulation and streamline the often burdensome administrative system. The government has made a start on deregulation, producing a list of nearly 100 bureaucratic requirements or prohibitions which it says will go. But if the panel comes up with wider-ranging proposals and the internally divided coalition succeeds in getting them enacted, the private sector may have in prospect a new age of flexibility which could enhance profits. Large retailers, for example, may be freed to open stores where consumer markets warrant an outlet without having to spend years seeking ministerial sanction in the face of opposition from small shopkeepers nearby. Deregulation has long been a Keidanren goal, but now it has a following wind. Many changes will be sternly resisted among ministry officials concerned with holding on to administrative power. But if the measures pass  -and under the LDP previous similar initiatives were prone to run into the sand - the hope exists that corruption may be further curbed. Mr Nukazawa points out: 'Bureaucrats said over the years: 'If you want to start any sort of business, come to me at night with a weighty fruit basket,' ' Bureaucrats and politicians in regional, as well as national government, were also frequently on the take, and a construction company wanting to develop a commercial site or win a share in a public sector contract would know that a bunch of grapes and a few well-polished apples would not be enough. Court cases involve allegations of bagfuls of cash being slid under restaurant tables. Money which came through the Keidanren went to party central funds, rather than as backhanders to individual politicians, and was openly accounted for. None the less, the system helped preserve a culture of mutual dependence, an umbrella under which greater sums changed hands in a less transparent fashion. Some groups, such as the commercial banks from which the LDP has outstanding loans, have said they will continue to make direct donations to the party - if only to help get these off their books. The banking sector was the biggest declared donor to the party, providing some Y2bn a year. But however modest the amounts, corporate profitability will not be hurt by the fact that Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house, need no longer feel obliged to make annual political contributions of Y62.4m; also Nippon Steel, Y75m; and Nippon Life Insurance, Y60.8m. In the third year of economic downturn, Japanese companies can ensure the money is better spent.</p>

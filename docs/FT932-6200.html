			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Thatcherite lashes out after sacking MR JOHN MAJOR'S attempts to promote loyalist Tory MPs in his reshuffle of the ministerial ranks below the cabinet provoked a backlash from a rightwing victim yesterday. Mr Edward Leigh, the Thatcherite junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry until Thursday, said he had been sacked because of his widely known opposition to government policies, particularly over the Maastricht treaty. With Tory Euro-sceptics eager to find new champions, Mr Leigh warned the prime minister: 'He (Mr Major) obviously feels that I argued my corner too strongly within government and I will have to argue it even more strongly from the backbenches.' Mr Leigh predicted on BBC radio that Mr Norman Lamont might also 'argue his corner very forcefully from the backbenches'. The prime minister has brought other right wingers into the government, perhaps to compensate for Mr Leigh's exit. Mr Iain Sproat, a close ally of Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher until he lost his Aberdeen South seat in 1983, becomes deputy to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary. Mr Sproat won the Harwich seat in last year's general election. Mr Michael Brown, the right-wing MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, has joined the whips' office. Some Conservatives regret Mr Major did not make more radical changes. But in Northern Ireland there was cynicism among local politicians at Mr Major's decision to move Mr Jeremy Hanley from his job as junior minister with responsibility for political talks to the Ministry of Defence. Mr Hanley's replacement is Mr Michael Ancram, the aristocratic Roman Catholic Conservative MP for Devizes - another former MP who re-entered at the last election. Although his Catholicism should not be any handicap, the nuances of Ulster's politics will have to be mastered swiftly if the government is to re-start talks soon. A more prominent theme has been the preference given to loyal supporters of Mr Major. Backbenchers joining the government include the moderate but astute Mr John Bowis, MP for Battersea, who joins the Department of Health. Among those promoted were Mr Timothy Yeo, who as MP for Suffolk South is part of the 'East Anglia Mafia' that increasingly dominates the cabinet, including Mr John Gummer, Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr John MacGregor and Mr Major himself. Those criticising Mr Major for not going further in reshaping the government included Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the normally loyal Tory MP for Leominster. In further attempts to soothe wounds, Mr William Hague, the former parliamentary private secretary to Mr Lamont, was appointed a junior minister at the health department.</p>

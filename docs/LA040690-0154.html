			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLAYER OF 2 TEEN-AGERS HAS LIFE SPARED BY JURY  </P> <P> An Orange County jury Thursday decided against a death verdict for gang member  Mario Tirado, convicted of murdering two teen-agers on bicycles, and voted  instead that he be sentenced to life in prison without parole.  </P> <P> Tirado reacted to the verdict with a slight smile and got a pat on the shoulder  from his attorneys. But members of his family -- many of whom traveled almost  2,000 miles from their home in Vista Hermosa, Mexico -- sobbed openly in  relief. Tirado's grandmother, Guadalupe Cortez, had to be helped from the  courtroom.  </P> <P> "We are thankful to God that Mario does not have to die," said Anna Leal, one  of his sisters.  </P> <P> The jurors, who had convicted Tirado last month, took a day and a half to  decide his penalty.  </P> <P> If jurors had chosen death, Tirado, at age 21, would have been the youngest  person ever sent to Death Row from Orange County since the state restored  capital punishment 12 years ago. Tirado was convicted of first-degree murder  after a four-month trial for the Oct. 30, 1987, shooting deaths of Enrique  Arceo, 13, and Jesus Perez, 17. They were returning from a church carnival on  bicycles with several others, witnesses said, when Tirado opened fire in a  drive-by shooting. Tirado was also convicted of six attempted murders,  including other victims in that incident and several from a shooting incident  earlier that day.  </P> <P> A witness who had been in the car with Tirado testified that he, Tirado and  Patrick McCauley, 24, the driver -- all from different branches of the F-Troop  gang -- were out searching for Lopers, members of a rival gang, because of  friction between the gangs a few weeks earlier. The two teen-age victims were  known to be associated with the Lopers.  </P> <P> The jurors were hung 11 to 1 in favor of a first-degree murder conviction on  McCauley, who will be retried. Prosecutors had not asked for the death penalty  in his case. The same jurors found Tirado guilty, plus special circumstances of  double murder, which allowed prosecutors to seek a death verdict against him.  </P> <P> The jurors were limited to two choices. Thursday, after they decided on the  lesser sentence of life without parole, most of them declined to discuss their  decision.  </P> <P> But one juror, Loyd Kilby of Mission Viejo, said the majority of them thought  that "this just wasn't the right case for the death penalty."  </P> <P> "I believe very firmly in the death penalty," Kilby said, "but this kid had no  prior record; he just isn't one of the monsters I think should go to the gas  chamber."  </P> <P> Some of the jurors indicated to the lawyers involved that Tirado's youth -- he  was just 18 when the shootings occurred -- was a big factor in deciding on the  lesser penalty. But Otha Standifer III, one of Tirado's attorneys, said he is  convinced that Tirado's religious conversion since the shootings, which was a  major part of the defense during the penalty phase of the trial, made the  difference.  </P> <P> "Mario has changed; he's more mature, with better moral judgment," Standifer  said. "It would have been absolutely unnecessary for him to be sent to the gas  chamber."  </P> <P> The defense presented more than 30 witnesses during the penalty phase -- 14 of  them from Mexico.  </P> <P> Nearly a dozen of Tirado's relatives sat outside in the hallway for two days  awaiting the jury verdict.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton appeared only mildly disappointed at  the outcome.  </P> <P> "This case was strictly a jury call," he said. "We thought the crime was  serious enough that we should present the death penalty as something for them  to consider. But I have no problems with their decision. They were an extremely  conscientious group of jurors."  </P> <P> Defense attorney Standifer said the jurors wanted to know afterward if there  was a chance Tirado might be freed from prison someday. The law does have  provisions for a governor to reduce a life-without-parole sentence. But no one  has yet been in prison long enough under a life-without-parole sentence to have  the provisions tested.  </P> <P> Absent from the courtroom throughout the trial, and during the reading of  Thursday's verdict, were members of the two victims' families.  </P> <P> "This is not all that unusual during gang cases," Middleton said. "We had a lot  of F-Troop gang members in here during this trial. The fear of retaliation is  very real to these folks."  </P></p>

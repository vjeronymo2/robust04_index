			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Latinos and blacks continue to suffer housing discrimination in the north and  central Fresno areas, according to a study by the Community Housing Leadership  Board. The board said half the property managers contacted during test visits  by a dozen university students posing as renters displayed some form of unfair  discrimination. Latinos and blacks often were quoted higher rents than whites  and sometimes were told no apartments were available on the same day whites  were told apartments were available, the board said.  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Poland acts on copyright abuse Poland cracked down on copyright abuse yesterday by implementing a law intended to end video and music piracy and strengthen intellectual property rights, Reuter reports from Warsaw. The law, passed by parliament in February and taking effect after a three-month grace period, is intended to end piracy which costs the state treasury millions of dollars a year, and bring Polish laws in line with international norms. Polish artists welcomed the new law but said its efficacy would largely depend on how well it was enforced. The new legislation replaces a weak and outdated 1952 copyright law under which the police's ability to make arrests was limited. A part of the law governing computer piracy went into effect immediately after it was passed in February. The weakness of the old law helped music, video and computer piracy flourish after communist rule ended in 1989, flooding the streets with hawkers of cheap cassettes. It was also a discouragement for some foreign investors. The IFPI estimated that the state treasury lost a minimum of Dollars 25m in 1991 and probably much more in 1992 to music pirates alone and official producers lost three times as much. Computer software is dominated by pirated programmes. Those losses should be quickly reduced, experts say, and prices of official recordings are not expected to rise much as a result of the new law.</p>

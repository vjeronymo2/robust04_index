			<p>BFN     [Text] The commerce minister has refuted the opposition's  allegation that the government has compromised on the  sovereignty of the nation by signing the GATT agreement at  Marrakesh.    Giving clarifications on the statements regarding the  Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations in Rajya Sabha  today, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee asserted that the interest of the  farmers and workers will not be affected by this treaty. Not  satisfied with his clarification, almost the entire opposition  staged a walkout, alleging that the government has bartered away  the interests of the nation by signing the treaty.    Refuting the charges of the opposition that most of the  foreign investment has come into the consumer sector, he said 90  percent of the investment has been made into the core sector.  Denying the charges that the center did not consult the chief  ministers before signing the accord, he said he had talks with  several chief ministers, including some of the non-Congress-I  governments.</p>

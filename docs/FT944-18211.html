			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / German Elections: SPD rivals form a troika to beat Kohl - Teaming up has halted the slump in the party's fortunes It may yet prove to have been the best thing Rudolf Scharping did in his long, hard campaign to defeat Helmut Kohl and become the next German chancellor. At the end of the summer, with his popularity slipping, and his Social Democratic party falling ever further behind in the polls, the SPD leader swallowed his pride, abandoned hope of challenging the chancellor on his own, and summoned his two arch-rivals in the party to help. Oskar Lafontaine, the impish and irrepressible premier of the Saarland, on the Franco-German frontier, was already in the campaign team, but not in the front line. Gerhard Schroder, the smooth-talking and ambitious premier of Lower Saxony, was sulking in his capital of Hanover, making little secret of his intention to stay there until the election was lost. All three men, known as the 'grandsons' of the late Mr Willy Brandt, the SPD chancellor, openly competed to inherit the mantle of party leadership and continued to disagree on the best way of unseating Mr Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union. Today the three are operating as a team. This has breathed new life into a flagging campaign and with less than two weeks to polling day, the result is still wide open. It was a day in mid-August, after another gloomy meeting of the party's national executive in Bonn, that Mr Scharping took Mr Schroder to one side and made him an offer he could not refuse. He would give him a super-ministry - industry, transport and energy all rolled into one - in the future federal government, if he would come back into the fight, Mr Scharping said. And it would be three against one - Scharping, Schroder and Lafontaine against the immovable Kohl, he promised. It took Mr Schroder just a couple of days to decide, with a little help from Mr Lafontaine. It was time the three dedicated rivals, all career politicians since their days as Young Socialist leaders in the early 1970s, buried their differences and came to the aid of the party, he said. Within days, the SPD head office was rushing out 150,000 copies of a new election poster: the grinning threesome shoulder-to-shoulder, with a one-word caption, Stark (Strong). It is a simple message, but ever since then, the slump in the SPD's fortunes seems to have stopped. Mr Kohl, whose own campaign poster has no words on it at all, has at last got a fight on his hands. Last week the SPD troika came together on a platform in Frankfurt's Romerberg, outside the medieval town hall, to demonstrate their new-found solidarity. They still strike a pretty strange contrast side-by-side. Tall and austere, the bearded Mr Scharping stands with his arms sternly folded across his chest, a fixed smile on his face. He never seems able entirely to relax, gearing himself up for the next encounter. He lectures the crowds like a headmaster, full of moral duty, facts and figures. Mr Schroder is quite the opposite. Deliberately casual in smart, double-breasted suits and pastel-coloured shirt, he sticks his hands in his pockets, and chats easily with the crowd. He delights in hecklers from the back row, speaks off the cuff, and obviously revels in the television lights. Mr Lafontaine is different again. Short and plump, he's a punchy, aggressive orator, the best the party has got, mixing wisecracks with political punch-lines. His one weakness is that he cannot forget his own defeat at the last election, when he was the chancellor-candidate, and misread the mood of the electorate in favour of unification. He still spends too much time justifying his insistence that unification would cost too much - and denouncing Mr Kohl for pretending that it could be paid for without increased taxation. Their messages at least are complementary. Mr Schroder hammers home his record as a saviour of jobs in Lower Saxony, where he has openly pumped public funds into loss-making enterprises, such as Deutsche Aerospace's Lemwerder plant, to keep the workers busy. 'It is far better to save jobs than pay unemployment benefit,' he insists. It is what he plans to go on doing if he gets that super-ministry. Then it is Mr Lafontaine's turn to denounce the spendthrift ways of the current coalition and demonstrate that his own tax plans are both fairer and more responsible. Eighty per cent of taxpayers will pay less, he says, and just 20 per cent will pay more, to bear the burden of unification which he warned about before. Both pledge their loyalty to the official chancellor-candidate, although few doubt that each believes he could have done the job better. And then it is up to Mr Scharping himself to give the crowd a vision of the fairer, more prosperous world that the SPD can offer, with the promise of more jobs, at no more expense. He still finds it hard work to be exciting, preaching down from the pulpit, following a text he appears to have learned by heart. But he can leave the rhetorical flashes to his erstwhile rivals. His great achievement is that he has bound them in to his election team. That means, if they win, they will all share the credit. And if they lose, they will all share the blame.</p>

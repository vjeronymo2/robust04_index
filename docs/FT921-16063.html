			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Technology: Confessions of a magazine junkie - Technically Speaking I have a confession to make. I am a computer magazine addict. Fortunately for me, if not my bank manager, publishers seem hell bent on satisfying my craving. At the latest count my local WH Smith had no less than 39 computer magazines on its shelves including 10 samples of what I describe as the PC generic magazines which cover the IBM PC compatible market. By a rough calculation to buy all 10 generic titles each month would cost Pounds 16.93 or Pounds 203.16 a year - or about half the cost of a basic Amstrad PC. Indeed the most blindingly obvious trend played out in the advertising pages of the computer press is the inexorable decline in PC hardware prices and the parallel surge in performance. If you bought a PC a year ago you could now either buy the same for half the price or get twice the performance and speed for the same price. What passed a year ago for an acceptable entry-level machine, say a computer based on Intel's 80286 chip running at 12Mhz with 1 megabyte of Ram and a 20Mb hard disc, now looks sluggish and small. However, although hardware prices are plunging, they are not falling by as much as most manufacturers/assemblers in the computer magazines' advertising pages would have us all believe. Computer manufacturers insist on advertising their products exclusive of Value Added Tax. Thus what appears to be a system costing Pounds 1,500 will actually cost Pounds 1,762.5 for customers except those - like businesses - who can reclaim the Vat. There are one or two honourable exceptions, like mail order supplier Eversham Micros, which list both the Vat exclusive and inclusive prices, but most advertisers appear determined to disguise if not mislead. Often the words 'plus Vat' only appear in the small type at the foot of the page. Perhaps there is nothing to be done about such sales tactics. However there seems little excuse for computer magazines which perpetuate such myths by quoting Vat exclusive prices in their editorial copy. One example among many comes from the December PC Plus. An article entitled 'How Much Power Can Pounds 1,500 Buy?' proceeds to list and evaluate 11 machines with nominal price tags of less than Pounds 1,500. However, once Vat is added on all but one of the machines would cost more than Pounds 1,500, and the magazine's 'recommended' system, the Elonex PC-420X, would cost Pounds 1,733.12 in the configuration tested. An annoying feature of PC advertising is a growing tendency to strip what is on offer down to the minimum specification. Some advertisers claim this is to give the buyer the maximum choice, assuming that they want, or have the patience, to plough through columns of figures and options to 'build' a working system. A cynic might argue such tricks are actually designed to make the 'headline' price seem as small as possible. Some manufacturers advertise PC systems 'from Pounds X'. Often this price does not include a screen or a hard disc - without which the machine is functionally useless - let alone sufficient power and storage for today's software. Some magazines make an attempt to overcome price comparison problems by specifying 'standard' or 'target' systems in their listings, usually at the back of the magazine. But these listings, helpful though they are, can have drawbacks. Because prices and specifications are changing so quickly, they are often out of date by the time the magazine is printed, and they do not always include cheaper machines assembled by smaller direct sales companies. Deciding which PC to buy based on advertisments in the computer press is a difficult business - but 'window shopping' through the pages can still be a useful experience.</p>

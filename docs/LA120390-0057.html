			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: PERSONALITY CLASH BLAMED IN CHANNEL  39 RESIGNATION  </P> <P> KNSD-TV (Channel 39) employees learned of the sudden departure of News Director  Don Shafer early Thursday, when a terse memo from General Manager Neil Derrough  was posted in the newsroom.  </P> <P> "Let's just say more than a few jaws dropped to the floor," said one newsroom  source, who asked to remain anonymous.  </P> <P> Shafer made both friends and enemies during his 18-month tenure, but few  suspected his job was in jeopardy. Although the memo said Shafer had left  voluntarily, in an interview Thursday, Shafer confirmed that he had been asked  to resign.  </P> <P> In the newsroom, speculation immediately centered on Shafer's relationship with  Derrough. Neither Derrough nor Shafer wanted to comment on specifics, but  Shafer did say, "You have to get along with your boss."  </P> <P> There is little doubt that Shafer and Derrough agreed on general philosophy --  the hard-news emphasis that Shafer brought to the newscasts -- but they are  vastly different in terms of personal style.  </P> <P> "Derrough is an uptown, New York City kind of guy and Shafer is not," said one  newsroom source.  </P> <P> With the situation at Channel 39 once again tense, to say the least, newsroom  personnel interviewed for this story did not want to be quoted by name. But  they made it clear that Derrough simply didn't mesh with Shafer, the veteran  news director he hired to give the station a new direction.  </P> <P> Within the industry, Shafer was largely perceived as a hatchet man when he  first arrived at Channel 39 from KOLD-TV, the CBS affiliate in Tucson. A  well-traveled veteran of the industry with a background in law enforcement,  Shafer revamped the newsroom, firing several longtime reporters, such as Cathy  Clark and John Britton.  </P> <P> Shafer also brought a serious news focus to the station, particularly  emphasizing "cops and robbers" news. He gave Paul Bloom leeway for his  oft-criticized "Crime Watch" segments, as well as allowing sinced-departed  reporter Bill Ritter freedom to pursue an array of topics.  </P> <P> Although many in the newsroom were wary of Shafer's often abrasive style, a  large contingent also respected his news judgment and the stability he brought.  </P> <P> A large man with an often gruff manner, Shafer spent 20 years working within  the slick and competitive corporate structure of CBS.  </P> <P> "Don has a huge bark to him, but he is kind of a big puppy," said one source.  "The toughness he brought to the newsroom just melted around Neil."  </P> <P> Derrough emphasizes meetings and communication among staffers, neither of which  were Shafer strongpoints, a source said. Shafer's relationship with lead  anchorman Marty Levin also was known to be strained, which certainly didn't  help him.  </P> <P> In the newsroom, it is widely believed that Channel 39's stilted coverage of  the verdict in the Betty Broderick trial two weeks ago was Shafer's death  knell. Channel 39 had made a big deal of the Broderick trial, televising  portions of it live during the sweeps month. But when the hung jury was  announced, Channel 39 seemed unprepared. Its coverage was brief and tentative,  and the station was off the air while the competition was still reporting live  from the courthouse.  </P> <P> The mishaps reportedly were largely due to technical problems, but several  people at the station were upset.  </P> <P> "I know Neil was furious about the Broderick case," said a source. "I think  that was just the final straw."  </P> <P> Derrough downplayed his personal problems with Shafer, saying only that he felt  the newsroom needed someone new to take it to the next level. But he emphasized  that he was in no way interested in changing the station's "straight to you"  news philosophy. And he offered the job to the employee most closely linked to  Shafer, Irv Kass, who has been Shafer's right-hand man for a decade. He worked  with him at several stations before joining him at Channel 39.  </P> <P> Reached Friday, Kass declined to comment, even to say whether or not he had  accepted the job.  </P> <P> "Irv is a much more measured, thoughtful kind of guy" than Shafer, a source  said.  </P> <P> Certainly the timing of Shafer's removal, coming the day after the end of the  most important ratings sweeps month of the year, was no accident. The station  will have a breather before entering the next sweeps period in the spring.  </P> <P> But after an unusual few months of stability, Channel 39 employees now are left  to wonder what is going to happen next. If Kass doesn't take the job, it could  lead to months of turmoil and indecision at a station that has suffered through  both for far too many years.  </P> <P> KNSD-TV (Channel 39) could be excused for prominently using pictures of Charlie  Rose in its November ads for "Personalities." It received word of Rose's  departure from the show too late to change the ads.  </P> <P> But ads during the November sweeps period for "A Current Affair" spotlighted a  huge photo of smarmy anchorman Maury Povich. Povich hasn't been on the show for  weeks, and it's widely known that's he's not coming back.  </P> <P> "I did it on purpose," said Channel 39 promotions director Doug Gilmore. "I  didn't think a picture (of the new anchorwoman) conveyed 'A Current Affair' as  much as Maury."  </P> <P> Two points for honesty.  </P> <P> Channel 8's Larry Himmel says he has received a contract offer from Fox  Television. If he can work out a deal, he would work on a new game show being  developed for the Los Angeles market. He also would have a chance to develop a  "San Diego at Large" type of show. Nothing is definite. Himmel said he might  even be able to take the gig and stay at Channel 8, although it would be  difficult to continue his morning show on KIFM (98.1). His contract with KIFM  expires Jan. 1. . . .  </P> <P> Channel 10 General Manager Ed Quinn and former Channel 8 anchorwoman Allison  Ross recently were spotted having dinner together. Perhaps a little discussion  about a job over appetizers? Not so, says Quinn. "It was more just staying in  touch." . . .  </P> <P> The XTRA-FM (91X) morning team of Jeff Prescott and Mike Berger spent most of a  morning last week doing jokes about flatulence, which pretty well sums up the  current level of their humor. . . .  </P> <P> KUSI-TV (Channel 51) has started to operate like a real local television  station, televising such community events as the Mother Goose Parade and the  San Diego Marathon. . . .  </P> <P> Several TV news operations reported the story of MTV's refusal to air Madonna's  new video by showing clips from the piece, which was considered too racy for  MTV. Channel 10, in particular, registered its disgust by airing lengthy  portions of it.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Safe Partners sold for Dollars 120m to UK's OAG A British investment company jointly owned by Union Bank of Switzerland and Phildrew Ventures has bought Safe Partners, an accommodation rig specialist, from privately-owned companies in Sweden's Stena group for about Dollars 120m. Offshore Accommodation Group described Safe as 'a dynamic, financially-strong, and well-managed group'. Safe Partners, based in Aberdeen, owns five accommodation rigs which are mainly deployed in the North Sea. Last year the group made a pre-tax profit of SKr228m (Dollars 30.4m) on turnover of SKr811m. Celsius, the Swedish defence group, said yesterday it had sold its 40 per cent stake in Safe Partners to a Stena company for Dollars 45m. This gave Stena 100 per cent of the company which it then sold on to OAG.</p>

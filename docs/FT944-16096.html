			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Faro mine revival plan progresses Former managers of Curragh, the collapsed Canadian mining group, are at an advanced stage in raising funds to reopen the Faro lead/zinc mine in the Yukon. If the financing efforts succeed, the group aims to restart stripping at the mine within the next two months. Production of concentrates would begin next autumn. Faro was the third-biggest producer of lead and fifth-biggest of zinc before operations were halted at the end of 1992. Output that year totalled 322,000 tonnes of zinc and 181,000 tonnes of lead concentrate. It still has an estimated life of about 10 years. Mr Robert Granger, a Toronto lawyer who is chairman of Anvil Range, the newly-created company that is trying to revive Faro, said the group was in the final stages of talks with South Korea's Hyundai Group to acquire a stake of just under 31 per cent in Anvil. Another 31 per cent would be held by institutional investors, which are being canvassed to subscribe to a CDollars 25m (Pounds 11.7m) private placement. Anvil aims to conclude this within the next six weeks. It is also in the throes of launching a CDollars 30m public offering of tax-sheltered 'flow-through' shares and silver royalty units. The management group, which bought Faro from Curragh's receivers earlier this year for CDollars 27m, will retain an 8 per cent stake. The managers have been at pains to assure investors that Anvil Range has no connection with Mr Clifford Frame, Curragh's controversial founder. They estimate that, with zinc at 55-65 cents a pound and lead at 28 cents, Faro will generate a positive cash flow, an 'attractive' net present value and a 33 per cent return.</p>

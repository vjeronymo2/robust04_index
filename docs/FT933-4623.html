The proceedings are passionless and rigidly stage-managed. The conference has had its moments though, including one memorably poetic exchange yesterday. Summing up a debate about labour legislation, Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU's national officer in Scotland, ended by quoting from the Mask of Anarchy by Percy Bysshe Shelley: 'Rise like lions after slumber In unvanquishable number - Shake your chains to earth like dew Which in sleep had fallen on you.' But Arthur Scargill, the miners' leader, arguing for more militant opposition to the government's employment legislation, politely pointed out that Airlie had missed the final line of the verse: 'Ye are many - they are few.'

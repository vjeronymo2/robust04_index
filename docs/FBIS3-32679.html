For this reason, President Cristiani does not believe  it will be possible for the United Nations to [words indistinct]  international agreements on this matter.

[Begin Cristiani recording] Our country is no longer within  the same framework [words indistinct] constant supervision. On  the other hand, we believe that it is more than enough [words  indistinct]. [end recording]    President Cristiani also shared the concern expressed  yesterday on "KL Radio News" by General Mauricio Ernesto Vargas.  Gen. Vargas said that some points in the peace agreements are  not being respected by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front [FMLN].    [Begin Cristiani recording] I would like to say that what  creates doubt and unrest is the finding of caches and arsenals  full of weapons that belong to the FMLN. The FMLN has tried to  make the people believe they have surrendered all their weapons  and this is not true. This creates some doubt. People wonder  if they are planning something other than joining the country's  political life. [end recording]    Regarding the replacement of Augusto Ramirez Ocampo,  director  of the UN Observers for El Salvador, President Cristiani said  that he has not been officially advised of the replacement by  the United Nations. However, it has been said that he will be a  Venezuelan.</p>

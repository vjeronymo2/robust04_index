			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed WDN: "Kurdish Leader Kani Yilmaz Denies </F> Triumphant Reports From Ankara"]    [Text] Kani Yilmaz is the representative in Europe of the  National Front for the Liberation of Kurdistan (ERNK), which is  closely linked with the guerrilla movement PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan]. Yesterday [18 May], at a press conference in  Brussels, he denied the triumphant reports released on a  virtually daily basis by the Turkish Government. Not a day goes  by without the official Turkish press agency ANATOLIA reporting  the deaths of dozens of PKK guerrillas. The day before  yesterday [17 May], General Dogan Guces, the commander of the  Turkish Army, told the Turkish newspaper HURRIYET that "the PKK  was eradicated."    "We have recently suffered some severe blows," Yilmaz  admitted, "but on the other hand, the PKK guerrillas have never  had such a flood of young Kurds streaming to join their ranks  and fight the Turkish state."    "However," Yilmaz went on immediately, "the Turkish  Government of Prime Minister Ciller is peddling false victories.  As time goes on, the Turkish Army is daring less and less to  engage in direct confrontation with the guerrillas, and is  consequently switching to wholesale psychological warfare, in  which the Turkish press is playing a key role in spreading  triumphant reports that are manufactured out of thin air. Not  we, but Turkish Prime Minister Ciller will surrender before the  summer is out," Yilmaz predicted. In a detestable war like the  one currently raging in Turkish Kurdistan, where no prying is  tolerated, and where many journalists have lost their lives, it  remains difficult to verify the correctness of any reports.  However, yesterday [18 May] it was Yilmaz's turn to be  absolutely sure: "In the last four months, the Kurdish  guerrillas have suffered 882 losses; 152 PKK fighters have been  wounded, and eight taken prisoner." Yet Yilmaz contrasts these  figures with the losses suffered by the Turks: "2,155 soldiers  and 33 officers have died during the same period, as have 15  leading watchmen (members of the Turkish militia in Kurdistan);  moreover, 482 village watchmen were taken without a struggle. A  total of 884 village watchmen has gone over to the guerrillas."    Yilmaz requested that special attention be paid to the  scorched earth policy currently being implemented by the Turkish  Army in Kurdistan. "In recent weeks, 30,000 Kurds have fled to  northern Iraq as a result," Yilmaz said. "And there, they land  right in the middle of the fight raging between Iraqi Kurdish  parties under the guerrilla leaders Barzani and Talabani, which  have already been shelling each other for weeks," he went on.  According to Yilmaz, "Barzani and Saddam Husayn have joined  forces to suppress the Kurdish people. Turkey has been given  the role of clearing Iraq's name of all guilt. Ankara and  Baghdad are working together closely again in their common fight  against the Kurdish people," Yilmaz said.    Yesterday [18 May], the Kurdish leader reiterated in no  uncertain terms that the Kurdish guerrillas will continue their  attacks on the Turkish economy and hence also on tourism in  Turkey. "We advise foreigners not to come to Turkey. Tourism is  something one does in the pursuit of pleasure, but surely there  can be no pleasure in visiting a country where one people is  killing off another."</p>

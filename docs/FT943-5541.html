			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Bulgaria's 'government of technocrats' to quit: Parliament must resolve crisis, says premier Bulgaria's non-party 'government of technocrats', which has ruled since the end of 1992, said yesterday it had decided to resign. Mr Lyuben Berov, the prime minister, who has been incapacitated for months by a heart attack, said on television that parliament was so hamstrung by contradictory opinions that he believed new elections were the only solution. 'In these circumstances, the government doesn't want to take the responsibility for postponing early elections,' he said. 'Simple political ethics require the government to re-tire. . . and make way for the parliament to resolve. . . the political crisis in the country.' President Zhelyu Zhelev said in a statement that the parliament now must decide whether to call early elections. Parliament may be divided over the wisdom of dissolving parliament and calling early elections. The alternative would be to reshuffle the existing government, possibly under a new prime minister, although the 68-year-old Mr Berov is recovering. The government, which is sustained by the votes of the powerful Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Movement for Rights and Freedom, a largely ethnic Turk party, narrowly won a no-confidence vote in May. There was widespread reluctance to create a political vacuum when Bulgaria was in the midst of complex foreign debt negotiations. But agreement was reached with London Club commercial bank creditors on June 30. The deal provided for a 47 per cent reduction in Bulgaria's hard currency debt of more than Dollars 8bn. The agreement triggered a raft of IMF, World Bank and other loans required to finance the agreement and boost reserves. Recent opinion polls indicate that the BSP, heir to the defunct communist party, would emerge from elections as the largest single party, reflecting a pattern already seen in Poland and Hungary, which returned socialist parties to power earlier this year. But the BSP is internally divided into old-style former communists and western-style social democratic factions and is unenthusiastic about running for elections before resolving its internal conflicts. It is a similar story in the United Democratic Front (UDF), a loose umbrella grouping of over a dozen 'democratic' parties formed after the collapse of Soviet domination. The UDF won the 1991 elections after the socialist party, which took over power from the deposed communist dictator, Mr Todor Zhivkov, was attacked for its close links with the old regime. But the UDF government led by Mr Philip Dimitrov split and lost power a year later. This created a vacuum which President Zhelu Zhelyev, one of the founders of the UDF, filled by appointing the Berov-led government of technocrats which the votes of the BSP helped keep in power. The economy, which was badly hit by the collapse of Comecon markets and the UN trade embargo against neighbouring Serbia, is recovering slowly. Nearly half Bulgaria's foreign trade is now with the west, compared with only 9 per cent four years ago. Reuter adds from Sofia: The chief of staff of the Bulgarian army was replaced yesterday after he opposed a government plan to retire 300 colonels. The cabinet asked President Zhelev, who is supreme commander of the armed forces, to dismiss Lyuben Petrov after a closed session at which it discussed a rift between him and Defence Minister Valentin Alexandrov.</p>

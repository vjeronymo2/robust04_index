			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Midland strengthens profits to Pounds 178m MIDLAND Bank, which was taken over by HSBC Holdings last year, yesterday disclosed a strong rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 178m for 1992 against Pounds 36m for the previous year. Provisions for bad debts fell to Pounds 676m, against Pounds 903m. Midland's capital ratio strengthened to 10.7 per cent on the retention of Pounds 102m after tax and an extraordinary gain of Pounds 26m from the sale of its Thomas Cook travel agent subsidiary. It did not make a dividend payment to HSBC last year. It will add Pounds 242m to HSBC's 1992 profits. This comprises Pounds 89m of pre-tax profits and Pounds 122m of restructuring costs and a Pounds 31m permanent diminution in property values which it took as losses, but which will be charged against HSBC reserves. The commercial banking division made profits of Pounds 138m against a Pounds 50m loss last year. Its provisions fell 31 per cent to Pounds 557m, although those on UK corporate and personal loans rose to Pounds 336m in the second half against Pounds 306m in the first. The merchant banking division, which includes the Samuel Montagu and Greenwell Montague stockbrokers businesses, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33m (from Pounds 34m profit). This was due to a bad debt charge of Pounds 77m, created by a few problem accounts. Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, said the bank was starting to see 'glimmers of light' from increased economic activity. Midland would gain from HSBC's strong capital, he said, and from being able to offer corporate customers access to services such as treasury operations and trade finance in which it had joined forces with HSBC. Midland's Firstdirect telephone banking subsidiary did not achieve an operating profit, because of a high level of spending on advertising. Mr Pearse said he expected the business to enter operating profit this year. Overseas commercial banking operations recorded a loss before exceptional items of Pounds 6m (down from a Pounds 38m profit). Operating income from overseas offices fell 14 per cent to Pounds 277m and there were losses in France and Italy. Profits from foreign exchange trading increased by Pounds 67m helped by volatility following Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Pearse said this was mostly from commission, although the bank had limited positions. Following a property revaluation, the bank charged a Pounds 31m permanent diminution in value to its profit and loss account, and charged to reserves a remaining revaluation of Pounds 99m. The tier 1 ratio strengthened to 5.7 per cent, while the total risk asset ratio rose to 10.7 per cent (from 10.3 per cent). Total assets rose to Pounds 61.3bn (from Pounds 59.8bn) and risk-weighted assets rose slightly to Pounds 41.9bn. Total operating income excluding Thomas Cook's contribution fell marginally to Pounds 2.96bn (from Pounds 2.97bn), while total operating expenses fell to Pounds 2.03bn (from Pounds 2.04bn) and the cost-to-income ratio remained at 68.6 per cent. HSBC's 75p ordinary shares closed 23p up at 624p. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VINELAND' AND VINEGAR  </P> <P> In his review of "Vineland," Frank McConnell alternates between a gee-whiz  talking down to us and an Agnew-like linguisitic shell game.  </P> <P> He actually assumes his readers won't understand the meaning of Vineland and  1984, and throws in gratuitous references to "Astaire" and Thelonious Monk.  </P> <P> . . . Plangent is a weak, ugly and obscure word for plaintive, and why call  politics sclerotic? Sick, maybe, but is sclerosis more political than other  diseases?  </P> <P> Such is the currency of the pseudo-intellectuals -- not real words but marks of  mutual recognition. . . .  </P> <P> DANIEL O'HEARN, GLENDALE  </P></p>

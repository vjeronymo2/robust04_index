			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Wong from the Parque de la Industria </F> Information Center polling station]    [Text] There are citizens at the voting center, but very  few, we have noticed. I also want to report that this morning's  transportation service was very scarce. Very few vehicles were  operating. The people going to the various voting centers in  the capital to vote are doing so timidly.    We have an interview with Jose Pinzon, secretary general of  the CGTG [Guatemalan Workers General Central Organization], who  will give us his opinion about what is happening at Parque de la  Industria.    [Begin Pinzon recording] There is an average of three voters  per voting booth. We have toured the place. The CGTG is an  observer in this popular consultation event.    At the voting booths we have visited, there is barely an  average of three voters per booth, meaning, there is no  enthusiasm. The people of the capital are stating no opinion.  We do not know what is happening at other voting places, in the  downtown area. We are going there. Anyhow, I believe the  people are pessimistic and frustrated about the reforms to the  Constitution, because they believe they have not been prepared  clearly or honestly.    We do hope the people vote, to decide their own future in  this issue. It is not good for the people to abstain from  participation. They have been invited to abstain, but we believe  this is negative, because to abstain from voting favors the  reforms to the Constitution and this would be fatal to the  Constitution, which has always represented some kind of social  pact among Guatemalans [sentence as heard]. If this social pact  is reformed, the pact would be broken. We do not think it is  positive to remain home. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Leniency urged for form-filling farmers THE European Commission yesterday urged national authorities not to be too strict with farmers struggling to meet the bureaucratic demands of the EC's reformed common agricultural policy. Today is the deadline for farmers to submit new forms to national authorities if they want to claim EC funds this year. But many have complained that the new system, which requires farmers to give a detailed breakdown of the area farmed and the type of agricultural activity, is too complex and that Brussels and member states should be lenient about mistakes and delays. Mr Rene Steichen, the EC farm commissioner, indicated yesterday that if the Commission found that genuine errors and minor delays were widespread some of the severe penalties for breaking the new rules might be relaxed. But he stressed that this was not an invitation to flout the system. Officials indicated that a decision on whether and how to relax the regulations would not be taken until next month, after a Commission review of problems with implementing the CAP reform. The National Farmers Union of England and Wales welcomed Mr Steichen's comments but urged farmers not to interpret the Commission statement as an excuse to delay submission of the forms. Addressing EC farming organisations in Brussels, Mr Steichen said the Commission and member states should 'show flexibility, fairness and understanding' in dealing with the aid applications. But he added that the rules were necessary to prevent fraud. 'Community taxpayers are entitled to be assured that the Ecu35bn (Pounds 27.7bn) which will be spent this year to support the EC agricultural sector actually reaches its legitimate destination,' he said. EC farm spending will rise an estimated Ecu50m (Pounds 39.5m) over the next 12 months as a result of Thursday's devaluations of the peseta and escudo, a Commission spokesman said, Reuter reports from Brussels.</p>

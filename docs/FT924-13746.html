			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Eco-tourism gets a collective voice There may not yet be a television promotion inviting holiday-makers to 'Come on down' to the Brazilian rain forest or the Rwandan gorilla park, but one may not be far off. The travel and tourism industry is reaping the benefits of environmental awareness, aided and abetted by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). The Brussels-based organisation, formed by 50 of the world's chief executive officers to influence government decision-making at the highest levels, is now formulating a 'coherent compelling environment message'. It also has a messenger: Geoffrey Lipman, the council president, who was plucked from an aviation consultancy firm to promote the industry. Last week, speaking in Washington, he said eco-tourism is emerging as a rapidly growing segment of the travel and tourism industry, which in itself is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. This year it is expected to generate more than Dollars 3,000bn (Pounds 1,600bn) worldwide in gross output or sales. Eco-tourism is attractive for the young, who are particularly worried about inheriting a despoiled Earth; the growing number of environmentally-conscious travellers; and also for vacationers bored with beaches and resorts. In the US alone, the market potential for eco-tourism is considerable. According to Donald Hawkins, a professor at George Washington University, the most popular special interest tours are related to nature-oriented outdoor activities. Between 4m-6m Americans travel overseas each year for nature-related trips. About 30m Americans in the US belong to environmental organisations and 80m Americans call themselves bird watchers. The travel and tourist industry itself is striving for environmentally compatible growth, Lipman said. Hotels are adopting sound energy management, car hire companies are switching to lead-free petrol and airlines are buying more fuel-efficient aircraft. The WTTC has established a new World Travel &amp; Tourism Environmental Research Centre in Oxford to establish a database of environmental policies and programmes, and to become 'a catalyst for responsible policies'. Lipman also promotes 'rural tourism' in the EC as a substitute for inefficient agriculture. He is annoyed that the Community has allocated less than Dollars 10m a year to promote the concept. 'I'm not just thinking of bed and breakfast on farms, although that is no bad starting point,' he said. 'I'm thinking of theme holidays, nature trails, health holidays, rambling trips and so on.' But first the farmers must be convinced of the economic future in 'nature tourism' because it will require infrastructure, investment, education and promotion. Lipman is also pushing eco-tourism where it has a 'competitive advantage in scenery or wildlife'. It could become 'a major source of income and potential for economic development' in third world countries with nothing much else to sell beyond increased exploitation of their natural resources. He envisions the creation of a Pan African fund to market the continent as a whole and allow individual countries 'to piggyback' their own programmes. Lipman is something of an idealist - he left a good job as chief of staff for the International Air Transport Association to set up an organisation to represent passengers. But he admits, he has not yet changed his own environmental habits. 'I'm Mr Average,' he said. 'I think recycling is the right thing. I sometimes do it. I don't do it enough. If I'm to be a better person I should do it more.'</p>

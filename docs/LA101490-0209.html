			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE PIANO;  </P> <P> BEST-SELLING AUTHOR MARCEL MONTECINO REGRETS THAT HE NEVER COMPOSED A HIT SONG  WHEN HE WAS A STRUGGLING MUSICIAN  </P> <P> Two years ago, Marcel Montecino exchanged the piano for the pen, and took off  on his Hollywood honeymoon:  </P> <P> * First novel, "The Crosskiller," 900,000 copies printed, a best-seller.  </P> <P> * First screenplay, "Improper Conduct," bought by Jaffee-Lansing Productions  for $250,000; the film is scheduled to be released next year.  </P> <P> * Second novel, "Big Time," published in August with its movie rights already  purchased for $1 million by Tom Cruise.  </P> <P> "I can spit on a piece of paper," said Montecino, 45, of West Los Angeles, "and  someone will give me $50,000."  </P> <P> He paused, as if expecting Federal Express to arrive with an immediate check.  Things have gone that well.  </P> <P> Not too shabby for a piano player who, until 1988, was working the bar mitzvah  circuit, collecting $100 a night and waiting for the hit song that was going to  propel him into stardom. But the closest he got to fame during his music days  was playing for five years at Budd Friedman's Improv in Hollywood. Robin  Williams and Jay Leno worked there and made it big. Marcel Montecino just  worked there.  </P> <P> "I was miserable," he recalled. "It wasn't happening."  </P> <P> So he turned to his other creative craft -- writing. He used to write a lot in  his youth, he said, but gave it up to experience life. "I didn't know what I  wanted to say."  </P> <P> He spent the '70s in a daze, high, still not ready to record his thoughts.  Finally, when the '80s drew to a close, Montecino discovered his literary  voice, fine-tuned by years of hard living on the streets. He had played piano  in a Mississippi brothel, losing his virginity to a blackjack dealer. He worked  in bands up and down Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Finally he knew what he  wanted to say.  </P> <P> "I call my books dark novels, not thrillers," said Montecino. "I like to  explore the dark side of the human psyche. The dark side is right below the  surface for everyone. How many of us contemplate suicide every day?"  </P> <P> Montecino's characters are not heroic; "I don't think any of us are heroes."  Rather, they are ordinary characters, who, trapped in extraordinary situations,  rise above their limitations.  </P> <P> "Everybody has difficult times, and somehow finds a way to do what's  necessary."  </P> <P> In "Crosskiller," a Jewish cop hunts down a neo-Nazi serial murderer in West  Los Angeles; in "Big Time," a New Orleans piano player has to run all over the  world to escape the Mob, and can't pursue his dream of fame because he knows  recognition would kill him; and in "Improper Conduct," a cop gets involved with  a rich woman who leads him astray.  </P> <P> His dialogue holds little back, filled with sexual references and profanities,  the kind of realism that attracted producer Sherry Lansing. "It's gritty and  gutty," Lansing said. "He creates characters that are totally believable. He's  one of the most talented writers I've ever worked with."  </P> <P> Even today, Montecino insists, as his lifestyle undergoes changes he never  anticipated -- he's about to buy a house in Pacific Palisades -- he claims he's  not far removed from his modest beginnings.  </P> <P> He grew up in a lower-class Louisiana family with his aunt and uncle -- both  parents died before he was 8. He attended high school owning only two shirts.  His aunt and uncle, however, saved enough money to afford his $1.50 piano  lesson once a week. His practice paid dividends, and after receiving a music  scholarship to Southeastern Louisiana State College, he seemed ready to pursue  his dream.  </P> <P> But Montecino, always impatient, left college after one year. "I couldn't spend  the next three years eating one hot dog a day. I hated school. I wanted to  start life."  </P> <P> And so he did, often losing control, taking at least 45 grams of amphetamines  every night. Most of the money he earned playing music was squandered in  illegal gambling houses. "I wouldn't quit even if I made 10 times my  investment," he said. "I wanted to win the house."  </P> <P> He recalled with amusement the night he slept with the blackjack dealer and  feared for his life. "She took this gun out of her glove compartment and put it  in her purse," he said. "She brought it inside. I didn't know what to think."  </P> <P> In 1974, he moved to Los Angeles, ready to make his impact on the national  music scene. Along with his wife, Montecino wrote dozens of songs, paying the  rent with his piano job at the Improv. The couple separated in 1989.  </P> <P> After all his success in writing books and screenplays, Montecino still regrets  not landing the hit song. "It broke my heart," he said. "I haven't played the  piano in two years, but eventually, I'll go back."  </P> <P> Montecino, never lacking in confidence, received a big boost when he took a  UCLA Extension course in novel writing in 1985. By then he had written about 70  pages of "The Crosskiller." He showed it to a teacher and classmates who told  him to go home and finish it. "I knew then I could write novels."  </P> <P> When Montecino finished "Crosskiller," he took it to get copied. He told his  wife he would be lucky if he got an agent within a year, but "when I got home,  there was a call on the answering machine from someone in the UCLA class. I had  an agent three days later, and a publisher a month after that."  </P> <P> He wasn't as self-assured about screenplays, so the immediate success of  "Improper Conduct" stunned even him. So far, he derives more satisfaction from  his novels, but eagerly awaits the release of the movie. "They give you a lot  of money, and they can do what they want," he said. "They could turn it into a  milk carton. With novels, you have that total amount of freedom."  </P> <P> Despite his fortune, Montecino took a long time to regard himself as a true  writer. "I used to tell people that I was a piano player who writes. Writing  was something other people did. I went through this period of not knowing who I  was. People who used to be names in magazines became friends of mine, Hollywood  friends to be sure. But now I know I'm a writer."  </P> <P> And a prolific one. He is busy working on a new screenplay, and says he knows  the contents of his next four books. He claims his screenplay -- a story about  post-Vietnam days in Bayou country -- isn't commercial.  </P> <P> But, with typical confidence, he replied: "Somebody will buy it."  </P></p>

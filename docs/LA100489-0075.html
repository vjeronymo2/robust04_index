			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A group demanding the release of a Palestinian wanted on terrorism charges in  the United States occupied the Greek Justice Ministry in Athens for eight  hours. About 20 members of the Movement for the Defense of Social and Political  Rights left after officials promised them "positive developments" in the case  of Mohammed Rashid. The interim conservative-leftist government has said that  decisions on extradition and other foreign policy matters will be left to the  administration formed after elections scheduled for Nov. 5. Rashid, 35, is  accused in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Hawaii in 1982, killing a  Japanese teen-ager and wounding 15 people.  </P></p>

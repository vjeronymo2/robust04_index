			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> NEWS GUILD ACCEPTS UNION-TRIBUNE OFFER  </P> <P> Members of the San Diego Newspaper Guild ended a bitter labor dispute with the  Union-Tribune Publishing Co., voting begrudgingly to accept a new, two-year  contract but saying all is not well at San Diego's two largest newspapers.  </P> <P> Guild members voted 227 to 78 to accept the new labor package that calls, among  other things, for an immediate 10% pay raise -- the first pay increase for many  employees since December, 1987. The contract negotiated by the guild covers  1,100 employees in the editorial, advertising, circulation and business  departments. Guild President Ed Jahn said members felt resigned to accept the  new contract because it was the best they could expect to muster from the  company.  </P></p>

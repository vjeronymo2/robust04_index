			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Recovery is just as it should be Sir, Your article 'A clear case of confusion' (January 22/23) spoke of conflicting recovery signals. Evidence from the (industrial) cliff face is that order books are building up slowly and steadily - which is just what is wanted. Hence the cautious, but sustained, rise in gross national product, evident now for more than a year. Retail sales are another matter. It is probably desirable they should not move ahead too fast, to avoid sucking in imports on what might be termed 'froth' spending. There need be no conflict here. The underlying heartbeat of the build-up of the economy appears sound. Brian Warnes, managing director, Business Dynamics, 13 Blackheath Village, London SE3 9LA</p>

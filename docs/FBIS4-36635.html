			<p>BFN     [Text] The General Directorate of Public Security decided  tonight to stop the Future Television station's transmission due  to violations of the cabinet decision of 23 March 1994, which  banned the audio and visual media from transmitting direct or  indirect political news and programs.    Future Television transmitted on its news program "Tonight's  World" a report on the inauguration of the Sidon municipality  building. The report included the political speech delivered by  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, thus violating the cabinet  decision on the transmission of political news.    The public security organ contacted the station and asked it  to stop transmission. Future Television stopped its  transmissions at 2030 today [1730 GMT] in obedience to this  decision.</p>

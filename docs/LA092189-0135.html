			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE STRESSES N. KOREA MILITARY THREAT  </P> <P> Praising South Korea's "political transformation and movement toward  democracy," Vice President Dan Quayle emphasized the military threat posed by  North Korea and soft-pedaled concerns over continuing human rights violations  in the south as he met Wednesday with government and opposition party  officials.  </P> <P> "The North Korean military establishment is larger than ever," Quayle told  members of the Korean Newspaper Editors Assn. in a speech.  </P> <P> In particular, he said, Moscow in the recent has strengthened North Korea by  sending it advanced aircraft. The rationale for the continued presence of U.S.  troops here, he said, "is as strong as ever."  </P> <P> South Korea was the first stop on a four-nation tour of Asia that will also  take Quayle to Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia before he returns to  Washington next week. Before leaving today for Tokyo, Quayle plans to visit the  demilitarized zone between the two Koreas to review U.S. and South Korean  troops.  </P> <P> Quayle's tone here reflected the Bush Administration's policy of avoiding  public confrontation with other nations over human rights issues as well as his  own deep suspicion of Soviet military intentions. Although U.S. Embassy  officials have expressed private concern over the human rights situation here,  the Administration has carefully avoided any public criticism of President Roh  Tae Woo and his government.  </P> <P> Roh, Quayle said in his speech, has "successfully ushered in democratic  reforms" and shown "moderation in the face of radical violence that seems  designed to provoke overreaction."  </P> <P> Korean opposition leaders have questioned that moderation, charging that in  recent months Roh's government has turned toward a more repressive course. They  cite figures made public Tuesday by a committee of the Korean National Assembly  that show a sharp increase in arrests under the country's strict National  Security Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indicted Opposition Leader  </P> <P> In addition, the government last month indicted Kim Dae Jung, the nation's  best-known opposition figure. The indictment, which Kim has vehemently  denounced, charges that he failed to report an opposition legislator's trip to  North Korea and received money from the legislator that the traveler had  received from North Korean agents.  </P> <P> Quayle sidestepped that issue in meetings with Roh, Kim and other Korean  leaders. U.S. officials said that Roh assured Quayle that he "would not turn  back" toward the repressive policies of past South Korean governments.  </P> <P> "The vice president was happy about that," spokesman David Beckwith said.  </P> <P> Although complaints of a government crackdown have been a major part of the  opposition's political program, neither Kim Dae Jung nor Kim Young Sam, the  other main opposition leader, raised the issue directly during their meeting  with Quayle at the National Assembly.  </P> <P> Kim Dae Jung criticized past U.S. policies, saying that in the past the United  States "put security too much ahead of Korea's democratization," according to a  Korean official who briefed reporters after the meeting. The U.S. government  had alienated many South Koreans by its "support for dictatorial regimes of the  past," the official quoted Kim as saying.  </P> <P> But both Kims emphasized their support for the presence of 43,000 U.S. troops  here. Any move to reduce the U.S. force at this point would be "unproductive,"  Kim Young Sam told Quayle.  </P> <P> Beckwith said that Quayle was "surprised by the unanimity" of opinion on the  troop-strength issue.  </P> <P> South Korean government officials have expressed considerable anxiety over the  possibility of a troop cut, repeatedly asking Quayle about proposals in  Congress for such a move. The Bush Administration opposes reducing troop  strength here and, for now, the idea appears to have relatively little support  in Congress.  </P></p>

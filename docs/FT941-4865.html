			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enviromed purchase and joint venture Enviromed, the biotechnology group, yesterday announced a Pounds 9m acquisition and joint venture plan aimed at expanding its distribution and supply of research and healthcare products. The company, which came to the market last year, said the expansion would be dominated by the acquisition of Biozyme, the private laboratory group, for Pounds 8.05m cash. Mr Peter Townsend, chief executive, said Biozyme - which specialises in the isolation and supply of enzymes for clinical laboratories and the diagnostics industry - would complement its existing biochemical monitoring business. 'It's a very exciting prospect for us - Biozyme's enzyme technology will make an important contribution to our operations,' he added. Enviromed has also agreed to form a European joint venture with Selfcare, the US distributor of self-diagnosis and self-treatment products. As part of the joint venture agreement, Enviromed is buying a 12.5 per cent stake in the Massachussett's-based company for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 1m). The Biozyme acquisition and Selfcare share stake will be funded by a Pounds 9.8m placing and open offer of 8.63m new ordinary shares at 125p each. Singer and Friedlander, which is handling the offer, said existing shareholders would be offered new shares on a 3-for-5 basis. Enviromed's directors, who currently hold 52.06 per cent of the shares, are expected to retain 34 per cent once the placing and offer is completed.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE GOOD IGNORED  </P> <P> The news media are blowing out of proportion gang happenings and painting the  wrong picture of Southeast San Diego.  </P> <P> For all the drive-by shootings, there are as many good things happening, such  as the Regional Youth Center that provides summer jobs for the low-income  families. The Palace, formerly called the Boys' Club, provides recreational  activities and dance parties on the weekends. The Bandini Center is a  continuation program that helps students make up classes.  </P> <P> Southeast San Diego is not always as the newspaper and TV describe it. I live  there and I like it.  </P> <P> FREDDRICK BROWN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM share price recovery aids Dow rally Wall Street A VOLATILE day for US stock markets ended on a positive note yesterday as higher bond prices and a recovery in IBM's share price following a disappointing set of quarterly earnings lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to another record high, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow was up 15.43 at 3,264.98. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 0.64 at 418.85, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slipped 0.60 at 626.74. NYSE turnover was 286m shares, and rises marginally outpaced declines by 905 to 814. There were a few titbits of fresh economic news to give the market direction. The announcement of a 0.2 per cent reduction in December industrial production, and a decline in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for early January should have injected a sour note at the end of what was generally a good week for stocks. The market, however, was able to draw comfort from a rise in bond prices, which prompted a much-needed reduction in long-term interest rates. Most eyes were on IBM, which announced a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 1.38bn after taking a slightly bigger-than-expected charge of Dollars 3.4bn to cover restructuring costs. The stock fell more than Dollars 2 on the release of the figures, which were deemed by analysts to be disappointing, but later recovered to end Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 96 3/4 in turnover of 2.6m shares as investors reacted positively to reports of upbeat comments from IBM's management. Other big computer stocks were mixed in the wake of IBM's results. Compaq rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 , Digital Equipment fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53, Hewlett-Packard slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62, Unisys held firm at Dollars 5 1/2 and Motorola rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 79 7/8 . Reebok climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 on earnings in line with market estimates. Reebok had been heavily sold on Thursday in anticipation of poor results. Citicorp ran into profit-taking for the second day running, dropping Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 5/8 in turnover of 3.4m shares. The stock has enjoyed a remarkable ride in recent days, buoyed up by heavy demand from investors who believe the worst may be over for the troubled banking group. Since Thursday, however, some investors have been taking profits on the assumption that Citicorp's rally may have stalled for now. On the over-the-counter market, Apple jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 on news of fiscal first quarter net income of Dollars 1.36 a share, up from Dollars 1.28 a share a year ago. Canada TORONTO stock prices closed mixed in heavy trading. According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell 7.67 points, or 0.21 per cent, to close at 3,658.29, but advancing issues outnumbered declines 380 to 252. Volume was 34.941m shares, down from yesterday's 39.983m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 456.8m from CDollars 487.3m. The index finished the hectic week up about 65 points, or about 1.8 per cent. Euro-Nevada fell  1/4 to 18 3/4 on news it will issue 1.5m special convertible warrants at CDollars 18.75 a warrant. Ocelot Industries was unchanged at 11 7/8 . The company said it will sell to an underwiting group 4m special warrants at CDollars 11.50 a warrant, each of which is exercisable for one common share.</p>

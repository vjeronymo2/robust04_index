			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is asking  those who do not wish for a potential MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party]-SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] coalition to support  the MDF candidates. According to the statement by the MDF  National Executive, the MSZP-SZDSZ coalition could gain a  two-thirds majority, which would mean power on a scale which is  undesireably excessive in a democracy. [passage omitted]    The MDF cannot conceive of cooperation with the SZDSZ, even  on a local level. MDF Executive Chairman Sandor Lezsak also  said that in the election campaign it would be incorrect to warn  against a left-wing danger because that is already a fact.</p>

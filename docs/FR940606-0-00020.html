			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately 55 comment letters were received in response to the March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11018) reopening of the comment period. The majority of these letters were from industries or industrial trade associations, arguing in favor of the less stringent ``Lower Floor Interpretation.'' Environmental groups, State or local governments and labor unions argued almost uniformly in favor of the more stringent ``Higher Floor Interpretation.'' The EPA considered all public comments in framing the final policy for MACT floor determination and in selection of the requirements for medium storage vessels. The major issues raised by the comments are addressed in this preamble. The EPA's responses to all the comments can be found in docket A&hyph;90&hyph;19, Subcategory VI&hyph;B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I.

As set forth in more detail below, EPA believes that one of the interpretations of section 112(d)(3)(A)_referred to as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation''_is the better and more natural reading of the statutory language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act provides that Emissions standards promulgated under this subsection for existing sources *&blank;*&blank;* shall not be less stringent *&blank;*&blank;* than_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources *&blank;*&blank;* 42 U.S.C. section 7412(d)(3). Existing sources for which the Administrator lacks emissions information and those that have recently achieved LAER are excluded from consideration. Id. (For categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources, standards may not be less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources.'' CAA section 112(d)(3)(B)). The minimum level of stringency defined by this language has come to be known as the MACT Floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the March 9, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA published a notice soliciting comment on ``the appropriate interpretation of'' section 112(d)(3)(A). Two interpretations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 112(d)(3)(A) were discussed. Under the first, referred to as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation,'' EPA would look at emission limitations achieved by each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and average those limitations. ``Average'' would be interpreted to mean a measure of central tendency such as the arithmetic mean or median. (The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements in the set. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of values, when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the second, ``Lower Floor Interpretation,'' EPA would look at the average emission limits achieved by each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and take the lowest. This second interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation'' into a single phrase, and asks what ``average emission limitation'' (accounting for variability over time, or between different pollutants being emitted from a facility) is ``achieved by'' all members of the best performing 12 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. EPA's Interpretation of Section 112(d)(3)(A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA believes that the ``Higher Floor Interpretation'' is a better reading of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A) than the ``Lower Floor Interpretation.'' This conclusion is based on a review of the statute, legislative history and comments received in response to EPA's March 9 notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Statutory Language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112(d)(3)(A) requires that standards be no less stringent than ``*&blank;*&blank;* the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources *&blank;*&blank;*''. The EPA believes that the most natural and straightforward reading of this language would have EPA first determine the emission limitations achieved by sources within the best performing 12 percent, and then average those limitations. This is the method described above as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA believes that if Congress had intended the Lower Floor Interpretation, language other than that actually used in section 112(d)(3)(A) would have been far more natural. For example, Congress could easily have expressed the Lower Floor Interpretation by requiring standards to be no less stringent than ``the emission limitation achieved by all sources within the best performing 12 percent.'' Similarly, Congress could have required standards to be no less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the worst performing member of the best performing 12 percent,'' or ``the emission limitation (averaged over time to take account of variability in the effectiveness of control) achieved by all sources within the best performing 12 percent.'' Any of such phrases would have been a more natural way to convey the Lower Floor Interpretation than the language Congress chose. However, the actual language of section 112(d)(3)(A) provides, in straightforward fashion, that standards may be no less stringent than the ``average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent *&blank;*&blank;*''. To glean the Lower Floor Interpretation from this language is a strain; words and concepts not set forth in the statute must be added or inferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language of section 112(d)(3)(B) makes this point even clearer. That section requires that standards for existing sources in categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources be no less stringent than <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: OFFICIATING IN COLD-WEATHER GAME FROSTS NOLL  </P> <P> Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll said Monday that officials must have been  affected by a minus 29-degree chill factor while criticizing them in his team's  23-16 loss to the Houston Oilers Sunday.  </P> <P> Noll said he'll file a report to the NFL office. He said that Haywood Jeffires  was clearly out of bounds on his 37-yard catch that set up Lorenzo White's  game-winning touchdown run. He also maintained that the Oilers were given an  extra timeout as they scored twice in the final 1:54 of the first half.  </P> <P> Noll wouldn't fault cornerback Rod Woodson's coverage of Jeffires along a  snow-covered Oilers' sideline, three plays before White's touchdown.  </P> <P> The reception was upheld by instant replay official Cal Lepore, who made seven  lengthy replay reviews without overturning any calls.  </P> <P> "The thing that ticks you off is having to stand there for five minutes with  the chill factor what it was, waiting for a decision like that," Noll said.  "The instant replay is just another in the chain of mistakes. Jeffires had one  foot in and he fell out of bounds."  </P></p>

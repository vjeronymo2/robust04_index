			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE FIRMS TRY TO EASE TRADE TENSIONS  </P> <P> Japan's business leaders, apparently alarmed by the paralysis gripping their  national government, are starting to take measures on their own aimed at easing  trade problems with the United States and other countries.  </P> <P> The Keidanren, the powerful federation of economic organizations, decided last  week to set up its own agency to help foreign executives experiencing  difficulties in exporting goods to Japan. Meanwhile, major manufacturing  companies are stepping up their own importing efforts in a bid to ease trade  tensions.  </P> <P> In the past, Japanese business leaders have counted on government bureaucrats  to handle trade problems and fend off complaints from foreign competitors about  unfair trade practices.  </P> <P> However, as the country's trade surpluses have persisted despite the  revaluation of the yen, it has become more difficult for the bureaucrats to  satisfy foreigners. Also, the deterioration of Japan's political leadership in  recent months has left the bureaucracy uncertain about the direction of trade  policy.  </P> <P> Officials are concerned, for example, about how to handle forthcoming  negotiations with the United States on structural barriers to trade. In the  current political climate, with parties trying harder than ever to appeal to  public opinion, no one is prepared to make concessions on sensitive issues such  as trading practices.  </P> <P> At a Keidanren seminar near Tokyo last Thursday, Akio Morita, chairman of Sony  and a vice chairman of Keidanren, noted that many foreign businessmen claimed  that nothing was done about complaints that they made to the government-run  Office of the Trade Ombudsman. The OTO, set up in 1982, has handled only 370  cases to date, and only one-third of them have led to any action.  </P> <P> The Keidanren accepted Morita's suggestion that their own complaints body be  set up and that advertisements be placed in major U.S. magazines to publicize  its existence.  </P> <P> Among other signs of business concern about trade friction, a number of large  companies are stepping up their importing efforts and avoiding any increase in  exports, despite the yen's recent weakening trend. For example, exports of  motor vehicles fell 0.1% in the first half of 1989 to 3.06 million, according  to figures published last week by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn.  </P> <P> Also, Matsushita Electric Industrial, the giant consumer and industrial  electronics group, said earlier this month that it would double its imports of  parts and manufactured goods to $2.8 billion by 1993.  </P></p>

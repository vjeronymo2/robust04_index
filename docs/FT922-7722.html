			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Roads to ruins MY HOUSE is on a narrow unadopted lane which serves several other properties and is marked as a bridle path. The owners of the properties have right of way over the lane, but other motorists use the lane as a short cut, and drive along it at unsafe speeds. I should like to install 'sleeping policemen' humps in the lane to make high speeds impractical, but I believe that I need the permission of the owner of the lane to do this. I have been unable to discover who owns the lane. What can I take to find the owner's name and address? If I am unable to obtain this information, can I go ahead with the alterations? It is correct that you need the permission of the owner of the soil of the lane. You can make a search of H M Land Registry to find out if the land is registered land, and if so who the owner is. If it is not registered you may be unable to find out who owns the lane. If so, you would still go ahead at your risk as to the cost of reinstating if you decide to install the humps. MY PROPERTY has a very old dry stone wall as its boundary and is adjoined by a narrow road just wide enough for one vehicle. I believe it is classified as a No 4 road. This road is now used by tankers and other heavy vehicles. The wall, upright in 1976 when we moved here, now lies at an angle and has fallen in some places. I have been in touch with the council who admit some liability as our garden is approximately 2 ft lower than the road and the wall helps to support the road. What is then council's legal liability? We have a shrub border in front of the wall and as we are both OAP's would not be able to dig up and replant if these were damaged in further falls. If the wall supports the road it may be part of the highway, in which case the local highway authority has a duty to repair it. You should claim that this is the case and require the local authority to effect the necessary repairs. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

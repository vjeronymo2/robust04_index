			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHEAST SOVIET REGION TO GET ITS FIRST CHURCH  </P> <P> There has never been a church in the entire Magadan region of the Soviet Far  East, an area three times as big as California and with a population of  500,000.  </P> <P> But now, a Russian Orthodox church is being built in the center of Magadan, a  seaport on the Sea of Okhotsk that serves as the capital of the most  Northeastern region of Siberia.  </P> <P> The church will stand next to a 60-foot-high memorial to the victims of  Stalin's infamous prison camps. The memorial is scheduled to be completed by  sculptor Ernst Neizvestny within two years.  </P> <P> Until the 1930s the huge Magadan region remained virtually uninhabited except  for nomadic reindeer herders and natives living in scattered villages along the  coast of the Chukchi, East Siberian and Bering seas.  </P> <P> Then Stalin started shipping hundreds of thousands of prisoners to the area.  More than 100 camps of the Gulag system were erected and support communities  were built around them. Everything in the region evolved around the prison  camps from the 1930s through the late 1950s.  </P> <P> "Since we were an atheist nation there never was a reason to build churches  here. It was the policy of our government to discourage belief in a god,"  explained Vyazheslav Kobets, the region's governor. "Of course,  pre-revolutionary Russian Orthodox churches still stand in many places in the  Soviet Union. But they were never here."  </P> <P> There seems to be a great deal of curiosity about religion everywhere in the  country.  </P> <P> Foreign visitors are besieged by Soviet citizens, some of whom have been  lifelong atheists, for any information they can get on their views of God. It  is part of ane emerging phenomenon of people searching for something to believe  in now that they have lost faith and confidence in the Communist Party and  their government.  </P> <P> The 32 members of a medical expedition to the Magadan region, sponsored by the  University of Alaska's Institute of Circumpolar Health Studies, said Soviet  doctors repeatedly asked them this summer if they believe in God and if they  attend church.  </P> <P> Members of the medical group included MDs, dentists, psychiatrists, hospital  administrators, dental hygienists and physicians' assistants.  </P> <P> "In one meeting when the subject of God was brought up, we asked the Soviet  doctors what they believed in," said Anchorage psychiatrist Bill Richards, 49.  </P> <P> "They said they were brought up in the Communist system to be atheist and  always taught not to believe in God, but to believe in the state rather than  spiritual forces."  </P> <P> Dr. Wandal Winn, 44, an Anchorage psychiatrist observed: "There is tremendous  hunger in this country for ethics, morals and values to replace something they  feel we have that they're missing. The Soviet people are in a vacuum, looking  around for meaning in life. I have been asked by Soviet doctors if I had a  Bible I could give them."  </P> <P> Winn said he believes the Soviet Union "is fertile soil for fundamentalistic  Christianity. I would not be surprised to see it coming on very strong."  </P></p>

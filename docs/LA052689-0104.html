			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REWARDS OF $50,000 OKD IN CHILD KIDNAPING CASES  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, flanked by the somber parents of four abducted  children, on Thursday signed urgency legislation authorizing state rewards of  up to $50,000 for information leading to convictions in child kidnaping cases.  </P> <P> At a ceremony in his office, Deukmejian cited the parents of four kidnaped  children standing near him and observed, "It is impossible, even if you have  children, to appreciate the devastating worry and concern these parents have."  </P> <P> The faces of the four sets of parents were drawn and nearly expressionless  after months of ordeal. Their children, ranging in age from 8 to 16, were taken  from various San Francisco Bay Area locations during the last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allows Governor to Post Rewards  </P> <P> The bill, which took effect immediately upon Deukmejian's signature, allows the  governor for the first time to post rewards of up to $50,000 for information  leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnapers of children.  </P> <P> The measure by Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) also boosts the maximum state  reward for other major crimes from $10,000 to $50,000. At the ceremony were the  parents of Micheala Garecht, 10, of Hayward, abducted last November; Amber  Schwartz-Garcia, 8, of Pinole, kidnaped in June; Michael Masaoay, 16, of San  Francisco, who disappeared in January, and Ilene Misheloff, 14, of Dublin, who  also vanished in January.  </P> <P> "We do believe that this bill holds out hope that Micheala will be returned,"  said her mother, Sharon Garecht.  </P> <P> "I have a reputation for being very careful with the dollar," Deukmejian said,  "but I would be delighted to see the state pay out these rewards."  </P></p>

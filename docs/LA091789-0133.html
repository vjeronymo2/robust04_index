			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART NEWS: A RARE LOOK AT WOLFLI'S 'OUTSIDER ART' EXHIBITION  </P> <P> Known as the first and foremost practitioner of "outsider art," Adolf Wolfli  spent his entire artistic life confined in a Swiss mental institution. Yet in  the space of 30 years (from 1899-1929), he created a body of art encompassing  3,000 drawings and 25,000 pages of text, images and musical notations.  </P> <P> "It's kind of unbelievable, because he came from such a deprived, depressed  background with no formal education at all," said Phyllis Plous, curator of the  UC Santa Barbara Art Museum, where a rare exhibition of Wolfli's work opens  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The traveling exhibition, "The Other Side of the Moon: The World of Adolf  Wolfli," consists of 85 pencil and colored pencil drawings and collages of  landscapes, cosmic battles, and imaginary travels around the world. Also  included is a taped interpretation of some of Wolfli's musical notations.  </P> <P> "Those who know anything about it know how rare it is to have a chance to see  it without going to Switzerland," said Plous of Wolfli's work, which has been  shown in the United States only once before (in a traveling exhibition in  1978-79). Plous added that because the drawings are done on fragile newsprint,  this may be the last time the works leave Switzerland. (Their permanent home is  at the Adolf Wolfli Foundation in Berne.)  </P> <P> "They're pretty fragile for much more travel -- this tour is probably it,"  Plous said.  </P> <P> The exhibition's showing at UC Santa Barbara completes a five-stop U.S. and  Canadian tour.  </P> <P> GRANTS: The California Arts Council has awarded a total of $1.9 million to 194  organizations and schools as part of its Artists in Residency Program. The  program is designed to bring artists and the public together in either school  and community settings and social institutions. The awards were made in several  areas of the arts, including music, dance, literature, media arts, theater,  visual arts, folk arts, and crafts.  </P> <P> The L.A. County groups receiving grants -- ranging from $3,600 to $10,400 --  for resident artists in the visual arts are the Long Beach Museum of Art,  Korean Youth Center of Los Angeles, Los Angeles' Self-Help Graphics &amp; Arts,  Santa Monica's Olympic High School, Los Angeles' Fairburn Avenue Elementary  School, Santa Monica Alternative School House, Pasadena's Sequoia School, Los  Angeles' Hilltop Nursery School, and the Boys/Girls Club of Venice.  </P> <P> AUCTION: Focus On AIDS II, a photography auction and benefit for AIDS Project  Los Angeles and the City of Angels Hospice, will be held Monday at 7 p.m. at  the Palace, 1735 N. Vine St., Hollywood. Items to be auctioned include rare  vintage and contemporary photographs by Rebecca Blake, Greg Gorman, Robert  Mapplethorpe, Annie Leibovitz, Helmut Newton and Herb Ritts.  </P> <P> The event is the second such benefit put on by Focus On AIDS, a volunteer group  committed to raising funds and awareness to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency  Syndrome and care for those suffering from the disease. Tickets are $50 dollars  each and can be obtained by a phone call to (213) 652-5204.  </P> <P> OPENING: In his "A Conversation on Collecting," noted art collector Richard A.  Manoogian says his collection "is probably broader and much larger than most  American private collections. I don't know if that's good or bad or just an  obsession." Whichever may be the case, Californians can see a portion of his  collection -- 63 19th-Century paintings, including Hudson River and  Impressionist landscapes, trompe l'oeil still lifes, genre scenes, and figure  paintings -- at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Memorial Museum's "American  Paintings From the Manoogian Collection," which opens Saturday.  </P> <P> Organized by the Detroit Institute of the Arts and the National Gallery of Art,  the traveling exhibition features works from every major school and tradition  in American 19th-Century painting. It includes paintings by Thomas Cole, John  Singer Sargent, George Caleb Bingham, Raphaelle Peale, Mary Cassatt, Thomas  Eakins, Jasper Cropsey, Sanford Gifford, Thomas Worthington Whittredge, Albert  Bierstadt, William Harnett, William Merritt Chase, Maurice Prendergast and  others.  </P> <P> CONTEST: Black Gallery is holding its fourth annual photography contest, with  $1,500 in cash and prizes being awarded in four categories. The contest is open  to both professional and amateur photographers, who may submit black-and-white  or color prints in the categories of photojournalism, landscapes, conceptual  photographs and portraiture. The entry deadline is Oct. 28. For more  information and entry rules, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Photo  Contest '89, Black Gallery, 107 Santa Barbara Plaza, Los Angeles, Calif. 90008;  or call (213) 294-9024.  </P></p>

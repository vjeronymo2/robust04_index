			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / Western Isles chief fuels poll tax dispute WESTERN Isles Council, which lost Pounds 23m with the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was in disarray yesterday after Mr Donald Macleod, the convener (chairman), appeared to suggest that islanders should not pay the poll tax which the council has increased by 370 per cent, James Buxton writes. Mr Macleod told BBC Radio yesterday that he had not favoured imposing the losses from BCCI on poll-tax payers. Asked if he thought people ought to pay the increased tax, he replied: 'I don't think so.' Later he said he did not support non-payment and blamed his statement on confusion caused by a bad telephone line. Mr Angus Graham, another councillor, said Mr Macleod should resign because of his statements. He said: 'He doesn't know what he's saying. I just think that the best thing that could happen now would be for Councillor Macleod to step down.' The council voted on Monday to raise its poll tax from Pounds 26 to Pounds 122. Of that, Pounds 35 is to cover the cost of extra borrowing to replace the BCCI loss.</p>

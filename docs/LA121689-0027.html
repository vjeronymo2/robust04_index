			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SANTA FE IN L.A.  </P> <P> This year's touring contingent from the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival blew  into Royce Hall at UCLA on Thursday with a typically wide-ranging program and a  sterling lineup of artists: violinist Daniel Phillips (replacing the indisposed  Joseph Swensen), cellist Marcy Rosen, flutist Ransom Wilson, pianist Jeffrey  Swann and tenor Robert White.  </P> <P> White opened the concert by bringing his sweet, fragile tenor and canny  musicality to bear on eight of Beethoven's British folk song arrangements,  deftly accompanied by the ensemble, after which the stage was set with  paraphernalia, including microphones, blue lights and yards of wiring, that  might be considered alien to a "serious" chamber music concert.  </P> <P> But this was, in a sense, ever-enterprising Santa Fe, and the music was the  1971 "Vox Balaenae" (Voice of the Whale) by the non-avant-gardist's one-time  favorite avant-gardist, George Crumb. The 20-odd minute piece is performed by  three players wearing black half-masks.  </P> <P> It's easy to snigger at the composer's spacey verbal program, and there were a  few titters from the audience when the masked players -- Wilson, Rosen, Swann  -- entered. There was a bit of shifting in seats, too, when Wilson began to  sing humpback whale-type songs into his flute.  </P> <P> Still, "Vox Balaenae" remains an intriguing study in timbres that, with its  mistily East Indian languidity, soothes rather than grates.  </P> <P> The evening's more conventional offerings were Dvorak's Four Romantic Pieces,  heroically projected by Phillips and Swann, and a relentless, grandly  rhetorical reading by Swann, Phillips and Rosen of Smetana's doom-laden Trio in  G minor.

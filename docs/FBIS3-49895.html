Renata Havranova, editor of PRACE daily,  reports from Bratislava:    [Havranova] (Mario Martins), head of the delegation of  Council of Europe experts, noted that since his first visit last  April, considerable progress on the part of the Slovak bodies  has been noted in tackling territorial administrative division.  Council of Europe experts are of the opinion that the proposed  integration of state administration on a horizontal level could  improve not only its efficiency, but also the coordination of  branch activities and, above all, relations among citizens.  Slovakia should speed up the process of decentralization so  that appropriate laws can be put into practice prior to local  elections. Experts consider as too liberal the principle of  voluntarism in the cooperation of self-administration bodies  when setting up offices. The Slovak Republic should safeguard  the standard level of state administration by laws.    The experts pointed out that the problem of national  minorities cannnot be solved by artificial division of the state  into regions. They consider the geographical spread of  minorities as one of the many factors of the reform.  Representatives of the Council of Europe recommended permanent  dialogue, above all, with the Hungarian minority. The problems  of this minority, in their view, could become a question of  human rights.</p>

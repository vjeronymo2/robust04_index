			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid move boost for VSEL VSEL was a clear feature among engineering shares, jumping 23 to 1405p following what was seen by the stock market as a dramatic shortening of the odds on GEC's bid for the company escaping a monopolies reference. The catalyst was the interim results statement from defence contractor Vosper Thornycroft, which disclosed strong profits and dividend growth but - more importantly for VSEL - made it clear that Vosper was in a position to provide plenty of competing defence shipbuilding capability. GEC is bidding 1400p a share cash for VSEL in direct counter to a share offer worth 1295p from British Aerospace, which put on a penny at 471p. The stock market has not ruled out a fresh offer from BAe, possibly next week.</p>

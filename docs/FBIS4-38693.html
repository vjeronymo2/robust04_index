			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia wants to upgrade Russian-Greek economic  relations by launching new large scale projects, Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told Interfax following his meeting  with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.    These projects include the construction of an oil pipeline  from Burgas, Bulgaria, into Greece. Shokhin said that this  would be a new export route by-passing the Bosphorus and  Dardanelles which might be closed for environmental reasons.    Under another project, Greek ship-owners would contribute to  the revival of the Russian merchant fleet.    To the best of Interfax's knowledge, during the Papoulias  visit to Moscow the two sides held intensive talks on the  continuation of the construction of an alumina works and gas  pipeline in Greece with Russian participation.</p>

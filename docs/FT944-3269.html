			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rules for a Euro referendum Sir, While I agree that a referendum on Europe is necessary ('Referendum required', December 12) there remain some tricky details to be resolved. First of all, who is to set the questions? This is not a task that should be left solely in the hands of politicians, particularly those from the present divided administration. If the referendum is to be more than a simple Yes/No to a single, or common, currency then more than one question will be necessary if we are to have an informed consent to a new constitutional settlement in Europe. I suggest that an independent commission be established and charged with the task of devising suitable questions. The commission should have a majority of non-politicians. It could also draw on available expertise from the market research profession and the social sciences. The second issue is: will the result of the referendum be binding or simply advisory? To make it binding would restrict parliament's sovereignty to a marked degree. To make it advisory is probably preferable, given that a substantial referendum majority could hardly be ignored by elected MPs. Finally, if we are to have a new set of (written) rules for governing Europe after the intergovernmental conference in 1998, is it not time we also had a set of (written) rules for governing Britain in the late 20th and the 21st century? Such rules could, among other things, spell out the conditions under which referendums should be held. John Thomson, Croglin Cottage, Friday Lane, Charlton St Peter, Nr Pewsey, Wiltshire SN9 6EY</p>

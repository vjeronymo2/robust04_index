			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Sudan crowd in terror protest A CROWD of over 2,000 women (right), chanting Islamic and anti-US slogans, delivered a protest note yesterday to the American embassy in Khartoum over US accusations of Sudanese sponsorship of terrorism, Agencies report from Khartoum. The embassy has cut the size of its staff and evacuated family members. Sudan's hardline military leadership has responded angrily to the accusations. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said on Tuesday that Washington had failed to produce any proof his country had allowed terrorist training camps on its territory. Lt-Gen al-Bashir, speaking in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa after a regional summit, also denied he was supporting Somali gunmen linked to Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, in their increasingly bloody battle with UN forces in Mogadishu.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the Auditing Directorate for the Administration </F> of the Russian Federation President: "`Ostankino' Is Selling  Itself, Continuously Lowering the Price"]    [Text] In 1993, the expenses of the RGTRK [Russian State  Television and Radio Company] "Ostankino" were financed by the  Russian Ministry of Finance from the Russian Federation Budget  for the sum of 103.7 billion rubles [R]; of this amount, R82.8  billion, or 80 percent, were used to pay for the services of the  Russian Ministry of Communications and R20.9 billion were spent  for its own needs. As of the beginning of 1994, the company owed  R50.3 billion to state enterprises which provide for  dissemination and retransmission of radio and television  programs and R1.8 billion to the Television Technical Center  (TTTs).    At the same time, despite its difficult financial situation  (...) it continues to use budgetary funds for unauthorized  purposes.    Because of the lack of appropriate supervision by the  management of the RGTRK "Ostankino" (the former chairman V.I.  Bragin), individual television studios illegally permitted an  increase in the volume of broadcasting established for them last  year (...).    Television and radio advertising, which is one of the  company's principal sources of commercial income, is being  broadcast practically without supervision. The Main Commercial  Advertising Board was established only in May 1993.    There were cases in 1993 in which subunits were given  budgetary appropriations without accounting for the funds they  received from commercial activity. Thus, the Television  Program Board was allocated R38 million at the same time that  the studio's expenses were covered in full by the incomes  received from advertising activity. Some R21 million were  allocated without justification to the "Radio Podmoskovya"  studio as well. A spot check at five studios established that  the unpaid placement of advertising in 1992 added up to R45  million. In 1993, the liabilities totaled R441 million.    Incomes from commercial activity in 1993 amounted to R11.2  billion, although according to the expert assessment of the  sociological center of the RGTRK "Ostankino," the company  should have received no less than R60 billion in profit from  airing advertising alone. This estimate is confirmed by a  check made of activity following the purchase of a license to  air television serials in exchange for advertising time.    Estimates show that the RGTRK "Ostankino" could have  received  nearly R1.3 billion from the contract signed 16 February 1993 by  the company's acting director, I.Ye. Malashenko, with the  "Premyer SV" Advertising Agency for collaboration in purchasing  the rights to broadcast the television serial "Twin Peaks" from  the World Vision Company and to organize its showing on the  RGTRK channel (we will return to this in our concluding  remarks--NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA [NYeG]). This agency was  granted 120 minutes of advertising time, without the appropriate  economic accounting, for all 30 series of the film, which  amounts to a minimum of about R596 million when the total cost  of hiring the film was R159 million. Moreover, the "Premyer  SV" was given the exclusive right to select and place  advertising in the time belonging to the company (180 minutes)  with a 30-percent discount from the estimates; as a result of  this, the agency was provided with additional income totaling  R273 million. In 1993, some 27 minutes of the company's  advertising time were not used during the course of the  contract's implementation through the fault of the "Premyer SV."  However, demands were immediately made by the "Premyer SV"  Advertising Agency for an additional 69 minutes of advertising  time for the television serial's transfer to other time periods  during the election campaign, and this can bring it an income on  the order of R393 million. Despite the fact that this violation  was called "force majeure" circumstances (the circumstances were  favorable!--NYeG), because it was necessary to comply with the  Russian Federation President's Edict No. 1792 of 29 October  1993, the company met the agency's demand without reservation.  Moreover, it paid R57 million for the services of the Russian  Ministry of Communications for the advertising time actually  used. (Something else would have been strange: if the  advertising agencies were to bear responsibility for the  president's actions--NYeG).    With the connivance of the RGTRK "Ostankino" management, the  activity of commercial enterprises and institutions has been  neglected by the company's subunits. As of the beginning of  1994, founders have not had data at their disposal on the number  of enterprises and the payments made to their charter funds. The  company is not receiving income from the activity of commercial  structures.    During the audit of the RGTRK "Ostankino," the "VID"  Television Company, the "Intervid" Corporation, the Television  Technical Center, the "Vzglyad," "Telekanal 2x2," TV "Servis,"  "Sodeystviye," and a number of other enterprises directly  connected with television and radio broadcasting which  collaborate with the company were checked as well.    It was established that individual enterprises owe the  company for payment of services, and cases of nonpayment of  taxes were revealed as well. In accordance with the laws in  force, they have been charged additionally for payments to the  budget of R1.1 billion.    The court examination of the suit involving V.I. Bragin,  former chairman of the RGTRK "Ostankino," has continued for  nearly a year. At the same time, several judicial decisions have  been made by the Higher Arbitration Court. At the present time,  the statement registering a protest has been recalled by the  company's acting chairman, A.N. Yakovlev. The dispute continues  to be unsettled... (There is no question that the authors of the  report are much more competent than the court. This is a  customary privilege of those close to the president. Further  details in concluding remarks--NYeG.)    It has been established that some contracts not only do not  protect the company's economic interests, they are simply not  advantageous for it. Thus, a contract was signed on 7 October  1993 by the RGTRK "Ostankino" Studio for Children's and Young  People's Programs with the closed-type joint-stock company  "INMAK" and the Association to Promote the Development of  Children's Television (a limited partnership) to show publicity  subjects of the "INMAK" AO [Joint-Stock Company]. In this case,  the funds for airing the advertising should be transferred to  the current account of the association, which is not part of the  company's structure.    A contract signed on 12 July 1993 between the RGTRK  "Ostankino" (former Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Bandura) and the  "Jeronimo, Ltd." Firm for collaboration in purchasing the rights  to show films from television companies in West Europe and the  United States, as well as in organizing their showing on the  company's channels, provides for the income from advertising to  go into the foreign firm's current account.    In conformity with the "Supplement to the Gentlemen's  Agreement" made on 24 July 1993 by former RGTRK "Ostankino"  Deputy Chairman Yu.N. Bandura and Mr. (I. Amors), president of  the "Ostankino Development" Enterprise, 100 minutes of  advertising time are transferred to the company from this  enterprise at a price of $3,000 [presumably: per minute]. So the  enterprise sold the company a "commodity" which it did not  officially have at its disposal. Nevertheless, at the  instruction of the former managers of the RGTRK "Ostankino"  (V.I. Bragin and Yu.N. Bandura), the company transferred  $300,000 to the account of this enterprise in October 1993.    In 1993 the RGTRK "Ostankino" (former Chairman V.I. Bragin)  signed a contract with the "Kamaka" TOO [Limited Partnership]  for the firm's transcription of television materials and their  subsequent sale of the right to show them to commercial  television companies. In the period from July to December 1993,  the "Kamaka" TOO transferred 360 cassettes to the company  containing 432 programs, of which 382 were taken from the  Gosteleradiofond [USSR State Committee for Television and Radio  Broadcasting Holdings]. For this work, the firm received R25  million, that is, the funds were spent for transcribing programs  already existing in the state's holdings. The company has not  received any income from this contract to date.    The RGTRK "Ostankino" has received no profit from a  transaction concluded in 1992 with the American corporation  "U.S.S.U. Arts Group," which was granted the exclusive right to  use recordings of classical music stored in the archives of the  Gosteleradiofond (incidentally, the transaction was also  concluded by Yu. Bandura!--NYeG).    A founding contract has not been concluded yet between the  Russian Federation Government and the RGTRK "Ostankino" to  regulate relationships between the founder and the company, as  stipulated by the Statute on the Russian State Television and  Radio Company "Ostankino" and confirmed by the Russian  Federation President's Edict No. 421 of 2 April 1992 "On  guarantees to stabilize the information and activity of the  Russian State Television and Radio Company "Ostankino." The lack  of a unified concept in the field of state television and radio  broadcasting has led to the point that orientation of the  company's activity has been defined chiefly by the position of  its managers, seldom by the broadcast studios themselves. (So  that's where the problem lies!--especially with respect to Ye.  Yakovlev and "VID"--NYeG.)  <H8>  From the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Editorial Staff </H8>   Tha anonymous authors of the report, who gave a good  account of themselves at the start by identifying the completely  obvious problems of "Ostankino," fulfilled a social and  political order at the same time, in our view. Those Ostankino  characters who have been the most free in their judgments have  been the subject of administrative wrath first of all--the ones  from "VID" (we may wonder if the auditors were unaware of the  damage inflicted on "VID" by Bragin's excommunication of its  leaders), Yegor Yakovlev (The court decisions are of no concern  at all to the inspectors. They found in themselves the strength  and the right to declare him "illegal.") Of course, Malashenko  must be given a pat as well--the NTV which he heads is much more  liberal and talented than the official "Ostankino." And at the  same time, outside the limits of the report, which we are  publishing with certain abridgments, there is the reckless  private business of the technical employees, the fantastic  dimensions of "indirect advertising," and the studio corruption  leading to ordered slaughters. And most importantly, there is no  attempt made to explain why it was to the advantage of Bragin  and K [presumably: the company] to decentralize advertising and  close their eyes to Mr. Bandura's transactions.</p>

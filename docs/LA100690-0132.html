			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET CLAIMS BYPASS PANEL, COURT URGED  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court was urged Friday to allow job-bias claimants to  bypass the state's civil rights agency and file suit directly in court, where  they could obtain far larger damage awards.  </P> <P> Attorneys for two women who charged that their employer demanded sexual favors  as the price of keeping their jobs told the justices that state prohibitions  against employment discrimination permit such suits to deter bias.  </P> <P> "The highest expression of public policy in California is through its  Constitution . . . and the public policy of this state is against  discrimination," David C. Anton, a Berkeley lawyer representing civil rights  groups, said during a court hearing in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Attorneys for employers countered that workers charging bias should be required  to resort first to the state Fair Employment and Housing Department, the agency  established to review such claims, offer mediation and conciliation and promote  settlements. Those cases can result only in awards by the Fair Employment and  Housing Commission of back pay, reinstatement and compensatory damages --  although the commission's authority to award such damages is under challenge.  </P> <P> Steven G. Drapkin of Los Angeles, a lawyer for the Merchants and Manufacturers  Assn., said that sending bias claims to the agency promoted resolution of  disputes without resorting to the courts. "It gives employers who screw up an  opportunity to make ameliorative efforts," Drapkin said.  </P> <P> The case has drawn considerable attention from employers, who have expressed  concern that allowing claimants to bypass the agency will result in a flurry of  additional lawsuits seeking big punitive damage awards. One study showed that  California juries sided with employees in 70% of the cases, granting an average  award of $652,100 in one five-year period.  </P> <P> Employment-rights advocates reply that the threat of such punishment is the  best deterrent to wrongful acts by employers.  </P> <P> The case arose from a lawsuit by Emma Rojo and Teresa Maloney charging that  they suffered emotional distress from sexual harassment and improper demands by  Dr. Irwin H. Kliger of Los Angeles, their former employer. Kliger has denied  the allegations.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed the case because Rojo and Maloney  had failed to go first to the fair employment department. But a state Court of  Appeal reinstated the suit, saying the state Constitution allowed civil rights  claims to be filed directly in court.  </P> <P> The appellate panel called the agency's process "largely ineffectual," noting  that the overwhelming majority of the 8,000 cases filed annually were dropped,  settled or otherwise resolved without a formal hearing. Forcing claimants to go  through the department would "diminish, rather than enhance" their remedies for  discrimination, the panel said.  </P></p>

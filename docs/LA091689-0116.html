			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FANCY FOOTWORK RESCUES PRETENTIOUS JACKSON SHOW  </P> <P> Janet Jackson's ambitious new "telemusical," possessively titled "Janet  Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814," is much like the upcoming album of the same name  -- pretentious but fun. What little script there is in this half-hour "message"  film is deadly, but plenty of fancy footwork saves the day. (The expensive  project premieres on MTV at 6:30 tonight and airs again on Sunday and  Wednesday, never to be seen again till its Oct. 17 home video release).  </P> <P> The can-humans-really-do-that? choreography in the three dance numbers is on a  par with, and may even top, the best of brother Michael's hoof-happy videos.  "Miss You Much" is full of joy and giddy goofiness, and establishes shyly  grinning Janet -- a real team player in this big production number -- as  winsome and human after some of her earlier ice-goddess poses. "The Knowledge"  and "Rhythm Nation" are angrier performances; the former is a bravura solo  rooftop dance, with Jackson breaking windows and knocking over objects in rage  at the dying of the light.  </P> <P> What connects these numbers is an anti-drug story, unfortunately bolstered by  the glitziness-among-the-L.A.-ruins imagery of "Blade Runner." Director Dominic  Sena's slick penchant for neato futuristic grime hardly contributes any saving  realism to the drug saga.  </P> <P> Jackson intones some silly narration and spoken-word slogans in a voice that  renders her well-intentioned sincerity somewhat campy. When it comes to  pretentiousness, Janet, just say no! But the big-bass songs and the dazzling  dancing say what the hokey script can't. Her feet, her body, her grace and her  lightning speed are fine arguments for sobriety indeed. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

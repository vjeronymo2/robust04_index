			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Printing side leads surge at Quebecor QUEBECOR, the North American publishing and printing group, reported a sharp increase in second-quarter net profits. They jumped to CDollars 15.5m (USDollars 13m), or 28 cents a share, up 76 per cent on CDollars 8.8m, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales advanced to CDollars 616m, compared with CDollars 593m. First-half profits rose to CDollars 20.7m, or 37 cents a share, up from CDollars 11.1m, or 23 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.2bn, against CDollars 1.16bn. The latest period excluded a CDollars 48.5m special gain, which brought per-share earnings to CDollars 1.22. Commercial printing in Canada and the US turned in the best performance, but publishing and other sectors also delivered improved results. Quebecor includes 28 per cent of Donohue, a newsprint producer, in its figures.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Li Lanqing, member of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice  premier, on 7 April went to Beijing Agricultural University to  learn about the state of the educational reform and development  of the university. Li Lanqing took part in a discussion meeting  with leading cadres, teachers, and students of the university.  He expressed his hope that cadres, teachers, and students of  the school will continue their efforts to seriously carry out  educational reform, further improve teaching quality and  results, turn the school into a first-rate university in China,  and train more students and create more and better capable  people for the construction and development of agriculture.    Beijing Agricultural University was founded in 1949 by  combining the agricultural colleges of Beijing University,  Qinghua University, and Huabei University. It is directly under  the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture. It has  botanical, zoological, biological, resource and environment, and  four other colleges with a total of 29 departments. It also has  two national-class research institutes and 10 ministerial-level  laboratories and research institutes. In recent years, the  school has actively promoted educational reform in a  comprehensive manner. While strengthening work on teaching and  scientific research, the school has considered the  popularization of scientific research findings and the  development of new and high technologies as important functions  of the university. The university has played an important role  in promoting local agricultural construction, the "harvest  project," and the work of helping poor areas.    During the discussion meeting, Li Lanqing heard a report  made  by Shi Yuanchun, president of the university, and suggestions  from professors and experts on the reform of education. Li  Lanqing fully affirmed the work of the university in training  people to meet the needs of agriculture and developing and  popularizing scientific research findings. He said: The key to  China's agricultural development lies in having advanced  agricultural science and technology, and advanced agricultural  science and technology in turn rely on having trained people.  Our agricultural colleges and schools should become bases for  scientific research as well as bases for training people.  Beijing Agricultural University as a university with great  influence should shoulder a greater responsibility. He pointed  out that we must not overlook the study of basic agricultural  science because a good foundation in basic science can further  promote the development of applied agricultural science and  technology. At present, agricultural colleges and schools with  good conditions should start research on important subjects,  seek breakthroughs, and use their findings to promote  agricultural development.    Li Lanqing pointed out: The current reform of higher  education should place emphasis on raising the quality and  results of education. Therefore, we must change the past  pattern in running schools. We should avoid advocating small  but complete and should encourage colleges and schools with good  conditions to cooperate and jointly run schools so as to give  full play to the advantage of a group and create greater social  benefits. He said: Beijing Agricultural University has  conditions to cooperate with other schools in developing  education. Taking itself as the center, Beijing Agricultural  University should work together with related colleges and  schools to make more reasonable teaching arrangements and to  raise the quality and results of education.    Li Lanqing said: The training of agricultural technicians  should be conducted at various levels. The Ministry of  Agriculture should place emphasis on running well one or two key  universities to cultivate high-caliber professionals at an  advanced level. Meanwhile, it should also improve the existing  agricultural colleges and special and technical secondary  schools through reform and develop vocational and adult  education to promote the development of agriculture, science,  and education.    Prior to taking part in the discussion meeting, Li Lanqing  inspected an exhibition on scientific research achievements, the  library, and the agrobiology technology experimental station of  the university.    Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang; Xu Zhijian, State Council  deputy secretary general; and Wang Mingda, State Education  Commission vice minister, also took part in the discussion  meeting.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Change of strategy helps Cerus reduce net losses to FFr251m Cerus, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, achieved a sharp reduction in net losses last year, to FFr251m (Dollars 43.05m) from FFr1.55bn in 1992 The group said the improved performance reflected its strategy of focusing on industrial activities and cleaning up its finances. Mr de Benedetti said the company was 'in a position to prepare for take-off again'. The reduction followed reduced losses at its banking operations and a solid contribution from Valeo, the French vehicle components group in which Cerus holds a 30 per cent stake. Losses at Dumenil Leble, the group's banking operation, fell to FFr363m from FFr1.34bn. Cerus said that its management had been 're-centred' in France, Luxembourg and Belgium and that the bank's principal risks had been resolved. Cofir, the group's financial operation, contributed profits of FFr26bn, despite difficult conditions in Spain. A much larger contribution, of FFr206m, came from the group's investment in Valeo, despite the downturn in the European vehicle sector. Cerus described Valeo's prospects as 'particularly promising' and said its participation would remain at the centre of the group's strategy. In addition to curbing group losses, Cerus also achieved a sharp reduction in debts, partly through the sale of assets. Net debts, according to the group, were FFr108m at the end of last year, down from FFr1.45bn at the end of 1992.</p>

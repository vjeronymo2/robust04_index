			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (3): Tough battle ahead to cut deficit - The economy / Nominal convergence is a priority Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government, proud of what it considers assiduous efforts to discipline the Portuguese economy, has been stung by proposals for a variable-speed Europe. 'We don't like the idea of a two-track Europe,' Fernando Faria de Oliveira, trade and tourism minister, told foreign bankers recently. 'Experience shows that once you drop behind the pack, it's difficult to catch up again.' The possibility raised in Germany and France that some European Union countries could move towards monetary union ahead of others is almost certain to strengthen Portugal's determination to try to achieve nominal convergence - the lowering of inflation, budget deficits, public debt and interest rates to meet the target for monetary union set by the European Commission. Mr Cavaco Silva gave an indication of his resolve on this issue in October when he refused to agree to a trade union demand for a 5 per cent national wage increase in 1995 as the starting point for a five-year social pact between government, employers and unions. More indulgence would have been understandable, considering the government's re-election next October is far from assured. But the prime minister drove the point home in a speech to trade unionists immediately after the negotiations on a social accord collapsed. 'If we lose the battle to reduce our budget deficit, Portugal will forfeit the political weight required to defend its interests within the European Union,' he warned. Added to the risk of a multispeed Europe that would inevitably leave Portugal behind the leaders, the government also has to consider that from this year the provision of EU aid from the Cohesion Fund, to help poorer member states catch up, is being linked directly to the attainment of budget deficit targets as delineated by their convergence plans. The budget deficit is the area of nominal convergence where Portugal faces the most difficulty. Good progress was being made until 1993, when the public sector borrowing requirement jumped to 7.2 per cent of GDP from 3.3 per cent the previous year. The onset of recession in the second half of 1992 contributed to the increase, but the main cause was a virtual breakdown of the tax-collecting machine. A deficit of 6.9 per cent of GDP was originally set for 1994, but higher than expected tax revenue has enabled Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, to cut this to 6.4 per cent. The budget for 1995 tables a deficit of 5.8 per cent. This is based on forecast GDP growth of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, up from 1.1 per cent this year, and average annual inflation of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, down from an expected 5.3 per cent in 1994. 'The 1995 deficit target is at the absolute top end of what is allowed under Portugal's convergence programme,' says Sally Wilkinson, London-based southern Europe economist with Union Bank of Switzerland. 'The government could have set a lower target but, by being pessimistic, they are giving themselves leeway either to outperform expectations or to grant an interim pay award.' Such an award would be made shortly before the election. Portugal is making more rapid progress in cutting inflation. The average annual rate will have fallen by about 3.6 points in the two years to the end of 1994, to 5.3 per cent. The year-on-year rate will then be about 4.5 per cent, a 25-year low, and is already equal to that in Spain. The fall is due to a relatively strong currency, depressing the inflationary component of Portugal's high level of imports, combined with a cut in real disposable income and depressed demand during the recession. Miguel Namorado Rosa, an economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, is less confident that the government's more optimistic inflation target for next year can be met. An inflation rate of 3.5 per cent is virtually unknown in Portugal and would be lower than that forecast for Spain. He sees stronger domestic demand and wage rises placing increasing pressure on inflation, with strains on industrial capacity beginning to be felt by 1996. A stable escudo and falling inflation have enabled the central bank to begin a cautious lowering of interest rates, an important factor in helping to relaunch economic recovery. Overnight rates are about 170 basis points above those in Spain although there is no longer an inflation differential. Antonio de Sousa, governor of the Bank of Portugal, says the bank will continue to be prudent in lowering money market rates, keeping exchange rate stability as its priority. 'Reductions in interest rates have to be gradual and the market has to lead the way not the central bank,' he says. 'Rates are at an historic low in Portugal and moving downwards. The tendency is what is fundamental for the competitiveness of companies.' Efforts are under way, he says, to improve the financial reporting and accounting of the small and medium-sized companies that dominate the Portuguese economy to reduce risk premiums on bank loans and thus lower their financial costs. Concern over nominal convergence is a political and face-saving issue for governments as much as an economic one. Vitor Constancio, a former finance minister and formerly leader of the opposition Socialist Party, believes that, in economic terms, Portugal need not be overly concerned about the targets. He considers the level of public debt, 67.3 per cent of GDP in 1993, and the budget deficit to be compatible with Portugal's long-term effort to achieve real convergence, that is, to catch up with the output level of the rest of Europe. That effort will receive an important impetus in December when AutoEuropa, a Es450bn joint-venture by Ford and Volkswagen, begins production of a new multipurpose vehicle at a plant in Palmela, 30km south of Lisbon. Mr Constancio estimates vehicles produced at the factory, which has directly created 5,000 new jobs and perhaps double that number indirectly, will account for about 20 per cent of Portugal's total manufactured exports, representing 1 per cent or more of GDP.</p>

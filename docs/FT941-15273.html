			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife can sell shares I have obtained from the Inland Revenue leaflet number CGT 15, A Guide For Married Couples in respect of Capital Gains Tax. It is my understanding from reading this document that if I transfer a shareholding, currently in my name, to my wife, the shares may then be sold in my wife's name in order legitimately to make use of her CGT allowance. Furthermore if the sale is then split, part of it before April 5, 1994, and the rest after, it would appear that total gains of approximately Pounds 10,000 could be free of CGT. Given that my own allowance has been fully utilised, this seems to be a sensible option to take. Is this correct in your opinion? Your choice of words (such as 'sold in my wife's name' rather than simply 'sold by my wife') suggests that you are not contemplating making a bona fide outright gift of shares to your wife, but merely using her as a nominee or puppet to realise funds which will find their way back to you, albeit indirectly. However, if you propose to give your wife some measure of financial independence by making outright gifts of shares to her, then the answer is yes: if she decides to sell some of the gifted shares on or before April 5 and others after, she will have two annual exempt amounts of Pounds 5,800 to set against her chargeable gains. We recommend that the proceeds, and any dividends arising after the gifts, be credited to an account in your wife's sole name (to which you have no access), so that it is clear that none of the money can be construed as for your ultimate benefit. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

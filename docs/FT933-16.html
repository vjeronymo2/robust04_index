			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (29): On a wing and a smile - Civil Aviation EARLY this year I arrived a few minutes late at Bombay Airport for an Indian Airlines flight and was told to come back for the next flight the next day. Though other passengers were still standing at the security check, I was not allowed to join them. Last month, I reached the airport 15 minutes before take-off and was escorted on to the aircraft. Few Indian industries have changed so fast since the onset of economic liberalisation as aviation. Since private airlines started operating regular services at the end of last year, the quality of air travel has changed out of all recognition in India. This shows how quickly competition can improve services even when the private operators are small in comparison with the state-owned enterprise. The most telling lesson has been the improvement in Indian Airlines' own services. 'Competition is working. It is changing us,' says Mr K. Lal, commercial director of Indian Airlines. 'They (the private companies) are not a threat but a challenge. We have to show we are professionals.' Indian Airlines has no time to lose, for the government last month allowed foreign airlines to invest in India's private operators. Competition is bound to hot up if the private companies are able to secure support from foreign airlines, with their long experience of international service. Already one company, Jet Airways, is seeking permission for Gulfair and Kuwait Airways to invest in its expansion. Mr S. Kanungo, the civil aviation ministry's top bureaucrat, called last month for foreign investment in the aviation sector. He said such investment offered 'attractive returns, particularly due to India's vast tourism potential and liberalisation measures initiated in the past two years'. Four airlines have emerged as serious rivals to Indian Airlines - Jet, East West Airlines, Damiana Airways and Modiluft. Together they now have about 20 per cent of the domestic passenger market. But on the lucrative routes between India's main cities their share is 37 per cent, according to Indian Airlines' figures. The private operators will do even better as they bring more aircraft into service. Modiluft, for example, has just two jets leased from Lufthansa, the German carrier with which it has a collaboration agreement. Among the improvements pioneered by the private operators are on-time flights, flexible check-in services, in-flight-drinks, top-class meals and smiles from the cabin staff. They have captured the imagination of travellers despite various bureaucratic hurdles still in their way. The Air Corporation Act of 1953, which bans private companies from operating scheduled services, is still in force. It is due to be amended in parliament later this year. Until then, the new companies cannot openly advertise their timetables. One private airline owner complains: 'The government has given us permission to operate to schedules, but we are still not allowed to advertise our schedules. What's worse, we are misleadingly called 'air taxi operators' even though we are for all purposes, full-fledged private airlines.' MPs loyal to Indian Airlines and its powerful trade unions are fighting a rearguard action to protect the airline. But they can at best delay change, not reverse it. The real battle is now in the skies. Indian Airlines, which lost Rs2.11bn in the year to last March and has not made a profit since 1988, has little money to spend on a price war. So, as Mr Lal says, it must improve quality. The airline has improved its time-keeping. It has extended computerised check-in facilities. It has introduced better food and drink services (although it is not serving alcohol) and it has put staff through an intensive course in service. Mr Lal says that simple things make a big difference. He picks up a file and holds it in front of him like a tray. You can serve drinks like this, he says, with a scowl on his face. Or like this, his mouth opening into a broad smile. Then Mr Lal picks up the telephone. You can answer a call like this, he says, growling into the receiver. Or you can answer it like this: 'Good morning, this is Indian Airlines. How can I help you?' Indian Airlines is also rethinking its marketing. It is introducing long-distance fares which give passengers a discount if they travel the whole way by Indian Airlines and is launching package holidays. It has signed an agreement to join Mega Sierra, an international computerised booking network. And it is planning a frequent flyer programme. The airline can cope even with the possible advent of foreign airlines into the domestic market, says Mr Lal. 'If foreign airlines are permitted to compete, we would like to co-operate with foreign airlines too.' The big cloud on Mr Lal's horizon is relations with the trade unions representing the airline's 22,000 staff. For the last two years, the pilots have called strikes in the winter in support of demands for better pay and conditions. The pilots complain that their counterparts at other airlines are more highly paid and want parity. Last winter's strike cost the airline dearly because it gave the private operators a free run at the market. Another strike this year could be ruinous because the private airlines are now operating on a larger scale. Mr Lal says: 'I look at the future and it looks bright, as long as this winter passes off peacefully.'</p>

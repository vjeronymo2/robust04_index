			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths perks stores sector with strong sales The post-Christmas round of retailers' trading statements began well yesterday with news from Goldsmiths, the jewellers, of a 19 per cent increase in total sales and a 12 per cent like-for-like rise in the month to December 24. Shares in Goldsmiths, which has 117 branches in the UK trading under names such as Walker &amp; Hall and Northern Goldsmiths, gained 6p to 133p. The statement, coupled with reports of a strong start to the post-Christmas sales across the UK, gave a boost to the stores sector, which had fared badly in December amid fears of poor trading. Goldsmiths said total sales for the 11 months to December 24 were up 13.3 per cent, and like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, increased 11.4 per cent. However, Mr Jurek Piasecki, chairman and chief executive, said he believed the sales increases were due more to improvements in Goldsmiths' business and changes in the jewellery market than to any improvement in consumer confidence. 'I don't think any of it is a reflection of underlying confidence. Things are still very sticky,' he said. 'People are still concerned that interest rates are going to go through the roof.' Mr Piasecki said Goldsmiths had gained market share through investing in systems and improving its product range, while the number of jewellery outlets in the UK had fallen by more than one third in the past 10 years.</p>

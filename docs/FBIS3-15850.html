			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Spirit of Political Innocence..."] </F>   [Excerpts] Since the fifth round of talks between Lithuania  and Poland on the interstate agreement is over, we can finally  say with relief -- it seems that we have the treaty. We say "it  seems," because politicians get down to work after diplomats  finish their job, and the aims of the first often differ from  those of the latter. Therefore, it is not accidental that on  Tuesday [22 February], Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas, who  heads the delegation for negotiations, evaded a definite reply  to RESPUBLIKA's straight question whether this really meant  accomplished work. "We coordinated everything what can be  coordinated on the level of deputy ministers," such was his  diplomatic reply. One should interpret it in this way: We have  done our job, but will politicians like the result...?  Certainly, not all of them. Negotiations with Poland have  become one of Lithuania's protracted foreign policy myths, as  well as a yielding cow from which most of our radicals like to  milk political dividends. The Poles are insidious invaders who  day and night think about recovering Vilnius occupied by  Zeligowski in 1920. They began to hammer this idea into  people's heads long before the declaration of independence.  Certainly, there is no fire without smoke. However, Lithuanian  political radicals exaggerate Poland's interests in the Vilnius  region (anyway, several thousand Poles live here). Some of  these enthusiasts looked for and, of course, found certain  parallels with Nazi activities in the Klaipeda region in the  1930's.    Our patriotically disposed countrymen did not even consider  that the situation in the late 20th century in Europe is  different from that in the third decade. [passage omitted]  Frontiers are falling. Although with creaks, Europe is  uniting. Lithuania is also declaring its intention to become a  member of the European Union and sign a free trade agreement  with it. Even our greatest "Polophobes" approve this. However,  one simple truth seems to escape their heads for some reason --  we can reach the long-desired Europe only through our western  neighbor -- Poland. Therefore, even the staunchest advocates of  Lithuanian "Eurocentrism" should understand that normalizing our  relations with Poland and signing a bilateral agreement is  primarily more in our interest than in theirs. Instead of  assuming the position of insulted historical innocence, we  should demonstrate more flexibility and not try to revive the  70-year-old specter of Zeligowski. If we want to become  civilized Europeans, we should behave according to their  standards. [passage omitted]    In the current draft treaty coordinated by diplomats, Poland  recognizes Vilnius as the capital of Lithuania and condemns  certain historical events in the preamble.    However, this is insufficient for those Polish and  Lithuanian  politicians who feed on political disputes. On the day of  negotiations, the Polish Catholic daily SLOWO published an open  letter to Polish leaders, demanding that special guarantees for  Lithuania's Poles be incorporated in the treaty. In the  authors' opinion, first of all, such guarantees should be  considered in the talks between the Polish Government and the  Lithuanian Poles' Union. One could ignore this letter, if the  author was not the blatant and influential organization "Kresy"  [territory to the east of Poland formerly under its rule].    Yesterday, we could hear some Lithuanian voices cautiously  condemning the treaty as well. Former Foreign Minister A.  Saudargas, member of the Christian Democratic Party, deemed it a  "unilateral concession" at yesterday's press conference.  [passage omitted]    We would like to draw the attention of all future critics to  the following fact -- on the day when V. Domarkas was shaking  hands with I. Biczewski [Polish deputy foreign minister], the  latter's chief [Olechowski] was greeting the Russian foreign  minister [Kozyrev]. Judging by the comments on Polish  television, Moscow is operatively improving its relations with  Warsaw. If the latter's ties with Russia really strengthen,  while those with Vilnius deteriorate, in what situation will  Lithuania find itself? It is worth remembering that before  World War II the "Baltic Entente" was not established only  because of Lithuania's difficult relations with Poland. This  was useful to the USSR and Germany alone. Do Lithuania's great  patriots want this situation to recur?</p>

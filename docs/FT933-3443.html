			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: The Recruiting Officer - Theatre The Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh has a high profile during the three weeks of the city's festival - and then suddenly shrinks back to merely local significance. A pity, for its old auditorium is handsome, its stage well-equipped and its foyer space (expanded two years ago) attractive. The theatre's reputation, however, may be starting to rise. Its recently appointed artistic director, Kenny Ireland, has just launched the 1993-94 season with a deft, traditional, funny staging of Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer. The season will include Maureen Lipman directing The Sunshine Boys, Brian Cox acting in The Master Builder, Bill Paterson in Bulgakov's A Mongrel's Heart, and Ireland's stagings of A Midsummer Night's Dream and Oedipus Tyrannos. Ireland keeps A Recruting Officer light and vivid. I came to it straight from watching the movie of Much Ado, and could not help noting how much smaller Farquhar's comic world is than Shakespeare's, how much narrower his tone. The trick of Restoration comedy is to make its tight little world real and brilliant. Ireland gives his actors enough period sense to make it real and he differentiates each character sharply while giving them all vigour. Brilliance is only fully present in one impersonation - Bob Barrett's playing of Captain Brazen. Brazen, a secondary role, is all irrepressible presumption and namedropping cocksureness; and Barrett bursts onto the stage with such fruity big-voiced glee, such silly round-faced panache, that he almost unbalances the play. But not quite. As Silvia, Jules Melvin brings off the feat of acting en travesti with convincing style; and Rebecca Charles, playing Melinda as a pettish spoilt parlour pug, grows endearingly vulnerable as the play proceeds. As Plume, Phelim Drew has energy, manner, but not enough refinement; as Worthy, Patrick Toomey has refinement but not enough energy. The strength of the production owes much to Russell Craig's designs, which use the revolving stage to create several different interior and exterior scenes economically but surely; and a dozen extras swell the crowd scenes to fine effect. Ireland allows his cast to misinterpret some small points but at all points the play keeps up brisk pace, colourful characterisation, and high spirits.</p>

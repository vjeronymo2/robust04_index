			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PHILLIES END METS' HOME WIN STREAK AT 11  </P> <P> It figured that when the New York Mets' home winning streak ended, there would  be a left-handed pitcher involved.  </P> <P> Rookie left-hander Pat Combs held the Mets to four hits Friday night as the  Philadelphia Phillies scored a 4-1 victory that ended the Mets' 11-game Shea  Stadium winning streak.  </P> <P> The Mets are 23-28 when left-handers start against them.  </P> <P> Combs, ejected in his previous start at Shea on Aug. 9 when he hit Dwight  Gooden with a pitch and precipitated a brawl, gave up a home run to Howard  Johnson in the second inning but otherwise was in charge. The 6-foot-4 Combs  (8-9) was leading, 3-1, when he hit Gooden to start the fifth inning in the  previous effort.  </P> <P> The Phillies' Lenny Dykstra scored a run, drove in a run and regained the  league batting lead at .336. Dale Murphy hit his 22nd home run and the Phillies  beat Sid Fernandez (9-13), who struck out 12 in 7 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> The Mets, who had won four in a row, remained 1 1/2 games behind the Pittsburgh  Pirates, who also lost, in the National League East.  </P> <P> Combs, 23, was 4-0 when he came up late last season. Four of his 12 victories  have come at the expense of the Mets.  </P> <P> "I don't think it was a letdown after beating the Pirates," said the Mets'  Darryl Strawberry, who was hitless in four at-bats, striking out twice. "He  just made some good pitches."  </P> <P> Said Combs: "I am surprised. I didn't have it warming up. I was all over the  bullpen. But from the first pitch I was good."  </P> <P> Montreal 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- There are two major factors keeping the Pirates  from taking charge in the East.  </P> <P> First is their inability to beat the Expos, against whom they are 5-11. The  other is their inability to find a late-inning stopper.  </P> <P> In a desperate move at Montreal, the Pirates brought starter Neal Heaton to try  to save a 2-1 lead for Bob Walk. Walk gave up five hits in seven innings,  didn't walk a batter and struck out five.  </P> <P> Heaton retired the first two Expos, but walked Delino DeShields. Tim Wallach  doubled home the tying run and rookie Larry Walker followed with his 18th home  run.  </P> <P> Walker said he wasn't trying to hit a home run and the left-handed Heaton said  he wasn't trying to throw a strike to the left-handed-hitting rookie.  </P> <P> "I was trying to get him to chase a pitch in the dirt, but I got it up," Heaton  said.  </P> <P> The Pirates' Barry Bonds hit two home runs and a double against rookie  left-hander Brian Barnes, who otherwise was impressive in his debut.  </P> <P> Houston 2, San Francisco 1 -- Mark Portugal (9-10) overcame early wildness at  Houston to beat the Giants for the sixth time in seven decisions.  </P> <P> Portugal, who gave up four hits in six innings, walked five before being  replaced by Juan Agosto.  </P> <P> Rookie Karl Rhodes doubled twice against Kelly Downs and scored both runs. The  Giants fell to third and trail the Cincinnati Reds by 6 1/2 games.  </P> <P> Portugal's 23 scoreless innings at the Astrodome ended in the fourth inning  when Ernest Riles singled in the Giants' run.  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Chicago 2 -- The Cardinals' new center fielder, Ray Lankford, had  three hits and Pedro Guerrero doubled him home twice at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Cub shortstop Shawon Dunston was sidelined after suffering an injured left  shoulder in a pregame fight with teammate Marvell Wynne.  </P> <P> Atlanta 7, San Diego 3 -- Jim Presley doubled home the first of five Brave runs  in the fourth inning at Atlanta and homered in the next inning.

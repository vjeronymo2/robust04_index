			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Funding plea for inner London hospital shake-up SIR Bernard Tomlinson, author of a report recommending widespread changes to London's hospital service, said yesterday he had told ministers there must be 'major injections of money' to make his proposals work. He defended his plan to reduce the number of hospital beds in the capital - shifting resources to family doctor and community services - at a National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in London. Without rationalisation, he said, hospitals would become unviable and his proposal for planned closures would be replaced by unplanned closures of beds. Sir Bernard's terms of reference did not involve producing detailed costings of closure proposals and he would be disturbed if changes were approved 'on the basis of back-of-the-envelope calculations'. Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC, who headed an inquiry by the King's Fund health policy centre into London hospital provision, endorsed Sir Bernard's call for adequate funding. 'There does have to be serious money up front to fund the necessary investments in primary and community care health services,' he told the conference. Critics have two concerns about the financial implications of the proposals to reduce hospital beds in the capital, on which ministers will make final decisions next month. One is the absence of evaluations of individual closure recommendations. The other is a fear that, with a sharp decline in London land and property values, closures will not release sufficient funds to finance proposed improvements in community services. The difficulty of making closure proposals ahead of detailed evaluation has been illustrated by the Tomlinson report's recommendation to move the specialist Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden hospitals into the buildings of Charing Cross hospital. North West Thames regional health authority calculated that that would Pounds 10.6m cheaper than closing the Charing Cross and leaving the other hospitals in their existing premises. But a study by Ernst &amp; Young, management consultants, says the net capital cost of closing the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden instead of Charing Cross would be between Pounds 47.4m and Pounds 62.5m. Ernst &amp; Young says about Pounds 52m-worth of work would be needed at Charing Cross to enable the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden to move in. 'A full investment appraisal will need to be carried out to determine whether such an investment is commercially sound and will deliver a satisfactory rate of return on capital,' says the report, commissioned by the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden. Taking a 10-year payback at 6 per cent Treasury discount rate, Ernst &amp; Young says, an investment of Pounds 52m would require annual savings of more than Pounds 7m. Another argument over the statistical basis of the Tomlinson proposals broke out when Sir Bernard told managers and medical staff from St Bartholomew's - one of those recommended for closure - 'you are very much worse off than you think you are'. He said recent figures showed that by the end of the financial year the hospital's position would be 'precarious in the extreme', with a likely overspend approaching Pounds 10m. Prof Michael Besser, St Bartholomew's chief executive, responded by producing information from North East Thames regional health authority which, he said, proved Bart's was more efficient than other leading north-east London hospitals. There was, he said, a 'major inconsistency' in the Tomlinson report saying hospitals' survival depended on efficiency while recommending the closure of the one with the 'best record of efficiency' in inner north-east London.</p>

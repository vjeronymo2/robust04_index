			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY COMPILES TIPS ON REDUCING TRASH  </P> <P> As part of a campaign to inform residents about a new recycling program, the  city has compiled a list of tips for reducing the amount of garbage generated  by each household.  </P> <P> The tips, published in the city hall newsletter, include buying products in  bulk quantities with minimal, recyclable packaging; avoiding disposable items  such as Styrofoam, paper plates or disposable diapers, and donating used  appliances and furniture to charities so the items can be used again.  </P> <P> The city General Services Department has also provided the name of a company  that offers to remove names from some bulk mail lists to reduce the amount of  paper thrown away as junk mail. Interested residents can write to the Mail  Preference Service, Direct Marketing Assn., Six E. 43rd St., P.O. Box 3861,  Grand Central Station. New York, N.Y. 10163-3861.  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (3): Power shifts to outsider - Stephen Fidler on the impact of a period of political change PRESIDENT Carlos Menem has made a deliberate effort to transform Argentina's economic future with, so far, beneficial results. He is also presiding over a political change which is often less deliberate and the effects of which are significantly more uncertain. Some aspects of this change are linked to the new priorities of the government's economic reform programme; some to President Menem's methods of government; others to a long-term decline of traditional power bases: the military, the trade unions and the church. 'Menem has atomised the traditional corporations of the state,' says one western diplomat in Buenos Aires, 'but a clear picture of what will replace them has yet to emerge.' Although a Peronist, Mr Menem is from the poor state of La Rioja and thus an outsider at the centre of power. This in itself is a challenge to traditional Argentine politics. Moreover, his economic policy has made the old divisions of political parties less meaningful. While his use of patronage has meant that dissent within his own party is practically non-existent, the success of economic reform has made it difficult for the main opposition Radical Party to argue for a coherent alternative. To suggest that the government's economic policy is wrong looks like an argument for hyperinflation. The economic policy has also weakened the trade unions. In common with their counterparts in many other countries across Latin America and in the industrialised world, trade unions have lost power. They will lose more as reform continues. Privatisation and bureaucratic reform have already meant a large-scale reduction of the workforce in the highly-unionised public sector, a process that will continue over the next year. The government is also seeking to weaken centralised collective bargaining and to reform the corrupt system under which unions provide medical services to members. While some industrialists argue that the unions they face are still powerful, others say that they see evidence of increasing flexibility on the shopfloor which is helping to undermine the traditional trade union leadership. The church remains a relatively popular institution, but it too has appeared divided in the face of the economic programme. Meanwhile, the military - especially the army - still languishes under the humiliation of its defeat in the South Atlantic war 10 years ago. Its capability has also been reduced by a lack of spending: much big equipment appears not to function while salaries are so low that many military personnel have a second job. While comparisons with Venezuela might suggest a dangerously unstable military, the likelihood of a coup in Argentina is now considered remote, particularly since the civilian government offers the prospect of economic stability. Furthermore, because of the new slant in Argentine foreign policy, the armed forces, or at least parts of it, can begin to develop a more professional role. This was exemplified by the decision to send two warships to the Gulf as part of the US-led coalition against Iraq, and a contingent of 800 men being sent as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia. Economic reform has also thrown into relief some of the shortcomings of Argentine political institutions. Privatisation, done properly, and the new discipline imposed on the central bank should reduce the opportunity for large-scale corruption. But corruption will be harder to root out on a smaller scale: in the police, in the courts and among the officials in central and provincial governments with whom Argentines still have to deal on a daily basis. A weak legal system is often cited as an obstacle to foreign investment which is an important part of the government's long-term economic policy. The system suffers from a lack of finance, which encourages corruption among some judges. It is almost entirely based on written presentation, severely delaying legal process. (In September, an important experiment will start with oral public hearings). Mr Menem has also called into question the independence of the judiciary from the executive by packing of the Supreme Court in 1989. Judicial reform is one possible aspect of the constitutional reform now being widely discussed in Buenos Aires. However, cynics say that Mr Menem's interest in the subject may be mainly a result of his wish to stand again as president when his term ends in 1995. He is currently barred from doing this under the constitution. Mr Menem denies this, however. 'This is not a Peronist project or a project of Carlos Menem,' he said. 'It's an old project that was begun by the Radical party', which held the presidency before Mr Menem took power. At the moment, there seem few obvious rivals to Mr Menem, except for Mr Domingo Cavallo, his economy minister. The opposition Radical Party is divided into three groups, one of which supports the former president Mr Raul Alfonsin, who is seen as unlikely to re-emerge as a political force. The more 'modern' incarnations of the Radical Party are led by Mr Fernando de la Rua, now running for election as senator for the Federal District of Buenos Aires, and Mr Eduardo Angeloz, governor of Cordoba province. Both are seen as relatively reliable but neither has yet to carve out a strong image as a potential president. Whoever is the next president, Argentina's opening up to the outside world should help to provide incentives against reversing reform. For example, any veering away from financial orthodoxy is likely to be punished by the international financial markets. Meanwhile, privatisation and other economic reforms should make it more difficult to defraud the state through the corruption that became endemic in the 1980s. Nonetheless, Argentina needs time to complete its institutional reform and that time can only be bought through continuing stability in the economy. That, for now, depends heavily on a powerful president, whose political instincts are acute but essentially populist, and on a couple of his ministers.</p>

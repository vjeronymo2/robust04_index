			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Banks agree Pounds 260m rescue for MGN: Eve-of-results package eases pressure on newspaper group THE IMMEDIATE financial pressure on Mirror Group Newspapers eased last night with the announcement that the company's banks had finalised a Pounds 260m financial package. The deal comes on the eve of the newspaper group's first accounts today since it was floated on the Stock Exchange last May. The Pounds 260m refinancing has been provided by a small group of banks led by National Westminster and Midland Bank. MGN, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, The People, Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, said yesterday the two-year credit facility 'strengthens the group and provides financial stability for the future'. In addition, leasing finance of around Pounds 180m remains in place. MGN has been trading profitably, in spite of Mr Robert Maxwell's death, and is expected to announce trading profits of around Pounds 80m today. Money missing from the MGN accounts, losses suffered by its pension funds and a series of Maxwell deals charged to the MGN accounts are likely to lead to losses of around Pounds 300m. The costs range from a loss on the sale of a stake in the Canadian commercial printing company, Quebecor Printing, to a Pounds 24m loan attributable to MGN for the large financing and consultancy charges being paid to banks. Since December the majority stake in the newspaper group, which was owned by Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests, has been in administration. The stake is effectively controlled by a group of banks because the MGN shares were pledged as collateral for other loans. Mr John Talbot, of Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell interests, has said he has no plans to sell the stake. Today's accounts should give some indication about the financial health of MGN. The company wants its shares, suspended at 125p in early December, to be relisted although this is thought unlikely for at least another two weeks. A relisting would almost certainly see a sharp fall in the share price. Up to nine groups are believed to have expressed an interest in buying MGN, including a management buy-out team led by Sir Peter Parker, former chairman of British Rail, Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, and Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group.</p>

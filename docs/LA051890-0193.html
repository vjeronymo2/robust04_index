			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GENERAL DYNAMICS PREPARED TO LAY OFF 7,000 OF WORK FORCE  </P> <P> Ruling out diversification into the highly competitive civilian aviation field,  a senior official of General Dynamics Corp. said today the company would prefer  to lay off about 7,000 employees in face of deeper defense budget cuts.  </P> <P> In an interview published in today's Ft.  </P> <P> Worth Star-Telegram, Charles Anderson, vice president and general manager of  the company that makes F-16 fighter planes, said General Dynamics is not  prepared to risk financial disaster by switching to commercial jet liners to  make up for the lost defense business.  </P> <P> "The commercial world is not as rosy out there as everybody thinks it is," said  Anderson, who is in charge of General Dynamics's Ft. Worth division where the  F-16s are made. "It's easy for people to say you ought to diversify, but the  main problem is it takes a tremendous amount of cash."  </P> <P> General Dynamics, headquartered in St. Louis, has already laid off 350 workers  from the F-16 production line in the past month. Anderson said the company,  however, will continue to make military planes at the Ft. Worth facility where  32,000 people work.  </P></p>

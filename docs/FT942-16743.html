			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Agreement on workers' rights removes hurdle to Gatt accord The US and developing countries yesterday settled a bitter dispute over workers' rights which had threatened to overshadow the signing of a global trade accord at next week's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh, Morocco. The US had demanded that a formal declaration planned for the meeting should commit the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the Gatt next year, to discussing links between trade and labour standards. The demand was strongly opposed by most developing countries, which feared it was a pretext to erect trade barriers against them. The aggressiveness of the US approach was also criticised by the European Union. In a compromise negotiated in Geneva, the US has accepted that the declaration should go ahead without any mention of workers' rights. However, other Gatt delegations have agreed in principle that the issue should be aired in the preparatory committee which will draw up the WTO's agenda. Developing countries have also said they will not object to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US special trade representative, stressing in Marrakesh the importance the Clinton administration attaches to labour standards. The US and other countries said they were satisfied with yesterday's settlement. 'It's enough to say (the issue) is on the agenda and we're beginning,' Mr Kantor said. A delegate from a large developing country said: 'The outcome met everybody's biggest concerns, without requiring anyone to give up anything substantial.' Washington appears confident that several leading trading powers, including the EU, Japan and Sweden, will support its call for an early debate on workers' rights in the WTO preparatory committee. However, it still seems undecided on the tactics to adopt. US officials believe they need to do more to persuade other delegations that they are not seeking a backdoor way to erect trade barriers. Mr Kantor repeatedly emphasised yesterday that the US would oppose the use of workers' rights as a 'protectionist tool'. The issue will have to compete for attention with a growing list of other proposals. Mood swings and trade winds, Page 17</p>

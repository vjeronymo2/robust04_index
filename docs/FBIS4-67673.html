			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 2 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Ministry  of Health is setting up special centres in government hospitals  for prostitutes who are HIV carriers, the Minister Lee Kim Sai  said here Saturday. The centres would also provide  rehabilitation programmes to help them change their lifestyle  and dissuade them from returning to their trade.    At present, 140 prostitutes, including 100 foreigners, have  been detained and found to be infected with HIV, the virus which  causes AIDS, he told reporters in Seremban, about 60 km south of  here.    Lee said all the foreign prostitutes would be repatriated to  their country of origin while the 40 local prostitutes would be  sent to the centres. [Words indistinct] government had  allocated RM [Malaysian ringgit] 218 million [words indistinct]  for AIDS prevention activities and awareness campaigns for a  three-year period beginning 1993.    There were now 7,000 HIV carriers in Malaysia, 85 per cent  of  whom were drug addicts, who formed the majority of the 150-200  HIV carriers detected monthly.    He said the most prominent problem in the AIDS prevention  campaign in the country was to convince the high risk groups to  change their habit and lifestyle.    Lee also said that the country's infant mortality rate had  been reduced from 13 per 1,000 during the Fifth Malaysia Plan  period (1985-1990) to 11 per 1,000 at present.</p>

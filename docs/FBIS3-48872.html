Even Honda Motor Co., considered typical  of one of the more successful operations, has been losing steam  these days. While U.S. carmakers are enjoying a comeback, Honda  hopes to regain its footing with its new model Accord. But even  with the high yen, if Honda hopes to maintain its present work  force at home, it will have to continue exporting some of its  cars from Japan, thus putting restraints on its competitiveness  and the "localization" of its products.    Along with the Civic, the new Accord, which came out  yesterday (2 September [1993]), is one of the company's leading  models and is important for the company, especially in the  United States. There, of the 770,000 Honda cars sold in 1992,  Accords accounted for 390,000 units, or one-half of all sales.  Honda's goal is to sell 375,000 of the new model Accords in the  United States on an annual basis, compared to 48,000 on the  domestic market.    However, to beat the Big Three--General Motors Corp. (GM),  Ford Motor Co., and Chrysler Corp.--will not be easy. U.S. cars  are improving in quality and Japanese cars have lost their  almost religious following. U.S. carmakers are also now on top  in terms of having cut costs through restructuring, including  wide personnel cutbacks.    At Honda, "costs have been cut at the source," according  President Nobuhiko Kawamoto, and the company is now clearly  taking a course that will give precedence to profits over market  shares. The first step in that strategy is to further localize  its operations. Thus, there were some 61 U.S. parts makers  directly involved with the new model Accord this time from the  development stage on. Two years ago, when the Civic was brought  out, there were only 20 such companies. Honda has also raised  its local sourcing from 75 percent to 82 percent. Compared to  its 1993 models, 64 additional local companies are supplying  parts, raising the total number of such supplies to 320  companies. New locally supplied parts include suspension  [frames], airbags, and sunroofs, for a total of 395 locally  supplied parts.    Moreover, designers were sent out from as early as the  planning stage to tour the facilities of Japanese-U.S. parts  makers and recommend the use of existing plants to manufacture  parts. When new cars are made, a large capital investment is  required. But in the Accord's case, Honda was able to get by  with "half the usual investment in plants and equipment,"  according to Kawamoto.    Ninety engineers from Honda of U.S. Manufacturing, Inc.  (Ohio) were sent for three years to Honda's Saitama plant (in  Sayama city). The idea behind this experiment, the first of its  kind for Honda, was to have them learn how to reduce production  costs from the company's central manufacturing base in Japan.    Armed with the knowledge it has gained about localization  this time, Honda plans to expand local production even further.  It is even studying the feasibility of shifting production to  the United States of the Integra and Legend, which are now only  exported from Japan.    As localization moves forward, an important question it  brings with it is how to cope with the "hollowing out" of  domestic industry. Last year, about 60,000 Accords were exported  from Japan to the United States. Though less than 20 percent of  all Accords sold in the United States, if these 60,000 cars  were no longer produced in Japan, some 1,000 workers would  become domestic dead weight. But the policy at Honda, says  Kawamoto, is "to maintain its personnel." If cuts continue to be  made in the production of its four-wheeled vehicles, Honda will  have to do something about workers at its Suzuka plant. In lieu  of personnel cuts, Honda has begun looking into the possibility  of putting the Suzuka plant in charge of parts that are  currently produced at both its Hamamatsu and Kumamoto facilities.    Revising its rate from 115 yen to 105 yen to the dollar,  Kawamoto made it clear yesterday that the company is working on  a new management plan. The age of the high yen is making it  necessary for companies to consider fundamental changes in the  way their domestic and overseas production and sales systems are  being organized.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Georgia battles worry Nato NATO said yesterday it was deeply worried by the fighting in Georgia, amid signs that the west is growing pessimistic that former Soviet republics can overcome the problems and conflicts they face, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'We are deeply worried,' said Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general. 'I think we have enough conflicts, crises and wars in the whole Euro-Atlantic area,' he said. 'We do not need more.' Georgia's embattled ruling State Council has sent its Foreign Minister Alexander Chikvaidze to Nato after asking the alliance in a letter to use 'all possible means' to prevent the republic's break-up. Mr Chikvaidze will visit the alliance today to discuss the conflict. Mr Worner said Nato's 16 member-nations were trying to help find a peaceful solution to the fighting between government troops and Abkhazian separatists. The alliance has so far refused to offer any of its former cold war enemies security guarantees or military assistance and prefers to leave the task of mediation to bodies such as the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. What worries Nato is not so much the fighting, but the possibility it could drag Russia into a war with Georgia and that the conflict would spread. Georgia wants control over Russian military equipment on its territory to fight what it says is a Russian-inspired uprising. Moscow says it will defend its legitimate interests.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Canadian MPs approve agreement CANADA'S House of Commons yesterday evening approved the North American Free Trade Agreement amid cautious optimism in Ottawa that the pact will also be ratified later this year, as scheduled, by the US and Mexico. Nafta is due to come into force on January 1. But doubts about its implementation have grown in recent weeks as negotiations on two 'side-agreements' covering environmental and labour standards have been stalled. A spokesman for Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said yesterday that Ottawa still views the side-agreements as 'do-able'. He noted that the three governments 'lived through several moments as difficult as this' during the main Nafta negotiations. He said that Canada objects to 'a very narrow and specific feature' of the US proposals, namely, the use of trade remedies to enforce environmental and labour standards. Passage of the Nafta enabling legislation through the House of Commons has been marked by stormy debates, including an all-night sitting earlier this week. The ruling Progressive Conservative party eventually used its sizeable majority to close the debate and force the bill through the House. The government had been anxious to complete the debate before parliament adjourns for the summer recess, and before campaigning for a general election to be held later this year gets into full swing.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Syria rules out Jordan-style deal Syria yesterday flatly ruled out an Israeli proposal to craft a peace agreement between the two neighbouring states based on Israel's landmark treaty with Jordan involving exchange of land and lease-back deals. President Hafez al-Assad, holding surprise talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo last night, reaffirmed Syria's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and said it would be blasphemy to lease Arab land to Israel. Mr Assad said anyone who thought Syria would accept such a model was 'shamefully wrong' and adoption of this strategy by Israel would lead to the opposite of peace 'even if we live tens or hundreds of years'. Mr Assad's comments came after Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he hoped territorial exchange between Israel and Jordan might set a precedent for peace talks with Syria over the return of the Golan, home to 14,000 Jewish settlers and many businesses. Under the Israel-Jordan peace treaty initialled in Amman on Monday Israel will return to Jordan more than 300sq km of occupied territory. In addition Jordan agreed to accept 30sq km of Israeli land in exchange for Jordanian territory being farmed by Israelis and to lease back at least a further 700 acres for 25 years with an option to renew. President Mubarak, who has welcomed the Israeli-Jordanian agreement, also cast doubt on leasing Arab land to Israel, saying 'land is honour'. More criticism against the Israeli-Jordanian agreement came yesterday from Palestinian radical groups based in Damascus and from the extremist Islamic Hamas group, which said the accord favours 'the occupation enemy and contradicts our legitimate Palestinian and Arab rights'. The Palestine Liberation Organisation also attacked the treaty's allocation of a special role to Jordan as the guardian of Islamic holy sites in Arab East Jerusalem, saying it was a 'flagrant violation' the PLO-Israeli agreements and an attempt to legitimise Israeli occupation of the holy city. The statement confirmed mounting PLO-Jordanian tension over the rival claims to Arab East Jerusalem. In Israel, however, the treaty was received with near euphoria. Israeli newspapers lauded Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a great man and even ultra-right-wing parties praised the agreement, which appeared to involve no significant Israeli sacrifices. Mr Dan Proper, head of the Israeli Manufacturers' Association, said the move marked a 'big swing forward' for Israel in trade with the world, access to foreign investment and participation in large regional infrastructure projects. Tourism officials forecast large gains to both economies, with at least 1,000 tourists a day crossing between Israel and Jordan. Arkia, a small airline company, announced it would start two flights a day between Amman and Tel Aviv and another company plans to offer a helicopter and limousine service for businessmen. Plans were also unveiled yesterday for an Israeli-Jordanian joint venture to construct a tourism project in the Arava desert. Israeli optimism has been buoyed by President Bill Clinton's decision to attend next Wednesday's signing ceremony at the new border crossing between the Red Sea twin cities of Aqaba and Eilat.</p>

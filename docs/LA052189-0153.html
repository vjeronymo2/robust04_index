			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNDUE FORCE, RACISM CHARGED IN SHOOTINGS BY DEPUTIES  </P> <P> The fast-food restaurants and strip malls around the "Welcome to Lancaster"  sign at the Avenue K exit of the Antelope Valley Freeway present an image of  safe, homogenized suburbia.  </P> <P> But last month, the Carl's Jr. restaurant at that intersection was the scene of  a fatal shooting that has sparked allegations against Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies of excessive force and racial bias.  </P> <P> To many, the incident and three other recent shootings by law enforcement  officers reflect the Antelope Valley's transformation from a cluster of sleepy  desert communities into an urban area with urban problems.  </P> <P> "It was shocking," Lancaster Mayor Lynn Harrison said of the Carl's Jr.  shooting. "We're not used to things like that here. Residents are feeling the  pressures of change, and I'm sure law enforcement officers are feeling the  pressures as well."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acted Accordingly  </P> <P> Harrison said she thinks that the deputies saw a "life-threatening situation"  and acted accordingly.  </P> <P> On April 11, deputies confronted Betty Jean Aborn, a 50-year-old black  transient armed with a butcher knife, at the Carl's Jr. after responding to an  armed robbery call at a nearby business. When Aborn lunged at them, three  deputies opened fire, authorities said. She was hit 18 times.  </P> <P> Ensuing protests by the Antelope Valley chapter of the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People included a march last month by black residents  around the sheriff's station. And a federal mediator from San Francisco has met  with authorities and about 35 black residents to discuss Aborn's death and the  fatal shooting by a deputy six months ago of Robert Moriya, an Asian student.  State NAACP President Jose De Sosa helped set up the mediator's visit and  attended the meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death Investigated  </P> <P> Like all deputy-involved shootings, Aborn's death is being investigated by the  Los Angeles County district attorney's office in conjunction with Sheriff's  Department homicide investigators.  </P> <P> In January, the district attorney's office cleared Deputy Terry Rice in the  Nov. 4 shooting of Moriya, a 19-year-old Lancaster resident who had crashed his  car into a freeway underpass after a night of drinking. Rice shot and killed  Moriya after he charged Rice and attempted to wrestle away his gun,  investigators concluded.  </P> <P> But NAACP member Mike Kirkland said: "I don't think either of those two people  could have mustered enough force to seriously threaten the officers, especially  with the expertise, backup and guns they have available to them."  </P> <P> Capt. Gary Vance, commander of the Antelope Valley sheriff's station, predicts  that the investigation of the Aborn shooting will conclude that deputies acted  properly. He said he is willing to work with black leaders but sees no need for  outside intervention and rejects the racial allegations about the two  shootings.  </P> <P> "I can understand why that jumps to their minds," Vance said of the black  leaders. "But no way is that a connection. I don't see any racial tensions at  all."  </P> <P> As further evidence that race had nothing to do with the Aborn shooting, Vance  said, one of the deputies involved is Latino and another is white and married  to a black woman.  </P> <P> But Harrison said she thinks that, regardless of whether the Aborn shooting was  justified, the involvement of an outside mediator may be a good idea. "If the  members of the minority community feel there is a problem, then for them there  is a problem," she said.  </P> <P> The federal mediator, Ada Montare, said she can recommend -- but cannot require  -- police-community forums or human relations training for officers. But  Montare said it is unlikely that she will suggest such action since the  Sheriff's Department has made itself accessible to NAACP leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resolves Disputes  </P> <P> Montare works for the Community Relations Service of the U.S. Department of  Justice, which has no investigative powers.  </P> <P> "It seems the area is in an era of change with people moving from the Los  Angeles area," she said of the Antelope Valley. "It could be that tensions are  beginning to take place."  </P> <P> Palmdale's population grew 17% last year, and Lancaster's grew 10%. But there  were grim accompanying numbers: Overall crime went up 33% in the Antelope  Valley in the first quarter of this year, with the crime rate per 1,000 people  increasing 8%.  </P> <P> The three shootings this year contrast with only one deputy-involved shooting  in each of the previous two years in the Antelope Valley. All three occurred  within the past six weeks; the most recent was Wednesday when deputies shot and  killed a man who charged a deputy with a rake after a two-hour car chase in  which the suspect rammed a police car.  </P> <P> The Rev. Samuel Hooker, president of the Antelope Valley's NAACP chapter, said  his group requested outside help because the Aborn and Moriya shootings show  that deputies are quick to use deadly force against minorities. The NAACP  chapter has located Aborn's daughter, 19-year-old Mona Aborn, and are  consulting with lawyers about filing a wrongful death suit on her behalf,  Hooker said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials estimated the Antelope Valley's population at  135,000 in 1985, up from 107,000 in 1980. But a continuing influx of residents,  which includes a significant number of minorities, has pushed the valleywide  population to more than 200,000, officials said.  </P> <P> The most recent available data on ethnic makeup dates from 1985 and showed a  population of 81% white, 10% Latino, 5% Asian and 4% black, with a longtime  concentration of blacks in the Littlerock and Sun Village communities east of  Palmdale.  </P> <P> The Aborn incident began at 4:45 on a Tuesday afternoon. Investigators say  Aborn, a transient whose last known address was in Inglewood, stole several ice  cream bars from a convenience store across the street from the Carl's Jr. A  clerk challenged her, then called police after she threatened him with a  10-inch butcher knife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Account of Events  </P> <P> Investigators give this account of the events that followed:  </P> <P> Seven deputies responding to the call found Aborn sitting behind a table in the  back of the restaurant, where she was a familiar face.  </P> <P> Aborn held the deputies at bay with a knife. Several deputies moved customers  and employees out of the dining area while four deputies and a sergeant tried  to calm the woman. She screamed that they would have to kill her. The sergeant  shot her with a Taser stun-gun. It had no apparent effect. An autopsy report  said one Taser dart was embedded in Aborn's forehead, but other darts may have  been blocked by several layers of clothing.  </P> <P> Seconds later, Aborn lunged over the table at a deputy with the knife above her  head. Three deputies -- William Phelton, Tony Ortiz and James Vetrovec --  opened fire. Twenty-eight shots were fired; the autopsy showed that Aborn was  hit 18 times, mainly in the torso and legs.  </P> <P> Hooker and others question whether it was necessary for the deputies to fire  that many times. They also ask why deputies did not attempt to subdue Aborn by  other means, or back off and negotiate as police do in barricade situations.  </P> <P> "There is no way I believe those men had to shoot that woman," Hooker said.  </P> <P> Vance responded: "People who aren't in law enforcement may see more  significance in the number of rounds fired. Unlike in the movies where people  fly back after they're shot, in real life they tend to keep going. I think each  deputy fired until he perceived the threat had been eliminated. I can't  remember a shooting where the deputies counted how many times they fired.  Either you're justified in shooting or you're not."  </P> <P> Vance noted that deputies first used the Taser gun.  </P> <P> "The Taser gun usually works," Vance said. "Before they have time to make other  plans, she attacks, and they have their guns drawn. . . . A barricade suspect  is different because you contain the area."  </P> <P> In the Aborn case, the deputies were pursuing an armed robbery suspect into a  public place, Vance said. "They were intent on arrest," Vance said. "We don't  negotiate with armed robbers."  </P> <P> Aborn was arrested in Pasadena in 1983 on charges of assaulting a police  officer with a pair of scissors, court records show. The charges were dropped  when Aborn agreed to undergo mental health treatment, a Pasadena court official  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deputy Exonerated  </P> <P> In the Moriya shooting, the district attorney's inquiry found that Rice was  justified in shooting Moriya five times because the unarmed youth charged him  repeatedly, even after being wounded. Moriya's blood-alcohol level was  determined to be 0.17%. The legal limit for drivers in California is 0.1%.  </P> <P> Rice remains on leave for psychological stress suffered since the shooting. The  county rejected a $5-million claim filed by Moriya's family, and Los Angeles  attorney Albert DeBlanc said he is preparing a lawsuit.  </P> <P> DeBlanc says he has witnesses to refute the official findings.  </P> <P> "I have no reason to believe it was necessary for him to shoot an unarmed boy,"  DeBlanc said.  </P> <P> Hooker said the fact that Aborn and Moriya were members of minority groups  cannot be overlooked in an area that is populated mostly by conservative  whites. Hooker acknowledged that the two incidents have come at a time when the  Antelope Valley NAACP chapter is trying to become more visible.  </P> <P> "We have to have some kind of voice," he said.  </P></p>

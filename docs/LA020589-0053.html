			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TASS REPORTER INTERVIEWS U.S. ATTY. GIULIANI;  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR GIVES MOB-BUSTING TIPS TO SOVIETS  </P> <P> It was perestroika, more or less, that brought Vladimir Kikilo to U.S. Atty.  Rudolph W. Giuliani in search of government secrets.  </P> <P> Back in the U.S.S.R., one expression of the new entrepreneurial spirit is a  wave of bribery, extortion and other organized crime. Soviet mobsters throw  lavish funerals and use the chain saw as a persuasive device, just like their  American counterparts.  </P> <P> Late last summer, the Moscow headquarters of Tass, the Soviet government news  agency, asked its New York bureau to write a long report about how the U.S.  government is fighting organized crime. Kikilo drew the assignment.  </P> <P> "I had to start from the scratch, as you say," he said in an interview at Tass'  office in Rockefeller Center.  </P> <P> He knew enough to realize that he should interview Giuliani, who successfully  prosecuted the leaders of New York's Mafia families as well as members of the  "Pizza Connection" heroin-smuggling conspiracy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Difficulty Connecting  </P> <P> But Giuliani works for the same Justice Department that keeps an eye on Kikilo  and his colleagues, and for a while it seemed Kikilo was destined to be the  only reporter in New York never to have gotten a word with the voluble  mob-buster.  </P> <P> Kikilo, 36, called Giuliani's office for an interview and, after it was learned  who was calling, was referred to Justice Department headquarters in Washington.  </P> <P> There, his calls were passed from office to office. Finally, someone told him  Giuliani -- who appears on off-hours cable TV shows and lingers long after news  conferences to do interviews with college radio stations -- would not be able  to see him for months, if ever.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Kikilo had been reading a book on the Pizza Connection case by New  York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal. One night, while driving home, Kikilo  heard Blumenthal plugging his book on the radio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sets Up Interview  </P> <P> The next day he called Blumenthal, who discussed the case with him -- and  helped set up an interview with Giuliani.  </P> <P> Despite his misgivings, Kikilo found the shirt-sleeved Giuliani to be friendly,  candid and helpful. Although the newsman pronounced the interview "a real  scoop," the prosecutor did not tell him anything he has not been telling anyone  else with a pencil or tape recorder for the last six years.  </P> <P> "First, before you prosecute, you have to gather intelligence," Giuliani  explained. "You try to develop informants, people within the organization  willing to tell you how it functions. They can tell you the weak points, the  legitimate people who are victimized -- that's the way you start."  </P> <P> Over the next 45 minutes Giuliani went on to spill the rest of the beans, how  to seize mob property, tell a boss from an underboss, etc.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Use the Tools  </P> <P> Such tactics are of more than academic interest to Soviet authorities. In  national security matters, they enjoy investigatory powers that can safely be  described as broad. But they cannot prosecute an entire organized crime group  or use videotapes as criminal evidence.  </P> <P> Kikilo said it might be good if Giuliani spoke directly with Soviet  prosecutors. "I think it could be an excellent thing to talk about," Giuliani  said. If he did so, however, it would have to be as a private citizen: Giuliani  resigned last week, amid speculation that he may soon challenge Mayor Edward  Koch.  </P> <P> Accompanied by Blumenthal, Kikilo also visited Knickerbocker Avenue in  Brooklyn, an area that had been the turf of some Pizza Connection Mafiosi.  Kikilo, however, couldn't understand why anyone would frequent such a shabby  area. He was particularly struck by the sight of a pothole big enough to  accommodate two large trash cans.  </P> <P> "Then I realized the Mafia is reluctant to demonstrate their riches."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Views Murder Scene  </P> <P> He walked into what once was Joe and Mary's restaurant, where mobster Carmine  Galante was gunned down in 1979 while eating lunch. Although the place is now a  Chinese restaurant, Kikilo was able to get a look at the courtyard out back  where Galante died, a cigar still clenched in his teeth.  </P> <P> "You feel some excitement," he said, his face becoming animated. "You can read  about it, but when you actually see it, you start to grasp a little bit of  something you need for the story."  </P> <P> But Kikilo's piece is not primarily atmospheric, dealing as it must with the  finer points of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968 and the  Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clutter Lingers On  </P> <P> The article is finished -- all 10,000 words of it -- but his desk still looks  like a mob reporter's. There is a Mafia family organization chart tacked on the  wall; three huge volumes of background from Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame expert  on organized crime; videotapes of mob TV programs; an old U.S. Information  Agency folder bulging with yellowing newspaper clips.  </P> <P> Kikilo also has a gift from one of Giuliani's assistants -- a computer printout  of the disposition of each defendant in the Pizza Connection trial, one of the  longest and most complicated in American history.  </P> <P> "This was my savior," he said.  </P></p>

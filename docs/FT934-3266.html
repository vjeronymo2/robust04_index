			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Xerox to cut workforce by 10% over three years Xerox, the US document processing company, is to cut its worldwide workforce by more than 10 per cent, or 10,000 jobs, over the next two to three years. It will take a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of about Dollars 700m to cover the restructuring. It will also take a Dollars 154m charge in the quarter to cover the settlement of a 1992 anti-trust lawsuit over sales of spare parts for high-volume copiers and printers. The restructuring is the latest in a series of moves by Mr Paul Allaire, chairman, to shake up Xerox's culture and improve productivity at a time of intensifying global competition. While its products generally have a good market reputation, it has suffered a chequered profits record in recent quarters, because of sluggish growth in some of its most important global markets and an unexpectedly protracted reorganisation of its sales force. Mr Allaire said yesterday the restructuring in the document processing division was 'not a function of any change in the current business environment, but rather it accelerates numerous productivity initiatives that have been under careful consideration for some time'. The aim was to increase productivity, lower the cost base, be more responsive to customers, and improve financial results. The shake-up will involve the closure and consolidation of some facilities and the streamlining of the organisational structure, including reduced layers of management. The company is also considering a plan to 'outsource' some of its operations to outside vendors. The job cuts will come through normal attrition, redundancies and some controlled, voluntary programmes. About half the cuts will be implemented next year. The anti-trust court case involved complaints by customers and independent service organisations that Xerox had refused to give the service companies access to parts and software, allowing the company to overcharge for equipment, parts and service. Under the settlement, Xerox has agreed to sell parts to the service providers, and will give discounts of Dollars 225m to plaintiffs for part-payment on future purchases of company products.</p>

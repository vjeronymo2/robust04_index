			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Sertoglu--punctuation as published] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  "Talabani's Design" </H5>   Fighting has continued in northern Iraq for many weeks. The  supporters of Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud  Barzani and those of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal  Talabani have been engaged in violent clashes. The fighting  broke out in a small area. It assumed a violent nature very  quickly.    The U.S. officials, who are very influential in the region,  belatedly decided to take action last week. They suggested to  Talabani, who has been living in Damascus and making no effort  to end the clashes in northern Iraq, that he "should go to the  region and halt the incidents as soon as possible." Talabani  responded by asking them to provide him with a helicopter  because he had to cross through territory under Barzani's  control. He stressed that he did not wish to do that.    However, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs received  reports that the area Talabani mentioned was not sealed off by  Barzani's men. In fact, several of Talabani's assistants left  Damascus and crossed through that territory to reach their area.  Considering that state of affairs, the U.S. officials rejected  Talabani's request.    The situation that has emerged in northern Iraq is as  follows: "Syria is supporting Talabani against Barzani in the  clashes. Talabani seems to have urged Damascus to increase  Syria's military and political support for his supporters....  As far as I am able to see, Talabani and Barzani mostly differ  on matters related to northern Iraq's future. Barzani supports  the idea of a federation or a confederation with Baghdad. In  other words, he supports Iraq's territorial integrity. However,  Talabani wishes to establish an independent Kurdish State."    The approach maintained by the two Kurdish leaders will  force  Turkey to willingly or unwillingly side with Barzani. Talabani  is either unaware of that state of affairs or he is convinced  that he stands to gain more by cooperating with Syria.... He  may be planning to use Syria when the situation returns to  normal in the region as a result of a peace agreement between  Syria and Israel.    Nevertheless, Turkey has not intervened in the fighting  between the two sides. That was the right thing to do. The  United States is expected to intervene in the situation in the  near future. A very high-ranking foreign ministry official has  said that "Turkey has to maintain a wise policy."    Considering the developments in northern Iraq, I wish to  criticize those who defend the view that the "Hammer Force must  immediately withdraw from Turkey." I do not know what else I  should say.  <H5>  Question of Iran </H5>   Let us consider the developments that took place during the  Iranian delegation's visit to Ankara a few days ago:    1. The Iranian officials explained the anxiety the  developments in northern Iraq have caused in Iran.... They  conveyed a verbal message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to  President Suleyman Demirel on Iran's uneasiness.    22. President Demirel and the foreign ministry officials  informed the Iranian officials that Turkey is worried by Iran's  approach on matters related to the activities of the Kurdish  Workers Party [PKK]. The Iranian officials said that their  country has been trying to do everything it can on the matter.  They called for coordination between the two sides. The  framework of such a coordination is unknown. However, the two  countries can cooperate through the Turkish-Iranian Security  Committee.    23. The delegation did not propose joint intervention in  northern Iraq by Turkey and Iran.    24. The Iranian officials said that their country is  opposed to the establishment of an independent Kurdish State in  northern Iraq. The Turkish officials said that they shared that  view.    25. The Iranian officials said that they were worried by  the possibility that Talabani may emerge stronger against  Barzani as a result of the clashes in northern Iraq. The  Turkish officials responded by saying that Turkey and Iran  should wait until the situation becomes clear in a few months....    That is how the Iranian delegation's meetings in Turkey can  be summed up.... The Iranians seem to prefer to visit Turkey to  express certain views that otherwise could be conveyed through  telephone calls. Apparently, frequently traveling to foreign  countries seems to be attractive to them.  <H5>  Someone Is Provoking </H5>   Several people seem to have disrupted the relations between  Turkey and the United States. In fact, they have been making an  intensive effort to achieve their objective in Washington. A  number of them have an "official capacity."    The U.S. Congress' Helsinki Commission on Human Rights has  been convinced to focus on the Kurdish problem in an  unprecedented way during the past few months. Unfortunately, it  has failed to discriminate between the PKK and the Kurdish  problem.    Speaking at a meeting that was held two days ago, the  members  of the International Human Rights Legal Committee made horrible  accusations against Turkey, in spite of the fact that they  visited Ankara to study the situation for only four days.  Kathryn Porter, wife of Republican Congressman John Porter,  addressed that meeting. She claimed that she was treated in an  unbelievable way in Turkey, which she described as a police  state and a country in which democracy does not exist.  Furthermore, she said that the situation in Diyarbakir was  worse than that in the former Soviet Union. She also claimed  that several of the people who accompanied her were killed and  that she was harassed by officials.    Kathryn Porter is not a new name for Turkey.... She  maintains a hostile attitude toward the Turks. In fact, she  traveled to south Cyprus and encouraged the Greek Cypriot women  to march against the Turkish Cypriot border some time ago. She  appeared in many photographs at the time.    The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has to realize the harm that is  being done to the relations between Turkey and the United States  by individuals who maintain hostile feelings against the Turks.  In fact, the U.S. Embassy has to take measures against them....  The matter is not a joke. It must be considered seriously.    Turkey is not a colony.... The U.S. ambassador in Ankara  must immediately explain that to Washington.... It seems that  the individuals who address the commissions of the U.S. Congress  are selected very carefully.... Ambassador Barkley, you must  end that state of affairs. Mr. Ambassador, have I made myself  clear?</p>

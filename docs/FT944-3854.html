			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Daniel Green looks at five areas for investors to watch Purveyors of snake oil masquerading as scientists, or entrepreneurial geniuses building a new Glaxo? That is the question which everyone investing in biotechnology tries to answer. It is tough even for professional investors because the road from laboratory research to a blockbuster new drug is long and risky. They get little advice from analysts, most of whom have their hands full with developments in the pharmaceuticals industry. There is no way of using conventional yardsticks - such as yields and price-earnings ratios - since biotech companies have no earnings and pay no dividends until they make it big or fail. Investors both private and professional must resort to the old-fashioned approach of trying to understand the companies themselves. There are five areas of risk they should consider: Financial Biotech companies consume money for years before products are marketed. This burn rate should be compared with the company's cash reserves to judge when the next cash injection is likely. This is usually a rights issue or partnership with a large drugs company. While drug company partners bring cash and expertise, they usually take marketing rights in return. Scientific It is difficult even for the experts to determine which field will provide the next breakthrough. Investors should concentrate on the facts that emerge from clinical trials. As explained on page 1, clinical trials come in three stages. Phase 1 is on volunteers to check for side effects. Phase 2 is to test proof of principle (does the drug have the right kind of effect?) and to find the best dose. Phase 3, on hundreds or thousands of patients, is a statistically significant comparison of the new drug with existing treatments or a placebo. This phase is, ultimately, the only one that counts. Nine out of 10 drugs that enter Phase 1 will not make it to Phase 3. Management Biotech company bosses may never have run a business before, or be out of their depth in research. Would you trust them with your money? Regulatory Drug regulators, such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the Medicines Control Agency in the UK, are more sympathetic to companies trying to treat hitherto incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's. Also, it is easier to produce unambiguous clinical trial results quickly if - to put it bluntly  -a disease is virulent and lethal. Economic There is pressure on health-care costs around the world and drug prices are often a target for control. Drugs that fetch the highest prices will, increasingly, be those that cut health-care costs elsewhere - for example, by avoiding the need for surgery or shortening a hospital stay. On the right are the most important investment vehicles in the UK.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PUTTING A VALUE ON POTENTIAL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 Mkt cap Pounds m   12 month share price (p)   Dec 9 Company           Dec 9 close         High   Low             close (p)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- British Biotech        269.5           615   311 3/4           558 BB Warrants             -              149    43               124 Celltech               167.1           243   191               236 Scotia                 160.3           295   242               254 Proteus                 74.6       492 3/4   130               240 Cantab                  37.7           488   383               383 BIL (dollars)              -           215   155               157  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Television and Radio: Music, movies, many happy reruns - Christopher Dunkley picks the plums over four days of holiday viewing and listening CHRISTMAS EVE IF YOU took away all the music and movies, the airwaves would remain virtually silent for much of the Christmas period. The pick of today's movies begins (or for many readers, no doubt, began) at 9.30 this morning with the first and one of the best musicals made by the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rogers team, Flying Down To Rio (BBC2). Fans of the partnership who have already missed this absurdly early offering can take heart since more of their films are spread through the holiday. Most are screened even earlier in the morning, so it looks like a job for the video recorder. The music begins in earnest after lunch at 1.05 when Radio 3 offers a 1970 recording of Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio. The late Leonard Bernstein conducted the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Chorus with a starry cast: Gwyneth Jones as Leonore, Walter Berry as Don Pizzaro, Lucia Popp as Marzeline and James King as Florestan. If you prefer modern dance and have the afternoon free, BBC2 screens Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre at 2.50 with the famous American company performing Ailey's own ballet 'Memoria'. For many, the day's most important broadcasting fixture is the Festival Of Nine Lessons And Carols from King's College Chapel which begins at 3.00 on Radio 4. This has a comparatively high proportion of modern and foreign songs. Another version on BBC2 at 6.15 is more traditional with 'The Holly And The Ivy', 'Silent Night', and 'Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem'. The day's most unusual music and dance programme promises to be Everybody Dance Now (8.00 C4) which looks to the pop video as the chief source of popular contemporary dance once provided by the Hollywood musical. Exponents seen in the programme include Madonna, Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul and M C Hammer. ITV provides a Midnight Service from Ely Cathedral (11.50). Other notable movies include Sea Of Love (9.45 BBC1), a 1989 mixture of police thriller and steamy romance which is getting its first showing on terrestrial television. Al Pacino plays the detective and Ellen Barkin is the suspect with whom he begins a passionate affair. Dear old Auntie BBC has censored the language. Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown is also having its first terrestrial airing. This was made in 1988 by the biggest name in Spanish cinema since Bunuel: Pedro Almodovar, darling of the film festivals. His work is sexy, funny, eccentric, stylish and brilliantly coloured. The best of the oldies is Arsenic And Old Lace (12.35 BBC1), Frank Capra's hilarious wartime adaptation of a popular stage farce with Cary Grant playing the man whose aunts take to poisoning. There are just three non-musical programmes I want to catch. First, Fanny And The Plastic Saints (5.30 pm Radio 4) because Piers Plowright's radio documentaries are very special; this one is about actress Fanny Carby who had a part-time job 50 years ago painting and gold-leafing saints and martyrs. She now goes in search of them. Second, BBC2's account of the 1992 re-run by vintage cars of the 1955 Mille Miglia race, How About A Lift Old Boy? (7.30 pm BBC2) because Ian Wooldridge who navigates for Stirling Moss is a particularly good and funny reporter. Third, Harry Enfield's Festive Television Programme because the ghastly disc jockeys, Smashie and Nicey, are two of the funniest characters on television (9.20 pm BBC2). CHRISTMAS DAY THE PICK of the day on Christmas Day is the Queen's Speech: 9 am Radio 4, 10 am Radio 5, 11 am Radio 2, 1 pm Radio 1, 3 pm Radio 4, BBC1 and ITV 6.25 pm and 8.30 pm BBC2 and C4 (both have sub-titles &amp; sign language). You will also be well served if you like music - especially religious music  -and movies - especially old ones. The first notable offering comes bright early at 7.30 in the morning when BBC2 shows Rio Bravo, a Western which, although slow and predictable, is peculiarly enjoyable. John Wayne plays a sheriff determined to hold a prisoner, although he has only a drunk (Dean Martin), a boy (Vicky Nelson) and a one-legged veteran (Walter Brennan) to help him. The best thing to do this morning is steal enough time for a leisurely bath and listen to either Down Your Ear (10.30) or Desert Island Discs (11.00) both on Radio 4. The first is a recycling of the events of 1992 by Armando Ianucci who has been responsible for some of the funniest of recent radio programmes, notably 'On The Hour'. In the second - an extended edition - the castaway is the Cambridge physicist Stephen Hawking. If the middle of your day is free you can watch, and more to the point listen to, a repeat of The Messiah on C4 starting at 11.30. This was a performance in Dublin marking the 250th anniversary of its first performance in that city in April 1742. An impressive list of soloists includes Sylvia McNair and Anne Sofie von Otter. That goes on until 1.55. Instead you could listen to Radio 2 at 1.00 for Comedy Hour which begins with a repeat of a 1958 Christmas edition of 'Take It From Here' devoted entirely to The Glums. While playing sardines, Ron gets locked in the cupboard under the stairs with the buxom barmaid fancied by Mr Glum . . . For anyone who has still never seen it, or those of us wanting to watch for the 27th time, at 1.15 BBC2 again shows Top Hat, just about the best musical ever made by Astaire and Rogers. The numbers include 'Isn't This A Lovely Day', 'Cheek To Cheek' and 'White Tie And Tails' and the dance sequences are among the best ever to come out of Hollywood. Of course the story is ludicrous, but that is part of the charm of the thing. The supporting cast is splendid, especially Eric Blore. Otherwise the most tempting movies of the day are Dangerous Liaisons (9 pm BBC2), the cinema version of Christopher Hampton's hugely successful dramatisation of the epistolary novel by Laclos in which aristocratic French lovers plot the seduction of a young woman. This is the first showing on terrestrial television, as is the screening of Shirley Valentine on BBC1 (9.50). This is another filmed version of a stage play, but a far more sentimental one. Pauline Collins plays the uncherished suburban wife who finds fulfilment in a Greek holiday romance. Tom Conti plays the Greek. The most interesting of television's own programmes (there are far fewer than on a normal day) may well include Saint Mugg: The Making Of A TV Saint (7 pm C4). This considers the transformation of Malcolm Muggeridge from wit and humorist in middle life to religious zealot and crashing bore in old age. Centre of BBC1's evening, and therefore candidate for one of the largest audiences of the year, is Victoria Wood's All Day Breakfast (9 pm). Where her contemporaries tend to be described as 'among the top female performers on television,' Wood is so good that her sex does not have to be taken into account. She is simply one of the funniest and most talented people on television. BOXING DAY CONSIDERING the well known availability of the audience on Boxing Day, this year's schedules look surprisingly ordinary, even lacklustre, some may think. One reason, presumably, is that, as the years have passed, broadcasters have learnt that Christmas editions of their own normal programmes win ratings at least as big as those for expensive galas or new movies. Hence the succession of familiar titles on ITV and BBC1 early in the evening. Also, fewer special music offerings are on offer than you might expect; just two of note. The Mikado (7.30 BBC2) is the new D'Oyly Carte production, marking the 150th anniversary of the birth of Arthur Sullivan, recorded at the Buxton Opera House under conductor John Owen Edwards. Since the copyright lapsed, there have been several modern and unconventional productions of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operas, but the D'Oyly Carte company sticks pretty much to the established Savoy Theatre traditions. Deryck Hamon sings the Mikado, Jill Pert is Katisha, and Julian Jensen plays Nanki-Poo. Altogether darker and more serious is Channel 4's main programme of the evening: Salome (8.10). This is the Peter Hall production of the Richard Strauss opera, mounted at Covent Garden with Edward Downes conducting. The title role is taken by Maria Ewing who was formerly married to Hall. Ewing, happily, is a good example of the modern requirement that sopranos playing seductively gorgeous man-killers should no longer be allowed to weigh 18 stone and to waddle around the stage, but must actually look the part. Watching Ewing in the dance of the seven veils you can well believe she would achieve her purpose. Of the 21 movies on offer from the four main networks, four seem worthy of mention. The Sword In The Stone (3.15 ITV) made in 1963 is not one of Disney's best cartoons, nor even among the best of the studio's modern works, but it has never before been shown on terrestrial television. It is adapted, of course, from T. H. White's splendid King Arthur story. For those who have still not managed to catch it, BBC2 is repeating Claude Berri's poignant two-part saga of French rural life beginning today with Jean de Florette (4.35). The stars are Gerard Depardieu and Yves Montand. 'Manon des Sources' is screened tomorrow. When Harry Met Sally (BBC1 10.05) is a modern American comedy romance containing the famous scene where Meg Ryan proves in a crowded restaurant that a woman can, indeed, realistically fake orgasm. And ITV is showing Parts 1 and 2 of The Godfather starting today at 11.20 pm. This Mafia epic, beginning with Marlon Brando as the head of the family and Al Pacino as his heir, runs to a total of six and a quarter hours (and that is excluding the inferior 'Godfather 3'). But it is much the best thing Coppola has ever directed, the acting is outstanding, and the photography superb, so it is worth the time. For traditionalists there is Racing from Kempton Park (12.30 C4), and, for skating fans, highlights of Torvill and Dean's ice spectacular in Simply The Best (4.05 BBC1). Anyone who missed the most recent 'behind the scenes' documentary about the Queen, Elizabeth R can see a repeat on BBC2 (2.45). There are just two new television programmes which I particularly want to catch. God On The Box (7.10 C4) sounds as though it might have been specially made for television critics: it tells the story of the 'God Slot' which began in the days of the 'toddlers' truce' when television transmitters were switched off in the early evenings so that mothers could put their children, un-tempted, to bed. This is about to end with the coming of the new ultra-competitive ITV. Most of the programmes in this slot were, as the makers of this programme admit, 'curdlingly sanctimonious'. Bookmark (9.50 pm BBC2) promises Maureen Lipman as Enid Blyton in a programme which mixes drama, animation and documentary. Blyton was one of the earlist victims of political correctness, falling foul of librarians who felt her work was much too middle class and enjoyable, and banned her books because - they said - Noddy was a racist. Time for reinstatement. CHRISTMAS SUNDAY FOR ANYONE who takes an interest in television scheduling, the crucial moment tonight occurs at 7.15 when BBC1 and ITV both finish a dose of what passes for religion on television (jolly songs and fat men with sad smiles). ITV then starts a two-hour Ruth Rendell Mystery Movie starring John Duttine and Mel Martin, and BBC1 offers More Auntie's Bloomers with Terry Wogan trying desperately to seem as funny as the out-takes - journalists' fluffs and actors' pratfalls - he has to present. That is followed at 8.05 on BBC1 by Miss Marple: The Mirror Crack'd with the matchless Joan Hickson starring for the last time as Agatha Christie's famous little old lady detective. Such a contest will inevitably split the audience and destroy anybody's chances of record ratings. But my guess is that, in spite of the big figures achieved by ITV with its 'Ruth Rendell' productions in the past few years, the BBC's combination of out-takes and Miss Marple will win hands down. The notable movies mostly carry over from yesterday. Manon des Sources (4.25 BBC2) certainly can be watched as a self-contained piece of work, but the story of water rights and the wild child growing up in a remote farming region of Provence will be even more impressive if you saw 'Jean de Florette' yesterday. The Godfather II (11.30 pm ITV) is still more firmly hitched on to yesterday's opening section of this gripping story of the New York Mafia and its Sicilian connections. Best movie offer of the day is BBC2's first terrestrial showing of the 1989 bittersweet comedy / romance The Fabulous Baker Boys (10 pm). Brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges star as the drooping piano-bar entertainers who are returned to tumescence by the arrival of an electrifying singer. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Susie Diamond with such wonderful oomph that she won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for an Oscar. The two musical productions which look particularly interesting are both on BBC2. In The Maestro And The Diva (3.25) Kiri Te Kanawa sings Richard Strauss's Four Last Songs (which have become extraordinarily popular as concert pieces in the past three or four years) with Georg Solti conducting the BBC Philharmonic. At 6.25 the channel offers La Cenerentola, an opera version of Cinderella written by Rossini whose birth in 1792 we have been celebrating this year. This production, directed by Michael Hampe for the Salzburg Festival, has Riccardo Chailly conducting the Vienna State Opera Chorus and the Vienna Philharmonic and the singers include Francisco Araiza, Walter Berry and Ann Murray as Cinderella. As ever, radio has some tempting programmes. Chris Wines has made what promises to be a remarkable curio for Radio 4: 33 ypm which stands for '33 years per minute'. In one hour from 7 pm the programme undertakes to cover 2,000 years of history. Radio 3's Hamlet (7.30) is a repeat of the Kenneth Branagh production with himself in the title role, Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Judi Dench as Gertrude and Richard Briers as Polonius. Most compelling of all, since it is one of the earliest events I can remember vividly, is David Perry's half hour on The London Smog Of 1952 (11 pm Radio 4).</p>

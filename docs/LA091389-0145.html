			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LEMOND SIGNS $5.5-MILLION PACT  </P> <P> American Greg LeMond, winner of this year's Tour de France and the cycling  world championship, said today that he has signed a three-year $5.5-million  contract with the French Team Z cycling organization.  </P> <P> The contract, richest ever in cycling, was announced at a news conference by  LeMond and Roger Zannier, the president of Z, a children's clothing  manufacturer. Zannier said one or more partners would join in backing the team.  </P> <P> "I had the possibility between 7-Eleven, Toshiba and Z. I analyzed very  carefully every team," LeMond said. "I believed that Z was the best one for me  because they have the riders I need, which are climbers. I think the most  important for me is to have a strong team in the Tour de France."  </P> <P> Among LeMond's new teammates are Robert Millar of Britain and French cyclists  Ronan Pensec and Eric Boyer, all known as strong climbers.  </P> <P> "I am very happy because we now have on our team a great leader," Zannier said.  "I think we will now be a winner because we now have a great champion."  </P> <P> LeMond said he made his choice about two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "At the world championships (Aug. 27), I made my decision that for me, my  career, I believed that Z was the best," LeMond, 28, said.  </P> <P> Under the contract, the entire Z team will ride on Greg LeMond-model bicycles.  </P> <P> LeMond said his whole salary is covered by a French bank guarantee.  </P> <P> Although LeMond did not give the yearly breakdown, in response to a question he  said he would probably earn at least $2 million in the final year.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be specific about it. I am embarrassed to talk about it,"  LeMond said.  </P> <P> The highest previous reported salary for a cyclist was the roughly $800,000 a  year provided in a contract to Ireland's Sean Kelly.  </P> <P> Under the new contract, LeMond will be able to race for Coors in exhibition  races in the United States but not in regular competitive events.  </P></p>

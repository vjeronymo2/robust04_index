			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of people marched through rainy streets in Rome to protest  racism and demand better conditions for Italy's immigrants. The marchers walked  through central Rome behind several African immigrants carrying a banner  reading: "Together for a Future Without Racism." Organizers said 200,000 people  took part, but police estimates varied from 60,000 to 100,000. The march was  organized by the Communist labor union CGIL and dozens of citizens' groups  after robbers killed a South African refugee in southern Italy.  </P></p>

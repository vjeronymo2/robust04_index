			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Moscow reshuffle may streamline cabinet Russian government ministers are spending the new year holiday in a state of nervous anticipation on the eve of a cabinet reshuffle and streamlining of government. Mr Sergei Vasiliev, the radical economist who heads the government's centre for monitoring the progress of economic reforms, is one of the authors of a blueprint for a leaner cabinet, which argues that administrative reform is essential for more efficient decision-making in a country notorious for labyrinthine and corrupt bureaucracy. Mr Vasiliev's blueprint foresees a cut in the number of deputy prime ministers from eight to either one or three, a 20 per cent cut in the number of bureaucrats, and the abolition of some ministries and government committees. But it is unclear whether reforms or reformers will come out on top after the changes, which are expected to take place by January 11, when the new parliament convenes. Russia has seen too many administrative re-organisations - designed to replace unpopular figures or create new jobs for friends - for any administrative reform to be credible until it actually happens. Reformists who were promoted to the rank of deputy prime minister after Mr Yegor Gaidar was removed as prime minister a year ago will be among those who revert to being simple ministers. This would not necessarily represent a blow to reformists, if the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, remained committed to sweeping economic reforms. One appointment which will be watched for clues of the reform intentions of President Boris Yeltsin is the job of central bank governor, on which he will have the final decision. The government newspaper, Rossiisskiye Vesti, yesterday said that Mr Victor Gerashchenko would be staying. But his confirmation would trigger the resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, who has accused Mr Gerashchenko of sabotaging attempts at financial stabilisation.</p>

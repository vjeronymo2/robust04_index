			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Observer: Merged out Unions, like companies, often discover that mergers have unexpected costs. Officials of the former print union Sogat, which last year merged with the NGA print union to form the GPMU, estimate that redundancy payments to former Sogat officials whose faces did not fit have reached about Pounds 330,000. Brenda Dean, the 49-year-old former Sogat leader, and most prominent casualty of the merger, has pocketed Pounds 148,000. The London Machine Branch of GPMU, a former Sogat stronghold, is so alarmed by such figures, and by the NGA's domination of the merged union, that it has called for a special conference to discuss Dean's departure. But Alf Elderton, the branch secretary, admits that the response has been relatively cool. 'People say a conference would cost too much money,' he says. Tony Dubbins, the GPMU general secretary, defends the pay-outs on the grounds that the merger has saved Pounds 1m from the joint wages bill of the two unions. The pay-out to Dean - overshadowed only by the Pounds 220,000 paid to Clive Jenkins by the white collar union MSF - appears to have been part of the merger agreement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Werner A. </F> Beninger in Tunis on 16 January: "I Wish Kreisky Were Still  Alive"]    [Text] [Beninger] What is the present state of the  negotiations with Israel, above all on the following main topics:    -- The dimension of the Jericho area, which Israel only  defines as the town of Jericho covering 27 square kilometers,  whereas the PLO defines it as the old Jordanian administrative  district covering more than 350 square kilometers;    -- The issue of control of the borders between Gaza and  Egypt, and Jericho and Jordan;    -- The problem of the Jewish settlers and their security?    ['Arafat] Regrettably, I must say that the Israelis are  still not negotiating honestly and are not really ready to keep  to the accords of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The crucial date  is 13 April (according to the agreement of 13 September 1993,  the Israeli soldiers must have left the autonomy areas by that  date -- editorial board). This is where it all starts, the  points of the agreement are not being observed. Israel  continues to insist on having control of the border crossings.  This means that the Israelis do not withdraw, but want to  maintain the present status. They insist on making Gaza a  Palestinian ghetto.    The same holds true for Jericho. Who could accept their  intention to stay? Who would be ready to invest money in an  Israeli annex or a ghetto? Who would be ready to do so? These  are the maneuvers that the Israelis are now trying to carry out.    [Beninger] What specifically does this mean for the  continuation of the negotiations, for the peace process in the  Middle East?    ['Arafat] Take the Jericho area as an example, against the  background of what we discussed. The province of Jericho is 712  square kilometers large -- according to a definition of the  Israeli administration. Then they offered us 27 square  kilometers, which they increased to 50 square kilometers in  their latest proposal. What is this supposed to be? A ghetto, a  new enclave? The Israelis speak about so very small areas, even  though under the agreement signed, they must pull out of all  these areas within four months. What does it mean? It means  that it is their intention not to pull out.    [Beninger] In view of these facts, is it realistic at all to  believe that the time schedule under which the Israeli  withdrawal is to be completed by 13 April can be met at all?  One is already in default now.    ['Arafat] Rabin has said repeatedly that not even 13 April  is a fixed date. What does that mean?    [Beninger] But if the time schedule cannot be fulfilled, do  you see any possibility at all of keeping under control the  disappointment and bitterness of the people who live in the  occupied territories?    ['Arafat] That depends on those who signed the agreement  together with us. We will then also have to see how the  international community will react. After all, this agreement  was not only signed by the Israelis. In the final analysis, it  is an international agreement. Then it will depend on how the  Europeans, how Clinton and the Americans react.    [Beninger] Does the PLO have specific options to stop  violence in the occupied territories?    ['Arafat] This is not the only issue. There is also  continuing oppression and the provocation of violence. Why are  they continuing to confiscate new land and to build new  settlements, specifically near Jerusalem? The isolation of  Jerusalem is being increased. Then there is the additional  scandal that happened only last Christmas when they granted  Christians special status in the holy places.    [Beninger] Accordingly, the Gaza-Jericho agreement so far  has changed nothing at all for the people in the occupied  territories. It is true that the refugees who left Palestine  after 1967 have been guaranteed the right to return, but in  fact, they are not admitted into the country. No more than 650  of more than 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons have been  released, and the oppressive measures of the occupation  authorities has not declined, as you said.    ['Arafat] What we agreed upon must finally be respected.  This means that the most important points now are the  withdrawal and independence. At the beginning of the third year  -- not in the course of, but at the beginning! -- we must  discuss the other problems.    [Beninger] But is it not true that fewer Palestinians have  been released than expected?    ['Arafat] Not only that. The oppressive measures against  our women and our people are continuing to escalate. The  continuation of these activities certainly shows what game the  Israelis are continuing to play.    [Beninger] But there are also efforts to split the  Palestinian people. For instance, following secret talks with  the radical Hamas people, to which Rabin had sent him, General  Doran reported recently that Hamas would prefer Israeli  occupation to autonomy -- for fear of a regime by 'Arafat and  his people.    ['Arafat] That is a wrong story that the Israelis keep  repeating. They are trying to play us off against one another.  We are sure, however, that our unity is strong, much too strong  to be jeopardized by such efforts.    [Beninger] Nonetheless, how about your relations with  Hamas? Do you believe their assertions that they want to  prevent civil war?    ['Arafat] Why civil war? Who is talking about civil war?  This is something the Israelis talk about. Their military  officers sell weapons, guns, because they hope the Palestinians  could then start waging war against one another, they hope they  will be split. The Israelis must withdraw. Please tell every  Israeli, every Israeli official, that I am sure that such  actions will not influence our free men, our free people in any  way. They will have no influence on a democracy and a society  in which human rights are respected.    You should remember, for instance, that many Palestinian  organizations were represented in Beirut that had all types of  weapons -- guns, rifles, and even tanks. Nothing happened among  them. Rather there was unity and stability among the  Palestinians. We are certain that the Palestinians will  demonstrate responsibility. Granted, there will be opposition,  but this is part of our democracy.    [Beninger] Against this background, how about your relations  with Syria? Will you meet with President al-Asad in the next  few weeks?    ['Arafat] If there is an opportunity, why not? But we  should not forget that there was a meeting in Damascus recently  between Syria, Egypt, and other states, and these states  expressly support the declaration that we signed with Israel.    [Beninger] You will need huge sums to reconstruct Gaza and  Jericho....    ['Arafat] ... and the West Bank.    [Beninger] How about the financial situation of the PLO?    ['Arafat] You know that several countries promised us help.  We have pledges from the World Bank and the EC. We have a  number of bilateral pledges, and U.S. President Clinton promised  us $2.2 billion at short notice.    [Beninger] There has been vehement criticism from your own  ranks in recent weeks about yourself and your leadership style.    ['Arafat] Are you against democracy? Isn't this so in  Austria, too? Why do you speak about democracy in your country,  whereas in the case of the Palestinians, you do not consider  criticism a sign of democracy? If there is no opposition,  something is wrong.    [Beninger] Do you have concrete plans to bind the people who  are opposed to you into the work?    ['Arafat] Of course, they will also help reconstruct their  country.    [Beninger] Some Palestinian experts and even the World Bank  and the European Community have criticized the fact that you  brought PEDRA (Palestine Economic Development and Reconstruction  Authority, which is to take over management of the entire aid  funds -- editorial board) under your personal control, and the  two vice presidents of PEDRA (Faruq Qaddumi and Mohammed Zahdi  -- editorial board), who are politicians and no economic experts  ....    ['Arafat] Who says that? These are rumors.    [Beninger] So there was criticism?    ['Arafat] Some, but no official criticism, just one of those  obstructive maneuvers and rumors. We are talking about facts.  A counter example is the way the World Bank is dealing with our  economic facilities. The same holds true for Europe, the  European Community.    [Beninger] How do you assess Austria's role in the Middle  East process? During the Bruno Kreisky era, Austria played a  decisive role in the region. This is not nearly the case any  more to the former extent.    ['Arafat] We should not forget what they are doing now.  What the Austrians are doing is very important. They are doing  their best.    [Beninger] Does this also include their material aid, which,  compared with comparable countries, appears to be a bit small,  doesn't it?    ['Arafat] We are satisfied with what the kindly people in  Austria are doing for us. But we should never forget what a  significant role my friend, Bruno Kreisky, played for us. I  wish he could be here. I wish he were still alive.</p>

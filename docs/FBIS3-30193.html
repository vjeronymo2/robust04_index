People are not only panning for gold but  also digging for gold ore, primarily in Ky Anh and Huong Khe  districts.    At the Hoa Hai gold mine in Huong Khe District, people from  various localities have come to dig for gold ore using a variety  of implements such as rock crushers and manual grading machines.  At times, thousands have come, with the average being 200  people with about 40 rock crushers in operation. There have been  reports that Nguyen Van Dai, a local person, extracted 40 kg of  gold ore, which is the equivalent of 26 ounces of gold. After  mining this gold, he abandoned his tools and left the area,  fearing that he would be robbed. One person was murdered while  digging for gold.    Village authorities collect 1.2 million dong for each gold  excavation pit without giving any attention to how the land is  dug up. This has had a serious impact on the environment.</p>

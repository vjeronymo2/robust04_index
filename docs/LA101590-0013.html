			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Name Game: Columnist Liz Smith reports that Vanity Fair magazine writer Maureen  Orth asked Marla Maples whether she would keep her maiden name if she married  real estate magnate Donald Trump. "I always promised Daddy I'd keep my name  because I'm an only child and he never had a son . . . . so I don't know --  maybe Marla Maples Trump." Meanwhile, she is living well, Orth reports, with  luxury suites in Aspen, Colo., and at Trump Plaza, a New York sublet and an  apartment in Century City.  </P> <P> Queen's Ransom: A Canadian publisher has been ordered by a British court to  surrender profits from "Courting Disaster," a best-seller by Malcolm Barker, a  former royal family employee, and Tim Sobey, about Buckingham Palace scandals.  "The penalty is extraordinary," said a Fleetwood Publications spokesman. Barker  said he hoped the book, which is rife with descriptions of homosexuality,  alcoholism and bad hygiene, would expose the Royal Family's lack of security  and inspire improvements.  </P> <P> Next Best Thing: Playboy magazine is banned in Saudi Arabia, but Kimberley  Conrad Hefner is starting a letter-writing campaign to American troops. "I'm  asking all the recent playmates to write to our servicemen. I know many of us  would go to Saudi Arabia tomorrow if we could," said the 1989 Playmate of the  Year, who married Playboy founder Hugh Hefner last year. Her first letter  included a picture of herself in a swimsuit.  </P> <P> Hello? Helmsley Hotel?: Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti does not like  smoky rooms, or steps to climb off-stage. He likes his decor in jewel tones,  king-size beds, large television screens and Italian movie tapes. These are  among the particulars the famously particular tenor asked for with his recent  reservation at the Blakely Hotel in Knoxville, Tenn. That's not all. When his  plane lands, Pavarotti wants an electric golf cart to take him from his plane  to his limo.  </P></p>

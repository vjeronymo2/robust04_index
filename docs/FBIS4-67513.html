			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of Kazakhstan's Ministry for Ecology  and Biological Resources fear that the shortage of money causes  delays in commissioning (late 1994) of the first stage of the  republic's system of utilization and burial of radioactive  waste. A spokesman for the Ministry said that the program may  be hampered by the negative attitude towards it by the heads of  the regional administrations. For example, only the leadership  of the Akmolinsk Region gave its consent for burial sites of  radioactive waste on its territory.    This year it is also planned to devise maps of the burial of  radioactive waste and its sources on the territory of  Kazakhstan, to take photos and start research studies in the  area of the Semipalatinsk test ground. The Ministry plans to  spend 12.04 million tenges (over 414,000 U.S. dollars)    Last year the volume of investments constituted 1.82 million  tenges (over 384,000 U.S. dollars as of the date of the  introduction of the national currency in the republic).  However, the general contractor responsible for the fulfillment  of the radio ecological works, the National Nuclear Center of  Kazakhstan, could not cope with the planned volume of research  work due to the lack of funds.    At present the republic has a total of 900 enterprises  polluting the environment and over 75,339 other sources of  radioactive pollutants.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> KILLER GETS DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> A former Cal State Chico football player was sentenced to death for the torture  murders of a couple during a 1987 robbery. Steven Crittenden, 21, had been  convicted by a jury in Auburn of murdering Dr. William Chiappella, 68, and his  wife, Katherine, 67, who were bound and gagged, then stabbed and beaten in  their Chico home. Placer County Superior Court Judge James Garbolino accepted  the jury's recommendation that Crittenden be put to death, despite defense  attorney Don Blake's contention that only one person had received the death  penalty in six neighboring counties in recent years.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- The farm ministry has  incorporated gains of 211.7 billion yen accruing from emergency  rice imports in the fiscal 1994 budget, ministry sources said  Wednesday [13 April].    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries started  rice imports on an emergency basis last November to make up for  a supply shortage resulting from a poor rice harvest in Japan  last year.    The sources said the ministry estimates total rice imports  at  2.29 million tons.    They said the ministry set the ceiling of rice imports at  2.65 million tons and if the imports hit the upper limit, the  ministry's earnings amount to about 250 billion yen.    The ministry makes profits by selling foreign rice to  wholesalers at prices higher than import prices. The yen's  appreciation also boosted the ministry's gains.    The sources said the ministry's gains from rice imports  average about 92,000 yen per ton.    The sources said the ministry will use the gains for  payments  of mutual aid insurance to rice growers who suffered from the  poor harvest.    They said insurance payments have hit a record high of 440  billion yen.</p>

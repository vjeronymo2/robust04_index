			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Arms treaty is a hostage to fortune - Potential dangers for Start 2 START 2 is, as Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin stressed yesterday, uniquely radical among arms treaties: it has sharply reduced armaments rather than, as Mr Bush said, simply 'freezing the arms race in place'. Its radicalism, and the speed with which it was signed ('a matter of a few months', said Mr Yeltsin proudly yesterday, contrasting it with 15 years for the first Start treaty) means that it faces three large potential dangers, which there has been no time to defuse. First, such large cuts will take time: all of 10 years, to 2003, for the two countries to bring down their strategic weaponry to the 3,000-3,500 warheads permitted (plus a maximum of 1,750 submarine-launched warheads). In that period, relations between the two states could worsen - will worsen, if the feared lurch to Russian authoritarianism happens. This could mean a breaching of the treaties, a freezing of the missiles' destruction (the more so since this is agreed to be done with US assistance) and a return to arms build-up. Second, the opposition to the treaties within the Russian parliament is strong - though Mr Yeltsin confidently declared yesterday that it was 'not the majority', being confined to those who 'are against everything positive which occurs in Russia'. Opponents have already latched on to what they say are unequal aspects in the treaty, claiming that the provisions for inspection give US officials carte blanche on Russian territory. The claim forced Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, to tell parliament on December 10 that the arrangements were predicated on Russia receiving Dollars 400m (Pounds 263.1m) to assist the dismantling of the weapons and that they 'freed our citizens from an additional burden of defence spending'. However, the opposition deputies share, and seek to stimulate, a feeling of shame in Russia that it is reduced to inequality by comparison with its historic enemy, the US. Mr Iona Andronov, deputy chairman of the parliament's international relations committee, said last month 'this agreement. . . has brought a great nation to its knees'. Mr Yeltsin, however, has made a point of involving Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, chairman of the international relations committee, in the talks: Mr Ambartsumov, a one-time radical who now takes a moderately nationalist position, will give vital support in parliament. Third, there remains the Ukrainian problem. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan retain strategic nuclear arms (they have sent their more numerous tactical weapons to Russia). All three states have twice mutually promised to renounce nuclear weapons: once in Alma Ata in December 1991 and again in Lisbon last May. All have committed themselves to ratifying Start and to signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Only Kazakhstan, so far, has ratified Start. Ukraine, as the largest of the non-Russian nuclear powers, is demonstrating what Mr Bohdan Kravchenko, an adviser to the country's government, recently admitted was an 'ambivalent' position. It has insisted on exercising sovereignty over all the 176 nuclear missiles deployed on its territory (saying it was ensuring their 'non-use'); it is now seeking security guarantees in return for the pledge to destroy warheads - a pledge which has anyway shifted from being executed by 1994 to the end of this decade. In a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, Mr Zalmay Khalilzad, former US assistant deputy under-secretary of defence, claimed that 'the mood in Kiev is shifting against disarmament' and forecast that the parliamentary debate on Start and NPT scheduled for next month 'is. . . likely to demand their renegotiation'. Were this to be Ukraine's position, it is likely that neighbouring Belarus, at least, would follow suit. After the triumphs of Moscow yesterday, Ukraine becomes the focus of diplomatic efforts to address its fears about non-nuclear life next to a nuclear Russia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE HAVE ALL THE WARHEADS GONE?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deployed strategic nuclear warheads  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US: 9,862 warheads, being: 500 warheads on MX/Peacekeeper ICBMs; 1,500 warheads on Minuteman III ICBMs; 370 warheads on Minuteman II ICBMs; 2,816 warheads on Trident I (C-4) SLBMs; 768 warheads on Trident II (D-5) SLBMs; 1,520 warheads on B-1B bombers; 1,860 warheads on B-52H bombers; 528 warheads on B-52G bombers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Former Soviet Union: 10,909 warheads, being: 296 warheads on SS-11 ICBMs; 40 warheads on SS-13 ICBMs; 176 warheads on SS-17 ICBMs; 3,080 warheads on SS-18 ICBMs; 1,800 warheads on SS-19 ICBMs; 920 warheads on SS-24 ICBMs; 315 warheads on SS-25 ICBMs; 176 warheads on SS-N-6 SLBMs; 280 warheads on SS-N-8 SLBMs; 672 warheads on SS-N-18 SLBMs; 1,200 warheads on SS-N-20 SLBMs; 448 warheads on SS-N-23 SLBMs; 240 warheads on Bear-G bombers; 1,074 warheads on Bear-H bombers; 192 warheads on Blackjack bombers. of which: Belarus: 81 warheads on SS-25 ICBMs. Kazakhstan: 1,410 warheads, being: 1,040 warheads on SS-18 ICBMs; and 370 warheads on Bear-H bombers.

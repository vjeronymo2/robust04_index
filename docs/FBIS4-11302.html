			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- An impressive contingent of  Cuban emigrants, who defend the normalization of their relations  with the island, arrived in Havana today. They voiced  expressions of enthusiasm and expectation for the congress,  which begins tomorrow.    The newly arrived travelers made the trip despite threats  and  insults from the most conservative sectors entrenched in this  U.S. city [city not specified], who failed in their attempts to  prevent the emigrants from attending the meeting.    "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, convened by the  Cuban Foreign Ministry, seeks to begin the process of addressing  the concerns and requests of Cubans who live overseas and to  consolidate the ties that unite them to their country of origin.    To this end, approximately 200 emigrants were invited to  participate in the event. Reality seems to indicate that this  number will be surpassed, as dozens of them arrived from other  countries, ahead of the large group that was welcomed today and  those who are expected tomorrow.    The hotel lobby became the setting for the first meetings,  conversations, and greetings. All this occurred amid the  urgency of the many reporters and the lights of several foreign  television cameras, as they all tried to capture the first  statements of the newly arrived home comers.    Those who accepted the invitation represent a broad spectrum  of opinions and ideologies that characterize the Cuban emigrant  community. In general, their impressions about the conference,  scheduled to conclude Sunday, were marked by expressions of  certainty about the positive results the meeting will have.    Another point of concurrence, with which even those who do  not accept the island's political process agree, is the  condemnation of the U.S. trade embargo against the Caribbean  nation and the call for changes in U.S. policy toward the island.    Journalists Luis Ortega and Marcos Castellon; Luis Torres, a  participant in the failed invasion at Playa Giron [Bay of Pigs]  in 1961; Maritere Vishop of the Cuban Change organization;  Andres Gomez, the director of the AREITO magazine; and Xiomara  Almaguer-Levy, of the Jewish Solidarity [previous two words in  English] group, arrived with the first contingent.    Castellon told PRENSA LATINA how radio stations controlled  by  the most radical enemies of the Cuban Government broadcast false  information about the situation on the island, just hours before  they took off.    Torres gave a similar report, adding that the leaders of the  groups that oppose the conference made numerous threats against  those who accepted the invitation from Havana. They united in  spreading false rumors, which were swiftly denied by the truth.    Both individuals concurred in stating that events such as  those only demonstrate desperation, before the support for the  idea of defending the rights of the emigrants to normalize their  relations with the Cuban State has rallied.    The conference begins tomorrow with the special  participation  of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who will discuss official  migration policy.</p>

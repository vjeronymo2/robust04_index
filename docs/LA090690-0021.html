			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW / L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> 'NATIVE DANCE' AT SUNSET CANYON CENTER  </P> <P> By staging "Native Dance of North America" in two separated outdoor areas of  the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Festival denied  its audience a fixed, passive perspective. Some parts of the program were  sequential, others simultaneous -- so you had to choose, to keep moving, to get  involved.  </P> <P> The program emphasized the diversity of Native American dance, ranging from the  surging spatial freedom of the Ikooc from Southern Mexico to the weighty  rootedness of the King Island Inupiat from Alaska. Sometimes the focus narrowed  to a simple two-step, such as the one taught the audience by the Cahuilla Bird  Singers from California. Elsewhere, it expanded to encompass the intricate,  buoyant footwork executed by the Jemez Pueblo Turquoise clan from New Mexico.  </P> <P> Accompaniments varied, too: violin and guitar in the Jemez Matachina ritual,  large tambourine-like drums and voice for the Inupiat, gourds for the Cahuilla  singers, flute and bells (plus percussion) for the Ikooc.  </P> <P> Such differences eventually helped you appreciate issues drawing the groups  together: performance as a family matter, for example. Celebrating the natural  world (especially animals). Using song and dance to safeguard the continuity of  a culture.  </P> <P> Carrying life-size wooden replicas of swordfish, the Ikooc swooped across open  lawn looking joyously connected to their environment -- and perfectly placed  against a backdrop of pines and a full moon. In the same space later on, the  Jemez Matachina ceremony made a statement about nurturing innocence and  neutralizing savagery -- but lightly, within vivacious group dances revealing  stylistic links to both Spain and Mexico.  </P> <P> In a more conventional setting (amphitheater seating, a slab stage backed with  banners), the six Cahuilla men shared the creation and migration lore of their  people through excerpts from song cycles that can last the whole night. Later,  the Inupiat offered a survey of their traditions -- games, crafts, performance  -- with women prominent for the first time on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Indeed, the sight of Inupiat women patting the air with gloved hands and  bobbing in place, while their men did a punching, stamping version of the same  movement, provided one of the most telling contrasts in an evening teeming with  them.  </P></p>

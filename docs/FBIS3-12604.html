			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Killers, Not Victims"] </F>   [Text] World Zionism and its military tool, the Israeli  entity, have been established against the background of a great  lie; namely, the world's persecution of the Jews and the  Europeans' alleged massacres of them. The Ramadan massacre,  which was committed by a rancorous Zionist Jew at dawn last  Friday, is one more piece of evidence to be added to hundreds of  other pieces of evidence, which all prove that the persecution  of the Jews was a big lie. This evidence exposes to the entire  world the falsehood of the Zionist allegations that have been  used to extort the West, which later adopted them to vent its  wrath against the Arabs and Muslims.    The political Israeli condemnation of the Ramadan massacre  does not absolve the Israeli entity from direct responsibility  for this massacre. What Rabin has said is not enough to deny  his joy over seeing the Palestinian blood spilt over the floor  of the Ibrahimi Mosque or to deny his happiness with that racist  action by a Jew who was brought up according to a rancorous  Torah ideology that views the Arab as the target at which all  rifles must be aimed and the Muslim as a potential victim that  must be chased until shot dead. There is no difference between  Rabin, Sharon, Shamir, and the Zionist killer with his American  and Jewish roots. There is no difference between the  Palestinian being killed by regular soldiers or by settlers who  carry all the instruments of death, except the military uniform.  It is natural for the Zionist school to produce all those  killers whose hands are stained with the blood of the  Palestinian people and whose nails have torn our flesh, which  has been scorched by their warplanes, tanks, and bombs.    Besides, the world which happily watches massacres and is  pleased to see peoples being torn apart by troubles and  tragedies, cannot change from one massacre to another. It is  hard, therefore, to believe that those who committed the  massacre at the al-'Amiriyah shelter in Baghdad can be sincere  in their sentiments toward the Ramadan massacre in Hebron. It  is hard to expect them to be committed to ethics and values  where the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is concerned, while Muslims  are being subjected to daily massacres, rape, death, hunger, and  disease in Yugoslavia and behind the racist wall erected by the  United States and its allies around the Iraqi people and their  children's right to milk and their sick people's right to  medicine.    The Ramadan massacre by the Jews and their allies, the  enemies of the Palestinian rights and people, the enemies of all  Arabs and Muslims is not the exception, but the rule.  Therefore, it will be difficult for us to believe the West's  condemnation of the massacre unless it is coupled by real action  which punishes the aggressor, works to establish a just peace,  and puts an end to the Jewish allegations about their having  been subjected to massacres and persecution.</p>

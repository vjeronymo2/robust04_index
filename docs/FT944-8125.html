			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Russian officials blamed over cash probe An international investigation into the flight of capital from the former Soviet Union has run into the ground because of the refusal of Russian officials to co-operate, it was claimed yesterday. Mr Jules Kroll, president of Kroll Associates, the leading international corporate investigative agency, described the Russian investigation as the 'most frustrating case' of his company's 22-year history. He told UK regulators attending a seminar in London that Russian security officials had held back from providing information that would have allowed his agency to name and locate those responsible for illegally transferring funds to the west. 'We never received any feedback from their (Russian) internal security people to whom we entrusted the task of following up our leads,' Mr Kroll said. This is the first time that Kroll Associates have publicly commented on the problems of one of their most prestigious and high profile investigations. It is estimated that the apparent failure of the Russians to complete the contract may have cost Kroll up to Dollars 4.7m in expected revenue. The agency was contracted amid wide publicity in 1992 by the then Russian government led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, who is now the leader of the reformist opposition party Russia's Choice. The Kroll investigation had strong support from the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries who were considering fresh aid for Russia at the time but were anxious about the issue of flight capital estimated to be running at Dollars 1bn. Mr Kroll told the seminar organised by a London-based financial think-tank, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, that his investigators had identified a series of suspect bank accounts and property holdings owned by Russians in the west. 'Unfortunately we came up against a roadblock,' he said.</p>

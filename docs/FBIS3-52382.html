			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] Oil prices continue to fall steadily. During  last Wednesday's [29 December] exchanges in European markets,  the price of all varieties of crude oil fell to its lowest level  in the last five years. [passage omitted]    The West's double standard with regard to international  trade  is quite clear. On the one hand, the West has invariably called  for lifting tariffs and restrictions and has promoted the notion  of free trade; on the other hand, by imposing heavy tariffs on  fossil fuels, it has violated the most fundamental principle of  free trade.    Some economic analysts believe that at present, the  countries  of the Middle East region can bring their economies out of the  present vulnerability only by ending their reliance on income  generated by a single product and expanding their sources of  foreign exchange earnings.    The members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC],  together with Iran and Iraq, can form a powerful alliance in  connection with the oil issue. Due to their common cultural and  historical traits and their good understanding of production  capacities, and also in view of the fact that they hold control  over the most vital source of energy for the industrial  countries of the world, these states are able to deal with the  harmful policies of Europe and America with regards to gasoline.  They can, perhaps, impose heavy tariffs on European and  American products, thereby making amends for part of of the  losses incurred by the fall in oil prices.    In the same way that the Western world waged a devious  confrontation against the oil-producing countries in 1973, now  is the time for the OPEC member states to pave the way for real  growth without reliance on oil income. The OPEC member states  can achieve this growth by transforming their production  structures, lessening their reliance on income generated by oil,  and finally, by enhancing the rich culture of work and  contentment -- which are, after all, characteristics present in  Islamic countries.

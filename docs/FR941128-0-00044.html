			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Turning to NWF's recommendation that the rule contain enhanced opportunities for public participation in the abandoned sites inspection process, OSM is including a public notice provision that provides the general public with the opportunity to submit written comments to the regulatory authority when concerns are raised as to a particular inspection frequency adjustment. This enhancement coupled with opportunities for private citizen involvement in the inspection process already provided under other regulations and discussed below will provide ample public participation in the inspection of abandoned sites. 30 CFR 842.14 provides that any person who is or may be adversely affected by a surface coal mining and reclamation operation may notify the Director in writing of any alleged failure on the part of OSM to make adequate and complete periodic inspections and the Director must respond with a determination including any actions to be taken to remedy any noncompliance. When a person provides OSM with reason to believe that there exists any violation at an abandoned site, that person may request a Federal inspection and has the right to accompany the inspector during the inspection. To the extent a person is not satisfied with a Federal inspector's decision not to inspect or enforce, the person is entitled to informal review of that decision by the Director of OSM, and can subsequently appeal to the Office of Hearings and Appeals within DOI. Finally, 30 CFR 840.15 provides that each State program shall provide for public participation in the enforcement of the State program consistent with the Federal provisions cited above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM encourages States to work with potentially affected citizens where a concern arises for a particular minesite. The ability and willingness of State regulatory authorities to work closely with citizens is clearly recognized in OSM's mission and vision statement and is a key part of making the Act work successfully. As part of its oversight duties, OSM will monitor the willingness of States to be responsive to the concerns of citizens and to allow them full access to information needed to evaluate the effect of mining on their health, safety, general welfare and property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Sections 840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, sections 840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1) are not being adopted as proposed, but instead are being revised. Under the final rule, before proceeding to reduce the inspection frequency at any abandoned site as authorized under 840.11(h) introductory text/842.11(f) introductory text, the regulatory authority must first conduct a complete inspection of the site. On that basis and on the basis of comments received during the public notice period required under this paragraph, the regulatory authority shall prepare and maintain for public review and Federal oversight purposes a written finding justifying the alternative inspection frequency selected. The prerequisite complete inspection is an on-site status review of all applicable performance standards conducted with an eye towards the long term effects of reducing the inspection frequency. Regulatory authorities shall make the written finding immediately available to OSM and the public in the area of mining in accordance with 30 CFR 840.14,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Availability of records. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To assist the public and OSM in reviewing written findings in a meaningful and expeditious manner, regulatory authorities are expected under this provision to maintain or be able to generate within a reasonable time a current compilation or index of all abandoned sites for which an inspection frequency adjustment has been made under this rule. Each written finding shall justify a reduced inspection frequency by affirmatively addressing in detail all of the following criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (h)(1)(i)/(f)(1)(i) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a prerequisite to any reduction in inspection frequency, the regulatory authority must explain how the site meets each of the criteria under the definition of an abandoned site under 30 CFR 840.11(g)/842.11(e). Meeting these criteria demonstrates that the regulatory authority has taken, and continues to be in the process of taking, all available enforcement within its reach under its regulatory program to secure abatement of violations and completion of reclamation at an abandoned site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (h)(1)(ii)/(f)(1)(ii) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulatory authority must document whether there exist impoundments, earthen structures or other conditions such as acid mine drainage that pose, or reasonably may be expected to progress into, imminent dangers to the health and safety of the public or significant environmental harms to land, air, or water resources as defined under 30 CFR 701.5. Depending on the circumstances, this criterion alone may be sufficient to warrant no reduction in inspection frequency or at least selection of a frequency in the high range. Even though there may be no remedy immediately available to abate any such dangers or harms, frequent monitoring can serve to give advance warning to the public or appropriate government agencies and serve as a basis to expedite reclamation or abatement of dangers or harms through the bond forfeiture process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (h)(1)(iii)/(f)(1)(iii) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulatory authority must document the extent to which existing impoundments or earthen structures were constructed and certified in accordance with prudent engineering practices and designs approved in the permit. This could be beneficial in support of a reduced frequency since structures such as ponds, head of hollow and valley fills, coal waste refuse piles, backfills or impoundments pose less risk of failure when constructed as designed and certified than structures that were not. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

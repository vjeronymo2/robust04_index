			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "Voldemars Selga Was Shot"] </F>   [Excerpts] Riga, 16 March -- At 2030 on Tuesday, 15 March,  on Rusanu street in Riga, businessman Voldemars Selga was killed  after suffering two gunshot wounds -- chief of the Criminal  Police of the Latvian Ministry of Interior Affairs, Laimonis  Liepins, reported yesterday. V. Selga died on his way to the  hospital, without regaining consciousness.    Assistant General Prosecutor Rita Aksenoka added that,  according to police information, the murder took place at a  garage where V. Selga kept his car. He was attacked by a lone  assailant who fired twice. "There was one eyewitness to the  attack, but it must be taken into account that it was already  dark, and this may make it difficult to get a precise  description of the murderer," said R. Aksenoka.    V. Selga was chairman of the board of the Latvian  Reconstruction and Development Bank [LRAB], and the owner of its  control packet, as well as the owner of several Latvian  companies and joint-ventures. About a year and a half ago, a  criminal case was lodged against him for large-scale fraud. On  25 September 1992, V. Selga was arrested and charged with  cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara," in a  deal worth 50 million rubles. [passage omitted]    A few hours before his death, Selga had called the  investigating magistrate.    "At around 1800 on Tuesday, Voldemars Selga called me and  asked when I was going to finish the investigation. He told me  it has been settled with my administration, although nothing of  the kind has taken place," Maigurs Strikis, the investigating  officer of the Ministry of Interior Affairs Investigating  Department, who is in charge of the case, told us yesterday.    As for the question of what is going to happen to the case,  the investigator replied that apparently it will be closed due  to the death of the accused. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / People: BT's Romeril departs for Xerox in US Barry Romeril, BT's group finance director since 1988 and one of the most powerful men in Britain's telecommunications behemoth, has resigned to take up the post of chief financial officer at Xerox Corporation in the US. Romeril, 49, is no stranger to north America. In previous incarnations, as assistant treasurer of ICI Americas and US chief financial officer for BTR Inc, he built up several years' experience of American accounting practices. Yesterday he said he was sorry to be leaving BT but the opportunity at Xerox was attractive and fitted in with a desire to return to work once more in the US. The parting with BT seems entirely amicable. Romeril does not join Xerox until June 30, and Iain Vallance, BT chairman, yesterday paid him a glowing tribute. It does, however, leave a significant gap in BT's senior management; the company said yesterday it had not yet decided on his replacement. Romeril, born in Jersey in the Channel Islands and educated at Oxford University where he read economics, was seen on his appointment to BT as one of a 'new guard' of young British managers with a reputation for cutting costs. It was a skill he was to use year after year in improving BT's profitability. At Xerox Romeril will become an executive vice president and a member of chairman Paul Allaire's corporate office. He takes over a post that has been vacant since 1990 when Stuart Ross became chairman of Xerox Financial Services. Xerox clearly has need of Romeril's cost-cutting experience; it pulled out of financial services earlier this year at an estimated cost of Dollars 3bn.</p>

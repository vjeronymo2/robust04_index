			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HARD TO KILL': ACTION AT POINT-BLANK RANGE  </P> <P> Steven Seagal, the hero of "Hard to Kill" (citywide), is not just hard to kill.  He's practically impossible to kill. Early on, hired assassins blaze away at  him repeatedly from point-blank range. All it does is knock him into a coma for  seven years.  </P> <P> When he wakes up, Seagal's "unstoppable" Storm Mason really hits his stride.  Wave after wave of murderers stalk him, ambush him, surround him, blast him  with automatic rifles, flail away at him with knives and hatchets -- all to  little avail. Even lying flat on his back on a hospital cart, armed with  nothing but a mop, he's more than a match for everybody. And, after he  recovers, with the help of Kelly Le Brock and acupuncture, he's hell on wheels:  ready to match antics with Stallone, Schwarzenegger and any other  one-against-a-hundred Ubermensch in town.  </P> <P> There's a plot to this ludicrous mayhem, but it's almost embarrassing to  repeat. In it, Mason surreptitiously records a murder-for-hire discussion  between a "flamboyant Los Angeles assemblyman" and Mafia killers. Then Mason  makes a phone call to headquarters: a hideous mistake, since every phone call  in the movie is constantly being intercepted by crooked cops or leering thugs  -- and he winds up with his friend and wife dead, his son in hiding and himself  comatose in the hospital, being ogled by nurse Le Brock. Meanwhile, the  assemblyman, riding on his vacuous blond looks, inane slogans ("You can take  that to the bank!") and hypocritical politics, rises inevitably toward the vice  presidency: the only half-believable element in the script.  </P> <P> But they made a mistake. They made Mason mad. What does it matter if he's  battling a senator, corrupt police, dozens of surly thugs and the entire phone  system? These guys don't know who they're messing with. Soon, they're dropping  like flies: crashing through windows, tumbling over car hoods, blasted through  piazzas, blowing up in cars, spinning head over heels in their own gore.  </P> <P> Most one-against-a-hundred action movies are fairly reactionary, full of  vigilante cops and lone avengers. Seagal's movies tend to be leftish, which  makes for a fairly curious conclusion: at the climax, the senator is holed up  just like a cocaine czar, with bikinied doxies and sneering torpedoes.  </P> <P> Seagal , a martial-arts expert, has lots of nifty chop-socky moves and a  menacing murmur that sounds like Mickey Rourke doing Clint Eastwood. Le Brock  looks great and manages her costume changes with dispatch.  </P> <P> Director Bruce Malmuth keeps all the carnage in the frame, despite his  addiction to sweaty close-ups and wet streets. Everyone else in the  preposterous "Hard to Kill" (rated R, for sex, nudity, language and violence)  dies right on schedule. There's nothing dopier than the crooks in  one-against-a-hundred action movies -- except maybe the people who cook them  up.  </P> <P> 'HARD TO KILL'  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. release of an Adelson/Todman/Simon production. Producers Gary  Adelson, Joel Simon, Bill Todman Jr. Director Bruce Malmuth. Script Steven  McKay. Executive producers Lee Rich, Michael Rachmil. Music David Michael  Frank.

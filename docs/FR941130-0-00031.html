			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters that opposed the LDP provision asserted that all association members, regardless of location, should be treated the same and be allowed to participate in the conversion process on an equal basis. The objections raised by commenters opposing the LDP provision included the following: all depositors have ownership, voting and liquidation rights, deposits are used indiscriminately, and the definition of customer should not be related to location; the LDP provision is an artificial distinction between depositors based upon geography; non-local persons with long-term accounts and/or more money in accounts would have a lower priority than local persons with shorter-term accounts and/or less money; the LDP is arbitrary, capricious, unfairly discriminatory, ill-suited to advancing any legitimate public policy objective, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the LDP deprives non-locals, who have had long-term accounts with significant amounts of money and who maintain banking relationships, of rightful opportunity to participate in attractive conversions; it is unconscionable for a federal agency to require U.S. citizens to be treated differently based on their residence; and the LDP provision conflicts with the takings, due process and equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> One of the most detailed comment letters came from counsel representing Thrift Depositors of America, Inc. (TDA), a trade association of mutual savings association depositors. A lawsuit by TDA (TDA vs. OTS, Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1008, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia) alleged that the OTS's implementation of the LDP in the interim final rule without a notice and comment period violated the APA. On September 29, 1994, the Court ruled that because the OTS had failed to adequately justify waiving notice and comment for the LDP, it would enjoin the OTS from proceeding with mutual-to-stock conversions containing the LDP provision until a new rule was finalized in accordance with the notice and comment procedures of the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several of the commenters objected to the LDP provision because they believe that it violates federal and state policies and laws that prohibit discrimination. The OTS acknowledges that the effect of the rule is to authorize a preference to a certain type of depositor. The LDP rule, however, does not discriminate against any person based on age, race, sex, ethnic background, religion or any other impermissible category. Its purpose is to reward those who have and will maintain a banking relationship with the institution. While using residency as the basis for determining this category of depositors is inexact, it is valid to assume that generally local depositors fall into that category and non-local depositors do not. The OTS believes that providing for a LDP provision will assist in achieving the goals of (1) recognizing those depositors who have maintained long-term banking relationships with the converting institution and thereby contributed to its financial success, and who are likely to continue to do so in the future, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and (2) promoting ownership by persons who have close ties to the community. Thus, in the OTS's view, the rule does not violate federal or state policies against discrimination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> OTS cannot, in a regulation, identify with exactitude every single instance in which a depositor has maintained a long-term banking relationship with a converting institution and thereby contributed to its financial success. However, it is both rational and convenient, for reasons discussed elsewhere in this preamble, to identify this group as the local depositors. Moreover, as discussed more fully below, the OTS has provided a mechanism to enable converting institutions, in applying the LDP, to take account of unique and compelling circumstances posed by persons who are not local depositors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS also believes that the constitutional arguments raised by certain commenters are without merit. As has been recognized by a number of courts, the property rights of mutual account holders are extremely limited. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the OTS conversion regulations, the limited rights that depositors have to share  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the surplus of a liquidated mutual savings association is recognized by the establishment of a liquidation account in the converted association. No distinction is made between local and non-local depositors in the establishment of these accounts and nothing in the interim rule or this final rule would diminish a depositor's interest in his or her liquidation account. Similarly, the OTS does not believe that authorizing the LDP provision violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Although the LDP provision does make a distinction between depositors, the OTS believes, for the reasons discussed above, that there is a rational basis for authorizing an institution to make the distinction and that the provision reasonably relates to legitimate policy objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Paulsen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> C.I.R.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 469 U.S. 131 (1985);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Ordower  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Bell Fed.

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie stages strong rally to regain 3,100 level - Market report An uninspiring and dispirited performance by London's equity market throughout a sluggish and tired morning session was transformed by the latest data from the US, which indicated a marked slowing down of inflationary pressures affecting producer prices in the US. Down almost 18 points within an hour of the opening, the FT-SE 100 commenced a powerful and sustained rally shortly after the US news was announced, easily regaining the 3,100 level and closing a net 6.3 higher at 3,105.9. The news that producer prices had fallen by 0.5 per cent, against expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase, took the markets completely by surprise and prompted strong gains across internat-ional bond and equity markets. Wall Street, which gave an alarmingly erratic performance on Wednesday evening, initially moving up 38 points on the Dow Jones Average and then sliding to a 20-point net loss before rallying to close a shade higher, was almost 20 points up shortly after it opened yesterday. The Dow was 11 points ahead well after London closed. The first back-to-back fall in producer prices for more than three years was seen by markets as a potent signal that the US economy is slowing and was thought to lessen the chances that US interest rates will rise more than 50 basis points next week. On Tuesday the Federal Open Market Committee meets to formulate US interest rate policy and has long been expected to promote another rise in US interest rates. Prior to yesterday's producer price data, economists and strategists expected the Federal Reserve to lift US rates, currently at 4.75 per cent, by at least 50 basis points and possibly by a full percentage point. Earlier, London opened on a quiet note and almost totally lacking in enthusiasm after Wall Street's surprising lack of follow-through on Wednesday. There was no support for equities from the gilts market, which edged down and showed little signs of rallying. There was no comfort for the markets from Germany, where the Bundesbank council met for its regular fortnightly meeting and signalled no change in German interest rates. Although most analysts had forecast no change, there were suggestions in the market that a small reduction had been possible. London's second line stocks gave a resilient performance throughout the day, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index only marginally lower at worst and eventually 9.5 higher at 3,542.8. Turnover in equities was 573m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks acccounting for around 57 per cent of the total. There was comfort for the City's harassed dealing teams with news that the value of customer business in the market on Wednesday was Pounds 1.6bn, the highest for a week. It was another heavy day of company trading statements, with the UK's two biggest companies, BT and Shell Transport, reporting. BT's results were above the consensus of forecasts but there was a measure of disappointment with the dividend increase, 6 per cent, against some over-optimisitc forecasts of 8 per cent. Shell's figures were in line with estimates but the shares slipped back in line with other oil stocks. A big two-way pull developed in Royal Insurance, with profit-takers moving in and outgunning bulls of the shares. The market's two newcomers, TLG, formerly the lighting division of Thorn EMI, and Tele-Cine, made reasonably successful debuts, both moving to modest premiums over the issue prices. Banks continued to outperform the market, especially Barclays and National Westminster. Northumbrian Water was the star performer in the utilities sectors after delivering a bumper 16 per cent increase in the interim dividend.</p>

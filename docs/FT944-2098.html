			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Witches lurk behind the Christmas tree - Wall Street - As the Dow bubbles unexpectedly, Patrick Harverson predicts trouble ahead The only predictable feature of the stock market this year has been its unpredictability. A little more than a week ago, Wall Street was reeling from a 50-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was the latest in a string of big sell-offs which had dragged blue-chip stocks close to their lows of the year and sucked much of the confidence out of the market. At the time, investors - already bruised by rising interest rates and fears of a darkening economic outlook - were also being battered by the biggest municipal bankruptcy in US history and the mysterious cancellation of a Dollars 2bn cash distribution by the nation's biggest mutual fund. The climate on Wall Street was so chilly that most pundits predicted that the market would miss its traditional year-end rise in share prices - the so-called 'December rally'. This week, however, the mood abruptly changed, and like many of the market's moves this year, initially no one was quite sure what was behind the shift. Since its big decline on December 8, the Dow has rebounded more than 90 points, or 2.5 per cent. Now, talk of a December rally is being revived, and investors are realising that there may be something under the Christmas tree for them, after all. The market's turnaround can be traced to the easing of fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates once more before the year ended. The selling of shares in early December followed a strong November employment report which led some analysts to predict that the Fed would tighten monetary policy for the seventh, and final, time this year after the December 20 meeting of its open market committee. To this grim prospect of yet another rate increase was added the bankruptcy of Orange County, California, and the cancelled payout at the Fidelity Group's Magellan Fund. Although neither story had direct implications for share prices (the Orange county debacle only briefly roiled the bond market after it sparked a fire sale of billions of dollars in government agency securities, and the Magellan mix-up subsequently proved to be the product of a mathematical mistake), they clearly undercut sentiment. In the past week, however, a string of economic data has forced analysts to reconsider their predictions of a December 20 interest rate increase. The most important statistics concerned inflation. On Tuesday and Wednesday the government reported that producer prices rose by 0.5 per cent and consumer prices rose by 0.3 per cent in November. Neither figure was encouraging, but in both cases the closely-watched 'core' measure of price inflation (which excludes volatile components which distort the indices) rose at a slower rate than expected. The market was also encouraged by a report from the Philadelphia Fed which showed signs of moderate growth in business activity and only mild inflationary pressures in the region. Taken together, the data comforted investors who had been worried about another tightening of monetary policy. Ironically, the Orange County bankruptcy may also have contributed to the easing of investors' fears, because another rise in interest rates would have further undermined the value of Orange County's troubled bond and derivatives portfolio. Stocks were also aided this week by fresh declines in bond yields. In the past eight days the yield on the 30-year bond has dropped from 8 per cent to 7.85 per cent. This has helped allay concerns that rising bond yields would lure cash out of stocks into the Treasury market. The favourable move in bonds, however, has been offset by a sharp rise in yields on shorter-term government securities, such as two-year notes. This divergence has led to a further flattening in the yield curve - the graph of yields on securities with differing maturities - and, as bond market analysts never tire of pointing out, a rapid flattening of the yield curve typically precedes a sharp slowdown in economic growth. To most equity investors, however, the flattening yield curve is a technical phenomenon of little interest, and this weekend they are likely to be basking in the warm glow of the Dow's best weekly showing since early October. Yet, they should be warned against making too much of the gains of the past five days because for most of the week trading was greatly influenced by the manoeuvrings of institutions ahead of Friday afternoon's 'triple-witching hour'. Triple-witching is the name given to the simultaneous expiration of stock options and futures, which happens four times a year and often produces exceptional short-term movements in share prices. This week, these movements were mostly upwards, which made for some handsome gains in the Dow. Yet, they were gains which only cloaked the market's underlying weaknesses - without them, the Dow's advance would have been modest. Come Monday, share prices are likely to drop initially, and the market will almost certainly be sporting a triple-witching-sized hangover.  ----------------------------------------------- Dow Jones Ind Average  ----------------------------------------------- Monday         3718.37  +  27.36 Tuesday        3715.34  -  3.03 Wednesday      3746.29  +  30.95 Thursday       3765.47  +  19.18 Friday         3807.19  +  41.72  -----------------------------------------------</p>

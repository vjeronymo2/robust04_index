			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Sweden's Yes In the end, Sweden's vote to join the European Union was close, but clear enough. It was always going to be a hard decision to reverse all those years of staunch neutrality and independence. The fact that both the main party leaders, plus the heart of the business establishment, threw their weight behind a Yes vote must have convinced the waverers. Now Austria, Finland and Sweden have voted to accept the membership terms laboriously negotiated with Brussels, the pressure will be on the even more sceptical Norwegians to follow suit. If they stay out, as a majority still appears inclined to do, they will be extremely isolated in northern Europe. They are and will remain members of the European Economic Area, which gives them most of the advantages of the single market, but no real influence on all the rules and regulations which underpin it. The terms they have negotiated with the rest of the EU are, by any objective measure, a good deal. Even such a notorious sceptic as Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister, said so. It would be good for Norway, and good for the EU, if they now vote Yes as well. However, it is up to the rest of the Union to prove to its new members, from the obvious Euro-enthusiasts in Austria to the Euro-sceptics in Scandinavia, that the club is worth joining. By their accession, they will strengthen those voices arguing for free trade and budget discipline - for they are all going to be net contributors to the EU budget. They will provide a very healthy counterbalance to the rather more protectionist influence of the southern Mediterranean member states. They will bolster the free trade lobby headed by the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. They will also bring more votes for environmental protection, for open and democratic decision-making, and for high social standards, aims which have not proved so popular in London, at least. But the EU is nothing if it is not about the process of consensus-building and shared decision-making. Striking deals will inevitably become more difficult as the Union grows, but this means that more effort must be made to streamline the process, to reduce the bureaucracy, while at the same time providing maximum flexibility for the devolution of decision-making - so-called subsidiarity. Once Norway has voted, the EU can turn its attention in full to the real challenge of the end of the 20th century - which is to bring the fledgling democracies of central and eastern Europe into the fold. In both economic and political terms, it will prove a far more difficult process than the relatively painless task of embracing three or four prosperous western democracies. It will require far more adjustment in the policies and institutions of the EU. But it is the most important enlargement of all for the security, stability and long-term prosperity of the continent.</p>

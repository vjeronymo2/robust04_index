			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (14): Hopes for an upgrade in rating - A look at the investor view of an emerging market that is growing up fast FOR AN emerging market, Mexico is growing up fast. International investors have had a wide array of Mexican equity offerings and high-yielding bond issues from which to pick and choose for their Latin American portfolios over the past couple of years. And as a further sign of 'maturity', those Mexican companies which have come into close contact with the international investor fraternity have taken steps to improve the quality of information they provide. Now, investors are holding their breath for a decision on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which the optimists believe will eventually be passed by the US Congress. Once Nafta is out of the way, Mexico could well see its credit rating - a sensitive indicator of a country's standing in the eyes of the international investor community - raised from speculative to investment grade. Hopes of a rating upgrade have already helped to underpin the performance of Mexican bonds: if and when an upgrading eventually happens, a far wider range of investors will be able or more willing to invest in Mexican debt. Mexican names have been among the most prolific Latin American issuers of new debt and equity, accounting for about 40 per cent of total new eurobond issuance from the region as companies refinanced existing borrowings or raised money for further expansion. In the first nine months of 1993, Mexican borrowers raised a total of Dollars 5.909bn in the eurobond market, according to IFR Securities Data, compared with a total of Dollars 4.098bn in the whole of 1992. This year has seen the launch of larger, more liquid bond issues, including a Dollars 1bn, five-year issue from Cemex, the largest cement company in Mexico, in May, and a Dollars 750m eurobond from Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank, in June. Such liquidity has been warmly welcomed by international investors. In addition to bigger issues and greater liquidity, the international capital market has seen a far greater variety of Mexican borrowers, some of whom the international investing community regard as 'second tier' names, but which have nevertheless succeeded in raising funds. Despite a setback in the performance of Latin American bond issues in the autumn of 1992, when investors suddenly panicked at the thought of just how much new issuance was likely to hit the international capital market, yields have continued to fall in the secondary market, and borrowers have been able to launch deals at increasingly more aggressive levels. One Mexican sovereign issue, the 7.25 per cent issue due 1998, was sold in March at 208 basis points over the US treasury bond, and the spread narrowed to as little as 130 basis points in September before widening out slightly thereafter. As Mr Paul Luke, head of emerging market debt research at Morgan Grenfell, points out: 'Such a spread is closer to US corporate investment grade spreads than to the sub-investment grade that new Mexican issues are rated by Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P).' However, Mr John Purcell, director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers, notes some signs of investor resistance to the ever-tighter yield spreads at which new issues are launched. Investor demand for Mexican paper has been driven by the desire for high-yielding paper, given that US interest rates are at their lowest levels in 18 years. 'Institutional investors are in the market in a much bigger way than a year ago: they like the high yields and many of the investors have been making the effort to do their homework on the region so they feel more confident now about investing there,' says one Mexican analyst. Some investors hope to see a further rally in bond prices (and narrowing of yield spreads) if Mexico's credit rating is raised. S &amp; P rates Mexico's sovereign foreign currency debt as BB+, the highest category of sub-investment grade, whereas Moody's, the rival international credit rating agency, rates it Ba2, which is one notch below S &amp; P's equivalent rating. Meanwhile, Duff &amp; Phelps, a less closely-followed rating agency, has assigned an investment grade rating of BBB to Mexico's foreign currency debt. In the case of sovereign long-term peso-denominated debt, the discrepancy is greater: S &amp; P rates it AA- while Moody's rates it Baa1. Mr Purcell of Salomon Brothers, says S &amp; P is altogether far more optimistic about Mexico's creditworthiness and argues that an upgrading of the rating for foreign currency debt could take place in the second half of 1994. 'We believe that Mexican sovereign debt should be regarded as virtually investment grade, even in terms of foreign currency obligations. We agree with S &amp; P that the policy process has encountered difficult tests in 1992 and has passed them with flying colours, exhibiting both flexibility and consistency. To the list of accomplishments mentioned by S &amp; P (fiscal policy and flexible exchange rate policy) we would add the renewed emphasis on education, the solidarity programme and agricultural reform among others,' says Mr Purcell. For both S &amp; P and Moody's, the sovereign debt rating provides an effective ceiling for the credit ratings for Mexican corporate borrowers, even though analysts argue that certain Mexican companies deserve better credit ratings in their own right. 'Some of the big Mexican companies would be as good as a double-A credit in the US if they weren't impeded by the country rating,' says one analyst. The key point is that if Mexico receives an investment grade rating, a much wider range of investors will be free to invest in Mexican debt. US insurance companies buy quite small amounts of Mexican debt at present, deterred by the fact that they must set aside capital because the debt is not investment grade: if that changes, they will be able to increase their exposure to high-yielding bonds significantly. While the international capital markets are set to see plenty more new bond issuance in 1993 and 1994, the volume of international equity issuance has slowed down when compared with the volumes seen in the early 1990s. This is largely a reflection of the absence of substantial privatisations during 1993 rather than a sign of poor investor appetite. If anything, Latin American equity specialists predict that demand for new international equity issues should remain fairly firm given the ever-growing number of emerging market funds and a perceptible shift of US investors into non-US markets. Mexican international equity offerings amounted to Dollars 3.103bn in 1992, boosted by a Dollars 1.243bn offering from Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications group, and large share offerings from Bancomer and Cemex. However, the deluge of new issues in 1992 came to a halt in the summer due to difficult market conditions and worries about too much supply. Some planned issues were put on hold and the calendar only really picked up again at the beginning of 1993. Total volume so far in 1993 - predominantly from private sector companies - amounted to Dollars 882.56m, according to IFR Securities Data, and included issues from Grupo Carso, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, Grupo Tribasa, Mexico's second largest construction company, Grupo Dina, Mexico's largest truck manufacturer, and Coca-Cola Femsa, the Mexican soft drinks bottler. Generally, Latin American analysts report that new equity issues have gone quite well, even though the stock market has been vulnerable to Nafta sentiment. If Nafta goes through, analysts expect to see a further Dollars 2bn of issuance unleashed over the next year. The variety of new issues has been accompanied by a noticeable improvement in reporting procedures and provision of information, analysts say, dictated partly by the US regulations governing the listing of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Many investors were justifiably peeved when Cemex launched an international equity offering in 1992 and promptly used the proceeds to make acquisitions in Spain. Investors who had bought the shares because they wanted a Mexican stock were annoyed to find they had bought exposure to the Spanish economy instead. It was not a happy chapter in investor relations: however, Mexican companies have probably learned from the episode, and analysts admit that Mexico today is probably among the best of the emerging markets in terms of disclosure.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ MEXICAN EUROBOND ISSUES 1992-1993*  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Issuers                                Issue amount    % of   No of                                      (US Dollars m)   total  issues  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mexico, The United Mexican States          1,580.78    15.8      10 Cemex SA                                   1,400.00    14.0       3 Bancomer SNC                                 750.00     7.5       1 Nacional Financiera, SNC (Nafinsa)           724.22     7.2       6 Grupo Financiero Banamex Accival, SA de      700.00     7.0       3 Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior SNC      475.16     4.7       3 Grupo Televisa, SA de CV                     400.00     4.0       3 Fomento Economico Mexicano de CV             300.00     3.0       1 Desc, Sociedad de Fomento Industrial SA      275.00     2.7       2 Volkswagen AG                                262.81     2.6       1 Empresas ICA                                 225.00     2.2       1 MCTTR Trips                                  207.50     2.1       1 Banca Cremi SA                               200.00     2.0       2 Hylsa SA de CVA de CV                        175.00     1.7       1 Consorcio G Grupo Dina SA                    150.00     1.5       1 Empresas la Moderna SA de CV                 150.00     1.5       1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ * Until October 12, 1993  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: IFR Securities Data  ------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------ MEXICAN EQUITY OFFERINGS 1992-1993*  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Issuers                                Issue amount    % of   No of                                      (US Dollars m)   total  issues  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Telefonos de Mexico, SA de CV           1,243.17    31.2       6 Bancomer SNC                                 638.00    16.0       2 Cemex SA                                     460.93    11.6       2 Empresas ICA                                 283.80     7.1       2 Grupo Carso                                  235.04     5.9       2 Grupo Trituradores Basalticos (Tribasa)      210.80     5.3       2 Consorcio G Grupo Dina SA                    173.15     4.3       3 Grupo Embotellador de Mexico SA de CV        138.80     3.5       2 Coca-Cola Co                                 134.50     3.4       2 El Puerto de Liverpool SA de CV              133.75     3.4       2 Sears Roebuck &amp;

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- With its dismissal of  26 district mayors, the government of Jozef Moravcik has started  large-scale purges reminiscent of the 1950's, chairman of the  opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan Slota told  journalists today.    The government dismissed the 26 mayors on Tuesday [19 April]  on charges of disloyalty and professional inadequacy. The  mayors had signed a statement condemning President Michal  Kovac's speech of March 19 in which he criticised the then  premier, Vladimir Meciar.    The SNS considers the government's approach to be a threat  to  democracy, and this was something especially serious in view of  the coming elections (September 30-October 1), Deputy Chairman  Eva Slavkovska said.    Slavkovska admitted that it was not usual for a state  official to criticise the head of state. However, she stressed,  "it is not usual either for the president to destablilise the  domestic situation in his own state." Kovac's speech is  generally considered to have provided the impulse for the  dismissal by parliament of Meciar and his government.    Slota forecast that after changes in the leadership of the  National Property Fund and the Supreme Control Office and the  dismissal of the mayors, there would follow purges in the  economic sphere above all, where the government parties would  want to influence privatisation and finance. These changes  would upset the Slovak economy further, he said. "I believe this  state has now actually collapsed and will only go on through  inertia," he added.    "We have a long way to go to democracy, even if our ears are  full of it," Slota said.</p>

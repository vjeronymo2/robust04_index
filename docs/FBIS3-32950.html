The  commission will be in charge of reinforcing and improving  bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries.  Gaviria and Fujimori also signed a joint statement to  strengthen the relations between the two countries, and  contribute to the peaceful solution of regional and  international problems. The two presidents advocated the  defense of participatory democracy in the hemisphere.    The last day of Fujimori's official visit began with a  meeting with Colombian businessmen at the Tequendama Hotel,  where Fujimori is lodged. The Peruvian ministers and delegates  that accompanied Fujimori also attended the meeting. The  meeting's main topic was Peru's reincorporation into the Andean  Pact and the problems caused by the differences in tariffs in  the two countries.    Although not anticipated in the official agenda, Gaviria and  his wife, Milena, invited Fujimori to walk through Ciudad  Bolivar, Santa Fe de Bogota's largest human settlement, to  observe up close the government's education and food programs.  The local residents welcomed the visitors with great  excitement. Stopping on his walk through the area, Gaviria  thanked Fujimori for reaffirming his support for Gaviria's  candidacy for the position of OAS secretary general.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] How did you  receive  President Fujimori's announced support for your candidacy for  OAS secretary general?    [Gaviria] I am grateful for this support for an aspiration  that has not yet crystallized. I thank President Fujimori and  the Peruvian people for this gesture of trust in me.    [Reporter] What does this meeting with the Colombian  president mean to you, Mr. Fujimori?    [Fujimori] It is very fruitful in terms of experience and  cooperation. As you can see for yourselves, the similarities  between the peoples of Colombia and Peru are interesting and  must be taken advantage of.    [Reporter] Will you invite the Colombian president to Peru  so  he can see the Peruvian people's struggles?    [Fujimori] I hope he will be able to visit Peru in the  remaining five or six months of his term. [end recording]</p>

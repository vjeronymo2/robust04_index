			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Leading Article: College for all A RECORD number of students will embark on higher education courses in the UK in a few weeks. About one in five 18-yearolds is about to set off to college or university, and the proportion is set to rise to one in three by the year 2000. Increasing access to higher education is a laudable goal, provided standards are safeguarded. It is not, however, in the best interests of the productive economy that so much of the current growth should be concentrated in the humanities and social sciences. The fault there lies in the schools, as evidenced by a continuing decline in maths and science at GCSE and A-level. Whatever form it takes, expansion raises two important policy issues as yet barely addressed by the government. What quality of higher education should students have a right to expect? And how is it to be financed? So far, the government has done little beyond setting targets for expansion and allowing polytechnics to call themselves universities. Targets without resources should impress no-one. As for nomenclature, if allowing a London polytechnic to call itself the University of Westminster silences the Oxbridge snobs, all well and good. But the acute overcrowding to be found in many of the former polytechnics will not be reduced by changing their letter heads. A number of fairly painless reforms could ease the burden. The government should accept the recommendations of the Pearce Report, and give higher education institutions greater freedom to borrow against their assets. It should also encourage universities to move towards semesters to increase their productivity, and be ruthless about concentrating research funding only on those institutions with strong research records. However, it also needs to contemplate several more painful reforms. First, if student maintenance is means-tested and, increasingly, provided in the form of loans rather than grants, why not students' tuition fees also? Most students benefit enormously in terms of earning power from their degrees: with public spending constrained, there is no reason in equity why those capable of doing so should not repay at least part of the cost of their courses. Second, the government should consider ending subsidies for students who wish to study away from home. There is a lot to be said for young people going away to college, but not much for the state paying large sums for them to do so. Perhaps student housing should only be built on a fully commercial basis. The government's job is to see that quality is maintained. The biggest contributions it can make to that are to keep class sizes small, and to ensure that academic pay is high enough to attract the ablest graduates into university teaching and research. At present it is failing to do either.</p>

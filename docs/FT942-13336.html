			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Recovery hopes dim in Tokyo: Retail sales fail to pick up as domestic car production hits new low The fragility of Japan's hopes for a consumer-led recovery was underlined yesterday by the latest set of weak indicators from the retailing and car industries. But the Bank of Japan is sticking to its prognosis, shared by many private-sector forecasters, that the worst is over in the nearly three-year economic downturn. The economy has hit bottom, but still has to go through a 'corrective period', Mr Toshihiko Fukui, an executive director of the central bank, said. Domestic car production fell 12 per cent in the year to the end of March, the steepest annual decline since 1947, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said. But the decrease seems to be slowing slightly, on the strength of a 9.4 per cent fall in output in March alone, compared with the same month last year. Department store sales showed a similar pattern, down 6 per cent in the year to the end of March; sales fell 4 per cent in March alone, the Japan Department Stores' Association said. Separately, supermarket sales dropped by 1.7 per cent in March and in the year to the end of last month, the Japan Chain Stores Association reported. The retail figures belie an increase in personal consumption in the second half of 1993, much of which went to discount stores, not counted in the official figures. Consumer sentiment improved in the three months to March, to show a 5.6 per cent improvement on the previous quarter, according to the government's Economic Planning Agency. Manufacturers of industrial machinery saw a glimmer in the economic gloom. The Japan Machinery Federation expects sales to fall 1.3 per cent in the year to next March, a far smaller decline than the 7 per cent recorded in each of the two previous years. The federation predicts a 1.1 per cent rise in second-half orders.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Holmes' alarms deal with Sears Roebuck HOLMES Protection, the US security company, has won a contract to install residential alarm systems under a licensing agreement with Sears Roebuck, the US retailer. The deal, worth Dollars 8m over three years, licenses Holmes to operate through Sears in New York and Long Island, and allow it to move into the mass security market for the first time. Mr Eric Kohn, the vice chairman of Holmes who put together a new management team last year at the debt-laden group, said it was still on course for a new share issue by the end of April. The issue would refinance Dollars 38m of debt left after a restructuring that had written off about half the Dollars 69m debt. Holmes supplies security systems to banks and businesses in and around New York and has a franchising operation in 48 locations throughout the US.</p>

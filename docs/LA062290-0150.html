			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> FLYING CANS SNARL TRAFFIC ON FREEWAY  </P> <P> About 3,000 empty soft-drink cans on their way to being recycled clattered onto  the eastbound Riverside Freeway in Fullerton on Thursday morning, snarling  traffic and creating a mess for Caltrans workers.  </P> <P> The truck driver carrying the load of aluminum cans told a California Highway  Patrol officer that he heard a noise, checked his rear-view mirror and saw "a  smoke screen of cans" flying behind his truck, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus  said.  </P> <P> A pin came loose from the door latch, sending his load of aluminum to the  asphalt, she said.  </P> <P> The cans temporarily halted traffic and kept two lanes of the freeway closed  from about 8:10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. while California Department of  Transportation workers swept the cans to the sides of the freeway. No injuries  or damages were reported, Burrus said.  </P></p>

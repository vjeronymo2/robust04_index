			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Radio power Sir, Henry Meakin says of ownership of radio stations (Letters, November 26): 'It should be the duty of the Radio Authority and the national heritage secretary to take urgent steps to eliminate such restrictive ownership anomalies.' The power to submit amendments to broadcasting legislation rests with the national heritage secretary. The authority has made representations to government and first submitted proposals to amend the ownership rules in January 1994. The problem appears to lie in finding parliamentary time for amendments to the law. Tracey Williams, The Radio Authority, 14 Great Queen Street, Holborn, London WC2B 5DG</p>

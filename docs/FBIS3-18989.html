			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Papoulias Makes Announcements on </F> Bosnia and Greek Trade Sanctions"; as released by Brussels  TEXTLINE database]    [Text] In his speech on Bosnia before the European  Parliament [EP], the President of the Council of the European  Union [EU], Mr. Papoulias, was able, for the first time in  months, to note a number of positive developments such as  progress in negotiations between Muslims and Croats, return to  calm in Sarajevo, and the prospect of reopening Tuzla airport.  The European Union will continue to play a "pioneer role" to  try to contribute to a global solution acceptable to all and  viable at long term, said Mr. Papoulias. He stressed that "each  of us must bring a stone to the building" and that Russian  participation in this process is indispensable. Furthermore,  the Council President announced that a group of experts would be  going to Mostar very shortly in order to examine the modalities  for temporary administration of the town by the European Union.    Mr. Papoulias also spoke of the dispute between Athens and  Skopje. As Greek Foreign Minister, he stated that the embargo  against the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [as received]  was necessary to allow Greece to "defend itself" against  aggression from Skopje authorities which, he said, have not done  anything to normalise the situation. Mr. Papoulias recalled  that, on 10 March, he is to have a talk in this connection with  UN mediator for Skopje, Cyrus Vance. He was reasonably  optimistic as to the possibility of settling the dispute. The  European Commission, recalled Hans van den Broek, has clearly  stated that the Greek sanctions, which are "virtually an  embargo," are in contradiction with Community law. He went on  to say that the Commission hopes the embargo will be lifted in  the near future and that there will be normalisation between  Athens and Skopje. Regarding the situation in Bosnia, he noted  the positive changes that have come about over the past weeks  and welcomed, in particular, the fact that humanitarian aid can  be resumed. We shall calculate new needs in close collaboration  with the UN High Commission for Refugees, he announced. Several  of the MEPs [members of EP] taking the floor reproached Greece  for its decision on the embargo against Skopje. Dutch Socialist  Mr. Woltjer said he hoped the embargo would be lifted and that  the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would, for its part,  modify its Constitution and its flag. Dutch Liberal Mr. Bertens  found this decision "incomprehensible." Mr. Bertens also hoped  that additional troops would be sent to UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] in order to extend the warning which worked in Sarajevo  and other areas in Bosnia. Italian Green Alexandre Langer said  the embargo against Skopje is "the least European, the least  cooperative" thing imaginable: In these circumstances, he  asked, what good is it to envisage a Pact on Stability in  Europe? Several Members of the EP voiced concern about the  aggressiveness of the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and  fears about the inviolability of the frontiers between this  country and Greece. Mr. Ephremidis (Left Unity) called Athens'  decisions "constructive" and capable of obtaining positive  results in the face of growing nationalism and Socialist Mr.  Papoutsis said the Greek people support its government's  decision and that, legally, Greece is acting within its rights  since it acted on the basis of Article 224, which has been used  by other countries on other occasions.</p>

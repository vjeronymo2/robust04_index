			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Ruding is favourite to take over at EBRD DR Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister, has emerged as the leading candidate to replace Mr Jacques Attali as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. However, French foreign minister Alain Juppe said yesterday that Paris wanted to keep the presidency of the bank French. 'I will undertake to recall that France has a sort of moral credit on this presidency,' he said. 'Since the choice was made that the EBRD should be based in London with a French person at its head, I think this choice should be respected, beyond the departure of Mr Attali,' he told RTL radio. The timing of any decision on who to appoint is uncertain, because the 56 governments and agencies which own the bank were caught off guard on Friday when Mr Attali announced his intention to resign as soon as a successor is found. 'There is a consensus that Mr Attali must be replaced quickly,' commented a bank director. 'Although he remains at the bank, it is impossible for him to do his job properly since everyone knows he is going.' But the director added that choosing a permanent successor should not be done in a rush. 'A number of us feel that someone should be appointed temporarily to the job, while decisions are taken on a permanent replacement and also on the structure of the bank's management.' Bank directors are touting three individuals as interim presidents: Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the Italian vice-president in charge of development banking, Mr Ron Freeman, the first vice-president in charge of merchant banking, and Mr Claes de Neergaard, Sweden's representative on the board of directors and chairman of the audit committee. Directors said that candidates to replace Mr Attali permanently were led by Dr Ruding, currently working for the US bank Citicorp, and also include Mr Henning Christopherson, the EC commissioner, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the French Treasury, and Mr Karl-Otto Pohl, former president of the German Bundesbank. 'Ruding is the only one who seems to command broad support among the G7 governments,' said an official from one of the G7 leading industrial countries. Ms Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister and chairman of the bank's governors, has said she will meet her vice chairmen as soon as possible to discuss how to replace Mr Attali. The bank's governors are expected to offer Mr Attali a year's salary - Pounds 149,000 after tax - for loss of office. The bank's directors today hold a board meeting, which is likely to approve the bank's first Bulgarian loan. The replacement of Mr Attali is not on the formal agenda. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

In each of the 3 years, after 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline (or quota) for whiting is taken, further at-sea processing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) would be prohibited, and the remaining 40 percent (104,000 metric tons (mt) in 1994) would be reserved initially for fishing vessels that deliver to shore-based processors. On or about August 15, any amount of the harvest guideline (including any part of the 40 percent initially held in reserve) that is determined by the Northwest Regional Director, NMFS, not to be needed by the shoreside sector during the remainder of the year would be made available to the at-sea processing sector. This action is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) by providing for equitable sharing of the harvest guideline between shore-based and at-sea processors; by contributing to the economies of coastal communities by providing reasonable opportunity for shoreside processing of the whiting harvest guideline; and by promoting stability in the west coast fishing industry by diverting effort from other fully-utilized fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are invited until March 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be mailed to J.

The FMP is implemented by regulations for U.S. fishermen at 50 CFR part 663. General regulations applicable to U.S. fishermen are at 50 CFR part 620. The FMP has been amended 6 times. Amendment 4 contains a framework process (the socio-economic framework) that provides the authority, guidelines, and criteria for establishing management measures that address social and economic conditions within the fishery. These measures can be implemented by regulation, without further amending the FMP, through the procedures contained in Amendment 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pacific whiting is the largest groundfish resource managed by the Council, and makes up over 50 percent of the potential annual groundfish harvest. Prior to 1980, this species was harvested primarily by foreign fishing vessels. Foreign directed fishing for whiting ended in 1989, when all the available whiting were allocated to U.S. fishermen, mostly for delivery of raw fish to foreign processing vessels under joint venture arrangements. By mid-1990 it was clear that over-capacity of the harvesting and processing sectors in the Alaska groundfish fisheries was causing shorter fishing seasons and that participants were looking for alternative resources, both inside and outside Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1991, the Council recommended, and the Secretary approved, a proposal to allocate the 228,000-mt 1991 Pacific whiting quota 104,000 mt to catcher/processors and 88,000 mt to fishing vessels that do not process (including vessels that delivered whiting both to shoreside plants and to motherships), with 36,000 mt reserved for priority access for the shoreside sector (56 FR 43718, September 4, 1991). The actual 1991 harvest was 117,000 mt by factory trawlers, 80,000 mt delivered to motherships, and 21,000 mt delivered to shoreside processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Pribytkov report under "Conflict" rubric: </F> "Talks Promise Peace in Abkhazia"]    [Text] Geneva -- After repeatedly approaching the danger  line and teetering on the verge of failure the second round of  talks in Geneva on a Georgian-Abkhazian settlement has ended  successfully. The intensive three-day discussions, which went on  virtually around the clock, resulted in decisions on the most  complex problems in the Abkhazian drama, such as the return of  the refugees, the strengthening of confidence and security, and  the use of peacekeeping forces. These decisions have been  included in the communique of the meeting, which was signed by  the heads of the delegations and the representatives of the  United Nations, Russia, and the CSCE.    The present round of talks in Geneva, like the previous one  (30 November-1 December), has been conducted under the aegis of  the United Nations with Russia's assistance. The Georgian  delegation was headed by Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the  Interim Committee for the State of Emergency and parliamentary  deputy, and the Abkhazian delegation by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya,  chairman of the Council of Ministers.    A lot of effort had to be exerted by the international  mediators -- Edouard Brunner, the UN secretary general's special  envoy, and Boris Pastukhov, Russian Federation deputy foreign  minister -- to make agreement possible.    One of the main results was the commitment, affirmed by the  sides in the communique, not to use force and not to resort to  the threat of force. The sides asked the UN Security Council to  extend the mandate of the UN observation mission in Georgia,  instructing it to monitor the nonresumption of hostilities.  They advocated locating in the conflict zone UN peacekeeping  forces or other forces sanctioned by the United Nations,  expressing mutual agreement to the use of a Russian military  contingent within them. The stationing of the "blue helmets"  must be followed by the withdrawal of all armed formations  within five days from the Inguri River and other possible zones  of confrontation -- their place will be taken by the  peacekeeping forces. The sundry volunteer formations and  individuals who have arrived to participate in the conflict must  be disarmed and withdrawn.    A commission for refugee problems is being formed with the  participation of representatives of the sides, the United  Nations, and Russia. It is planned to start the phased return  of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia as of 10 February  -- to Galskiy Rayon in the first phase. The most difficult  question involved in finding a settlement -- that of Abkhazia's  future political status -- will be discussed within the  framework of the previously formed group of experts, which will  meet for its next sitting 8 February in Moscow. On 22 February  the delegations and international mediators intend to conduct a  new round of talks in Moscow or Geneva.    As Sandro Kavsadze, member of the Georgian delegation and  chairman of the Georgian committee for human rights and  interethnic relations, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the  talks have made it possible "to move toward a settlement."  Although the discussion was of a "very sharp nature and there  were some fairly conflictual situations," "we reached agreement  and understanding on the main issues."    Having noted the great significance of the agreements,  Sokrat  Dzhindzholiya, head of the Abkhazian delegation, emphasized the  important role of the Russian Federation in the settlement.  "Thanks to the efforts of the Russian delegation and Russia as a  whole, many positive results were achieved," he said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS's correspondent. "Even in the past the  Russian Federation did all it could to bring our positions  closer together. Indeed, life itself evidently preordains it to  participate in the fate of the peoples which were brought  together by the Soviet Union."</p>

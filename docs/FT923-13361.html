			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Rabin asks Arab leaders for talks in Israel: Israeli premier says he is ready to visit Mideast capitals in search for peace MR YITZHAK RABIN, the new Israeli prime minister, yesterday said he was willing to fly to the capitals of neighbouring Arab states in the search for Middle East peace. He also invited their leaders to Jerusalem. His initiative was welcomed in Washington but treated sceptically in the Arab world. President George Bush said he had invited Mr Rabin to the US next month and would send Mr James Baker, secretary of state, to Israel and its neighbours next week to spur along the peace process. In his opening speech to the Israeli parliament, Mr Rabin said: 'In the service of peace, I am prepared to travel to Amman, Damascus and Beirut, today, tomorrow. For there is no greater victory than the victory of peace.' He invited a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation to Jerusalem for informal talks and suggested that King Hussein of Jordan and the presidents of Syria and Lebanon address Israel's parliament. But his invitations were in large measure rhetorical flourishes which are likely to be turned down by the Arabs. The Jordanian government last night dismissed the invitation to Jerusalem as 'just talk'. The Palestinians are wary of Mr Rabin, and Arab leaders will want to continue the peace talks on neutral ground, in Rome, within the next two months. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a leading member of the Palestinian negotiating team, said Mr Rabin's speech 'had important points and signals a willingness to deal with issues seriously'. But she added: 'We need concrete proof of the seriousness of their intent.' In contrast to the uncompromising attitude of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor, Mr Rabin called on Israelis to recognise that the world had undergone profound changes which presented opportunities for peace. 'We must overcome the sense of isolation that has held us in its thrall for almost half a century,' he said. 'We must join the international movement toward peace, reconciliation and co-operation that is spreading over the entire globe these days - lest we be the last to remain, all alone, in the station.' Mr Rabin, leader of the Labour party, which won last month's general election, was presenting to parliament his three-party coalition, which succeeds the two-year-old government led by Mr Shamir's Likud party. Labour has been joined in government by Meretz, an alliance of pro-peace groups, and Shas, an ultra-orthodox religious party, and is also supported by two Arab parties. The coalition won approval in parliament with a comfortable majority of 67-53. The new prime minister, resuming a post he last held in 1977, reiterated the coalition's commitment to accelerate the regional peace talks launched last October in Madrid. He urged the Palestinians to accept an interim period of self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, followed by talks on a final settlement. 'You will not get everything you want. Neither will we,' he said. 'Don't lose this opportunity that may never return. Take our proposal seriously - to avoid further suffering, humiliation and grief.' Jordan dismissive, Page 6</p>

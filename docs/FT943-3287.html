			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / IMF warned of 'ruin' over loans The International Monetary Fund could face ruin unless it starts to apply its normal credit conditions for loans to former east bloc communist countries, Swiss National Bank president Markus Lusser said yesterday. The ratio of debt to exports in the so-called transition countries was already higher than that in the developing nations, except for sub-Saharan African states, he said. The IMF must insist the transition countries quickly meet the normal conditions set for its loans, as further protracted waiving of its so-called 'conditionality' would be too risky. 'The currency reserves of IMF member countries would be endangered. Their credibility would suffer damage. The catalytic effect would be lost,' he said in remarks prepared for a Swiss Christian Democratic People's Party meeting in Zug. 'The transition would run the risk of ending in the financial and moral ruin of the IMF.' Mr Lusser said the IMF's financial aid, particularly to former communist countries, would increase massively in the next few years.</p>

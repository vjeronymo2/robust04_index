			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MR. T'S BROTHER SHOOTS ROBBER  </P> <P> An off-duty police officer, the brother and former bodyguard of television star  Mr. T, shot and wounded a man who tried to rob him at a South Side currency  exchange, authorities said.  </P> <P> The officer, Gustave J. Tero, a patrolman assigned to the Police Training  Academy, was waiting to cash his paycheck Tuesday when two men tried to rob  him, police said. Tero's brother, Lawrence (Mr. T) Tero, played a tough law  enforcer with a trademark shaved head in television's "The A Team."  </P> <P> Tero struggled with the two robbers and chased one of them into a nearby alley,  Cmdr. Toby Burton said. Tero struggled with the man again and shot him in the  legs, Burton said.  </P> <P> The second robber and a getaway driver fled and are still at large, Burton  said. The wounded man was hospitalized in fair condition. The police  department's Office of Professional Standards is investigating the shooting.  </P> <P> Gustave Tero had once served as a bodyguard for Lawrence but was fired after a  year. He sued his brother in 1984 to recoup $72,000 in damages and salary he  claimed he lost for taking a year off from the department.  </P></p>

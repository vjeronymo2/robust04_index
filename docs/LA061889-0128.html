			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE  </P> <P> Once again, when reporting the anti-abortionists' illegal blockade of medical  facilities ("82 Arrested Protesting Abortions," June 11), the focus was on the  blockaders and the police, and not on the patients whose rights were being  violated.  </P> <P> It doesn't matter if these patients were seeking abortions, prenatal care or  even a routine gynecological examination. All patients have a right to see  their physicians at their scheduled time. They have a right to privacy, free of  any harassment by self-appointed zealots who believe they know what is best for  everyone.  </P> <P> Under the cover of "religion," these anti-abortion activists are endangering  not only the lives and well-being of women, but also the rights of each one of  us. Today they don't approve of abortion; tomorrow, it may be voluntary  sterilization. Where does this harassment end? How many men would like the  world to know that they are visiting their urologist to have a vasectomy?  </P> <P> The "right to privacy" in the physician-patient relationship is cherished by  all Americans. It is time each of us speaks up for that right. If we don't, we  may all lose it.  </P> <P> ROBERT J. HASTERLIK, M.D.  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

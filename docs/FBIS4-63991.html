			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Three-day talks between the Ukrainian and Russian  government delegations in Moscow on division of the Black Sea  Fleet ended without result.    Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov told journalists that the sides  took "time out of 10-12 days" after which an agreement on the  first state of the Black Sea Fleet's division may be signed "on  the basis of almost prepared text of the document."    He noted that despite efforts of both delegations "which  worked for three days in two shifts," work has not been  completed because every "subject of the division required great  attention." Shmarov pointed out that the delegations of Russia  and Ukraine "were on the verge of the document's readiness,"  however "some technical details had to be specified."    In the opinion of a member of the Ukrainian delegation,  Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, the final document was  not signed at the talks "not at the fault" of Kiev. He believes  that the Ukrainian delegation "showed enough flexibility and  readiness for compromise." Tarasyuk said that the Ukrainian  side offered during the talks five various drafts agreement.    At the same time he believes that the Moscow talks allows to  speak about "burgeoning breakthrough," which "justifies the  delay with the signing of the document."    Tarasyuk hopes that within 10 days Ukraine and Russia will  manage at the level of experts to specify and coordinate  conditions of the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the  Russian Naval bases in Ukraine.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] While making an inspection tour in Zhengzhou's New  and Hi-Tech Development Zone this morning, Governor Ma Zhongchen  pointed out: Development zones should operate in accordance  with the requirements for establishing a new socialist market  economy system and with international practice.    Governor Ma Zhongchen; (Zhang Deguang), member of the  provincial party committee standing committee and secretary of  the Zhengzhou city party committee; and others inspected  development and construction in the Zhengzhou Development Zone,  including its commercial and trade, oil depot, financial, and  industrial districts.    Over the past five years, the Zhengzhou Development Zone has  developed its four major undertakings, including  microelectronics, biological pharmacy, [words indistinct], and  new building material industries. There are more than 200  enterprises in the zone, half of which are foreign-funded  enterprises. Last year, the zone's industrial production output  value reached more than 600 million yuan, and is expected to  increase to 1.5 billion yuan this year.    Governor Ma Zhongchen emphasized: The Zhengzhou Development  Zone's overall planning is rational, and its infrastructure is  complete. It has various kinds of economic sectors, and does  business in various ways. Its management mechanisms are  flexible, and its secondary and tertiary industries are  developing fairly effectively.    He added: The development zone is an inevitable result of  the development of productive forces, and an inexorable product  of the development of the socialist market economy at a certain  stage, and a new economic growing point as well. In the course  of moving our agricultural economy to industrialization and  urbanization, special zones can play a leading role.    He emphasized: We must show concern for and support  development zones. Under unified planning, we must vigorously  promote development zones. Not long ago, we had too many  development zones, and the situation was chaotic. This was  mainly due to a lack of experience and practice. We must not  waver in our determination to promote development zones in order  to improve the above-mentioned situation. In the future, in  places where conditions exist, development zones must continue  to be built. We must not give up eating for fear of choking.  In the meantime, we must prevent some places from arbitrarily  building development zones regardless of their own conditions.  The chaotic situation of building too many development zones  also must be avoided. The progress of development zones must be  put on the normal course. Governor Ma Zhongchen also inspected  the progress of an overpass project on Waihuan Road in  Zhengzhou. He asked the relevant responsible persons to convey  his regards to the cadres and workers who are working on the  project, and to their family members. He hoped that they would  construct the overpass well, with good quality and a high grade  of work guaranteed.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Council reform threat to landscape Reorganisation of local government may jeopardise the effective management of rights of way and areas of outstanding natural beauty, the Countryside Commission warned yesterday. The commission, which advises the government on the English landscape, told Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, that the move to unitary authorities could lead to a fragmentation of specialist countryside teams. 'Where counties are split up, we shall hope to see robust arrangements put into place for joint work on strategic planning and countryside management,' the commission said. It has set a target for local authorities to ensure that all 120,000 miles of public rights of way in England are open and clearly marked by the year 2000.</p>

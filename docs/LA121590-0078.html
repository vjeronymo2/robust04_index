			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: SCHOEFFLING CARVES OUT A NICHE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE SET  </P> <P> Michael Schoeffling, co-starring in "Mermaids" as a mysterious convent  caretaker who captures Winona Ryder's teen-age fancy, may never have to stand  in the unemployment line. Between such film assignments as "Sixteen Candles,"  "Belizaire the Cajun" and "Longtime Companion," the 30-year-old actor has a  successful furniture-making business at his home near Wilkes-Barre, Pa.  </P> <P> "Actors spend most of their time out of work, so I actually spend more time  making furniture," he says. "The thing about furniture that's much better than  acting is that it's just me. There's no director, no script -- the concept is  me, unless a client wants something. In film work you do the best you can under  the given circumstances, but you don't have control. At least, I don't."  </P> <P> Not that Schoeffling particularly aspires to attaining the kind of stardom that  commands on-set omnipotence. He prefers living with his wife and two young  children in his native state because there he "can afford to live like a king,  and there's a change of seasons. You do miss stuff (not being in Los Angeles),  but it's worth it. How much money do you need? How many parts do you need?"  </P> <P> Schoeffling's own acting needs surfaced after he left college after a year on  the wrestling team, and spent the following two years exploring Europe and  North Africa, working as a cook. Upon his return, he moved to New York, where  he met an agent through his actor-roommates and landed a role in "Racing With  the Moon." Cut from the film, his official screen debut came opposite Molly  Ringwald in "Sixteen Candles."  </P> <P> Next up for Schoeffling is the spring release of the drama "Wild Hearts Can't  Be Broken," in which he plays Cliff Robertson's rebellious son.  </P> <P> Has he any other plans?  </P> <P> "Yeah, I have a bunch of chairs I gotta go finish."

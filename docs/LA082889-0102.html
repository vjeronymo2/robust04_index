			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JIM BAKKER 'LOVED THINGS AND USED PEOPLE,' JURORS TOLD AS TRIAL OPENS  </P> <P> A federal prosecutor today outlined the government's fraud and conspiracy case  against PTL founder Jim Bakker, saying the evangelist became a man "who loved  things and used people."  </P> <P> Prosecutor Jerry Miller, in his opening remarks to the jury, said, "This case  is about cheating people, about taking their money, about tricking people out  of their money by misrepresenting a Christian theme park."  </P> <P> Bakker, 49, could face 120 years in prison if convicted on 24 fraud and  conspiracy counts stemming from the way he raised and spent money at PTL. The  central issue is the sale of "lifetime partnerships," which promised three  nights' free lodging each year for life to anyone who gave PTL $1,000.  </P> <P> Defense lawyer George T. Davis called Bakker a creative, religious genius and  said there is no evidence that he sold anything or had any criminal intent to  defraud people.  </P> <P> "We will prove that there was not a sale of one single membership or lifetime  partnership," Davis said. "What happened was gifts or donations. This was a  church. This was an outreach program."  </P></p>

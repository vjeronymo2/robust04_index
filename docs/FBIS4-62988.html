			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry has halted preparations  for exercises at Totskoye training ground. New talks will be  held in June with the Pentagon on the peacekeeping forces' joint  exercises. The Defense Ministry informed the Russian State  Duma's defense committee of this. It is particularly noted that  President Yeltsin agrees with the Duma's position on the need to  cancel these exercises.</p>

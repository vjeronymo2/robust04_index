			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Jacuzzi bid talk boosts Eljer stock NEWS that Jacuzzi, the whirlpool bathmaker owned by Britain's Hanson group, might bid Dollars 20 a share for Eljer Industries sent the potential target group's stock soaring by Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 21 7/8 yesterday. An offer at this price would value the Texas-based manufacturer of plumbing, heating, and ventilation products at about Dollars 145m (Pounds 86m). Yesterday, Mr Roy Jacuzzi, president of the California-based company, said that Eljer would form an 'ideal add-on' business for Jacuzzi. Eljer's products include toilets, sinks, bathtubs and shower stalls sold under the Glas Tec, Eljer, Aqualine, Valley and Cambrian brand names. The initial response from Eljer to the Hanson subsidiary's proposal was less than enthusiastic. Describing Jacuzzi's approach as 'unsolicited', it said that the matter would be discussed at the next scheduled board meeting on June 18. Eljer's net profits fell from Dollars 7.27m to Dollars 2.48m in 1990. Sales were Dollars 449.2m. Hanson is thought to have a stake of less than 5 per cent.</p>

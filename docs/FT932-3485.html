			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Observer: Oversight Much tut-tutting is abuzz behind the BBC World Service microphones at the absence of former boss John Tusa's name from the Queen's Birthday honours list. Having been denied a chance of even competing for the job of BBC director-general, Tusa has now failed to get the customary recognition for a job well done. Former Bush House occupants, such as Gerard Mansell and Austen Kark, picked up CBEs, and some thought that Tusa might even have been in line for his K. During his six-year stint, the World Service won praise from listeners ranging from President Gorbachev to the Beirut hostages. Admittedly, BBC-types have not been collecting quite so many honours under the new regime at Number 10. But Tusa has gone on to be master of a Cambridge College, and in his 32 years at the Beeb has probably done as much for public service broadcasting as the likes of recently knighted Michael Checkland, David Frost, and Robin Day. Could it be that BBC chairman Duke Hussey, whose wife is the Queen's lady-in-waiting, somehow forgot to mention Tusa in dispatches?</p>

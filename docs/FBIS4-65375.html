			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will submit  his report to the Security Council by the end of the week to  give Turkey a chance to clarify some points raised in the Vienna  talks last week. The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  correspondent reported from New York that the extension given to  the Turkish side expires tomorrow [17 May], when pseudo Prime  Minister Haki Atun returns to the occupied areas from Ankara.  Turkey is expected to clarify some points of the 21 March UN  document, which, according to the Turkish side, has been  modified.    U.S. officials said the Turkish explanations constitute no  dramatic development or new proposals. Asked whether the Greek  side will accept them, the same officials said they do not  intend to suggest something that will not bear fruit.  Discussing access to Famagusta, the U.S. officials said there  will be no Turkish troops or armed Turkish Cypriots near the  road linking the free areas with the fenced-off area.    A UN official denied reports that the procedure will be  suspended for two months, stressing that a negative report will  be issued if there is a negative Turkish reply. Referring to  the adoption of alternative ways to implement the UN  resolutions, a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent  reported that there is a shift in views at the UN Security  Council, something that may delay a decision until 15 June, when  UNFICYP's [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate is expected to be  renewed.</p>

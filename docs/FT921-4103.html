			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bush effort to break impasse with EC THE US yesterday presented the European Community with a new offer to break the farm subsidy impasse in the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. But after Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, handed him a letter from President George Bush, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said: 'We are still not on the same terrain'. The offer apparently allows the EC more scope to go ahead with proposed financial compensation to European farmers for cutting food output. Mr Baker quipped about the 'extraordinarily generous offer', but Mr Delors said the US scheme still did not meet EC complaints about the cuts in internal price support and export volume contained in the negotiating paper of Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt secretary-general. This seeks a 36 per cent reduction in price support, while the EC has offered 30 per cent and wants no quantitative curbs on farm export volume. US and EC officials meet today on the proposals.

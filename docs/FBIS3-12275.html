Rashid told MENA that the Palestinian delegation will call  on  the Arab League to take a unified stance in the face of repeated  acts of aggression by the Israeli settlers and Army. The  Palestinians will also urge international protection of the  Palestinian people for security and stability to prevail and as  a necessary condition for pursuing efforts to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace, Rashid said.    Rashid said that the Palestinians will also call for the  presence of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories  to be reconsidered. He added that there is a need to remove  these settlements because of the threat they pose to the peace  process.    Answering a question about the massacre's effect on the  peace  talks between the Palestinians and Israel, which have already  made significant progress, the Palestinian official said that  such attacks certainly affect the peace process and demonstrate  Israel's lack of credibility.</p>

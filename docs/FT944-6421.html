			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (19): Aiming for impulse purchases - Parragon Book Services Avonmouth is not Bloomsbury, and Parragon Book Services, with its premises next to an M5 motorway junction, may not be as familiar a name as Thames &amp; Hudson or Macmillan. But last year, it sold 12m books and this year expects to reach sales of 20m. PBS was set up only six years ago by Mr Guy Parr and Mr Paul Anderson, both of whom had worked for WH Smith. Their philosophy is simple: to sell books at such low prices that they will be bought as impulse purchases in large quantities at supermarkets, motorway service stations, newsagents and bargain bookshops. The company now employs more than 80 people. Pre-tax profits dipped in 1993 to Pounds 404,000 but Mr Anderson says: 'We have tightened up the running of the business.' He expects profits of more than Pounds 1m this year on turnover of about Pounds 20m. The company, which contracts out its printing, supplies books to Asda, Co-operative Retail Society, Presto, Safeway and Tesco supermarkets. 'By doing large print runs, we can get the cost-price down,' says Mr Anderson. 'We are very much a sales-driven company.' One element of this is computerised stock control - 'We had our own software written for us from day one.' This year, it set up a publishing division to produce its own titles, with 3i, the venture capital group, investing Pounds 1m to take a 10 per cent equity stake. Mr Anderson says the company has no immediate intention of seeking a stockmarket flotation, 'but we keep open our options for the future.' Its publishing division will specialise in cookery, gardening, art and children's books. The most recent titles are a series called 'Quote Unquote', featuring Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Laurel and Hardy. And it has published a series called 'life and works' of famous artists, selling at just Pounds 1.99 a copy.</p>

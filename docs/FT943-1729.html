			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western Mining joins Cuban nickel venture Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group, announced yesterday that it had reached agreement in principle with Cuba's state-owned Commercial Caribbean Nickel company, to assess and possibly develop the Pinares de Mayari West nickel deposit. The deposit lies in the Holguin province. WMC said that preliminary data on the near-surface deposit provided by CCN suggested 'a significant nickel laterite resource estimated to contain in excess of 200m tonnes of ore, at a grade of greater than 1 per cent contained nickel and 0.1 per cent contained cobalt'. WMC will be able to earn a 65 per cent interest in the joint venture, by funding a drilling programme, metallurgical test work, and a feasibility study, with CCN holding the remaining 35 per cent. The drilling programme could start in a matter of months. Several Canadian mining companies - including Sherritt, the nickel and cobalt producer - have unveiled plans or joint ventures in Cuba recently, and others are believed to be seeking a foothold there. US companies are barred by the longstanding trade embargo. Cuba is relatively rich in resources and some estimates suggest that it may house over one-tenth of the world's known nickel resources. WMC has major nickel operations in Western Australia.</p>

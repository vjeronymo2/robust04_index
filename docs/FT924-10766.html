			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (10): Who's who in Hungary Tamas Szabo, privatisation minister: in Mr Szabo, western investment bankers have the 'heavy hitter' that some think the great sell-off needs. Aware that public support is crucial to success, he has brought a political touch to privatisation. Mr Szabo is of that rare breed of Hungarian politician who tries to clear a day a week to visit his constituency. Andras Simor, head of CA Securities, the Hungarian brokerage and investment banking subsidiary of Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank: Mr Simor has helped carve out for CA a large share of the small to medium-sized deals which the larger international advisers disdain but which have proved easiest conclude. Sandor Rudnay, partner at Price Waterhouse in Budapest: one of the most respected auditors in the business. Several of his clients decided to follow him from KPMG to PW when he defected recently. Rudnay is a name which crops up frequently in Hungarian business life. Sandor's brother Janos, who also left Hungary with the family in 1956 and has now returned, is one of the most influential western executives, heading Philips's Hungarian operations and the new multinational lobbying association. Andras Kereszty, editor-in-chief of Nepszabadsag: Mr Kereszty has managed the formidable task of taking the much-hated former communist party newspaper and turning it into Hungary's most respected daily. The masthead remains the same - the name means 'people-freedom' - but the coverage has become increasingly objective. Gabor Varszegi, entrepreneur: Mr Varszegi has built up the Fotex retailing group into Hungary's largest homegrown private company. In the process he has acquired a reputation for shrewdness and ruthlessness. He was a rock star until the early 1980s and then spent a few years in the diamond trade in New York. George Lang, restauranteur: Mr Lang is the man who has brought power-lunching to Budapest. Creator of the Four Seasons and Cafe des Artistes in New York, he has brought his skills and money back to his birthplace of Hungary to revamp the country's most famous restaurant, the Gundel. George Lang and his partner, Ronald Lauder of the cosmetics dynasty, paid Dollars 8m and invested at least that much again in the Gundel to bring it back to its pre-war standards. That is more than most Hungarian industrial plants are worth. Les Nemethy, deputy managing director in charge of transactions of the State Property Agency, the privatisation authority: 'Made in Hungary, born in Canada,' Mr Nemethy likes to say of himself. His parents left during the 1956 revolution and he was born soon afterwards. After a career in mergers and acquisitions in Canada, he is now back to the place of his conception. Mr Nemethy has already brought some western efficiency to the SPA and investment bankers almost universally welcome his presence. 'He speaks the same language,' says one. Lajos Bokros, managing director of Budapest Bank: Mr Bokros has proved surprisingly effective as managing director, pursuing a tough write-off policy, bringing in new management and preparing the large state bank for privatisation. Mr Bokros, an economist by training, rose to head the National Bank of Hungary's capital markets department. But, in the great Hungarian tradition of second jobs, he also freelanced as president of the Budapest Stock Exchange (which he remains), a member of the State Property Agency board as well as an occasional lecturer. Miklos Nemeth, vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: No one in eastern Europe can have had a better transition than Mr Nemeth, Hungary's last communist prime minister. After a decent interval, Mr Nemeth, whose government attracts more nostalgia as the economic recession drags on, could quite plausibly re-enter Hungarian politics. Peter Magyar, partner at Baker &amp; McKenzie, the longest-established western law firm, crops up in so many deals that people joke that he is the only lawyer in Budapest. George Soros, Hungarian-American fund manager, has given approaching Dollars 100m out of his immense personal fortune to eastern Europe and large bit of that to Hungary through the Soros Foundation. Not all Hungarians are grateful, however. Government MPs have mounted increasingly vitriolic attacks on Mr Soros, who is Jewish and is perceived to support opposition liberals. Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the agriculture ministry: is a rare example of a professional civil servant. His responsibilities for Hungary's agricultural sector also give him a big say in privatisation, which has been especially concentrated in the food industry. Mr Rasko, a refreshingly frank man, admits that he is in a difficult position, buffetted on the one side by foreign investors with strong bargaining positions and on the other by government MPs who are increasingly demanding domestic participation in privatisation. George Varga, chief executive at GE-Tungsram, General Electric's Hungarian subsidiary. Mr Varga, doyen of the western multinationals who took over in 1990 as chief executive, has radically restructured the company and lobbied fruitlessly against the Hungarian government's strong currency policy. Gyorgy Jaksity, director of Lupis Brokerhaz, one of Hungary's largest independent broker. The 25-year-old Mr Jaksity does not think his age matters to clients. 'Financial analysis in Hungary dates back to 1990; no one has any more experience than two years,' he says. Mr Jaksity is also a novelist. His first published work about Socrates reborn in eastern Europe was a failure, however. For the time being he is sticking to the financial world, where he is rather more successful. Marc Holtzman, a director of EurAmerica Capital Corporation, an investment bank supported by the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund: Mr Holtzman has proved that networking recognises no boundaries. When he organised a Budapest charity dinner for Romanian orphans he brought out the whole post-communist establishment: multinational executives, local entrepreneurs politicians from the president down, cardinals and ambassadors.</p>

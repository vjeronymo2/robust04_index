			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finishes steady ahead of corporate news Wall Street US blue chips were looking a shade firmer by the close in New York as the market marked time ahead of a slew of corporate results due today, writes Richard Waters in New York. Following its 25-point climb on Friday to a record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator initially receded on profit-taking, before inching ahead to 3,870.29, up 3.09 on the day. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was still down 1.61 at the close at 473.30. The Nasdaq composite lost 0.13 at 792.18. Largely as a result of the Martin Luther King holiday in the US yesterday, which closed banks and government offices, trading volume on the New York SE was moderate, totalling 234m shares. The holiday closed the government bond market and in the process robbed the stock market of one potential driving force behind share prices. The Treasury bond market had ended the previous week in nervous mood, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond at 6.3 per cent. Shares in property/casualty insurers suffered as investors expressed fears about potential losses from the earthquake which hit southern California before dawn yesterday. Allstate, reckoned to be one of the biggest insurers in California, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 3/8 before recovering slightly to Dollars 28 5/8 . Gryphon, an insurer which specialises in earthquake insurance, lost Dollars 1 at one stage to trade at Dollars 12 7/8 before rallying to Dollars 13 3/8 . Elsewhere, with little specific company news to focus on, the market continued to position itself for the onset of the reporting season, with a clutch of the largest banks due today, as well as Chrysler. First Chicago chose to bring forward the announcement of its results to yesterday to avoid the rush and in the process confirmed the bullish tone for banks set last week by JP Morgan and Citicorp. Its earnings per share for the fourth quarter were well ahead of market expectations, helping to push its shares up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/4 , though they later fell back to Dollars 42 3/8 . After the run-up in its shares at the end of last week, Citicorp receded Dollars 1 to Dollars 41 1/8 , though it remains close to its 12-month high. Canada Toronto stocks climbed to a fourth consecutive record close, with the TSE 300 index ending 1.2 per cent higher and moderately below the session's peak. The index was finally 55.1 ahead at 4,544.2 after hitting 4,555.8. The run-up was fuelled by sharp gains in golds, financial services, base metals, consumer products, conglomerates and paper and forestry stocks. Volume was heavy at 71.7m shares valued at CDollars 931.1m.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / People: Howland-Jackson quits Nomura John Howland-Jackson is quitting as president of Nomura International, the UK subsidiary of Japan's biggest securities firm, to become a senior managing director of NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank. He will have responsibility for all NatWest's investment banking activities, which till recently were known as County NatWest. These operations employ 2,400 people. Martin Owen, NatWest Markets' chief executive, says he has been searching for someone to fill the role since he took over at NatWest Markets and began to reorganise the business six months ago. Howland-Jackson, 43, has considerable experience of the Japanese securities markets, having spent four years in Tokyo in the mid-1970s as Kleinwort Benson's chief representative there. He has also worked for Morgan Guaranty and Chemical Bank. Paradoxically, NatWest gave up its seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange just before Christmas. However, Owen points out that NatWest markets will continue to employ 350 staff in Japan, in areas such as fund management. The recent reorganisation of NatWest Markets has involved the renaming of its stockbroking business from County NatWest to NatWest Securities. However, the 'County' name has been retained for the corporate advisory department.</p>

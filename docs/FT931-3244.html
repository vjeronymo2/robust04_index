			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mr Sim blasts his way into the US market - Kieran Cooke charts the eventual success of a man whose dream machine was a flop THEY call him the Bill Gates of Singapore. Mr Sim Wong Hoo started a company called Creative Technology just over 10 years ago. Computer skills, bright ideas and a lot of persistence have made Creative one of the stars of the computer scene, not just in Singapore but also in the US. In August, Creative was listed on the Nasdaq over-the-counter exchange in the US. While not in the same league as Mr Gates's Microsoft, Mr Sim's company has taken one segment of the computer market by storm. Creative's shares, offered at USDollars 12, shot up to nearly Dollars 40 at one stage and now trade in the upper Dollars 20s range - valuing Creative at Dollars 1.2bn. In the second half of 1992, Creative reported net income of Dollars 32.6m on revenues of Dollars 129.7m - up from Dollars 9.1m and Dollars 33.3m respectively in the corresponding period in 1991. Creative's main product is Sound Blaster, a hardware-software package which enables computers to play music, mimic a wide range of sounds, and synthesise the human voice. First marketed in the US in late 1989, nearly 3m Sound Blasters have now been sold. Creative is run from the seventh floor of an industrial estate block in Singapore. A local workforce of 550 puts together more than 200,000 pieces of computer equipment each month. Mr Sim, at 37, is a local hero. Singapore is well-known for its technocrats and its managers, but entrepreneurs like Mr Sim are thin on the ground in what is a tightly-regulated and controlled business environment. 'There were times when no one wanted to know us. Getting venture capital was impossible,' he says. All that has changed. A Singapore state company has a 6.5 per cent share in Creative. Mr Sim and two friends who founded the company control 70 per cent. Mr Sim studied electronics but has no formal computer training. After military service in Singapore, he worked as as assistant electronics engineer for a local oil company and found he enjoyed computer programming and design work. 'By the early 1980s I'd decided to set up my own business. I knew I was good at creating things but didn't really have any focus. I was also very shy, and business did not appeal to me.' An early foray into computer teaching turned sour when a partner ran off with the money. In 1981, Creative Technology was founded, mainly to carry out various software contracts in Singapore. 'We put an ad in a local newspaper 'We are very hungry - so call us.' Our initial capital was only SDollars 10,000 (USDollars 6,000).' Design work continued. By 1984, Creative had gathered enough expertise to design what was Singapore's first home-grown computer. Mr Sim insists he did not clone products. 'We wanted to make an original. Ours was the first computer which was able to 'talk' in Chinese.' But it was not a success. Sales barely covered costs. Creative had no money for marketing. The same thing happened to what Mr Sim calls the 'dream machine' - another computer launched in 1986 which had both Chinese and English voices, plus graphics and a sound board. 'We thought the dream machine would sell like hot cakes. It didn't. It was ahead of its time. It had so many features that it took two hours just to do the sales pitch. People would ask us, 'why does your computer talk? or why does it have Chinese?' China might have been interested but then it had no money to buy such products. Locally we had very little support. So we had to start again.' Mr Sim and his colleagues made some radical decisions. 'We threw away the voice and languages. Music is universal. We started selling computer sound boards - music for the masses. We found we could earn the same margin on a sound board as on a complete PC.' With sounds for computer games, the Game Blaster became a popular product. In 1988, Mr Sim left for the US. 'That's where the computer market is. I told my family that if I did not sell 20,000 sound boards in the US I would not come back.' Penetrating the distribution system in the US is crucial. 'I would beg distributors to give me their time. I kept knocking on doors. I was willing to add in all sorts of features or modify the sound boards for them.' Persistence paid off. At a computer exhibition in Las Vegas in late 1989, Creative was taking a trade order every three minutes. A year later, it was exporting 10,000 sound boards per month from Singapore. Creative has several rivals, some of which, according to Mr Sim, have cloned Creative's products. Similar operations have started in Singapore. But Creative says it now has 60 per cent of a market which is growing by more than 30 per cent per year. Creative has introduced other products, some of which it it trying to persuade PC manufacturers to incorporate into their machines, rather than selling them as accessories. Creative has moved into multi-media computers, which combine pictures, text and high-quality sound. Creative now sells a multi-media package manufactured in conjunction with Matsushita of Japan which incorporates a Sound Blaster, a compact disc player adapted for the computer and software disks. There is also a Video Blaster which allows a user to watch television on a computer. Many of these products date back to Mr Sim's 1986 dream machine. That computer's functions, particularly its Chinese/English abilities, are now being resurrected with an eye to the fast-growing China market. Late last year, Creative formed a joint venture with a Beijing company. Creative's Chinese software is already being used in schools in Singapore. Mr Sim has also moved closer to Mr Gates. Creative is now developing, along with Microsoft, various digital video software.</p>

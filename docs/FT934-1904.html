			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Shoprite to expand after 88% jump Shoprite, the discount food retailer, yesterday unveiled an ambitious expansion plan following an 88 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the year to October 31. The company said that profits of Pounds 5.08m (Pounds 2.7m) would enable it to open at least 50 new stores over the next 12 months, almost doubling its size. The group, based in the Isle of Man, said improved turnover of Pounds 164m (Pounds 87.5m) showed demand was rising for its discount outlets in Scotland, where it already has 66 stores. Mr Deryck Nicholson, chairman and joint managing director, said: 'We believe our trading format is capable of sustaining at least 200 stores in Scotland by 1996 with the potential for a similar number in northern England.' He said the expansion would be financed from the group's own resources and borrowing. Disposals and leaseback transactions helped raise Pounds 5.6m, which, after the acquisition of 30 new stores, left the group with Pounds 1.8m cash in hand compared with Pounds 288,000 last time. Gearing, currently 51 per cent, is expected to exceed 60 per cent next year. Mr Nicholson, whose father Ken was a co-founder of the Kwik Save discount chain, said the balance sheet had been strengthened by a Pounds 9.7m rights issue in January and the expansion would not require another placement. The improved performance last year mainly reflected double-figure percentage growth at the 33 stores operating in Scotland for the whole 12 months. On the Isle of Man, however, the retail, property and vehicle retailing interests proved less buoyant. Discount supermarkets on the island were performing only satisfactorily, while trading conditions for its Mercedes-Benz dealership remained 'extremely difficult'. Earnings per share jumped from 3.77p to 5.64p. The proposed final divided is increased to 1.6p, making a total for the year of 2.2p (1.5p adjusted). The shares rose 8p to close at 178p.</p>

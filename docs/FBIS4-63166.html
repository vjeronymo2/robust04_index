			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Russian Press Keen on Latest Changes in Government" -- </F> ITAR- TASS headline]    [Text] Moscow May 20 ITAR-TASS -- "The premier strengthens  positions," IZVESTIYA daily concludes its analysis of the latest  changes in the government.    Many national newspapers have been closely watching these  changes for days. "Observers have no doubt that Chernomyrdin's  position is now so firm that the president cannot afford any new  appointments to the government without his consent," IZVESTIYA  elaborates. As an example, the newspaper mentions the  appointment of the Democratic Party leader, Nikolay Travkin, to  the cabinet in order to strengthen contacts with the State Duma.    "Shakhray's release from the post of the nationalities  minister should hardly be construed to mean the weakening of the  premier's positions. Inter-ethnic problems have traditionally  been a prerogative of the president's staff, while the prime  minister has been on the sidelines. Moreover, Shakhray's  achievements were not over impressive for a struggle to ensue  between the president and the premier around this figure," the  newspaper muses.    The newspaper calls "symptomatic" changes at the level of  second persons in the ministries. On Chernomyrdin's initiative,  the decisions on dismissing the deputy ministers of economics  and finance, drafted by the government staff, have been shelved.  On the contrary, economist Yakov Urinson, a former Gosplan  (State Planning Committee) staffer known in the  liberal-democratic circles as one of the first and few old-style  staffers to actively support market reform ideas, has been given  a status equal to that of minister by Chernomyrdin's decision.  Sergey Aleksashenko, who has fortunately been rescued from the  sacking, is "a young financier known as a first-class specialist  with liberal views on the economy".    The newspaper cites analysts who believe that the  equilibrium  in the government can be seriously tipped if Soskovets,  Zaveryukha and co. prove to be stronger. "In this situation,  the premier has to support the camp of pro-market liberals in  his cabinet in order to safeguard the economy and his own  political future".    "The role of the prime minister has enhanced sharply in  recent month," according to VEK, a newspaper of the business  community.    "The fragile centrist balance, which took shape after Viktor  Chernomyrdin came to head the cabinet of ministers is being  artificially broken down. It is possible that we will soon see  another series of incomprehensible resignations and  appointments, leading to the emergence of an absolutely new  ruling elite structure," the newspaper warns.    VEK surmises that "a question has been raised about creating  a coalition government with the participation of the main  opposition forces, which agreed to sign the national  conciliation pact". It points to the appointment of Travkin as  cabinet member and the premier's meeting with Zhirinovskiy,  reportedly to discuss the possible bringing of an LDPR man into  the government.    The press, particularly the CIS publishing organ "THE  BUSINESS WORLD", highlight the presidential press secretary's  assertion that there is no crisis of confidence in relations  between the president and the prime minister. "Political  concord is in evidence. But in the course of their recent  meeting, the president voiced a number of tough remarks about  the cabinet relating to the shortfalls in conducting economic  reform."</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWZAT? IT'S CRICKET;  </P> <P> POPULAR FROM KARACHI TO KINGSTON, THE SPORT IS ALSO ALIVE AND WELL IN THE  SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> "Howzat?" cries the bowler, flinging his arms up in appeal as he spins around  to face the man in the long white coat standing behind him.  </P> <P> The umpire pauses for a second or two, then lifts his right hand, the index  finger extended. The verdict has been given: "Out."  </P> <P> Twenty-two yards away, the batsman turns disconsolately from the wicket and  walks off the pitch. His innings is over. He is out, leg-before-wicket, for a  duck.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Batsman at the Crease  </P> <P> A new batsman comes to the crease, surveys the field and takes his stance. The  wicket-keeper and the half-circle of slips inch forward in anticipation as the  bowler returns to begin a new run-up.  </P> <P> Gobbledygook?  </P> <P> No, just cricket, a game that was already 500 years old when somebody with the  unlikely name of Abner (or was it Alexander?) tinkered with the established  English game of rounders and called his "invention" baseball.  </P> <P> Today, the "new" game's fans flock to Chavez Ravine and Anaheim Stadium, but on  any given weekend during spring, summer and early fall, there are cricket  matches being played from Santa Barbara to San Diego and from Los Angeles to  Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The sport is alive and well hereabouts. In fact, Jean Wong, president of the  Southern California Cricket Assn., says there are 26 teams playing in regular  league competition during the March-to-October season. More than 500 cricketers  from around the world are involved in the game locally.  </P> <P> And all because of one man.  </P> <P> Somewhere in Coldwater Canyon there is -- or at least there used to be, it's  difficult to tell with such things -- a house with a rather unusual name.  </P> <P> The Round Corner, as it was called, had a couple of other odd characteristics.  Its weather vane, for instance, consisted of a bat and ball, while elsewhere  atop the roof were three cricket stumps.  </P> <P> Those who visited the house regularly -- men such as Errol Flynn and Boris  Karloff, Nigel Bruce and Basil Rathbone, P. G. Wodehouse and David Niven --  knew what the rooftop eccentricities meant. They too were cricketers, though  they had never reached the starry heights of the home's owner, C. Aubrey Smith,  one-time captain of England and leader of Marylebone Cricket Club tours to  Australia in 1887-88 and to South Africa in 1888-89.  </P> <P> Sir Charles, knighted in 1944 for his work in improving Anglo-American  relations, was one of those empire builders who carried the grand game to the  colonies so that today the sound of willow bat striking leather ball is  instantly recognizable from Karachi to Kingston and from Cape Town to  Christchurch.  </P> <P> A gifted athlete as well as actor, he managed to enjoy both careers to the  fullest. Although he was a talented soccer player, it was cricket that was his  true passion.  </P> <P> Benny Green in his admirable "A History of Cricket" (David &amp; Charles, c/o  Sterling Publishing, 2 Park Ave., New York 10016; $35), describes Smith as: "A  bowler with a delivery so eccentric that all England knew him as  'Round-the-Corner' Smith." Proud of the nickname, Smith later used it in naming  his Hollywood Hills mansion, the one in Coldwater Canyon.  </P> <P> It was his acting, however, that brought him to Los Angeles in 1930. By then,  he was 68 and a household name among London theatergoers. In Hollywood, his  oh-so-proper accent and his silver hair and mustache quickly earned him parts  as the quintessential English gentleman in a string of movies such as "The Four  Feathers," "Rebecca," "Lives of a Bengal Lancer" and "The Prisoner of Zenda."  </P> <P> Between pictures, he founded the Hollywood Cricket Club, stocking its ranks  with other expatriate Britons who had come to make their fortune in the movies.  Some, like Laurence Olivier, resisted Smith's efforts and seldom played. Others  were keen cricketers and even went on tour with the Hollywood club.  </P> <P> Despite Smith's efforts and the glamour attached to his "star" players, the  game never really caught on in Los Angeles. It was then, and remains now, a  club sport played for the enjoyment of its participants, most of them  immigrants from Commonwealth countries. To those not brought up with the sport,  it appears baffling.  </P> <P> "Trying to describe cricket to someone who has never played the game," a local  player once said, "is like trying to describe bridge to a novice card player.  You cannot explain the intricacies of the game and the challenge it provides to  someone who has not played it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Americans Ignore It  </P> <P> Americans, by and large, therefore ignore it, and writers, when they are handed  the task of "doing a cricket story" by their editors, invariably wind up poking  fun at the sport's admittedly curious nomenclature (an easy thing in a game  where fielders are called "silly mid-on" or "square leg," and bowlers send down  "googlies" and "chinamen").  </P> <P> But cricket is filled with far better anecdotes, stories that seem to grow more  bizarre the farther one gets from Lords, the London headquarters of the game.  </P> <P> There is the tale, for example, of the Englishman who tried to get his cricket  bat through French Customs several years ago. Failing to grasp the visitor's  explanation of the bat's use, the inspector simply handed him a form listing  dozens of descriptions and asked him to check the appropriate one. The cricket  bat eventually entered France as an engine sportif sans movement mecanique.  </P> <P> Or what about this one from Germany, where cricket is played in Munich in the  Englischer Garten, a public park where, as one writer put it, "the German  penchant for cavorting about naked prevails."  </P> <P> This habit has necessitated a slight altering of the rules of the game as they  are observed in Munich: A batsman cannot be dismissed if, in the opinion of the  umpires, he was hopelessly distracted by an unclad Fraulein jogging in the  outfield. That, it is felt, just wouldn't be cricket.  </P> <P> Or there is this delightful tale involving C. Aubrey Smith himself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Dropped Catch  </P> <P> It seems that Smith, the team captain, was fielding in a match in Los Angeles  one day when he dropped a catch. He immediately stopped the game and called for  his butler, who was instructed to bring Smith his spectacles. The butler  returned with the spectacles and the game continued. A few minutes later, Smith  dropped another catch, and, so the story goes, was heard to curse: "The damn  fool brought my reading glasses."  </P> <P> Lastly, there is the story of the Rev. Elisha Fawcett, an English cleric who,  early last century, devoted his life to teaching the natives of the Admiralty  Islands Christianity and cricket, perhaps not in that order.  </P> <P> The islanders were not wealthy and, when Fawcett died, they cast about for a  suitable monument to place over his grave. They chose the good clergyman's  wooden leg. Well, what with a nurturing climate and plenty of rain, the leg  took root and, in the years ahead, the resultant tree produced a whole harvest  of new bats for the islanders.  </P> <P> Now that's a cricket story.  </P> <P> Those curious enough to want to see a game in person can best do so by heading  out to Woodley Park in Van Nuys between now and Oct. 22, when the current  season ends.  </P> <P> There are three cricket fields there, with matches being played simultaneously  starting at about 11 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  </P> <P> Allowing time for the traditional break for tea, the games can last until dusk.  If the action seems a bit baffling, ask a player what's going on. You might  even learn that a duck is zero, and the trip will not have been for nought.  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Greek economy minister dies:  European News Digest Greece's economy minister, Mr Giorgos Gennimatas (left), died yesterday of cancer. Although unable to go to his office for almost two months, he had refused to resign. Mr Gennimatas, 55, was one of Greece's most popular politicians. Before his cancer was diagnosed, he was considered the most likely candidate to succeed Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou as leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement. During Pasok's first term in office in the 1980s, Mr Gennimatas served as interior minister, launching a decentralisation programme that gave more powers to local authorities. As health minister, Mr Gennimatas was responsible for setting up a national health system intended to improve hospital care and provide essential medical services in remote areas. However, he was criticised for banning the establishment of private medical clinics. Mr Papandreou will have difficulty in finding a new economy minister who can carry out overdue structural reforms and push ahead with privatisation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rukh Chairman Vyacheslaw Chornovil by </F> Lyudmyla Kokhanets; place and date not given: "We Agree With  Bolshevik Ulyanov: There Should Be Less Political Idle Talk"]    [Text] [Kokhanets] Mr. Chornovil, the election results  confirmed that only two parties, two political forces, were able  to usher into the parliament a number of their representatives,  which allows them to form factions on a strict party basis.  These are the Communist Party and Rukh.    [Chornovil] So we have. Our faction is currently comprised  of 30 people -- members and supporters of Rukh. Several other  deputies, representatives of parties with opinions close to  ours, intend to join us. Other factions, unfortunately, are not  being formed on a party basis. "Unfortunately," because this  will not allow the parliament to be clearly structured. We  should aim at the European model of parliamentarism with its  faction discipline and clear division on the authorities and the  opposition. Although this will not take place, the first step  in this direction has already been taken.    [Kokhanets] I recall that, while discussing the electoral  law, the majority of speakers complained: "What parties?  People are already allergic to the word `party'..."    [Chornovil] Yes, the law proved to be completely antiparty,  but it was corrected by the voters themselves, because they  generally voted for certain political forces, not individuals.  It is significant that people want these forces to assume  responsibility; they do not want everyone be responsible for  themselves. Thus, we have our faction, and we have already held  an organizational meeting. According to our statute, the Rukh  chairman is the faction head, Rukh Deputy Chairman Oleksandr  Lavrynovych is its coordinator, and Rivne People's Deputy  Volodymyr Kovtunets is the secretary.    [Kokhanets] Will the program with which your faction is  going to the parliament not duplicate the Rukh program?    [Chornovil] What the faction will propose to the parliament  is not a party program. However, it is actually a little bit  easier for us, because we do not have to think over new things:  We have a well developed state-building concept, which was  elaborated by a large group of scientists and adopted as early  as at the Fourth Rukh Congress. So far, no political force has  elaborated such a document.    [Kokhanets] Do you believe that the current alignment of  forces in the parliament will ensure its ability to act?    [Chornovil] Those who claim that the new parliament is worse  than the previous one do not tell the truth. It is not worse.  Its problem is that it is incomplete. The current Supreme  Council, first of all, is more structured; second, it is not  dominated by the extreme left-wing forces, about which there was  a lot of talk on the eve of the elections. By the way, there  are many sober-minded people who are willing to cooperate among  leftists. For example, I have heard an opinion among socialists  that the parliamentary work should not be politicized from its  first days. The Rukh faction advocates exactly the same thing.  We agree with Bolshevik Ulyanov that there should be less  political idle talk. God forbid that we become stuck in a  debate over symbols, anthems, or state languages. This will  allow us neither to form a normal government and Supreme Council  working bodies, nor to resolve urgent economic problems. I am  very afraid of such politicizing. Perhaps we should first  convene the leaders of all factions -- starting with those  ranging from the extreme left to the center-right (since extreme  rightists will hardly be able to establish their own faction).  We must reach an agreement and prevent debates on certain  issues, on which we will inevitably disagree, and we will again  irritate the Ukrainian people with our senseless conflicts. I  think that we all must agree on vital questions: How to improve  the economy, implement market mechanisms, and curb the crime  raise and impoverishment of society. Another urgent problem is  the financial reform. Mr. Zvyahilskyy [acting prime minister],  apparently, has not done his job....    However, I am afraid that the parliament's incompleteness  can  hamper our resolutions of vital issues. For example, what to do  with the elections scheduled for 26 June? A working group, in  which I am participating, has recently come forward with  amendments to the Constitution, without which the elections  cannot be held, since the Electoral Law says one thing, and the  Constitution -- another. According to the latter, we have no  right to hold either the presidential or self-government  elections. It must be precisely defined what kind of  presidential or local authority there will be, and only then we  can go to the polls.    As for the parliament's structure, I think that the center  comprising predominantly nonparty people will have an impact on  many things. Leftist forces have approximately a third of  seats, national-democratic forces -- even less. Therefore,  while making decisions on a majority of issues, every faction  will be trying to win support of the center which has gathered  representatives of the party in power, agriculture sector  officials, entrepreneurs, and servicemen.    [Kokhanets] Who, do you think, threatens Ukrainian statehood  more -- extreme leftists or the interregional bloc?    [Chornovil] The interregional bloc, of course. Supporters  of Mr. Kuchma advocate things that unequivocally threaten our  independence. Fortunately, they won very few votes. I do not  know whether the bloc members will try to form a faction; they  do not have even 12 deputies: They won some votes in Kharkov  Oblast and Dnepr region; in Donbass, they were defeated by the  communists. As for the extreme leftists, we suppose that they  are not in agreement either. Among them are forces which,  according to socialist recipes, want to build a Ukrainian state.  We will be looking for a common language with them: We will be  trying to convince them, or to make certain compromises. Of  course, compromises will be out of the question if we see an  open proimperial mood. We expect, however, that there will not  be many such deputies in the new parliament.    [Kokhanets] What will be your party position in the  presidential elections?    [Chornovil] We will coordinate who will be nominated and  registered. It is not so easy to collect 100,000 signatures.  Rukh has not officially nominated any candidate. Perhaps we  will unofficially support Lanovyy. He really is a serious  economist, a man who stands on state-building positions and can  strip the proimperially oriented Kuchma of some votes. Yet, the  point is not Kuchma himself, but the forces which bet on him,  intending to command their nominee if he is elected to  presidential office.    [Kokhanets] Thus, we will not see your name among  presidential candidates this time. People say that  Chornovil-oppositionist can do more than Chornovil-president.  What is your opinion about such a "compliment?"    [Chornovil] I am not focused on being an oppositionist. I  simply consider these elections immoral. Even the situation  surrounding them is somewhat unpleasant. Look, this is our  president who states either that he will no longer run for his  current office, or that he will. [Former Supreme Council  Chairman] Plyushch has also put forward his candidacy, and he is  arguing at news conferences that Leonid Makarovych, to put it  politely, is not right.... They are simply fighting for the  chair, not knowing how will it look, since the president's  functions have not been defined, nor has the new constitution  been adopted. Where in the world is a president elected first,  and then his functions defined? This does not occur. This  drive to the chair, this intriguing against one another, this  coquetry, all this is very shameful. Most candidates are not  any better, either. Do these people really not realize that  they are ridiculous in their claims to the presidential office.  You know, watching such an atmosphere, I am only glad that I  have not joined this game. Of course, if there were a different  configuration of forces, a different situation within society,  why could not Rukh recommend its own representative? Regarding  that "compliment," I believe that I was governing Lvov Oblast  rather well, when I was openly not in the opposition. The  general situation was simply unfavorable for my work. The  economic collapse began at that time. We were trying to prevent  it, as much as we could. We achieved a lot, but....    I would like to emphasize again that opposition is not the  goal for me or our faction. If a political force only aims at  being in the opposition, it is doomed. Pure opposition does not  exist in politics. Thus, the opinion that "Chornovil is an  eternal oppositionist" is rather false. The current situation  simply gives us no chance to win more than we could win.    [Kokhanets] How, in your opinion, can Rukh's victory and the  defeat of the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] be explained?    [Chornovil] I think that the URP leaders' policy is too  temporizing, not only toward Kravchuk, but also his  nomenklatura. They recklessly believed that the old team would  honestly build a new state. Recklessness does not work out in  politics... And Rukh... Rukh was successful, because it  understands this.    We expect that our faction will become more solid after the  run-off elections, since in many constituencies where the  elections were disrupted we had a very good chance; our  representatives made it to the second round not only in western  Ukraine, but also in eastern oblasts (in Kiev, for example, --  14 "pure" Rukh members).    Our faction is ready for the parliamentary work. It will  cooperate with all who want to make our Ukraine an independent  and developed state.</p>

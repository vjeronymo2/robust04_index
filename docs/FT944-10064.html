			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Boustead ahead to Pounds 258,000 Boustead, the industrial products and technical services group, returned to the black at the operating level in the six months to September 30, while pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 258,000. Turnover of the group, a subsidiary of Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, came to Pounds 12.5m, against Pounds 28.8m, which included Pounds 17.3m from discontinued businesses. Last year's profits included Pounds 573,000 on the disposal of fixed assets, but interest this time added Pounds 245,000 (Pounds 58,000 charge) as a result of substantial cash balances. Sir Thomas Macpherson, chairman, said the current trend for all continuing businesses was positive, and full year results were expected to show further improvement over the first period. Earnings per share came to 0.35p (0.2p losses) while the interim dividend is maintained at 0.35p.</p>

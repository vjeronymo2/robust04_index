			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa announced early Thursday [3 February] his coalition  government has decided to introduce a new 7 percent "national  welfare tax" to finance a 6 trillion yen tax cut which will be  part of government efforts to boost the sluggish economy.    However, the Social Democratic Party, the largest of the  seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition, strongly opposed the plan  and threatened to withdraw its ministers from the cabinet.    Hosokawa told a news conference the government wants to  introduce the new tax on goods and services April 1, 1997.    Speaking at a hurriedly arranged news conference, Hosokawa  said, "the government has decided to introduce a new national  welfare tax at a rate of 7 percent, starting from April 1, 1997."    "In tandem with the introduction of the national welfare  tax,  the current 3 percent consumption tax will be abolished," the  premier said.    "The new tax will be introduced to finance the large cost of  building up the social infrastructure, improving the people's  living environment and financing growing welfare expenditures,"  he said.    The Hosokawa cabinet will decide Thursday on a 15 trillion  yen pump-priming package that will include the tax cuts,  officials said.    Hosokawa said part of the additional revenue stemming from  the new tax will be used to finance planned tax cuts of 6  trillion yen, of which income and resident tax cuts would  account for "5.3 trillion yen."    Asked by a reporter whether the fresh revenue from the new  tax would more than offset an immediate revenue shortfall from  the 6 trillion yen income tax cuts, Hosokawa nodded.    "Certainly, the new tax measures would result in a net tax  increase, starting from fiscal 1997," Hosokawa said, in response  to the reporter's allegation that the expected 9 trillion yen  annual revenue from the new tax would produce a net revenue  increase of up to 2 trillion yen.    Hosokawa said his administration will submit to the Diet a  bill that would replace the current consumption tax with the new  national welfare tax.    He said his administration will not include a provision that  would obligate the government to spend revenues from the new tax  solely for the purpose of financing government expenditures  related to welfare policy.    Items of government outlays on which the revenue from the  new  tax would be spent "would not be specified" in the text of the  new tax legislation, Hosokawa said.    Hosokawa rejected the Social Democratic Party's argument  that  the introduction of the new 7 percent tax would be tantamount to  raising the rate of the current 3 percent consumption tax.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a late night meeting of  the leaders of coalition parties that his party cannot accept  the new tax unless the government includes wording obliging it  to use all the revenue from the new tax for welfare-related  expenditures.    The party urged Hosokawa to set up a "special account"  inside  the state budget -- independent from its general account -- to  ensure that additional revenue be spent to finance  welfare-related outlays, while preventing a diversion of  revenues to expenditures unrelated to welfare, SDP officials  said.    Earlier in the day, most coalition partners agreed to back a  proposal by the Finance Ministry to offset the tax cuts of 6  trillion yen with the new 7 percent tax, the officials said.    The SDP, by joining the coalition, has lent vital support to  the Hosokawa administration, enabling it to secure a majority in  the House of Representatives.    The SDP has many opponents of the consumption tax as it  bolstered its parliamentary strength in the 1989 election on an  anticonsumption tax platform.    The non-SDP coalition partners tried in vain to persuade the  SDP to accept the revenue-balancing plan, they said.    Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, an SDP legislator, told  reporters, "Prime Minister Hosokawa asked the SDP chairman to  accept his tax legislation, but our chairman said the party  cannot accept such a proposal."    The coalition tussle has intensified nine days before  Hosokawa flies to the United States for talks with President  Bill Clinton.    Hosokawa, whose administration is under U.S. pressure to  revive the floundering Japanese economy by stimulating stagnant  consumer spending, is expected to mention some pump-priming  fiscal package featuring a tax cut at the meeting with Clinton.    The non-SDP coalition partners initially tried to alleviate  the SDP aversion to the tax by putting forward a proposal to  change the name of the tax to "welfare-purpose tax" from  "consumption tax," the officials said.    Earlier in the day, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a  meeting of coalition leaders, "the SDP will absolutely not  tolerate a raise in the rate of the consumption tax."    However, other coalition partners are calling for the raise  to be implemented by the end of 1994, saying they do not want to  antagonize voters before a House of Councillors election  expected in the summer of 1995.</p>

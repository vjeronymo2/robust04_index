			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (7): Eyes on the environment - Planning is becoming more sophisticated IN SPITE OF the increase in awareness of the environment and the more forceful lobbies of the conservation bodies, developers of business parks are still casting their eyes over green field sites. However, that said, many of the proposals put forward in the prosperous years of the 1980s are never likely to succeed. Developers in the 90s, however, know that they must take a hard look at environmental issues and put forward packages to planning authorities which offer real benefits to the community in general and, in some cases, specific benefits to special interest groups. Awareness of the environment is not all that is required. The approach of developers seeking to build on green belt sites is becoming much more sophisticated and considered, says Nicholas Taylor of solicitors Berwin Leighton. Rather than take on the government through the traditional appeal procedure, with the offer of planning gains which in some cases amount to little more than bribery, developers are seeking to have land taken out of the green belt through the new local plans. This is particularly so when it comes to 'brown field' sites which, though actually in the green belt are polluted in one way or another. Stockley Park, a former rubbish tip transformed into what is arguably one of the best true business parks in Europe, is an example of this type of site. The Rutland Group's Bedfont Lakes, just south of terminal four at Heathrow is another. Although lying within the designated green belt it had been worked for minerals for 60 years and the resulting excavations filled, causing the inevitable risks of carbon dioxide and methane gases. The planning process at Bedfont Lakes provides, says Mr Taylor, a particularly good example of the new 'balance sheet approach'. Begun before the introduction of the Environment Protection Act 1990 which enforces stringent measures on owners of old landfill sites to clean them up, this initially involved wide consultation with the local community and the local authority, the London Borough of Hounslow. Mr Ian McDonald of Roger Tym and Partners, who was the coordinator of Rutland's professional team, says that in all such cases the starting point is to discover what the local authority is trying to do; then to check the balance between the land lost from the green belt and the resulting benefits to the community. Over the past few years public consultation has become de rigueur for promoters of large-scale developments, regardless of whether they are in or out of the green belt. However good the proposals, says Mr McDonald, there are bound to be those who will always be opposed just for the sake of it. But even after a full and serious debate, he says, it comes down to Can they believe you? Is the developer really able to deliver all that is being promised? The Bedfont Lakes development will include 188 acres of attractive green belt land laid out for recreation and sport, including fishing, horse-riding, birdwatching and nature conservation. The 17 acres of non-conforming industry will be removed, there will be seven acres set aside for housing and various measures will be taken to improve the traffic. To pay for all this the Rutland is developing 800,000 sq ft of high quality offices in a 33-acre business park and a further 200,000 sq ft of industrial space on a separate site. The first phase of the office park has been sold to a joint venture between IBM and MEPC which is developing 343,000 sqft of offices - of which IBM itself will occupy 185,000 sq ft - on 18 acres. The seven buildings, designed around a formal landscaped square, are due for completion next year. There remains, however, according to Ms Diane May of Jones Laing Wootton, a strong presumption against business park development on green belt sites in the south-east although planners are more likely to listen to proposals on sites where new development will not only replace existing non-conforming users but also provide further benefits. Ms May cites the Clayform/Maple Oak development at White Waltham, a 33-acre site adjoining the airfield. The new development will replace an old industrial estate and, in addition, the developers will construct a new road to the A4 and a new railway bridge. Present government policy is perceived to be one of leaving it to the locals via their local plans. However, in some areas the Department of the Environment is nudging local authorities into designating areas for business parks in their unitary plans. A case in point is Birmingham where the DOE issued a circular (PRO 10) putting forward strategic guidance for the West Midlands. In essence the circular stated that further sites for business parks should be released at the right time, that is when Arlington's successful 148-acre Birmingham Business Park next to the National Exhibition Centre and the M42 and the M6 has reached capacity. The site, which has already attracted a number of Blue chip occupiers, has planning for some 2.5m sq ft. The DOE's circular has spawned several competing proposals which have been the subject of a lengthy public inquiry. All the sites are located close to the M42 motorway. The five main sites are located in the green belt but only one, that of Blythe Valley Park, west of junction 4 in Solihull, has been designated as a business park site by the local authority. And this site, being put forward by Speyhawk with Solihull Council, with Arlington and Tarmac's Partway South East Site, south of junction 3, are thought to be the front runners. Other contenders are Shirley Farm Estates with a site south of junction 4, RM. Douglas's Weatheroak Park north west of junction 3 and Edmonds' site on the A435 south of junction 3. How many of the sites will get the go-ahead and when is not clear. The triggerpoint for the timing of the release of the next site is likely to be when Birmingham Business Park is 75 per cent full. Opinions vary on when this point is likely to be reached but there is a feeling that this should happen in about three years. If this estimate proves correct, there is a case to be made for one of the sites being released straight away. The drawing up of master plans and the putting in place of the considerable infrastructure required before a construction start can be made on a true business park development could easily take three years. The West Midlands is aware of its need to attract high-calibre employers if it is to recover from the erosion of its traditional industrial base. To do that it has to offer organisations the right kind of working environment in the right areas well served with communications. The West Midlands is not alone. Other regions are becoming aware of the necessity of attracting new employment opportunities. In Manchester, AMEC Properties and the Scottish Life Assurance Co have linked up with the Universities of Manchester and Salford, UMlST and Manchester Polytechnic to promote a development at Davenport Green which would provide European headquarters buildings for three large international companies. On a 350-acre site - with 260 acres of parkland maintained in agricultural and recreational use is located alongside the M56 and within five minutes of Manchester International Airport. Public consultation is now under way. The balance sheet is being drawn up.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Philips joins French in plan to beat Japanese PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, is to join forces with the French companies Thomson and Sagem in an attempt to break Japanese dominance of the world market for advanced liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), widely used in small portable televisions and lap-top computers. The three European companies said yesterday that they will pool their efforts in active matrix LCDs - which make possible the use of colour moving pictures, unlike passive LCDs which are common in digital watches and hi-fi equipment. Philips is to own 80 per cent of the joint venture, with 10 per cent each to be held by Thomson and Sagem. The Dutch company, which already has a pilot LCD plant in its home town of Eindhoven and which is currently building a factory nearby for commercial production, also said it plans to acquire a 10 per cent stake in Sagem, but it gave no financial details. The world's commercial production of active matrix LCDs is the preserve of Japanese companies, particularly Sharp, Toshiba and Hitachi. European producers of consumer electronics such as Thomson and Philips currently have to turn to Japanese suppliers for commercial quantities of LCDs. The new joint venture, which will start operations in January, aims to manufacture active matrix LCDs for its three parent companies as well as for third parties. 'Turnover is expected to reach the level of some hundreds of millions of guilders in the coming years,' Philips said. At first, the venture's production process is to be based on Philips technology but eventually it will switch to technology co-developed by Sagem.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Violent clashes continue to be waged in Bengo  Province, where for several days troops from the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT], led  by Eduardo dos Santos, have been on the offensive. According to  correspondent Octavio Mulandi, very fierce clashes have taken  place over the past 48 hours, with the aggressors suffering  heavy losses. Mulandi said more clashes are expected in the  coming days, taking into account yesterday's warmongering speech  by the Futungo de Belas chief in an interview with the ANGOLAN  PRESS AGENCY. Eduardo dos Santos promised to recover  strategically important regions in his struggle against the  Angolan people.    This morning, the MPLA-PT air force once again bombed  agricultural fields and villages at Picapo, the correspondent  said. Meanwhile, the UNITA Armed Forces are ready to prove to  Eduardo dos Santos that it is foolish to mount offensives when  parties are negotiating peace. This was stated by a UNITA  captain interviewed on the front line in Bengo today.</p>

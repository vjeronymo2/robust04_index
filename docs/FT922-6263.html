			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Saudi oil move boosts Opec hawks: Why hardliners will be pleased with last week's meeting in Vienna THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' meeting last week provided unexpectedly good news for the cartel's traditional price hawks - countries such as Iran, Algeria, Nigeria and Libya, which prefer Opec output agreements to keep supply tight to squeeze the oil price higher. This should be the effect of Opec's decision in Vienna last Friday to 'roll over' its second-quarter output ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day into the third quarter, allowing only Kuwait to boost output as it catches up lost ground. Indeed oil traders yesterday said the deal could create what one called a 'serious bull market' for crude. For the first time since before the Gulf war Opec may be within reach of its 'reference price' of Dollars 21 a barrel for the cartel's basket of crudes - a figure Mr Ginanjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, said yesterday could be attained by September. (Last week the basket price hovered above Dollars 18.50 a barrel.) This is unexpected because since the Gulf crisis, when Saudi Arabia boosted production from 5m barrels a day to above 8m b/d to replace lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output, the kingdom has clung jealously to its increased share of Opec output, now over 30 per cent, and, as the price hawks see it, used its unmatchable oil market weight to depress prices. Last week's meeting therefore looked set to be another Saudi tussle with the hawks - the kingdom suggested before the meeting that it wanted Opec's ceiling raised by 1m b/d to 24m b/d, but with Iran, leading the hawks, calling for a cut. Then something odd happened. Instead of insisting on its pre-talks position, Saudi Arabia quickly agreed that a roll-over, allowing for Kuwait, would be fine. Odder still, the Saudis arrived without Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, who was said to be 'exhausted' from international trips. Oil analysts professed bafflement. A market rumour that King Fahd, the Saudi ruler, was ill went around the oil market - a rumour Saudi delegates angrily denied. But what were the Saudis up to? Officially, the kingdom, led in the talks by Mr Fayez Badr, a junior minister, decided early that no agreement could be reached to raise the ceiling to 24m b/d, that even a lower ceiling of 23.7m b/d would prove divisive, and, therefore, that a roll-over plus extra Kuwaiti production was the best compromise. The deal will, Opec estimates, see the cartel pumping 23.5m b/d in the third quarter, 'with some leakages', in the words of one official. In fact, since most industry sources suggest Opec is already pumping 23.5m-23.6m b/d, the cartel's output by September could be near the 24m b/d Saudi Arabia chose as its starting figure, which represents its estimate of the call on Opec crude for the quarter. So to that extent the kingdom got what it wanted. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia, in common with the price hawks - which these days include heavily strapped Kuwait - will be glad of the extra revenues an additional Dollars 2-Dollars 3 per barrel will bring to help defray its hefty budget deficit. Its soft-pedalling was also good for Opec harmony. But these factors may not account entirely for the kingdom's shift towards a higher-price oil policy. Another which might, however, is the European Community's decision to back a carbon tax worth Dollars 10 on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent by the year 2000, designed to restrain oil consumption and curb carbon dioxide emissions. No Saudi delegates explicity linked their shift towards allowing oil prices to rise to their opposition to the proposed tax. But none lost any opportunity to make clear the kingdom's distaste for the proposal - something Mr Nazer expressed strongly in talks before the Opec meeting between EC and Gulf ministers in Kuwait. 'Excessive petroleum taxation' in the EC has, he said, already risen from Dollars 7 a barrel in 1973 to Dollars 56 in 1991, while taxes on coal, which produces more carbon dioxide than oil, were lower. Mr Nazer also pointed out overall EC taxes on oil raked in Dollars 210bn in 1991, while the oil exporters in the period earned just Dollars 64bn for their oil exports. Should the tax go through, Mr Nazer said, 'Producers will find themselves in a dilemma of overspending to raise their productive capacities to ensure security of supplies while taxation policies aim at curtailing demand in consumer countries.' This, Mr Nazer concluded, 'would ultimately affect. . . our relations with our trading partners.' Saudi Arabia - the world's largest oil exporter and a single commodity economy - the minister was suggesting, will not sit idle while the EC proposes a tax which will hurt its revenues while adding to EC governments' coffers. 'It is a question of who earns the economic rent from oil,' said one Gulf Arab oil official in Vienna. By backing higher Opec oil prices, therefore, the kingdom has issued a gentle reminder that its previous price-levelling policies should not be taken for granted. Moreover, the rest of Opec will fall swiftly behind Saudi moves to resist the carbon tax. As Mr Nordine Ait Laossine, Algeria's oil minister, said in Vienna, if the EC wants to raise oil prices for the consumer, 'we can very well do that for them'.</p>

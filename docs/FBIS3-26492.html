He recently officiated at  several important economic meetings and visited several places  to learn about the situations there. He bluntly expressed his  dissatisfaction with the overheated property development, the  slow pace in bringing order out of chaos in the financial  market, and the excessive scale of investment. He demanded that  cadres in all localities continue to follow the red-letterhead  document on strengthening macroeconomic control and act  according to their capacity by resolutely suspending or delaying  the construction of a number of projects. He was angry with  officials in various sectors having their own way and "refusing  to safeguard the authority of the central government." He was  furious with Guangdong and other provinces for resisting the  central decision to impose the value-added land tax. In the  first half of this year, he will take strong measures to tighten  up on investment and loans, cool down the overheated property  market, and bring down inflation.    According to Beijing economic circles, while Zhu, who was  promoted by Deng Xiaoping, favored the call to "seize the  favorable opportunity to speed up economic development," he kept  a wary eye on the possibility that local economic growth would  endanger the macroeconomic control exercised by the central  government. He believed the central government must have  abundant funds at its command before it can exercise effective  macroeconomic control. The supply of funds, energy, raw and  semifinished materials, and transport services must be taken  into account in planning to increase the GNP, and we must not  "rush headlong into mass action" and "hanker after something  sensational, but impractical," all over again, he said.    In recent speeches, he has reiterated the need to straighten  out the "bubble economy" at a greater pace, to effectively  recover loans made in breach of the regulations, to cool down  the real estate craze and the rush to set up development zones,  and to earnestly tighten up on bank loans and fixed-asset  investment.    Fixed-asset investment in 1993 was as high as 1,150 billion  yuan, up 44 percent over the planned 800 billion yuan, and up 47  percent over total 1992 investment. The economic growth rate  and fixed-asset investment planned for 1994 are 9 percent and  1,300 billion yuan, respectively. Zhu was quoted by an  economist in Beijing as saying: The investment scale is large  enough already. Provinces are not allowed to vie with one  another in launching construction projects, and leading cadres  of local governments must be held responsible for undesirable  consequences arising from improper investment. Zhu was highly  critical of some provinces that had refused to do away with  unacceptable economic development zones and had engaged in  property development irrespective of actual conditions. The  circular issued by the State Council in late January on  strengthening macrocontrol over fixed-asset investment was  prompted mainly by Zhu's idea of guarding against economic  overheating.    Zhu reiterated the need to enforce the following "three  regulations": No borrowing in breach of the regulations is  allowed, no unauthorized interest increase or interest increase  in a disguised form is allowed, and financial organs must sever  ties with the economic entities they have established. In  particular, he demanded that central departments and local  governments try their best to prevent the recurrence of  unauthorized fund-raising. He believed that only when bank  loans and unauthorized fund-raising are controlled can the real  estate craze be cooled down and the scale of fixed-asset  investment curbed. He required banks in all localities  immediately to break the debt chains of the financial offices,  put an end to the situation in which "the bank's  account-settling channel is stopped up and funds cannot be  transferred readily [hui lu bu chang 0565 6424 0008 2545]," and  forestall the possibility of banks not being able to provide  cash for their customers.    A Guangzhou official was quoted by Beijing economic circles  as saying in Hong Kong some days ago that Guangzhou would not  impose the value-added land tax. "Iron-headed Zhu" said this is  nonsense, claiming: The provisional regulations on levying the  value-added land tax will be carried out. All localities must  submit themselves to the central government, rather than  "countering central policies with local ones." All tax laws  enacted by local governments which run against central policies  are invalid.    There was a hot dispute in the CPC hierarchy over the  relationship between development speed and economic stability.  Chen Yun has been insisting that "the scale of economic  construction correspond to national strength" and that the  principle of doing what is within our capacity must be followed  in arranging fixed- asset investment so as to strike a balance  in finance, credit, materials supply and demand, and foreign  exchange. He once said: "How many capital construction projects  can be launched is not determined by how much money we have, but  by how many raw and semifinished materials are available." He  also maintained that in arranging the scale of economic  construction, the restraining effect of agricultural development  on economic growth rate must be taken into account.    Zhu and other third-generation leaders in central leadership  now are seeking a compromise program that will accommodate Deng  Xiaoping's call to "speed up economic development" and Chen  Yun's call to "do what the country is capable of" because, on  the one hand, they support Deng's plan "to bring about a period  of particularly rapid development every few years," and on the  other, they must take into account Chen's principle of "seeking  development under a stable situation." Evidently, economic  reform will deepen in 1994, but the State Council will curb  blind investment by local governments, including "excessive  development" in real estate and development zones.</p>

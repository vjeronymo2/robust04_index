			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Apt hue for Bluebird's fun bus IT HAS been a tough time all round in Toytown, but especially for Bluebird Toys, maker of the microscopic Polly Pocket doll and the Big Red Fun Bus. Pre-tax losses at this USM-quoted group deepened from Pounds 856,000 to Pounds 3.55m over 1991. Virtually all of the deficit was attributable to exceptional charges of Pounds 3.46m taken during the first six months for a wide-ranging restructuring programme. Profits in the second half totalled Pounds 924,000, compared with Pounds 40,000 for the comparable period of 1990. Mr Torquil Norman, founder and chairman, said the restructuring programme was now complete and the company expected to make a profit in the coming year. 'We are now back on track . . . Trying to restructure in the recession was like trying to turn a supertanker round in a force 10 gale,' he said. Two factories had been closed in the last 18 months with the subsequent loss of 450 jobs. Head office staffing had been reduced and various product ranges combined under a single sales force. Stocks had been cut by 50 per cent to Pounds 4.4m, and a significant amount of work was being sourced from the Far East. He denied that this would affect the quality of products offered. Turnover fell from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 42.6m. Margins came under pressure due to the greater proportion of overseas sales which rose by 50 per cent to Pounds 11m. Mr Norman said the group remained well within its banking facilities. Net gearing - excluding the 20-year convertible loan stock - was 75 per cent. Losses per share jumped from 10.8p to 35.8p.</p>

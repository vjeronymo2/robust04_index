			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Kmart acquires stake in Australian grocer KMART, the US retailer, has put itself into the forefront of the battle to rationalise the Australian grocery industry by paying ADollars 20.5m (USDollars 13.7m) for a 10.8 per cent stake in Independent Holdings, the South Australian wholesaler. Kmart, which controls just over 20 per cent of Coles Myer, Australia's biggest retailer, revealed itself yesterday as the buyer of a parcel of 3.2m Independent shares traded at ADollars 6.45 earlier this week. The Kmart move follows the recent purchase of a 19.9 per cent stake in Independent by Davids Holdings, the privately-controlled Australian grocery wholesaler. Foodland Associated, another big Australian grocery group, also controls 18.5 per cent of Independent. The Kmart purchase was seen yesterday by analysts as a move friendly to Coles Myer, which has recently moved to block acquisitions in the grocery industry which is one of its major supply sources. Earlier this year, Coles acquired a 15 per cent stake in QIW, a Queensland grocery group, helping to thwart a hostile take over attempt by Davids Holdings. The Trade Practices Commission said yesterday it would hold an inquiry into Kmart's acquisition of Independent shares. At its Michigan headquarters, Kmart remained tight-lipped about the share purchase. Although the company has been putting increased emphasis on international opportunities recently, and purchased stores in the Czech Republic and Slovakia last year, it described the Independent stake was a 'non-strategic investment'. Kmart declined to say whether it had discussed the share purchase with Coles Myer. In the context of Kmart, one of the largest retailers in sales terms in the US, the funds involved in the purchase are extremely modest. Kmart's assets at end-January, for example, were put at almost Dollars 19bn.</p>

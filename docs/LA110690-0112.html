			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: TOP VOLLEYBALL TEAMS FLOP SPOTS THIS SEASON  </P> <P> For the past couple of years the top two girls' volleyball teams in San Diego  County have been Poway and Torrey Pines. In that order.  </P> <P> But this year, Torrey Pines has worked its way to the top. The Falcons not only  defeated Poway earlier in the season, but again last Tuesday for the Palomar  League title.  </P> <P> Now, when people speak of the top two teams, the answer is reversed. Torrey  Pines and Poway. In that order.  </P> <P> "It was a real neat day," Torrey Pines Coach Jim Harrah said of winning the  league title. "It was a culmination of a lot of hard work and a lot of sweat."  </P> <P> Tuesday's victory also pushed Torrey Pines ahead of the Titans in the state  coaches' poll for the first time. Torrey Pines jumped from seventh to third in  the rankings; Poway remained fourth.  </P> <P> "The girls are excited to be recognized," Harrah said. "Any girl at the age of  15, 16 or 17 likes to be recognized. But at the same time they're putting it in  perspective. It's a fine honor but it's not everything to them. It's not going  to their heads. It's nice but you still have to prove yourself."  </P> <P> Poway had won the league title the past two years and in 1987 Torrey Pines was  co-champion with Mt. Carmel. This year, however, the Falcons weren't about to  let that happen again.  </P> <P> "Before the match, the girls said they didn't want to share the title this  year," Harrah said. "It's been an interesting season. The short-term goal was  to be strong at the end of the season. The long-term goal was to not only win  the league but (to be as) prepared for the (section) playoffs as possible and  possibly go to the state playoffs."  </P> <P> With the realignment of the section playoff divisions this year, Torrey Pines  and Poway will not meet for a third time this season. Poway remains in Division  I; Torrey Pines is now in Division II. Poway has won the Division I title the  past two years.  </P> <P> Poway will play Morse in today's first round of Division I playoffs and Torrey  Pines meets El Capitan when Division II play opens on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines (24-2) is second-seeded to Helix (28-0) in Division II, Harrah  said, because Helix defeated Torrey Pines in a tournament two months ago.  </P> <P> "We're a much different team now," Harrah said. "The committee seeds the teams  on head-to-head battles, not on how the teams are doing overall. I talked to  some parents of the girls the other night and they all said, 'Give us No. 2, it  gives us motivation and puts the pressure on Helix.' "  </P> <P> Because of Saturday's Times' report on Mike Chamberlain, the Mission Bay High  School football booster who collapsed because of an arrhythmic attack on his  heart while watching his son play in Mission Bay's football game Friday, his  family said it has been flooded with calls and contributions from well-wishers  at Mission Bay Hospital.  </P> <P> "Mission Bay (Hospital) says they've never gotten so many calls for one  person," Chamberlain's wife, Betsy, said.  </P> <P> La Jolla Country Day has had games stopped before the end of fourth quarter  because of the 45-point rule, but never after one quarter of play. La Jolla  Country Day defeated Borrego Springs, 50-0, in the first quarter Friday.  </P> <P> "It was really unusual," LJCD Coach Rick Woods said. "Everything happened so  quickly. We knew Borrego Springs was having a rough year, they only have one  win. We knew they weren't up to their strength. It was an opportunity to play  other kids, especially defensively.  </P> <P> "We made five interceptions, our defense kept getting the ball. It's not that  we ran up the score, they just kept throwing the ball in our hands. After the  game (Borrego Springs Coach Rod Quigley) said he was sorry he couldn't give us  a better contest."  </P> <P> Said LJCD linebacker Darren Hamilton, "What the score doesn't indicate is we  were trying to add a new defense and we were really confused at the start of  the game."  </P> <P> Kearny's football team broke out of a midseason slump with a 28-0 victory over  USDHS Friday mainly because it started using Darnay Scott as Notre Dame uses  Raghib (Rocket) Ismail. Without Scott, a 6-foot-3 split end with 4.3 speed,  Kearny is not the same team.  </P> <P> Against USDHS, Scott lined up at tailback on one play and scored on a 74-yard  touchdown run, breaking numerous tackles and spinning off a violent collision  with a linebacker, which almost knocked off his helmet, en route to the end  zone. He also caught a 23-yard touchdown pass and had two interceptions. He  leads the county with nine interceptions.  </P> <P> After starting the season 5-0 and averaging 30-plus points a game, Kearny went  1-1-1, and averaged 11 points during a three-game stretch, because it wasn't  getting the ball to Scott.  </P> <P> "Said Kearny offensive coordinator Steve Miner, "(Scott is) a rugged, tough  football player."  </P> <P> While being surrounded by reporters after he gained 159 yards against Fallbrook  and became the county's all-time leading rusher, Rancho Buena Vista's Markeith  Ross, who wanted to shake hands with the opposition, said: "Let me walk through  here."  </P> <P> It was the only time he asked all night.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writers Dana Haddad and Martin Henderson contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

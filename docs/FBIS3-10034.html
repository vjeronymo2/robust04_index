			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, 24 Feb (PL) -- Today ultrarightist  groups staged a demonstration in this capital to confirm their  support for the blockade against Cuba at a time when demands are  being made for the U.S. Government to change its policy toward  Cuba.    Four U.S. congressmen, including Robert Torricelli -- the  author of the law that intensifies the blockade against Cuba --  spoke during the demonstration, which was planned by the Cuban  Unity Movement [Movimiento Unidad Cubana].    Florida's Republican Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and  Lincoln Diaz Balart, as well as New Jersey's Democratic  Representative Robert Menendez, spoke at the demonstration.  They all expressed their support for maintaining the  restrictions, which have cost Cuba over $40 billion in the past  three decades.    Some 1,000 people, who arrived in three planes and 12 buses  from Miami, took part in this demonstration in front of the  Capitol.    A spokesperson for the organization called International  Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz Para Cuba] told PRENSA LATINA  by telephone that the demonstration was staged to protest a  draft bill proposed by New York's Democratic Representative  Charles Rangel, who will submit said bill for discussion before  four congressional committees on 17 February [date as received].    Rangel's draft bill, which is called the Free Trade With  Cuba  Act, has the support of 30 U.S. congress members, religious  leaders, businessmen, academicians, and the moderate sector of  the Cuban- American community.    Paul Asure, an International Peace for Cuba spokesman, said  that the demonstration's organizers sought to get the attention  of U.S. Government leaders in a context in which they are  increasingly becoming a minority, as they are listened to less  and less.    Asure added that they see themselves as losing strength in  their efforts to smother Cuba and are trying to make noise.  However, they are faced with the current situation where people  in the United States and most members of the Cuban-American  community are pressing Washington to change its policy toward  Cuba.    On 12 February the so-called International Peace for Cuba  organized a demonstration in favor of Rangel's proposal and the  U.S.-Cuban Friendship Caravan, which will take humanitarian aid  to Cuba on 12 March.    Today's demonstration in Washington is the most advertised  activity by ultrarightist groups since Havana announced a call  for a dialogue between the government and representatives of the  Cuban community abroad to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April.    According to Andres Romero, president of the Organization of  Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organizacion Cubanos-Americanos por  la Dignidad], this demonstration is "more or less the same  thing" and it shows that they "feel as cornered as those who see  their game is about to end."    Romero told PRENSA LATINA that representatives of various  groups that oppose the blockade also participated in the  demonstration because if "this is a democratic country, we are  also entitled to exert our rights."    When people of this type use their time to threaten the  lives  of 11 million people solely to defend their personal  interests.... their words, predictions, and threats lose their  strength.    The demonstration by blockade advocates is viewed as an act  of protest against those who favor an end to economic sanctions,  including prominent U.S. publications such as THE NEW YORK  TIMES, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, THE  WASHINGTON POST, and WORLD TRADE magazine.    Even former supporters of the blockade have changed their  minds, as is the case with New Mexico's Democratic  Representative Bill Richardson, who is a cosponsor of Rangel's  bill.    Former Justice Secretary Ramsey Clark has also challenged  this policy and has raised the question that if Washington ended  the commercial embargo against Vietnam, why can it not do the  same with Cuba, where, as opposed to the former, no U.S.  citizens have died.    However, Warren Christopher, U.S. Secretary of State,  recently rejected the possibility of a policy change as in the  case of Vietnam, because, Christopher argued, "Cuba and Vietnam  constitute two different situations."</p>

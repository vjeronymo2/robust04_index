			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Leading Article: In the pit FURTHER PIT closures have been inevitable ever since the UK government gave a stay of execution to 12 of the pits on British Coal's original hit-list earlier this year. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, could not say so at the time, such was the political uproar that greeted last year's closure programme. The government may not feel able to say so now, although the news that British Coal wants to close an even larger number of pits has been leaked. But the harsh truth is that March's white paper did not provide a rescue, only a reprieve. Coal is a dirty and expensive form of generating electricity and is therefore being inexorably driven out of the market by cheaper and cleaner gas. The white paper failed to guarantee a larger market for coal by elbowing aside other forms of energy. It merely promised subsidies to bring the price of British-mined coal down to world market levels if any extra market could be found. But it has become abundantly clear that the main generators, National Power and PowerGen, are not willing to buy more coal for the time being. They have already stockpiled far more coal than they want, and have no immediate need of any extra supplies on top of what they have already contracted to take. Even if they sign up for more from next year, the amounts will be small. Meanwhile, the prospects for UK coal have further deteriorated. Partly to blame is the government's decision to allow generators to burn more orimulsion, an even dirtier but cheaper form of fuel than coal. But the reprieve of the 12 pits has also played a part. It has resulted in British Coal building its own 14m tonne stockpile of unsold coal. The larger the coal mountains above ground, the more pointless it is to dig for coal underground. There will be some who think that the government should re-explore options discarded in the white paper such as banning new gas-fired power stations, closing nuclear plants and halting imports of French electricity. But changing the energy market in such ways would impose higher electricity costs on British businesses and consumers. The only sensible way forward is to press ahead with privatisation, in the hope that a small but efficient industry will emerge. In doing so, ministers will need to consider carefully whether British Coal should be broken into competing companies. Although this would give a spur to productivity, there may be something in the counter-argument that the generating duopoly would find it too easy to dictate terms to an excessively fragmented industry. As far as pit closures are concerned, there is an economic case for an open announcement that another 15 or so pits will have to go. Prolonging the agony would be debilitating for those who work in the industry. By adding to the coal stockpiles, it would also undermine the industry's remaining chances of long-run viability. But politics will presumably dictate otherwise.</p>

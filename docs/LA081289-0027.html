			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND RACING AT DEL MAR;  </P> <P> A NO-STAR FIELD FOR THE EDDIE READ  </P> <P> Even Eddie Read might have had trouble selling the 1989 version of the race  that bears his name.  </P> <P> Sunday's $250,000 Eddie Read Handicap, named for the late Del Mar public  relations director, is woefully short of stars for its 16th running at 1 1/8  miles on the turf, even though four of the contenders have won Grade I races.  </P> <P> It is a surprising turn of events, because the middle-distance grass division  in California has been one of the strongest in recent years. In fact, the last  four winners of the Read -- Deputy Governor, Sharrood, Al Mamoon and Tsunami  Slew -- were of world-class quality and helped boost the race to Grade I  status.  </P> <P> With division leaders Peace and Steinlen absent -- along with Frankly Perfect,  Nasr el Arab and Great Communicator, all pointing for the Arlington Million --  this edition of the Read shapes up as a showdown between Silver Circus, the  1988 Del Mar Derby winner, and Mister Wonderful II, winner of the American  Handicap at Hollywood Park July 4. Silver Circus will carry top weight of only  118 pounds, giving Mister Wonderful II a pound.  </P> <P> Richard Mandella trains the English-bred Mister Wonderful II for Santa Monica  car dealer Steven Taub. The American Handicap marked the first U.S. stakes  victory in 10 starts for the 6-year-old son of Mummy's Pet.  </P> <P> Mandella, who is having his finest season, took over the training of Mister  Wonderful II in January. His first challenge was an injured hoof.  </P> <P> "He was just getting over a quarter crack when he came to us," said Mandella.  "They had to cut out a pretty good chunk, and it took some time to grow back."  </P> <P> Mandella decided to bring Mister Wonderful II back to the races in a  six-furlong Breeders' Cup-sponsored event on the Hollywood Park turf course  June 25, even though the horse had not sprinted since he was a 3-year-old in  England. Mister Wonderful II finished a fast-closing third, then trotted back  to be unsaddled, bleeding profusely from the mouth.  </P> <P> "He bit his tongue," Mandella said. "Not bad but, boy, was there a lot of  blood. He probably didn't even notice it until the race was over."  </P> <P> In the American Handicap eight days later, Mister Wonderful II won at odds of  10-1, beating Steinlen by a nose at 1 1/8 miles. Pranke, who won the Sunset  Handicap in his next appearance, finished a close third.  </P> <P> "We weren't surprised he won," Mandella noted. "He'd shown us his quality  already. We were a little surprised that he came around so fast, though."  </P> <P> Besides Mister Wonderful II and Silver Circus, the Eddie Read field features  Saratoga Passage, The Medic, Pasakos, Skip Out Front, Halcyon Days and Quiet  Boy.  </P> <P> Mandella has a solid shot to sweep Del Mar's Sunday stakes doubleheader. He  will be sending out Robert Folsom's 3-year-old filly, Reluctant Guest, in the  supporting feature, the $100,000 San Clemente Handicap at one mile on the  grass.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> In the $83,650 Escondido Handicap at 1 3/8 miles today, Charlie Whittingham  will run Bruce McNall's filly, Raintree Renegade, against Danishgar, Loyal  Double, Brisque, Blade of the Ball, Foolhearty, Wallotton, Putting, Dance Card  Filled and Pleasant Variety. . . . The top stable for 2-year-olds this summer  belongs to trainer Brian Mayberry and his prime patrons, Jan, Mace and Samantha  Siegel. On Wednesday at Del Mar, their Barachois colt, Doyouseewhatisee, won  the six-furlong De Anza Stakes by three lengths. It was the Siegels' fourth  local juvenile winner, and they have had three more in Florida running in Jan's  name. . . . It has been raining off and on in Chicago, and that is fine with  Thad Ackel, who will send out Great Communicator against Blushing John today in  the Arlington Handicap, a prep for the Arlington Million Sept. 3. "He doesn't  have to necessarily win to please me," said Ackel. "But he's got to come away  from there running and keep on going." . . . Bedouin, one of the most popular  claimers ever to run in Southern California, will be paraded after the second  race today at Del Mar. The gray 8-year-old won 14 of 67 starts and ran 15th in  the 1984 Kentucky Derby.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Italian Christian Democratic leader </F> Ciriaco De Mita by Federico Geremicca in Rome on 16 February:  "De Mita Is Bitter: Martinazzoli Has Betrayed Me"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Geremicca] Is it true that you  will run all the same, on your own ticket, in Irpinia?    [De Mita] I know that they are saying this, that some people  are afraid that I will. But I reply no. It is as if an editor  were to decide to set up a completely new newspaper on his own.  It is an option which does not appeal to me. I know others will  do this. But finally, everyone has his own past to bear.    [Geremicca] But is it not true that you have thought about  it, and that you are thinking about it, and that there are  people asking you to take such a step?    [De Mita] I'm thinking about it. There are people who say  that I ought to do so, but frankly I do not know. Moreover,  look, I am handling this matter with a great degree of  detachment. It is true that the deluded and angry people from  the left of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] could have  banded together, and I would note that there are many of them  around in Italy. But we have not done this, and there is now no  longer time to do so. And it seems to me that the left of the  DC no longer exists. And if, on the other hand, it does exist,  then it is this which should constitute the Italian Popular  Party [PPI].    [Geremicca] So, you are not forming your own party. What are  you going to do then?    [De Mita] I am organizing myself.    [Geremicca] What do you mean, excuse me?    [De Mita] I mean that I am remaining in the PPI, but I am  going into opposition against everything. I can put it in  writing, explaining, however, that running as a candidate has  nothing to do with this, because Mino [Martinazzoli] knows how  things stand.    [Geremicca] And how do they stand?    [De Mita] We have spoken about this many times. I remember a  discussion with him sitting there, on the sofa where you are  sitting now. I had been the target of certain aggressive stands  taken by his colleagues, such as Formigoni and Buttiglioni, with  regard to electoral lists and people under investigation. I told  him that I was concerned about how the agreement with [Pact for  Italy leader] Segni was developing, and that I believed that it  was essential to retain our own ticket and identity. And then I  explained to him that, if there was a problem of needing new  blood, I could have stood down, but certainly not for the  reasons which these people were advancing. I told him also --  and there is an interview to prove it -- that if the agreement  with Segni went on to accentuate certain features, the  foundations were being laid for a rift between us.    [Geremicca] Which features are you referring to?    [De Mita] Let us tell the truth. They tried to strike off  the electoral list all the leaders of the left, whispering that,  if elected, we would push the party toward an agreement with the  progressives. This is offensive: If indeed this was our  objective, we would have gone into battle inside the PPI.  Therefore it is untrue. While it is true that, through the  candidate selection procedure, someone has tried to lay the  foundations for a future majority of the right. This is not the  PPI's original intention. The goal was to remain in the center  and put ourselves forward as holding the balance in the  postelection period. Look, if the problem was to win, to be in  a majority, then we might as well have allied ourselves directly  with the League and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, rather  then with Segni's indecipherable pact, which seems to me to be a  alignment of men without troops.    [Geremicca] Have you got it in for Segni, Martinazzoli, for  whom?    [De Mita] Segni, he is a journalistic invention. He has  followed a fairly interesting course, but without ever being  aware of what he was doing. And then his swaying between right  and left, his being first against and then with the DC, is proof  in itself of his failure to have the humility to stop for a  moment and think. Then, he has invented empty and dangerous  trivialities. He has said that his Pact is not interested in  future allies, but is aiming straight ahead, but without  explaining, however, where this straight ahead is going. He  repeats obsessively slogans of renewal and I say there is  nothing new about what he is saying at all. But frankly, I  already knew this about Segni, the fact is that I never thought  for a moment of running on his ticket.    [Geremicca] And whom did you not know about, about  Martinazzoli?    [De Mita] I believed that the relationship with  Martinazzoli was marked by great sincerity. He knew, for  example, that I was against the single ticket with the Pact and  the constitution of a single parliamentary group led, moreover,  by Segni, whom I do not think highly of. He knew that I was  inclined to examine the possibility of a commitment outside  parliament. My one request was that my integrity be safeguarded  and defended, and therefore the possibility of this commitment.  But he. Moro would have defined his approach as  "indifference." But today indifference is dangerous.  Unfortunately, in the behavior of this secretary I see a  certain capacity to reflect, but an absolute incapacity to  convert this into political initiative. He continues to  demonstrate an attitude of great pain. But nobody is obliged to  be in politics.    [Geremicca] So, troubled waters between you and the  secretary?    [De Mita] Yes, but he cannot say that I did not tell him. It  is a political problem, not a personal one. My running as a  candidate enters into it up to a certain point. It is  everything which he built up around it which has made me bitter.  If my name has to be used in order to maintain that the  electoral lists have been renewed, that there are no persons  under investigation, then I can't agree to that.    [Geremicca] But Mr. De Mita, you are under investigation!    [De Mita] I have nothing to do with certain stories. I have  spoken with all the magistrates with whom I had to speak. Some  of them almost apologized to me, and from the Turin public  prosecutor's office there was even a statement explaining that I  was not involved in any act of corruption. So, what are people  talking about? And in any event, I repeat, on this point the  problem is political. Because it is clear that Segni and certain  people in the PPI are looking solely to be in a majority and to  line up, after the election, with the reactionary bloc, with the  League and with Berlusconi in particular. People who are  feeding their election campaign more with superstitions, such as  anticommunism, than with political arguments.    [Geremicca] What people still do not understood is whether  you are saying goodbye to the PPI or not.    [De Mita] No, it is not a goodbye. I am staying in the PPI.  It is not a goodbye, but the opening of a battle against a  political direction which I find pretty dangerous. I have said  it: I shall organize myself. Even if I know that it is not easy  to organize oneself "against something" in a party which hardly  exists. I only hope that, having missed their target, certain  aggressive acts will cease, and that from now on I shall be  judged on the opinions which I express and the deeds which I  undertake.    [Geremicca] For whom will you be voting in the elections?    [De Mita] Whom do you want me to vote for? For the PPI.    [Geremicca] And you will take part in the election campaign?    [De Mita] I ought to say in public something which I said to  you. And frankly, perhaps it is not necessary.    [Geremicca] A final question. In Irpinia, many people have  protested about your being excluded from the lists. I would ask  you again, you are not having second thoughts, inventing your  own ticket and running in the election.    [De Mita] Yes, I know that there are protests. And on the  other hand, they have barely voted in the primaries. What do  you want me to say to them.... On Sunday I will go down, I  will call a meeting and I will explain how things stand. As for  my candidacy, no, I will not run outside the PPI.</p>

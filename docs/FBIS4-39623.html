			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 8 Jun -- Russia and Japan have confirmed the  common policy of the two countries of developing bilateral  relations and continuing talks on the territorial problem and  also their readiness to coordinate efforts in the matter of  settling the crisis situation regarding the DPRK nuclear  programme. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed at the  Russian department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry that this  was discussed at a brief meeting between Andrey Kozyrev, the RF  [Russian Federation] foreign minister, and Nobuo Matsunaga,  special representative of the Japanese Government to the  international talks, which were held in Paris today. They are  taking part in a session of the Organisation of Economic  Cooperation and Development, which is being held in the French  capital.    The Japanese representative noted that a certain amount of  progress has been achieved in advancing the political and  economic dialogue between the two neighbouring countries since  the visit by Boris Yeltsin, the RF president, to Tokyo and  stressed the need for the further development of  Russian-Japanese ties on the basis of the "Tokyo declaration"  which was signed on the results of the summit in October 1993.    The Russian minister confirmed the invitation for Tsutomu  Hata, the Japanese prime minister, to make an official visit to  Moscow this year. However, according to the Japanese Foreign  Ministry staffer, the sides did not touch on the issue of  specific dates for the possible trip.</p>

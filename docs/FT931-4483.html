			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Heinz shares slip on revised earnings-per-share forecast SHARES in HJ Heinz, the Pittsburgh-based food group, dipped by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/8 yesterday after the company warned that earnings per share in the year to end-April would total about Dollars 2.50. Analysts, guided by the company, had been predicting around Dollars 2.60 until recently. The company blamed the reduced earnings forecast on 'dramatic currency fluctuations caused by the withdrawal of the UK and Italy from the (exchange rate mechanism of the) European Monetary System, sustained marketing expenditures in certain select markets, and unusually adverse weather conditions affecting Weight Watchers meeting operations.' In the previous 12 months, it saw after-tax profits of Dollars 638.3m and earnings per share of Dollars 2.40. Profits in 1991-92, however, were lifted by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 221.5m, resulting from the sale of the Hubinger business. The revised earnings prediction implies a 30 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings per share and would still leave the company's profits at an all-time high. It came as Heinz posted after-tax profits of Dollars 162.3m in the third quarter to January 27, against Dollars 115.3m in the same period of 1991-92. Sales increased to Dollars 1.77bn from Dollars 1.62bn and earnings per share rose from 43 to 62 cents. Heinz attributed the third-quarter improvement to the 9 per cent increase in sales, of which 3 per cent came from volume gains, 2 per cent from price increases, and 7 per cent from the acquisition of the Wattie business in New Zealand; the benefits of a restructuring programme last year; and a reduced tax rate. The tax charge in the third quarter was Dollars 85m (Dollars 65.8m). The third-quarter results, however, still leave after-tax profits for the first nine months of the year down to Dollars 460.3m, from Dollars 492.6m a year ago. Sales stood at Dollars 5.07bn, compared with Dollars 4.71bn.</p>

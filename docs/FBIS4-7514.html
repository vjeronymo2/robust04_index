			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman granted an  interview to a group of foreign journalists, including  journalists from Associated Press, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR  and DIE ZEIT, in the presidential palace in Zagreb this evening.    Replying to their questions, President Tudjman spoke about  the cease-fire agreement reached between representatives of the  local Serbs from the occupied Croatian areas and the Republic of  Croatia, the Washington agreement, the overcoming of the crisis  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the causes of the Greater Serbian  aggression and its tragic consequences for Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Now that we signed an agreement on the normalization of  relations with Belgrade and the cease-fire agreement with the  Serbs in UN protected areas in Croatia, a process of reopening  roads and telecommunications should begin. At the same the  rebuilding of trust between the Croatian authorities and the  Serbs from these areas who were dragged into conflicts with the  Croatian authorities by the former communist Yugoslav army  should begin, President Tudjman said in reply to a question of  what he expected from the cease-fire agreement.    By the gradual normalization of relations, President Tudjman  said, we will try to restore trust to carry out elections for  the local Serb self-administration in two counties in which they  make up a majority. In the beginning we would like to create  conditions for the return of more than 250,000 refugees,  wherever it is possible, the president stressed, expressing the  hope this would be possible to achieve gradually and through  negotiations.    As regards the possibility of restoring economic ties,  President Tudjman stressed that some Serbs from the UN protected  areas a year ago signed an agreement with the Croatian  authorities after which they were arrested by Serb extremists.  We were called on to restore trade links and to normalize  relations by the people from all Serb-held areas, even from  Banja Luka, the Croatian president said. In the final phase the  Croatian policy and that pursued by the Western countries  coincided. That is the basis for the partnership between Croatia  and the Western world, particularly the United States, President  Tudjman said in reply to a question of whether the Washington  agreement and the cease-fire agreement were a result of a  turnabout in the Croatian policy or were a result of pressure  coming from the West.    We wish to reintegrate the UN protected areas into the  constitutional and legal system of Croatia in a peaceful way.  If our efforts and those made by the United States and Russia  did not bear fruit, Croatia would not be able to bear the  present situation for ever, President Tudjman said, stressing  that, in the light of the international situation, Serbia would  have to agree to the normalization of relations.</p>

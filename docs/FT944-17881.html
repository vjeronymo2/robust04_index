			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Rival group may challenge milk levy plan A rival milk group threatened yesterday to launch a legal challenge to the Milk Marketing Board if it went ahead with plans to charge Britain's 28,000 dairy farmers up to 4p per litre to provide the funding for market liberalisation in November. Mr Richard Smith, chairman of the Northern Milk Partnership, which represents a group of farmers who have agreed to sell their milk to Northern Foods in the new free market, said he was examining ways in which any attempt to deduct money from his members could be resisted through the UK and European courts. Mr Smith, who has written in protest to Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, called by the Milk Marketing Board suggestion of the levy 'astonishing and, if implemented, nothing short of disgraceful'. The milk board needs about Pounds 30m to wind up its operations and establish Milk Marque, the voluntary farmers' co-operative that will succeed it. It said yesterday that the probability of the levy being imposed was minute, but that it had to have funds to hand should guarantees from its banks not come through in time for market deregulation on November 1. But all farmers would be expected to pay the levy, even if they had no plans to join Milk Marque. Mr Smith said it was 'iniquitous' that the 30 per cent of producers who had made alternative arrangements for selling their milk should be forced to pay. He said it would cost his members about Pounds 2,000 each. The National Farmers' Union said it was extremely concerned about the possibility that the money would not be repaid. Sir David Naish, union president, is to meet Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the board, on Monday to discuss the issue. The board needs to raise cash to finance the market's deregulation because the flotation of its processing arm, Dairy Crest, has been delayed. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of the board, said farmers who had not signed up with Milk Marque should still be prepared to pay the levy as it would guarantee the free market going ahead from November 1 which was in everyone's interests.</p>

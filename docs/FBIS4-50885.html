			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Opinion" page: "Time To Stop Petty </F> Bickering"]    [Text] The long-running saga of the airport talks has been  a tale of woe from the beginning. And the end is nowhere in  sight.    Anyone looking to the latest Joint Liaison Group's (JLG)  Airport Committee meeting for a display of Sino-British harmony  was bound to be bitterly disappointed...again.    The two sides apparently made some progress on the disposal  of land around the airport rail link, but they haven't been able  to solve the overall problem.    It was a moment that captured, in one anguished sentence,  all  the frustrations of a weary negotiator.    As he emerged from yesterday's three-hour session, British  senior JLG representative Hugh Davies said: "I can't say we  made as much progress as we would have liked...we are  disappointed."    The sterile and fruitless wrangling between Beijing and  London must provide a powerful sense of deja vu for all  concerned, including the long-suffering people of this  territory. Never have so many been so frustrated for so long by  so much petty bickering and backbiting.    A glimpse into our files reveals a constant repetition of  such words as "impasse", "deadlock", "stalemate" and  "frustration" in news stories about the talks.    It would be easy to predict that the standoff will continue  until the political row is settled. It is tempting to suggest  that the feeling of injury in the senior Chinese leadership is  preventing them from striking an agreement.    It is equally tempting to submit that -- in view of Hong  Kong's massive annual surpluses -- the British side could reduce  the level of debt to a point that China would have to accept.    But we have no wish to apportion blame. Will and vision have  been in short supply on both sides.    It's time they both looked at the bigger picture,  irrespective of their political differences. It is time to get  on with the job. That is what the people of Hong Kong want.    They know that each delay costs millions of dollars. They  are tired of watching Beijing and London locking horns and  playing power games while this huge, complex and specialised  project is mired down in unrelated political debate.    There are any number of other crucial transitional issues  hanging in the balance: Special Administrative Region (SAR)  passports, the question of extradition treaties, the right of  abode in Hong Kong after 1997 and averting a legal vacuum in the  territory after the change of sovereignty.    There are many laws that will have to be updated to fit in  with the Basic Law when Hong Kong is no longer under the British  Constitution.    This is crunch time. There are only three years to go. We  must have an airport. Both sides must get their acts together  and get on with it.</p>

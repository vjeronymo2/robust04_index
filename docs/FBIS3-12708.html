[koranic verse] Prayers and peace be upon our master Muhammad  and all his kin and companions. In these blessed days all our  people from al-Maharah to Sa'dah are hoping for an end to the  crisis that has affected every aspect of our lives and  aggravated our people's pain and suffering. Our people have been  waiting for their political leaders to return to attend to their  duties and for state agencies to fulfill their Constitutional  tasks and carry out the accord document after it was signed in  Amman on 10 Ramadan [20 February].    Thus, our patient people are surprised by the military  movements and the incidents that have sparked off the crisis  anew and threatened the unity, security, and stability of the  homeland. These incidents were orchestrated as a device to  weasel out of the responsibility for implementing the provisions  of the accord document and then to drift to only God knows what  fate.    The higher council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping has been  following these developments and the irresponsible media hype  about them. It contacted official circles with the aim of  bringing the situation under control and keeping irresponsible  actions from getting out of hand. The higher council condemns  these regrettable incidents that can only harm the homeland and  the citizens and play into the hands of the haters of the  homeland's unity, security, and stability. It calls on all the  parties to be equal to their religious, national, and historic  responsibilities and work toward bringing these incidents to an  end and ensuring that they do not recur. The council calls for  the relocation of all military units to their positions and for  the Armed Forces to be kept out of political and party disputes.  This is in order for them to remain a source of strength for  the homeland and a shield for the country's sovereignty and  independence and the community's security and welfare and to be  kept unaffected by political considerations and narrow party  interests.    The council calls on all political forces and the citizens  from all walks of life to exercise vigilance and not allow  themselves to be drawn into any actions that may hurt the  homeland or its unity. It also calls for forestalling the  advocates of sedition who do not care for the well-being of the  Yemeni people and are used to living in a climate of bloody  conflict and deception and breaking promises and breaching  charters.    The higher council calls on the competent authorities to  speed up the enquiry into the incidents and name those who were  responsible and disclose facts to the people lest they remain at  the mercy of internal and external misinformation. We pray that  God keep our country and people and spare us all [word  indistinct] and lead us all to all that is good and our leaders  to the right ways.</p>

The four-nation working party recently surveyed the new  navigation route along the upper Mekong River slated to be open  for cargo and passenger ships. The working party studying the  feasibility of navigation said the new route is suitable from a  southern town in China through Myanmar [Burma] and Laos to  Chiang Saen and Chiang Khong Districts in Chiang Rai Province.    Director General of the Department of Engery Affairs Prathet  Sutabut said the opening of the new navigation route will  benefit the four countries in communications, transportation,  and tourism. The new project is part the Quadrangle Economic  Cooperation Plan among Thailand, Laos, Myanmar [Burma], and  southern China.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Inequalities of intelligence tests Sir, Michael Prowse's example of new thinking from the US research establishment ('The genetic threat to capitalism', June 29) is as old as the think-tank recyclings he rightly dismisses. The argument that stripping away imposed privilege creates discontent, by making those lower down the hierarchy feel responsible for their plight, was fully explored by Michael Young in his 1958 essay, 'The Rise of the Meritocracy'. The really frightening aspect of stratification by IQ scores is that measured intelligence relates so loosely to demonstrated ability (though in Young's classic, merit is a combination of IQ and effort). No one has yet devised an intelligence test that does not rely on knowledge that is environmentally determined, therefore unequally available. So, as anyone who uses banks, word processing software or dispensing machines is aware, intelligence among the masses remains vital to cope with the technical limitations of the elite.

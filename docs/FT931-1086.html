			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Greater transparency likely in French privatisation programme Sir, I would like to offer a few comments on William Dawkins' excellent article on French privatisation ('Assault on the state frontiers', March 16). The commission on privatisation - which he doesn't mention - will play a far more important role than in 1986 and operate with greater transparency and full independence. It will not only fix minimum prices for companies to be privatised but also select the 'noyaux durs' so that the government cannot be accused, as in 1986, of unduly favouring its supporters. The privatisation programme will most probably be in two stages: in the first two years ending with the presidential elections of 1995 the most likely candidates are Rhone-Poulenc, Elf-Aquitaine, AGF (Assurances Generales de France), Renault, in that order, and it is doubtful whether the first privatisation could be effected before October 1993. In the second, post-1995 stage, depending on the result of the presidential elections, the success of the first tranche and the buoyancy of the stock market, it is probable that the government will gradually open up the capital of some public monopolies such as France Telecom or EDF to private capital while maintaining a controlling interest.

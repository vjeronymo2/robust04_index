			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Kantor warns of trade review by Washington THE Clinton administration is reviewing a number of US trade positions, including the Airbus agreement reached with the EC last summer to limit government support, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday. 'It is a new day and a new administration,' he said. The administration would be assessing whether or not to proceed on the path set by its predecessors or to 'change course'. On many issues it is likely to change. Last week President Bill Clinton raised the issue of Airbus when answering a question in a televised 'town hall meeting' in Seattle. 'The Europeans are going to have to quit subsidising Airbus,' he said. 'I'm not going to roll over and play dead.' Mr Kantor said both sides had the option to withdraw from the Airbus agreement. It was supposed to have been 'multilateralised' by summer. On other issues, Mr Kantor said the US and EC might hold meetings with Japan as a way to get the Uruguay Round international trade talks moving and that US, Mexican and Canadian trade officials would meet during the week of March 15 to discuss side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement. This was agreed in talks yesterday between Mr Kantor and Mr Jaime Serra Puche, his Mexican counterpart. During the meeting Mr Kantor put intense pressure on the Mexican government to withdraw from a fund which was advertising its intent to attract US businesses to Mexico. National Financiers (Nafinsa), a Mexican development bank, was one of the limited partners in the AmeriMex Fund, which has issued a brochure advertising its intention to buy US companies and then move 'a portion or all of the manufacturing operations . . . to Mexico to take advantage of savings in the cost of labour'. Mr Serra told Mr Kantor he knew nothing about the brochure. Shortly after they met he called the trade representative to say Nafinsa would withdraw its investment from the fund. The fund had drawn fire from Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, who wrote to Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari saying such funds should not be allowed to operate. Mr Kantor praised the swift Mexican action, saying he was 'impressed by it and pleased'. The side agreements are to deal with labour, the environment and import surges. Mr Kantor said the development of enforcement mechanisms was vital, as was finding a way to address labour standards so that businesses did not flee south of the border to evade US rules.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Not quite running like clockwork: On the eve of the white paper on BR's future, Richard Tomkins discovers why privatisation might be slow to bring improvements to some lines AT 100MPH, to parody the famous Rolls-Royce advertisement, the only sound you can hear in the driver's cab of a London-Birmingham InterCity express is the ticking of the clock. Apart, that is, from the roar of the 4,040 horsepower electric traction motors, the ferocious rattling of the windows, the howling of the wind, the ear-splitting clanging of bells and whooping of Klaxons indicating favourable or adverse signals, and the sound of your own voice bellowing faintly ridiculous questions at the driver. 'Do you enjoy your job?' 'Yes, I like driving trains,' shouts back Euston-based Mr Harry Finn. 'I always have done. But I was much happier in the steam days. It was a different job then.' 'Why?' 'It's hard to explain,' he yells. 'In those days, with the steam engines, you made your own power. Now it's just handed to you.' This locomotive, number 86248, is more comfortable than any steam engine can have been. Even so, it is a draughty, battered old thing. Built 27 years ago by English Electric at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, it is nearing the end of its working life. At 100mph, its bucking and yawing puts the quality of the ride in the white-knuckle league. It is not just the locomotive. Everything about the west coast main line from London Euston to Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester is clapped out. There will be no private-sector interest in running a line like this in its present state. So, with or without privatisation, InterCity is going to need Pounds 750m of government money to put the line back to rights: and it is trying to draw attention to its cause. Seen from this perspective, the morning has started well. This particular train was supposed to have left Euston at 08.10. However, the carriages of the previous Birmingham train turned out to be defective and ours have been hijacked to replace them. Another set of coaches is found for the 08.10, but not in time. We leave eight minutes late, and having missed our departure slot we have to take a slow line out of Euston, costing us another minute or two. Inside the cab Mr David Teasdale, a Euston-based traction inspector who is acting as guide, is not optimistic about making good the delay. 'The timings are so tight these days that you've virtually got to go flat out all the way just to keep up,' he says. There is no chance of that for the 08.10. Normal top speed on the west coast main line is 110mph, but much of the rolling stock on the route is too old to go that fast. In our case, both locomotive and coaches are limited to 100mph. Worse, we have not been going many miles before we run into the first of several speed restrictions: a long stretch of 60mph running at Watford because of signalling repairs and track relaying. Theoretically, the timetable allows for this sort of setback. 'But there's so much engineering work on this line that you need more recovery time than they allow,' says Mr Teasdale. By the time we pull into Milton Keynes we are 13 minutes behind schedule. The passengers have been getting restless. A railman comes up to the cab window and shouts: 'Here's a silly question: someone wants to know why you're late.' Mr Finn delivers an earthy riposte. 'Typical,' he says afterwards. 'It's never the driver's fault, but we always gets the blame.' In the end, an unusually smooth passage through the busy lines into Birmingham New Street enables the 08.10 to claw back some of the lost time. We arrive six minutes late - enough to irritate the passengers, but not enough to count in the statistics. The minimum for an official late arrival is 10 minutes. At the west coast main line headquarters outside New Street station, Mr Ivor Warburton, route director, says delays like this - and often worse - are symptomatic of the ageing infrastructure. The line from Euston to Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester was modernised in the early 1960s. Thirty years later the equipment is at the end of its expected lifespan. Signal failures, for example, are commonplace, causing failsafe systems to halt the trains; overhead power cables are worn down to a third of their original size; the power supply system, originally designed for 90 mph running, is at the limit of its potential; the track is worn out; and the 1960s rolling stock is due for renewal. If the government would just let Mr Warburton have Pounds 750m, he would not only fix the line but upgrade it. By straightening out some of the curves, relaying the track, installing a modern signalling system and buying new trains, he could raise the line speed to 125mph and cut the London-Manchester travel time of 2 1/2 hours by 40 minutes. That would give the airlines a run for their money, without the need for spending up to Pounds 5bn on a French-style high-speed line. Afterwards we go to look at the signal box at New Street station. It is one of the busiest in the country, controlling the network of InterCity and suburban lines converging on Birmingham. But like everything else about the west coast main line, it is of 1960s vintage. Most of the equipment would look more at home in a science museum. The main feature of the control room is a vast panel carrying a diagram of the railways running in and out of Birmingham. It is covered with buttons and flashing lights. Some of the lights show where the trains are; numerical codes light up to describe which train is which; and the buttons enable the controllers to send the trains in the right direction. Ludicrously, we have only been there for a few minutes when the train describers fail. This sets the scene for rich farce, since it leaves the controllers with no way of knowing which train is supposed to go in which direction. The controllers, however, have evidently been here before: grabbing pads of yellow notelets, they hurriedly scrawl the numerical codes on them and start sticking them up on the board next to the appropriate trains. Soon, the diagram is covered with confetti. Calm is restored: but it would only take one good puff of wind through the open window to blow all the bits of paper away and paralyse the Birmingham rail network. Suddenly, someone in blue dungarees appears from behind the panel. 'Sorry about that, lads,' he says, 'one of the power supply transformers has blown up.' Nobody looks surprised. It has all been very effective from a propaganda point of view. But the morning ends disastrously. The return train to London arrives on schedule; the carriages are clean and comfortable; lunch in the restaurant car is courteously served and delicious; and the train arrives precisely on time at Euston. That's just the trouble with the west coast main line; these days, you can't even rely on it to let you down.</p>

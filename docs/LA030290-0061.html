			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: THE MYSTIQUE THAT DRAWS THE PRESIDENTS  </P> <P> Drive past Palm Springs, going down the valley, and you will soon come to  Rancho Mirage. Turn left on the boulevard named for Frank Sinatra, keep going  to the intersection of Bob Hope Drive, and then you will see it.  </P> <P> Actually, you won't see "it." What you will see are the armed guards, the  fences topped with three strands of barbed wire, and the rows of trees that are  designed to keep you from being witness to anything, great or small, that  happens within the confines of the Annenberg estate. Whatever secret qualities  made this place the San Simeon of its age are not for your eyes.  </P> <P> But the proof of its allure will be demonstrated again tonight. Catch the  evening news and you will see yet one more President of the United States  making his ritualized arrival at the gates. This time it will be the Bush  motorcade gliding down the boulevard, car lights blinking, little American  flags flying from the fenders. The limos will turn into the compound, the iron  gates will open, and the procession will disappear inside.  </P> <P> There is no other private residence in the world that performs this function.  Before Bush, Reagan came twice a year, before Reagan there was Ford and before  that there was Nixon. In between it was Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, who  tried to hit polo balls from a golf cart.  </P> <P> This time Bush has come to the estate to meet with the new Japanese prime  minister, Toshiki Kaifu. They will hold "trade talks," and maybe play a little  golf on the nine-hole course inside the estate. On Saturday the iron gates will  reopen, out will come the limos, and the Annenberg estate will settle back into  the quiet of the desert, its mystery intact.  </P> <P> We have watched this scene re-enacted so often on television that the Annenberg  estate has become part of the cultural background, almost invisible. Anchor  people say "Annenberg estate" the same way they say "Camp David." We do not  ask, anymore, why a Philadelphia millionaire would plop himself down in the  California desert and, more remarkable still, manage to have the world come to  his door rather than vice versa.  </P> <P> Sunnylands, it's called, and there is a story there. When Walter Annenberg  decided he wanted a place in the desert back in 1961, he did not simply buy  someone else's creation. He purchased 205 acres of raw sand at the edge of town  and set about transforming it to a private Arcadia.  </P> <P> He succeeded, probably beyond his own original vision. The golf course is said  to be one of the most handsome anywhere. When a first-time visitor came to play  several years ago, Annenberg instructed him not to bother replacing his own  divots. Sure enough, as the round began, the visitor noticed an Annenberg  retainer following the group at a discreet distance, retrieving each clump of  grass thrown into the air by their clubs.  </P> <P> It is said that inside the estate the only sounds come from the cormorants and  egrets nesting on the small lakes. In the main house hangs one of the foremost  art collections in the world. On a given evening you can walk to the dining  room and pass more Cezannes and Van Goghs than Sotheby's will see in a decade.  </P> <P> Even the water is special. When Annenberg bought the property, he realized that  his aquatic needs would be substantial, so he purchased the company that owned  the underground rights. Private wells now supply the swimming pool, the golf  course, the lakes and ponds.  </P> <P> Of course, mere luxury does not explain why this particular piece of real  estate has become a magnet for one President after another. There are many  billionaires, and many estates.  </P> <P> But there are not many contained universes. There are few places, no matter how  expensive, that can provide such a shield from the rest of us, the air of  mystery and seclusion, as these particular 205 acres. Once, when an aide to  former President Reagan was asked by a reporter why his boss spent so many  apparently blissful days at Sunnylands, he replied, "because you're not there,  and you can't get there."  </P> <P> Maybe that gets to the essence of Sunnylands. What we have here is a place,  planted in the sands of Rancho Mirage, that has the power to infuse its guests  with the trappings of royalty. Outside there may be murder and mayhem in the  streets, but inside there is Arcadia and peace. A place where the normal rules  don't apply.  </P> <P> A neat trick, if you are Walter Annenberg. So neat that Presidents and princes  can't resist, and the limos continue to line up, one after the other.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> KUSCH FINALLY WINS HOBBY STOCK TITLE AT SAUGUS SPEEDWAY  </P> <P> On a slightly chilly Saturday night at Saugus Speedway, Hobby Stock driver Jim  Kusch of Sepulveda felt the warming cloak of a long-awaited championship.  </P> <P> After eight years of racing in the Hobby Stock division at Saugus -- "Since its  inception," Kusch said -- all he had to do to sew up the 1990 points  championship was, basically, show up.  </P> <P> Well, of course he had to get into his car and start the engine and even bring  it out for the oval main, but that was about all that was needed for Kusch to  claim the final title of the 1990 season.  </P> <P> Kusch, 39, who entered the night 24 points ahead of Jim Gunnarson of Reseda,  clinched the title with a fourth-place finish in the Hobby Stock oval before a  crowd of 3,251.  </P> <P> "I owe it to these two men," the affable Kusch said in the pits, pointing to  crew members Rip Michels and Dave Moak.  </P> <P> Kusch, whose previous high finish in the points standings was fourth place,  credited Michels with working different spring combinations on his ride and  praised Moak, the mechanic who "likes to get his hands greasy."  </P> <P> The worst-case scenario for Kusch -- that Gunnarson would win both main events  and he himself not finish in the top 12 in either -- was erased with the  running of the oval main.  </P> <P> Kusch said he plans to take next year off and let Moak take a turn behind the  wheel. Then, in 1992, Kusch plans to cruise a Street Stock ride that he will  build next year.  </P> <P> In other events, Bob Vigil of Lancaster won the Hobby Stock oval 25-lap main  event.  </P> <P> Steve Kellick of Bakersfield ran away with the three-quarter midget main event,  passing Kara Hendrick of Upland on Lap 13 of the 20-lapper and not looking  back. Kellick, who won the main event the last time the three-quarters raced at  Saugus in July, actually passed Kendrick on Lap 12 of the race, but had to  return to second place on a yellow flag. He passed her almost immediately after  the restart.  </P> <P> Mini-stock points champion Garrett Yamada finished his season with yet another  main-event win in a six-lapper.  </P> <P> In the tightest race of all, Kerry Mulligan of Granada Hills finished ahead of  Richard Smith of Reseda in the 15-lap figure-eight to sew up the 1990 Jalopy  division points championship.  </P> <P> Coming into the evening, Mulligan held a three-point edge over Smith.  </P></p>

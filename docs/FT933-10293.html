			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Jordanian link probed in Iraqi antiques theft PART OF a private collection of antiques worth millions of pounds taken from Kuwait by the Iraqis during their seven-month occupation of the emirate has turned up at Sotheby's, the international art dealers, in London. British police who have informed the Foreign Office and other European colleagues through Interpol, believe the antiques may belong to a collection of Islamic art looted from the villa in Kuwait City of Mr Yasim Homaizi, a businessman. European police forces are investigating the possibility that Jordan may have been used as a diversionary route for the antiques. Kuwaiti officials said last night that leading members of the Iraqi government were being forced to try to sell antiques they had stolen on the international market because of an increasing shortage of hard currency. According to information reaching Kuwait City, Iraqi soldiers have been transporting lorry loads of priceless items in recent months to the Iraqi-Jordanian border where they are handed over to middlemen. When the Iraqi occupation ended in 1991, the Homaizi collection - containing manuscripts, carpets, metal work and pottery - was included in an official claim against Iraq for compensation which was channelled through the United Nations. As a result of UN pressure, Iraq returned antiques belonging to the Kuwaiti royal family which had been housed in the national museum. But the Homaizi antiques, one of the world's biggest private collections of Islamic art, were not returned. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until a few months ago, when Sotheby's received a package for auction from Amman containing a 12th-13th century brass candle-stick which it subsequently identified as part of the missing Homaizi collection. In London, police confirmed yesterday that they had arrested a man, believed to be a Jordanian, in connection with some Dollars 400,000 worth of antiques. It is understood that the arrest follows the identification of further Kuwaiti antique items which have been routed to London via Amman. Sotheby's is a founder of the computerised International Art Loss Register, set up to alert dealers around the world to suspected stolen goods. Emerging details on the whereabouts of the Kuwaiti antiques is likely to bring embarrassment to the Jordanian government. It comes against a background of reports that Jordan was used as a diversionary route for stolen goods and arms during and after the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. Sotheby's specialist knowledge of the Kuwait collection dates back to 1991 when it agreed to help Mr Yasim Homaizi in drawing up an inventory and pricing the missing items. A list was based on photographs and records which Mr Homaizi had kept with him while living in exile during the Iraqi occupation. The items that turned in London are to be returned to Mr Homaizi. Yesterday, Sotheby's refused to give details of the prices involved, although it confirmed that the collection ran into 'millions of pounds.' The candle-stick was one of the most valuable items, equivalent in price, according to a Sotheby's expert, 'to a Rembrandt'.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Brussels delay on export credits The European Commission is to delay until autumn a decision on rules for short-term export credits, in an attempt to meet British objections that its draft regulations would unfairly jeopardise the UK system. The Commission had been expected to publish the rules this month. However, Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, agreed to the delay after a meeting last week with Mr Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister. But though Mr Van Miert is to reconsider the commission's approach, observers are unsure if it will be technically or politically possible to find a compromise which satisfies all sides. The proposed rules, which the Commission has the authority to impose, are intended to prevent unfair competition by clamping down on government subsidies. The rules would apply to 'marketable' risks, defined by Brussels to include all commercial risks within countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development except Turkey. Britain objects that a proposed ban on state reinsurance of 'marketable' risks could threaten its government's policy of financing, through the Export Credit Guarantee Department, a small portion of the country's short-term credit reinsurance exposure. UK credit insurers, such as the Dutch-owned NCM group, say the policy brings valuable stability by cushioning the risk of sudden shortages in reinsurance capacity. However, the UK complains that because the system does not distinguish between commercial and political risks, the Brussels proposals would create unnecessary confusion and could lead to complete withdrawal of government support. Britain also denies that the government financing constitutes a subsidy. The UK is particularly incensed because, it says, it has already moved far to meet the commission's overall objectives by privatising ECGD's short-term export credits business three years ago. Brussels has sought a compromise which would enable the UK arrangements to continue temporarily. But Britain has rejected the offer, insisting the proposed rules must recognise its system as permanent. That demand, however, is opposed by France, Belgium and Spain. They argue that anything less than a total ban on state reinsurance would leave open a loophole for unfair subsidies.</p>

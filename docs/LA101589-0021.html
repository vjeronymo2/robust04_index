			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHSTYLE: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> NOTES ON A HIGH TECH DESK, AND GARDEN AND ANIMAL EVENTS;  </P> <P> EXECUTIVE WORKBENCH  </P> <P> IN THE MOVIE "Wall Street," the bad-guy financier, played by Michael Douglas,  masterminds his leveraged buyouts while seated at a Burdick Group desk.  Actually, it's not so much a desk as a desk system -- the first of a new  furniture breed, the executive workbench.  </P> <P> About 1975, San Francisco-based designer Bruce Burdick foresaw the implications  the desktop computer, poised to invade the executive office, would pose. For  starters, it meant a nightmare in wire management, what with communications and  power cables. So Burdick conceived the idea of a horizontal raceway standing a  few feet off the floor to conceal the wires.  </P> <P> The raceway also acts like the track in track lighting. It supports components  that snap into place along its length without tools, thereby allowing the desk  to be personalized and reconfigured instantly. Components can be endlessly  daisy-chained. They include a desktop-like work surface, computer and printer  stands, bookends, letter trays, and drawers and filing cabinets. Not to mention  a credenza-like attachment with a hutch for working at a typewriter, a round  glass top big enough for impromptu conferences, and a tool caddie analogous to  an roll-top desk with cubbyholes for pads, pencils and Rolodex.  </P> <P> The top surfaces come in glass, wood, laminate and marble. Glass is the most  popular because users invariably enjoy looking at the Burdick's elegant  superstructure.  </P> <P>  Typical Burdick Group systems retail for $2,000 to $15,000, depending on  configuration. At Herman Miller Office Pavilion in Irvine (714) 975-8700, and  Herman Miller Inc. in the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles (213) 659-7600.  </P></p>

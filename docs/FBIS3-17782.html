			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Smirnov report: "Cooperation Ministry </F> Consolidates its Positions. Ministry Gets Government Support"]    [Text] Officially circulated yesterday was a Russian  Federation Government decree, "Questions of the Russian  Federation Ministry on Cooperation with Member States of the  Commonwealth of Independent States." The Ministry on  Cooperation with the CIS Member States has received a stable  material base in the shape of personnel, financial support, and  buildings. Besides, until provisions on the Ministry of  Cooperation with the CIS Member States have been approved, the  government decree will provide the legal basis for the  ministry's operation.    The Russian Federation State Committee on Economic  Cooperation with Member States of the Commonwealth  (Goskomsotrudnichestvo) was formed in late 1991. One of the  committee's prerogatives, as it was steadily gaining in  influence, was defending Russia's interests in matters of  cooperation with former Union republics. As of last fall, the  committee took up the problems of restoring Russia's trade and  economic links with countries of the former Council for Mutual  Economic Assistance for which purpose a special directorate was  created inside its apparatus. There was a valid reason for it:  before the CMEA's dissolution, the share of its participants in  Russia's foreign trade was 50 percent, and as little as 20  percent in 1993.    In forming an economic union of CIS countries (whose  founding  documents were signed in Moscow on 24 September 1993), the  Russian Committee on Economic Cooperation with Member States of  the Commonwealth was also virtually the only  coordination-consultative and expert organ having what in fact  were intergovernmental prerogatives because similar government  structures were not in place yet in the other CIS member  countries. Besides, one should take account of the fact that  the currently functioning Commonwealth organizational structure,  which includes councils of the heads of states and governments,  a coordination-consultative committee, and an executive  secretariat, has no bodies so far that regularly check up on the  observance of decisions made by the executive organs of the  economic union. The question of setting up an Interstate  Economic Council is only to be considered at the upcoming summit  in late April.    The committee's broader functions increased its status, with  the result that it was turned into a ministry early in 1994. At  the same time, its activities have not undergone appreciable  changes: the ministry remains a test ground (proceeding from the  priority of Russian interests) for various projects of  development of economic integration with a special stress on the  credit and finance sphere.</p>

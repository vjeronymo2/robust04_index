			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Reynolds set to meet Major Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, is expected to meet Mr John Major during a private visit to the UK next week. Sinn Fe'in's response to the Downing Street declaration is likely to be at the top of the agenda. Senior UK ministers will meet later today to finalise the government's response to the demand by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, for detailed clarification of the Anglo-Irish declaration. Amid pessimism in Whitehall about the prospects for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland, it was clear last night that the government would go no further than to restate the declaration's underlying principles. Ministers agreed that the government could not be seen to be 'sitting an examination paper' set by the IRA.</p>

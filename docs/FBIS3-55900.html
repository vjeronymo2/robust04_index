In his interview with INTERFAX he underlined that  "it is necessary to raise this question as soon as possible."  "I would like to see a strong Georgia which would be able to  defend itself and a step towards the ruble zone is a chance for  Georgia's real rescue," he emphasized.    Goguadze also declared that he positively assesses proposals  of several political functionaries to introduce Russian forces  into Georgia in order to bring order in the republic. At the  same time, he noted that "this should be done minding genuine  necessity."    Goguadze stated that cooperation with other countries "which  would not restrict Georgia's sovereignty is always acceptable."    The speaker stressed the necessity to render assistance to  Georgia's law enforcement bodies. "A policeman without money is  a potential criminal and that is why we need help so we can  bring order in the country," announced Goguadze.</p>

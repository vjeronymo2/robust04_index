			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- The communications sectors of  Siemens AG (Munich) are achieving 55 percent of the total  turnover in business with other countries. This was stated by  Erwin Hardt, a member of the Siemens board of directors, in a  talk to correspondents at the CeBit '94 fair in Hannover on  Wednesday evening [16 March]. New business continues to be weak  in Germany. In total, turnover in the 1993-94 business year  amounted to 13.3 (13.5) billion German marks [DM]. The special  economic development because of the new laender, which provided  strong stimuli for growth, is over. However, the strong  business abroad -- above all, Southeast Asia provides dynamic  stimuli -- cannot yet compensate for the weak domestic demand.    Siemens is attentively watching the extremely fast  developments of telecommunications, Hans Bauer, member of the  central board of governors of Siemens AG, noted. New market  conditions are developing because of progressive liberalization  and the pressure of international competition is rising. Price  also becomes a competitive factor that determines everything.  The annual price cuts of up to 20 percent can be compensated  only with larger shares in the world market. As a result of the  concentration process in the communications industry, it is to  be expected that only four or five world market companies with  their own system development will be left. Smaller companies,  on the other hand, still have good opportunities on the market  as flexible suppliers of special equipment.    According to Werner Schmuecking, member of the Siemens  Private Communications Systems (PN) sector board of directors,  the Siemens subsidiary Rolm in the United States is experiencing  a particularly successful development within the framework of  the strong increase on the international markets. In new  business, it has achieved a growth of 11 percent calculated on a  dollar basis. PN received orders in 1992-93 worth DM6 billion  and had a turnover of DM6.3 billion. In Germany, PN wants to  strongly expand the business with analogous and digital cordless  telephones. "This year we want to market 1 million cordless  telephones," Schmuecking said.</p>

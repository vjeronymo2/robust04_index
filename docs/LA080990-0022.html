			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY ACCUSED OF HINDERING SHELTER  </P> <P> Joining a controversy surrounding the county's only year-round homeless  shelter, Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn on Wednesday accused the city of  Oxnard of trying to undermine the Zoe Christian Center.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, representatives of the center maintained that city officials are  trying to close the homeless shelter while working to develop their own  city-run shelter.  </P> <P> He said Oxnard city officials were trying to undermine the Zoe Center. "I can't  give you any names, but I've talked to sources inside the city administration  and with council members, and I've heard that," Flynn said.  </P> <P> City officials deny the allegation but acknowledge that they have proposed a  joint-powers agreement with the Assn. of Ventura County Cities to develop and  operate a homeless shelter in Oxnard. The association is studying the proposal.  </P> <P> Flynn, whose district includes Oxnard, also urged the City Council to issue a  land-use permit to allow the center to continue operating at its current site.  </P> <P> City officials have refused to renew a land-use permit that expired last year  because they say the center is too close to a fertilizer company where toxic  chemicals are stored.  </P> <P> "I'd be concerned if it were unsafe," Flynn said, "but I've visited the site,  and the city's health concerns are just an excuse" to deny Zoe a permit.  </P> <P> Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> During a City Council meeting Tuesday, Zoe supporters produced an internal memo  by a senior city planner in Thousand Oaks stating that financial support of the  Zoe Center "may be a political liability" for the city in its dealings with  Oxnard.  </P> <P> Oxnard Housing Director Sal Gonzalez said the memo is inaccurate.

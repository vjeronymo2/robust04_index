			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Princedale in black with Pounds 0.39m PRINCEDALE Group, the USM-quoted marketing and design agency, stayed in the black in the second half to record its first annual profit since 1988. In the year ended September 30 1992 the group turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 389,000, against a loss of Pounds 431,000. Mr Stephen Bennett, chairman, described that as encouraging particularly as the market place was difficult. All three remaining operating units made a positive contribution. Turnover fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 12.8m because of the sale of companies. There were exceptional charges of Pounds 163,000 (Pounds 116,000) and a significantly reduced net interest payable of Pounds 68,000 (Pounds 192,000). Earnings per share were 0.08p (losses 0.11p).</p>

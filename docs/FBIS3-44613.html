			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China is to put  postgraduate courses under a uniform administration to ensure  the standards of master and doctorate degrees.    This was announced by a spokesman of the Academic Degrees  Committee under the State Council.    According to the spokesman, educational authorities will  keep  records and start a uniform control system over courses in  subjects ranging from finance, politics and law to management  and engineering.    He said that recently some universities and institutes had  rushed to start courses outside their range of accredited major  subjects and had started to award degrees without approval or  assessment by the educational authorities.    They set up so-called "new majors" and ran training classes  in coastal areas. To attract more students, they even accepted  unqualified ones.    Furthermore, the spokesman said, it had been discovered in  Beijing, Shandong Province and Liaoning Province that some  unauthorized units ignored the country's regulations and were  running postgraduate courses jointly with overseas colleges.    Most of these courses are not accredited to accept  postgraduates but merely aim at making money. They have no  entry examinations or necessary management system.    Some of them even confer overseas academic degrees, severely  disturbing China's normal postgraduate education and degree  awarding system, the spokesman pointed out.    He said that to stop the confusing situation, the Office of  the Academic Degrees Committee had issued a circular on the  administration of such postgraduate courses.    Foreign academic degree certificates awarded by unapproved  Sino- foreign educational units are not recognized in China, the  circular stipulates.    The spokesman stressed that, to ensure the quality of  degree-  holders, his office will organize experts at an appropriate time  to inspect and assess the educational quality of the courses.    He said that students already enrolled in courses who come  to  the end of their studies and apply for master degrees will be  strictly examined.    Units which ignore educational quality and run classes and  award degrees and graduate certificates illegally will be  seriously punished, he added.</p>

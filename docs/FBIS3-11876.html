			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Luisa Azpiazu] </F>   [Excerpts] Washington, 27 Mar (EFE) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus, who ran against Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria for the post of OAS secretary general, today  struck a discordant note in an assembly which, in the end,  congratulated itself for choosing "the best candidate."    Niehaus, who in fact congratulated Gaviria, who defeated him  20-14 in a secret vote, delivered one of the most resentful  speeches heard at the OAS within the past few years.    According to what EFE could confirm in the hallways,  although  the speech did not diminish the organization's satisfaction over  Gaviria's election, it took everyone by surprise, given the  harshness of its vocabulary and the severity of its criticism,  which at times teetered on being incredulously undiplomatic.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin termed Niehaus'  speech  "an emotional reaction," while, for instance, her Ecuadoran  colleague, Diego Paredes, considered it "unfair and hardly  elegant" and "a bad end to a good campaign."    Meanwhile, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  disputed  many of Niehaus remarks, recalling that "in a democracy, one  must learn how to lose." Di Tella said he believed that  Niehaus' criticism about being discriminated against "was  extremely harsh and cannot be accepted." Even so, Di Tella  stressed, "one must not place great importance on statements  made in the din of defeat."    According to one South American diplomat who asked to remain  anonymous, Niehaus "did not keep anything to himself, and, in  his attempt to shake the structures, no one escaped his  admonishment unscathed."    According to Niehaus, what occurred today "creates deep  doubts over the alleged right every state has to aspire to posts  within the inter-American system."    In his opinion, small countries "are denied access to the  post of secretary general." He affirmed that in the OAS "large  countries are first-class members, and, although they are fewer,  they feel they should impose their will and criteria on  countries they deem second-class members." This "hurts the  system," Niehaus continued.    Later, Niehaus accused some OAS member-nations of showing  "little respect" for the "commitments made" and, despite having  promised to support Costa Rica, "they did not honor their word  and integrity, without even having the consideration to advise  the Costa Rican Government they would withdraw their support."    Within this context, the Costa Rican foreign minister  assured  that within the OAS "it will be difficult to ever again believe  in a vote commitment." He added, "It is ironic that the OAS  dispatches electoral observers to every corner of the  hemisphere, and yet, within its own internal elections, it  cannot guarantee that ethics and respect for prior commitments  are observed."    Moreover, Niehaus went beyond simply criticizing OAS  member-states in general, and, while referring to the United  States without naming it, he contended it was "inadmissible and  regrettable" that there are countries that "disregard the most  basic respect for foreign decisions, devoting themselves to  exerting pressure and resorting to all kinds of mechanisms and  nuances to force others to swing their votes." [passage omitted]    Niehaus walked out of the room before the special assembly  presided over by Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa  concluded.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2219 GMT on 27 March  carries a 350-word report on the reaction of Costa Rican  officials to Cesar Gaviria's 27 March election as OAS general  secretary. Niehaus is quoted as saying in his speech that he  wants to "ask OAS member-nations to reflect seriously on some of  the issues that have come up in this election and what they  might signify for the future of the Inter-American system." He  says that the large member-nations of the OAS feel "it is their  duty to impose their will and criteria on those nations they  regard as second-class." NOTIMEX also says Niehaus "deplored  the fact that some countries `cast their votes overboard,'  alluding to those nations that initially voiced support for him  but later withdrew this support when it came time to vote."]</p>

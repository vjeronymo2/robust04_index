			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Managing health PLANS ANNOUNCED yesterday to slim down the management of the National Health Service in England should be seen as a tidying up of unfinished business rather than a further radical upheaval. Bureaucracy which has become unnecessary and wasteful following the government's health reforms of 1991 will be swept away. But the reorganisation of the NHS management structure leaves unresolved the problems of accountability of those who spend the enormous health budget. Certainly few will mourn the passing of the 14 regional health authorities, to be abolished as soon as legislative time can be found. The RHAs are a hangover from the command structure necessary to administer the health service before the 1991 reforms. In the new internal market, decisions over the purchase of health services are devolved, largely to district health authorities. The hospitals and community health services which provide treatment are increasingly managed by independent trusts. A regional tier of management can only attempt to second-guess the decisions of these purchasers and providers. Welcome too is the decision to encourage mergers between the district health authorities and the family health service authorities which administer the family doctor service. In the health service of the future, the distinction between the primary care currently provided by family doctors and the secondary care provided by hospitals will become increasingly irrelevant as more and more treatment is offered at local health centres. The new integrated purchasing bodies will be better able to assess local health needs and buy the most appropriate mix of services to meet those needs. However, it is regrettable that Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, has set her face against turning the NHS into an executive agency. Agency status would encourage a closer focus on managing the health service, with clear business targets and less interference from Whitehall. The reason Mrs Bottomley gives is that an agency would reduce parliamentary and public accountability. This is a strange argument to offer when the government has already created more than 80 agencies, all the while denying any loss of accountability. It is also rich coming from a government which refuses to address the problem of local accountability in the new decentralised NHS. The merged purchasing authorities will between them dispose of a budget of almost Pounds 30bn, more than half the amount spent by English local authorities. Yet their boards are made up of Whitehall appointees, with no direct accountability to the communities they serve. At the very least, they should be required to work closely with elected local authorities and to consult them on priorities. It would be better, however, if some of their board members were elected, either directly or indirectly through nomination of local authority councillors.</p>

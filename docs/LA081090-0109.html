			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOLS CONSIDERING SHIFT IN CONSTRUCTION  PRIORITIES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District is considering a shift in construction  priorities so that it will not lose $13.6 million in state funding that can  only be used for school renovations.  </P> <P> The financially strapped district may also try to recoup $18.6 million lost  last year when the district chose not to make renovations for which state money  was made available under a school construction and modernization bond issue.  </P> <P> District officials have said the priority given to new construction has left  the system without the staff to oversee renovations. But under a proposal  announced Thursday, the Board of Education will be asked on Monday to shift  construction priorities so that renovations at 52 schools can be undertaken.  </P></p>

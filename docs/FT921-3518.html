			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / High street sales continue their recovery A MODEST recovery in high-street sales continued for the seventh consecutive month in February, bringing sales to their best level for this period since late 1990, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'There has clearly been an underlying increase in retail trade since the summer of last year.' Although the figures looked promising, heavy snow this time last year distorted the year-on-year comparison upwards. Retailers also reported that in spite of improved sales they still considered stocks too high and were continuing to place fewer orders with suppliers. The sales volume of wholesalers showed less marked improvement and remained poor for the time of year. The results of the CBI's latest quarterly distributive trades survey, which covers more than 15,000 retail and wholesale outlets, found that sales among motor traders were below levels in February last year although there was an upward trend in sales of parts and accessories. Sales were most buoyant in clothing and shoe shops. Sales of durable household goods were down on a year ago but furniture, carpet, hardware and DIY stores said last month's trade was up on the previous year. While wholesalers and motor traders reported a reduction in import penetration over the year to February, retailers said the proportion of deliveries accounted for by imports continued to increase. Overall, retailers, wholesalers and motor traders expected the business situation to improve in the next three months. Investment intentions were less positive, with cuts in capital spending throughout most retailing sectors. Shoe shops, booksellers and specialist food retailers expect the sharpest falls in investment while chemists expect to invest most.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The impasse is over. The negotiating teams have  already resumed their talks, but only at the level of heads of  delegation. With the presence of the mediator and observers, the  heads of the government and UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] teams once again discussed UNITA's  Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel]. Agreement  has been reached, and tomorrow night the last day Vorgan will be  discussed. Should that be the case, the negotiators will begin  discussing UNITA's participation in government.    On 28 May the government sent a document to UNITA through  the  mediator, stating what ministerial and deputy ministerial  portfolios it would give that organization within the framework  of national reconciliation. To prevent further delays,  President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos sent a special  envoy to Lusaka. He is General (Gopelipa), who delivered the  document to Beye. The UN representative received the document  and locked it in his drawer, only delivering it to UNITA on 31  May.    The UNITA negotiating team is assessing the government  proposal. Jorge Valentim says it is not a bad proposal because  obstacles have been removed.    What matters is that the war should end. The talks will  continue tomorrow, but only at the level of heads of delegations  and the mediator.</p>

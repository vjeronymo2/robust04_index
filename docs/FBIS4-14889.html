			<p>BFN     [Text] At present Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister,  does not see prospects for setting up joint armed forces for the  Commonwealth republics. According to the minister, such forces  can be set up only if CIS states form a closer political and  economic union. In addition, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev had  a meeting with Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary-general, today  and said after the meeting that Russian peace-keeping forces  would be able to carry out their operations in the CIS under the  UN aegis. According to the minister, Butrus-Ghali supported  this position wholeheartedly.</p>

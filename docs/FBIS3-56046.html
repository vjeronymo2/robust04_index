			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Generalov report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Boris </F> Fedorov's Fate Sealed?"]    [Text] It has come to light that V. Chernomyrdin's  entourage is discussing a future candidate for finance minister.  B. Fedorov's track record in this position has not only been  coming under fire recently, but he is also being blamed for the  results of the recent Russian parliamentary elections where the  votes of the "marginals" bloc "formed" by the finance minister  were of decisive importance for the defeat of Russia's Choice.    Few in the Russian Government dare to ignore Russian  Federation presidential edicts the way B. Fedorov regularly  does. The latest such example is B.N. Yeltsin's decision on  repaying last year's debts to the defense complex in the first  quarter of 1994. Judging by the reaction to the Russian  Federation edict by the Finance Ministry under B. Fedorov,  military enterprises will have to whistle for their 3 trillion  rubles as they continue to go hat in hand. While the Defense  Ministry is once again going to be singled out as the one to  blame, the Finance Ministry stays in the shadows.    Moscow military men are known to have recently pinned on him  the label of an "unsinkable aircraft carrier of the United  States of America!?"    But now there have emerged serious signs of dissatisfaction  with B. Fedorov also on the part of the United States. Strobe  Talbott, "the top man in the United States in charge of  stability of relations with Russia," has admitted to a narrow  circle of people around him that the gamble on B. Fedorov was a  mistake. Things have reached a point where his seat in the  World Bank, regarded until recently as being "reserved for good"  for him, was taken by someone else, and the Americans seem no  longer to be trying to pitch direct links with B. Fedorov, as  they would not like to take part of the blame for the state of  the Russian economy.    It is not ruled out though that Fedorov has simply become a  fall guy in the clash of two economic strategies residing  together in the Russian Government. To fell this guy would be  90 percent of his opponents' victory.</p>

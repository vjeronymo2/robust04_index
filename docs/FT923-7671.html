			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Deaths ferry to be withdrawn THE IRISH Sea ferry on which two children died earlier this week is to be withdrawn on Tuesday for modifications to the sewerage system. It will be out of action for three days. A representative of Swansea Cork Ferries said the Celtic Pride, owned by the Polish Baltic Shipping Company, would stay in service over the weekend to cater for hundreds of already-booked passengers, but without 95 of its cabins and 210 berths. The two children, Katherine and James Tomlins, of Truro, Cornwall, died in the night aboard the Polish-registered Celtic Pride when gases seeped into their cabin from the ferry's sewerage system. Since the accident, other people who have travelled on the vessel have said they had previously complained to Swansea Cork Ferries, the operator, about strong sewage smells in some cabins. Yesterday the vessel arrived in Swansea to be met by marine surveyors from the Department of Transport and was temporarily held for examination. Afterwards, the British, Irish and Polish authorities agreed that it could remain in service provided the operators made modifications to the sewerage system and sealed off the affected cabins in the meantime. The Department of Transport yesterday issued advice to other ferry companies operating in UK waters advising them to check that their vessels' sewerage systems had adequate venting. The department said it had no plans for an investigation into the accident. It said that was a matter for the Polish authorities. The lack of an investigation has caused concern on both sides of the Irish Sea. In Britain, Ms Joan Whalley, who speaks for the opposition on transport, urged an inquiry by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA) -- Palestinian-Israeli talks to  implement the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho resumed  in Cairo this afternoon. The talks are chaired by Dr. Nabil  Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian president Yasir  'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of  staff. The talks were scheduled to begin this morning but were  delayed several hours because the Israeli delegation arrived in  Cairo late.    Informed Palestinian sources told MENA that the current  round  takes on special importance because it will be the last round if  the two sides agree on the outstanding issues. The sources said  the most important issues that will be discussed in the context  of the Security and Legal Affairs Committee is the legal  jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho and the release of Palestinian  detainees in Israeli jails, estimated at approximately 10,000  according to International Red Cross statistics.</p>

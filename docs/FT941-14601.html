			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Anglia TV bid Announcement of a bid for Anglia, the television company, by MAI, the financial services group, boosted the media sector as investors re-examined takeover prospects elsewhere. The Pounds 292m offer values Anglia at 'not less than 637p' a share which, according to some analysts' calculations, puts it on a premium prospective p/e of 31.65 times earnings. However, an analyst argued that as long as MAI could cut costs by Pounds 5m it would make money on the deal. Anglia shares jumped 180 to 664p, while MAI gained 31 at 315p. Several analysts suggested that Anglia shareholders got the best of the deal. They were also eagerly awaiting a response from LWT, which is fighting off a much lower bid from Granada. There was a feeling that Granada might have to stump up more money or look at another company - possibly Scottish Television. Reflecting that, Granada closed unchanged at 552p after being 9 off at one stage, while Scottish advanced 25 to 491p and LWT climbed 7 to 675p. HTV, also seen as a takeover candidate, rose 8 to 119p. Reuters Holdings receded 34 to 1886p after US house Merrill Lynch turned more cautious on technical grounds. Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca was knocked back 12 to 827p as agency broker James Capel turned seller of the stock and cut its forecast for 1994 profits by Pounds 25m to Pounds 775m. London International Group rose 4 to 166p on hopes of an offer for its troubled photo processing arm. Photo-Me Inter-national, the world's leading photo-booth manufacturer and operator, said it had reached an advanced stage in talks to purchase a business with complementary activities. The latest upsurge in the Hong Kong market, coupled with various broker recommendations, triggered strong showings from HSBC and Standard Chartered, both of which are viewed as classic Pacific Rim plays. Standard, which NatWest Securities labelled a trading buy this week, climbed 38 to 1203p, while HSBC responded to excellent figures from its Bank of East Asia subsidiary and news that Peregrine, one of the most influential of the Hong Kong broking houses, had issued a covered warrant on HSBC stock. HSBC settled 44 higher at 947p. Kleinwort Benson finally erased painful memories of its Premier Consolidated Oilfields bought deal, which cost the merchant bank dear in financial and credibility terms. The shares forged ahead 16 to 654p. Sun Alliance, down 8 at 387p, was among the Footsie's casualties yesterday. One of the market's most aggressive marketmaking firms was said to have failed in an attempt to place a block of 3m Sun shares. Shell rose 10 to 734p on hints that the sale of its Billiton metals division to South Africa's Gencor has been salvaged after being called off recently. Rolls-Royce advanced 9 to 173p on good volume of 8.9m after NatWest Securities took the stock off its sell list. Metals group Johnson Matthey appreciated 17 to 568p, boosted by a recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing in a 137-page research document on prospects for the engineering sector up to 1996. In the review, analyst Mr Paul Compton also urges investors to buy Rolls-Royce and GKN, 2 1/2 firmer at 571 1/2 p. The rumoured rights issue from Stanley Leisure arrived, but encouraging results held the share price fall to 2 at 333p. There was intense speculation ahead of this morning's Christmas trading statement from Tesco. Some suggested that the group would announce a one-off provision of around Pounds 80m for property write-downs. Interest in the statement has been intensified by the recent price war. Tesco shares slipped a half-penny to 236 1/2 p. Turnover in Sears hit 26m following a large placing. The shares added 1 1/2 at 123 1/2 p. A UBS buy recommendation drove George Wimpey 11 higher to 219p, while talk that the big cement companies are pressing for a price increase lifted Blue Circle 9 to 375p and helped RMC put on 11 at 1048p. Eastern Electricity's share buy-back news saw the stock rise 20 1/2 to 664 1/2 p. London Electricity, however, was the best performing rec, closing 28 stronger at 659p after a Panmure Gordon buy note.</p>

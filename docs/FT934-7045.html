			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Kirkham bearded in his den: Lucy Kellaway talks to the sofa salesman whose company, DFS, floats this week Graham Kirkham, an unknown sofa salesman from Yorkshire, has made nearly Pounds 300 million but is not satisfied. His fortune is larger than the reputed piles of the Forte and Weinstock families put together and three times as big as Charles Saatchi's. Yet his sights are pitched higher still. 'I've got this burning desire,' he says. 'I'm not happy to be a multi-millionaire. I hear this talk of billionaires . . .' On Wednesday his life's work, DFS Furniture Company, joins the stockmarket. That day Kirkham will be in his office in Doncaster at 7.30 am as usual having made Pounds 130m from the sale of half the company. The flurry of publicity over, it will be back to the hard graft of making still more money. The scale of his ambition has left his advisers gasping. 'Genuinely ambitious people are rare,' one says. 'Some end up as dictators. Some go into business. He is the most complete example of the latter type I have ever met.' Two months ago few people south of Watford had heard of Graham Kirkham. Peers in the furniture trade like Derek Hunt of MFI have never clapped eyes on him. Out of nowhere this businessman has become the City's latest darling. The raging ambition is hidden under a bluff and modest manner; he comes across as the chubby, cheerful chappie. Analysts enthuse about his plain-speaking Yorkshire charm, his hard work, and the strength of his business. Outsiders might wonder at their reaction. The City has seen many entrepreneurs come and go. Retailers in particular have a habit of making a fortune only to lose a large part of it, witness Gerald Ratner, Sir Terence Conran and George Davies. Moreover, the DFS prospectus contains some eyebrow-raising details: Kirkham has withdrawn Pounds 13m from the company before flotation, of which Pounds 5.5m was paid in the form of works of art and antiques as a crafty piece of tax avoidance. The company's merchandise manager has several times been convicted for drunken driving; more recently he has been charged with driving when disqualified and refusing to be breathalysed. And finally, as Kirkham is raising no new money for the business, it has to be asked why he is taking the company public at all. 'I went along to the analysts' meeting very cynical expecting to hear all sorts of bullshit but was pleasantly surprised,' says Katherine Wynne of Kleinwort Benson. Kirkham, she points out, is different from the giddy entrepreneurs of the 1980s. Many of them, John Ashworth at Coloroll for example, came and went in a matter of years but Kirkham has built up a business slowly over a quarter of a century. Meeting this multi-multi-millionaire is a disarming experience. He talks directly, banter marred only by incessant assertions of his own high moral sense. 'The one person I am accountable to is me. If I can satisfy myself I can satisfy everyone else,' he says. According to his own ethical code there was nothing wrong with paying himself a tax-efficient fortune before the flotation - he sought and followed the best professional advice. When it comes to the merchandise manager and his drinking habits, Kirkham asserts: 'I care about people so much it hurts. We will support him as much as possible. I look at the work he's done for the company for the last 19 years. We employ human beings.' Kirkham was born in the little town of Edlington, the only son of a miner. He was a good boy: went to Sunday school, sang in the choir and learnt to be 'humble but proper. I was taught not to tell lies, to stand up in buses and to say thank you'. He failed all his O levels, failed to get into the RAF, and suddenly decided to buckle down. He became a sofa salesman, at which he says he was only 'run of the mill'. Frustrated then at the lack of prospects, he set up his own company, without any capital, in a disused billiard hall, making sofas upstairs and selling them downstairs. Then 23, with a mortgage and two small children, he was quite unbothered by risk: 'If people don't contemplate failure, that is a good reason for them to succeed.' He built up the business steadily, opening out-of-town furniture stores and reinvesting all profits. He believes in hard work; he never takes more than a week or two holiday a year, and neither does any of his top management. His own optimism and drive are obvious; he prides himself on being able to make others feel the same way. 'People who have the germ are set alight by my own enthusiasm,' he says. His city advisers, whom Kirkham initially thought had never done a day's work in their lives, were shattered by the experience of floating the company. 'It was tiring working with him. He has so much energy,' says one. Yet the explanation of how this energetic and ordinary bloke came to build a business worth Pounds 300m is elusive. Kirkham reckons there is no single secret to his success: 'I always say our margins of 16 per cent are made up of 64 quarters of one per cent.' Among these 64 little bits is the fact that the boss understands every aspect of his business. He has also formed close and longstanding relationships with his suppliers, and has been clever with his marketing. When he opens a new store he sends a personalinvitation to well off potential customers offering them a discount. Viewers of Central and Yorkshire TV can hardly tune in without seeing one of his settees. Whatever the reasons for his success, Kirkham may find he needs new skills as the boss of a public company. Suppliers speculate that his style will have to change under the beady eye of shareholders and non-executive directors. 'Make no mistake this has been run as Kirkham's company. No one makes the decisions except him,' says one. Fewer changes are likely to his lifestyle as a result of his Pounds 130m cheque. He already has more money than he knows what to do with - he owns a Georgian mansion and has a serious art collection. He makes the astonishing claim that he has no plans for disposing of the new millions. 'I've really not given it any thought,' he says. So if neither he nor his company needs the money, why should he voluntarily cramp his style just to list the shares? Kirkham argues that as his children do not want to go into the business, flotation 'just seems appropriate'. I remind him that Richard Branson and Alan Sugar regretted going public. He starts to say that Branson and Sugar are just two of hundreds of others. He stops and changes his tack. 'Those two guys have got beards and I haven't' PERSONAL FILE: Graham Kirkham Born: December 14 1944 in Doncaster Educated: Maltby Grammar School.

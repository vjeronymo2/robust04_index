			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Italian paper recovers from political worries ITALIAN government bonds tumbled over a point on political worries yesterday morning, but recovered some of the ground in volatile trading later in the session. The BTP futures contract fell from 94.90 to a low of 93.65 on fears that Mr Giulio Amato, the prime minister, would be forced to resign, and the lira weakened against the D-Mark, forcing the Bank of Italy to intervene and support the currency. As news emerged that Mr Amato would not be resigning, the market picked up again and recovered some of its losses but fell back again in after-hours trading on the news that Mr Franco Reviglio, the finance minister, was being investigated in the country's political corruption probe. GERMAN government bonds dropped back as statements from two Bundesbank officials yesterday led the market to fear the central bank may not allow a substantial cut in interest rates soon. Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, said in a television interview inflation remained a worry for the central bank and that the inflation rate must be brought down to 2 per cent in the medium term. Mr Helmut Hesse, another board member, said a small rate cut was possible, but not a big rate signal. The bund futures contract opened at 95.75, reached a high of 95.89, and then slipped back to 95.58 by late afternoon. Volume was relatively light. Dealers said the market was focusing on this week's repo in the hope the Bundesbank would allocate funds at a lower rate. In last week's tender, the lowest rate was 8.25 per cent. THE strength of the French franc against the D-Mark continued to provide firm support for the French government bond market which closed about a  1/4 point higher yesterday. UK government bonds closed higher with the 20-year area outperforming the rest of the market as dealers noted some buying interest ahead of today's gilt auction. The Bank of England will auction Pounds 3bn of 8 per cent treasury stock due 2013 today. Longer-dated gilts gained about  3/8 of a point yesterday as dealers noted buying of stocks of a similar maturity. US Treasury bond prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday after an early rally on news of weaker consumer confid-ence had failed to take hold. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year issue was down  1/4 at 102, to yield 6.908 per cent, while the two-year was up  3/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 3.891 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds recovered most of Monday's losses yesterday, with the futures contract bouncing back to end at 108.75, against the previous day's 107.93 close. Dealers said the market started firmly, with the June futures contract opening at 108.30, then gained strength. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.245 per cent and closed at 4.2 per cent.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / BT and Motorola plan video PC BRITISH Telecommunications and Motorola, the US communications and semiconductor group, announced yesterday that they were developing a multimedia chip set that would bring video-conferencing to desktop personal computers for less than Pounds 1,000, Michiyo Nakamoto writes. Users of the PCs will be able to talk to each other and see each other on their screens and to 'window swap' - send data and images to each other. BT is already working with IBM to develop PCs with fully integrated video-conferencing units. The units will cost between Pounds 3,500 and Pounds 4,000. Add-on kits that will transform an ordinary PC into a video-conferencing unit will also be about Pounds 3,000. The more advanced BT-Motorola model due out in two years and its add-on card, however, are expected to be available for less than Pounds 1,000.</p>

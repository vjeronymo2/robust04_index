			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Impressionist auction will test market: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S is to sell 33 important Impressionist and Modern paintings collected by the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty and his son Chester. They are expected to raise at least Pounds 12m at auctions in London in June and in New York in November. The most important work is 'La Toilette' by Toulouse-Lautrec, showing a woman examining her nails, which carries an estimate of Pounds 3m-plus. Another evocative painting by the same artist, 'Le lit', a brothel scene of a girl on a bed, is expected to make Pounds 2.5m. There are also works by Renoir, Degas, Chagall, Henri Rousseau, Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt. It is brave of the Trustees of the Chester Beatty Estate to offer the collection this year. Prices for Impressionist and Modern art sank last autumn and these will be the first important works to test the market. A year ago the group would have been expected to make at least Pounds 25m, and Sotheby's and the vendors obviously hope that the quality of the auction will provide the incentive to persuade rich collectors to return. Sotheby's also announced yesterday that it was selling Casa Batllo in Barcelona, one of the last domestic commissions undertaken by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi. Situated in the heart of the city, the eight-floor extravaganza has the appearance of a submarine palace. Bids of above Pounds 55m are expected. Meanwhile, in New York Sotheby's achieved an auction record of Dollars 363,000 (Pounds 214,800) for a Japanese silk scroll, 43in long, created by Suzuki Kiitsu in 1845 and depicting the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets. That was more than matched at Christie's, which set an auction record for a clock of Dollars 1.5m. It was paid for an Art Deco clock modelled on an Egyptian gate clock made by Cartier in 1927 and inspired by the revival in Egyptology following the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. It was lost for many years and far exceeded its Dollars 150,000 top estimate. Marilyn Monroe dominated Christie's South Kensington's auction of pop memorabilia yesterday, with a film swimsuit selling for Pounds 13,200 against an estimate of Pounds 4,000. Boyes, the Copenhagen auctioneer, offered toys in its first London sale. A rare Bing clockwork car of 1906 sold for Pounds 5,062 and a model of Rudolf Hess in uniform went to an American collector for Pounds 3,375, a record for a single toy 'soldier'.</p>

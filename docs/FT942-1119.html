			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Dollar dashes hopes of crisis-free summer - Wall Street The dollar returned to plague the stock market again this week, less than two months after Wall Street traders thought they had put the US currency's troubles behind them. It was in early May that the dollar last took centre stage, when its sharp decline spurred central bank intervention to halt the slide. At the time, the stock and bond markets both took big hits. Investors sold securities amid fears that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates to protect the dollar. When the Fed did that, and the dollar stabilised, Wall Street looked forward to a summer free of crises. Those hopes were dashed this week when another big drop in the US currency's value - on Tuesday the dollar fell to a post-second world war low against the yen of less then Y100 - sent stock prices plummeting. Apart from a brief midweek respite, the Dow Jones industrial average spent the week on the retreat. By 10am yesterday, the Dow had fallen 120 points, or 3 per cent, in slightly more than four days' trading. Although bond prices fared a bit better over the period - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond edged slightly higher from 7.4 per cent at the start of the week to 7.5 per cent early yesterday - the mood remained nervous, even with encouraging news on inflation. The reasons for the stock market's decline were relatively straightforward. While a weaker dollar pushes up import prices, investors were not so much worried about imported inflation as they were about the possibility that the Fed would have to raise interest rates again to stop the currency from falling further. Although yesterday's intervention by central banks enabled the dollar to bounce off its overnight lows against the yen and the D-mark, investors clearly believed the odds on another interest rate increase have rapidly shortened, judging by their frantic selling of stocks and bonds on Friday morning. By 11.30am yesterday, the Dow had fallen more than 50 points, and the benchmark 30-year bond had dropped one and a quarter points, pushing the yield above 7.5 per cent. The fact that stock and bond prices continued to fall while the dollar was staging a modest recovery suggested that there was something more to the markets' decline than just currency and interest rate concerns. That something more was almost certainly earnings; investors have been unnerved by recent profits warnings from US companies, and with interest rates apparently heading even higher, the outlook for corporate earnings is suddenly darkening. The massacre of technology stocks this week was a good example of how fears of weakening earnings are undermining confidence in stocks. The rout started on Tuesday when Lotus Development announced that its second quarter profits would come in well below analysts' expectations. The news wiped 28 per cent off the value of Lotus' shares in a single day, and sparked heavy selling throughout a technology sector already weakened by estimates of slowing computer orders and sluggish consumer demand. After a brief recovery on Wednesday, technology stocks fell further as fresh bad news about a single company (a broker's downgrade of Cisco Systems) sent shock waves throughout the sector. The declines were most pronounced among Nasdaq market stocks, and by Thursday's close the Nasdaq composite index had dropped to its lowest level since last July. The dollar's fall, the prospect of higher interest rates, the possibility of a slowdown in earnings growth, and more sudden and sharp sell-offs in the stock market have all made for a dispiriting start to the summer. As Thomas Gallagher, managing director of capital commitment at brokerage firm Oppenheimer, said yesterday: 'People are starting to lose some meaningful money in stocks and they are getting nervous.' There are pockets of sunshine amid the gloom, however, most notably in those sectors where takeover activity is still buoyant. Cable television stocks remain flavour of the month, thanks to the string of recent deals involving telecommunications and cable TV companies, and the financials sector has also been lively. Holders of Chicago-based financial services group Kemper were particularly happy this week when, out of the blue, a counter offer to GE Capital's near-Dollars 3bn takeover bid emerged from Conseco, a little-known insurance holding company from Indiana. Kemper shares jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 62- 5/8 after Conseco offered Dollars 3.25bn cash and equity for the company. Although Conseco said its offer would only stand until tomorrow, it was enough to scare off GE Capital, which quickly withdrew its bid.  -------------------------------------------- Monday            3741.90 -   34.88 Tuesday           3707.97 -   33.93 Wednesday         3724.77 +   16.80 Thursday          3699.09 -   25.68 Friday            3636.94 -   62.15  --------------------------------------------</p>

There is concern that this requirement will delay the GSM  launch whilst one party or another makes the undertaking to pay  the cost for the decoder system, a cost estimated at around 100  million Dutch guilders. PTT Telecom was informed earlier this  year by the ministry that it wanted to have the ability of  intercept, decode, and monitor calls on the GSM network, yet PTT  Telecom said it was not willing to pay for the developing of  applications to decode calls. The Dutch Government has the right  to eavesdrop as set out in draft legislation.    This legislation will end PTT Telecom's monopoly oN mobile  communications services in the Netherlands and will prepare the  ground for a second GSM network operator. The proposed  legislation obliges operators of GSM networks to co-operate with  any "special order to monitor data," though it does not specify  who will be responsible for paying for the necessary decoding  systems.    The financing question will be clarified by a separate piece  of legislation currently being drafted. Eavesdropping  technology on GSM networks has not yet been developed, and PTT  Telecom says it is not prepared to finance its research. The  PTT does provide the Ministry of Justice with the facilities for  monitoring calls on the PSTN [public switched-telephone network]  and on the NMT [Nordic Mobile Telephone network]-based ATF [car  telephone network] analogue cellular networks. Additionally,  the Dutch Government intends to issue a competitive tender for  another GSM licence before the end of the year. Unlike the  recent trend for "higher bidder" GSM licence auctions, the  second Dutch GSM licence is expected to be awarded to the "best  application."    PTT Telecom is still a state-owned monopoly, and the  government wants to fatten up the firm for a financial slaughter  before privatisation. Major investment in GSM may heavily  deplete finances and the issue of security and concern for  international drug baron activity, though important, may all be  a diversionary tactic for ulterior motives.</p>

It is difficult to say for the time being despite  the promises of the president of the Republic but one thing  seems certain. Apart from the assassination of a fierce  opposition leader, the killing of the Social Democratic Party  secretary general has another objective: To sabotage the  setting up of the transitional institutions planned for today.  As you know, the ceremony did not take place today. How can  one imagine the ceremony taking place in an atmosphere of  mourning?    Who has an interest in seeing the setting up of the  transitional institutions postponed? Three names come to the  mind of the least attentive observer: First, Liberal Party  Chairman Justin Mugenzi, for well-known reasons. He would like  to impose his deputies on the National Assembly but has met with  opposition from people, like the late Gatabazi, who defended  democracy. Second, there is the National Republican Movement  for Democracy and Development [MRND] which is pulling strings  behind Mr. Mugenzi and has an interest in supporting him.  Finally, there is the Revolutionary Democratic Council,  Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, the MRND's ally,  whose pretext for sabotaging the establishment of the  transitional institutions is because they were denied a seat in  the Transitional National Assembly.    So many parties for one reason or another could have acted  to  prevent the establishment of the transitional institutions.  None of them have never hidden this desire and they would like  to sabotage the setting up of transitional institutions and the  disappearance of late Gatabazi could be advantageous in this.  May his soul rest in peace.</p>

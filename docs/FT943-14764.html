			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Directors aim to practise as they preach Directors of Tecs seek to practise what they preach when it comes to the promotion of best training practices in their own companies, says the survey. Seventy-eight per cent of directors said their companies or employers were committed to Investors in People, the government-inspired standard that seeks to match a company's training more effectively to its business needs. But penetration of the scheme into business and employment at large is much lower. About 1,000 companies have achieved the standard while 8,700 are committed to achieving it. This means the scheme covers only about 12 per cent of the UK workforce. Directors whose companies or employers are not committed to Investors in People gave reasons including the scheme being too expensive and too bureaucratic. Tec directorships attract individuals from a wide spectrum of beliefs - asked how they would tackle unemployment, respondents made a range of suggestions, including banning overtime, a public works scheme and greater control of immigration. Enthusiasm for long periods on a Tec board seems to be flagging. The number of directors who have been with their Tec for more than a year has fallen to 80 per cent from last year's 89 per cent, while the proportion expecting to spend more than two years with their board has also fallen, from 91 per cent to 78 per cent. A total of 59 per cent of directors said they spent more than three hours a week on Tec-related activity, compared with 56 per cent last year.</p>

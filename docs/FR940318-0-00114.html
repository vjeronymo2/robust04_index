			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on SNAP Process and Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 12, 1993 EPA published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a Notice of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking (NPRM) for SNAP (58 FR 28094). The NPRM described the proposed structure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and process for administering the SNAP program and proposed determinations on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptability of key substitutes. The Notice also contained the proposed regulatory language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would serve as the legal basis for administering and enforcing the SNAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, EPA recognized that notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to establish regulations governing SNAP. EPA further concluded that rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was required to place any substance on the list of unacceptable substances, to list a substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as acceptable only with certain use restrictions, or to remove a substance from either the list  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unacceptable or acceptable substitutes. EPA did not believe, however, that rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures were required to list alternatives as acceptable with no restrictions. Such listings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not impose any sanction, nor remove any prior license to use a substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Final Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule promulgates the SNAP process and the first set of determinations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP substitutes. The Agency may revise these decisions in the future as it reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional substitutes and receives more data on substitutes already covered by the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA expects future changes to the SNAP lists to be minor, and thus not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent an undue burden on the regulated community. The principal changes the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expects to make in the future are to add new substitutes or sectors to the lists, rather than to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change a substitute's acceptability. Further, once a substitute has been placed on either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable or the unacceptable list, EPA will conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently remove a substitute from either list, as described below in section VII. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule also addresses comments that the Agency received on the NPRM, and incorporates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further data on substitutes received during the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Updates of SNAP Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three mechanisms exist for revising or expanding the list of SNAP determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in this final regulation. First, under section 612(d), the Agency will review and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either grant or deny petitions to add or delete substances from the SNAP list of acceptable or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable alternatives. Section VIII of this final rule presents EPA's method for handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second means of revising or expanding the list of SNAP determinations is through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notifications, described below, which must be submitted to EPA 90 days before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction of a substitute into interstate commerce for significant new use as an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a class I or class II substance. These 90-day notifications are required by section 612(e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA for producers of alternatives to class I substances for new uses and by EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations issued under sections 114 and 301 of the Act to implement section 612(c) in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other cases. Section VII of this final rule discusses the Agency's approach for processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these notifications, including a strategy for integrating SNAP notifications with other chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review programs already being implemented by EPA under authorities provided in the Toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FIFRA). Other parts of this final rule also explain how the Agency addresses the overlap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between SNAP regulations and regulations issued under other titles of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Agency believes that section 612 authorizes it to initiate changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP determinations independent of any petitions or notifications received. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments can be based on new data on either additional substitutes or on characteristics of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes previously reviewed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Outreach and Substitute Clearinghouse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public outreach and the substitute information clearinghouse comprise the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance component of the SNAP program. The purpose of this effort is to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information for the public to use in selecting acceptable substitutes. Sections VII.A.3.f. and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VII.A.3.g describe the Agency's approach for establishing the clearinghouse and performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outreach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

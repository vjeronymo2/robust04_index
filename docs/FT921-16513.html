			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Conference to discuss reconstruction in El Salvador A CONFERENCE to co-ordinate foreign help for the reconstruction of El Salvador is likely to take place in the next six months, following agreement this week of a peace plan to end a 12-year civil war. The government of President Alfredo Cristiani tentatively estimates the reconstruction programme will cost Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 980m) over a five-year period, both to repair war damage and to direct extra resources into health and education, particularly in neglected rural areas. The World Bank, which will co-ordinate the aid effort, is expected to call the conference after the ceasefire goes into effect on February 1. The US, El Salvador's largest aid donor, is expected to play the biggest role in the reconstruction plan, which would also probably involve Canada, Japan, the EC and others. There are still details to resolve in the peace accord, which took 20 months to reach. On Sunday, the two sides meet to establish a timetable to dissolve the military structure of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front, the left-wing opposition guerrillas, and to reincorporate its members to the 'political and institutional life of the country'. Hours after the agreement was announced, troops clashed with guerrillas and at least one soldier was killed. As the country where the Reagan administration in the US declared it would 'draw the line' against communism, El Salvador became the recipient of the third-largest amount of US aid during the 1980s, after Israel and Egypt. The military continued to soak up resources through the decade, diverting funds from social spending and public investment, which dropped in 1990 to a meagre 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product. As well as raising investment and savings, the government will also have to increase tax revenues. At about 7.8 per cent of GDP in 1990, these were among the lowest in Latin America. Before the civil war, El Salvador had sustained economic growth for three decades. This proved insufficient to guarantee security, largely because of the high concentration of income, wealth and land in the hands of relatively few, and the enforcement of this by military repression. Since then, there have been some successes with land reform, and remittances from the large number of Salvadoreans living in the US, which benefit half of all the families in El Salvador, have had an impact on income distribution. Even so, distribution issues will remain critical, along with efforts to diversify the economy. El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Latin America and its long-term growth is likely to depend on a further diversification away from agriculture. The government's economic reform programme is supported by the International Monetary Fund and has been described by the World Bank as 'one of the most ambitious reform efforts in Latin America.' Although this included safety nets, there remain concerns about the impact of the programme on the poor. There is some scope for a return of flight capital but El Salvador will be heavily dependent on foreign funds for years. The international financial institutions will be essential allies if this is to be obtained. With foreign debt of Dollars 1.86bn, 70 per cent of which is concessional, El Salvador's debt burden is among the lowest in Latin America and may be expanded. Nevertheless, it will be heavily dependent on the friendly countries, in particular the US, that have pledged support for reconstruction. Whether that support will in fact be forthcoming, for a poor country of 5m people no longer seen as having much strategic importance, is another matter.</p>

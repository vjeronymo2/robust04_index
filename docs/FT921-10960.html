			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Foot defends Moscow talks - Soviet relations MR Michael Foot, the former Labour party leader, last night defended his talks with the leaders of the Soviet Union in Moscow ten years ago in which he unsuccessfully sought an agreement on the abolition of tactical nuclear weapons. He insisted that, far from being the 'scandalous behaviour' alleged by some Conservative ministers and their supporters in the press, it had helped negotiations forward. Strongly condemning how The Sunday Times had reported the references to the talks in archives obtained from the Kremlin, Mr Foot stressed that US President Ronald Reagan had subsequently backed the so-called 'zero option'. He said: 'If Mr Andrew Neil (the editor) is partly ashamed, something very degrading must have occurred.' Mr Foot recalled that Mr Denis Healey, then Labour's deputy leader and shadow foreign secretary who accompanied him in Moscow, was widely regarded as the most powerful 'anti-Soviet warrior of the lot'. Mr John Reid, a Labour defence spokesman, accused the government of not being interested in preventing nuclear proliferation, and having nothing positive to contribute to international arms control. Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister of state, said he deeply distrusted the Labour party's commitment to keep Britain's nuclear deterrent. He recalled that until 1991 Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, had been a member of the unilateralist Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and claimed that until very recently the party had been 'wholeheartedly unilateralist'.</p>

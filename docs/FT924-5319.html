			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Pay review body considers options ONE OF the main independent review bodies for public-sector pay is still considering whether it is worthwhile preparing the annual report on its sector since being stripped of its ability to recommend pay rises. The doctors' and dentists' review body, like four of the five review bodies, has been asked not to make a recommendation this year. The teachers' pay review body was set up by statute and is obliged to make a recommendation. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in his Autumn Statement that public-sector pay settlements for next year would be restricted to a maximum of 1.5 per cent. He asked the review bodies to amend their remits for the coming year and to make no recommendations about overall levels of pay, fees or allowances for April 1 1993. The doctors' and dentists' review body was asked to report on 'miscellaneous matters' including general practitioners' fee scales and merit awards for consultants. The review body at first said that such a report would be 'inappropriate'. But after correspondence with the government it has been reconsidering its response and will make a final decision on Wednesday. The other review bodies have said they are prepared to accept restricted briefs.</p>

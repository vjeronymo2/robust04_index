			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Zimbabwe climate not yet right Sir, Tony Hawkins' hopeful article ('Harare sows seeds for an investment harvest', May 18) about the improving investment conditions in Zimbabwe resulting from exchange control and foreign exchange liberalisation, price deregulation, privatisation of some state companies, and freeing of interest rates did not refer to his previous article ('Zimbabwe cancels controversial land leases', May 5) on Zimbabwe which featured a radically different theme. In that article, it was noted that 72 leases of farms expropriated from white farmers, theoretically for resettlement of landless peasants, had in fact been allotted to senior politicians (such as the head of the air force and the former agriculture minister). The article noted that businessmen (were) . . . concerned that the Zimbabwe investment promotion conference in London on May 19 would have been undermined by the controversy', so the leases were cancelled. Indeed, I should think that the fear of expropriation of investments (with the possible subsequent donation of same to politicians) would not be assuaged by any amount of exchange control liberalisation or price deregulation.

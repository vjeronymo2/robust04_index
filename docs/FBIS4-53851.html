			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- Working people here  significantly marked the lapse of 48 years since the great  leader President Kim Il-song participated in the ground-breaking  ceremony of the Potong River improvement project and kindled the  first flame of grand nature-harnessing .    On May 21, 1946, President Kim Il-song initiated the Potong  River improvement project as the first undertaking for carrying  into practice the plan of land administration he had matured in  the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, and took  up the first spade at the ceremony. The project was completed  in only 55 days thanks to the wise guidance of President Kim  Il-song and to the great zeal and will of builders and Pyongyang  citizens to build the country.    With a view to conveying down through generations the  immortal feat of President Kim Il-song, the Workers' Party and  people of Korea set up a monument to the Potong River  improvement project on the spot and annually celebrate May 21 as  "day of builders".    A meeting of working people in the capital city took place  in  front of the monument on May 21.</p>

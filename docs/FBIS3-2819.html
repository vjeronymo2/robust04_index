"China today faces an excellent situation rarely seen in its  modern history," he said in a group discussion about premier Li  Peng's government work report.    Qiao, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress (NPC), said that internationally,  China maintains good relations with surrounding countries  including members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and is steadily improving its relations with Western countries.    All new reform measures taken since the beginning of this  year are correct, and new problems that have cropped up in the  course of implementing these measures can be solved one by one,  he told NPC deputies from coastal Zhejiang Province.    Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member of the  Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee, also spoke on such issues as agriculture,  establishment of a modern enterprise system for state-owned  enterprises, reform of taxation and financial systems,  transformation of government functions, and the fight against  corruption.    On agricultural development, he said, "throughout the 1990s  and the next century, we must always give top priority to  agriculture as the foundation of the national economy."    Qiao stressed the need to take "effective and feasible"  measures to help farmers develop both the range and quality of  production.    Development of the rural economy is not isolated, he said,  but must be combined with reform measures that aim to establish  a socialist market economy.    The Chinese Government has decided to help 80 million people  shed poverty by the end of this century, he said, adding that  attainment of the goal requires concerted efforts by both  central and local governments.    Qiao Shi also visited NPC deputies from Anhui and Hubei  Provinces.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Revenue guides to appear next year The Inland Revenue is to publish the internal guidance manuals used in its tax and collection offices by the end of next year. The manuals, which have previously been treated as confidential, are being published as part of the government's call for greater freedom of information. The Revenue said some information would be withheld, covering anything that would prejudice the assessment or collection of tax, assist avoidance or evasion, reveal information about the affairs of individual taxpayers or breach copyright.</p>

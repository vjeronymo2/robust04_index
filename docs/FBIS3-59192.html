			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "norb/tom/plo": "Accession Poker: Pressure </F> on the European Parliament"]    [Text] Brussels/Vienna -- Commissioner Hans van den Broek,  who is responsible for the foreign relations of the European  Union, has suggested the European Parliament apply "expedited  procedures" concerning the handling of the accession agreements  with Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.    Van den Broek proposed that only the "essential parts" of  the  agreements be submitted to the European Parliament by the end of  March.    Thus, the European Parliament, which must ratify the  expansion of the European Union, might begin preparations in  March. Van den Broek no longer considers the presentation of  complete treaties possible by 10 March. The president of the  European Parliament, Egon Klepsch, believes that membership  might be postponed by one year if negotiations are not concluded  according to schedule.    Chancellor Vranitzky told DER STANDARD in Athens that  contradictory statements by commissioners of the European Union  or the European Parliament on the schedule are not surprising.  It must be clear, however, that accession is a political  decision that will be made ultimately at the government level.    Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek stated that, according to his  information, there will be no delay in the talks. If problems  should occur, it will still be possible to achieve a solution at  the summit of the European Union in February.</p>

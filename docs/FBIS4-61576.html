			<p>BFN     [Text] The sharpest problems of the Russian-German  trade-economic relations are to be discussed in the course of  Boris Yeltsin's visit to Germany scheduled for 11-13 May, expert  of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry Aleksandr  Sokol told INTERFAX. In his opinion, the upcoming visit will  primarily be of "an economic nature."    As before, Germany remains Russia's most important business  partner and major "currency donor," underlined Sokol. In  general, the trade-economic relations between two countries are  developing favorably, however, several problems which hinder  their further development, have accumulated over the last period  of time. First of all, it is the problem of Russia's debt.  Currently it exceeds 50 billion dollars. This sum includes the  earlier granted credits which cannot be repaid due to a number  of reasons.    Along with the state debt there exists the so called  "commercial debt" of the Russian enterprises to several German  firms for the delivered goods amounting to 1.2 billion dollars.    One more problem related to the previous two ones concerns  credit granted to Russia under the guarantee of the German  insurance company Germes. Since 1991 all previous credits  totalling DM 18.4 billion have been allocated on preferential  conditions with a 10-year delay in payment. Since 1994 the  company Germes passed a decision to annul all benefits with  respect to Russia and to issue export guarantees in accordance  with the international practice with an advanced payment  amounting to 15 percent of the contract's value due to the  growth of Russian debt. Because of this circumstance the  majority of Russian enterprises cannot use the credit line of  the company Germes now. As a result, the Russian government has  not passed its decision on utilization of the DM 2.5 billion  credit allocated by the German party for Russia in 1994 under  the guarantee of the German insurance company.    Meanwhile, the absence of preferential credits can lead to  diminishing of Russian import from Germany and to the reduction  of turnover between two countries as a whole; both parties  recognize that this does not meet their interests.    The Russian Foreign Economic Relations Ministry believes  that  mutually acceptable decisions which would prevent further  lowering of the bilateral trade-economic exchange can be found  in the course of the upcoming Russian-German negotiations.</p>

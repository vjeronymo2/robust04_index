			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / GM deal resolves fight over Isuzu General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary and IM (International Motors), the UK's largest private motor-imports group, have backed away from a legal fight over who is entitled to import and distribute four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Isuzu of Japan, in which GM has a 37 per cent stake. A compromise has been reached under which both Vauxhall and IM will sell various versions of the vehicle in dispute, the Isuzu Trooper, until late 1996. By then IM should have available a full range of similar vehicles built by a rival manufacturer, Ssangyong of South Korea. Vauxhall dealers will start selling some Trooper models in May, but they will be re-badged as the Vauxhall Monterey. Under EU-Japanese market monitoring arrangements, it is expected that 6,700 Trooper/Monterey models will be available for sale in the UK this year, of which more than half will be sold by Vauxhall dealers under the compromise with IM. During 1995, when IM's current Isuzu dealers will have already begun selling Ssangyong's Mercedes-powered four-wheel-drive alternative, IM's share of Trooper sales will be halved to around 1,500 units. In the final year, IM's dealers are likely to be selling only 1,000 Isuzu models, mostly commercial-vehicle versions. Mr Bob Edmiston's IM, whose wholly owned Isuzu (UK) subsidiary has held the Isuzu franchise since 1987, last year declared its intention to seek legal action to block GM's Isuzu plans after Vauxhall's chairman, Mr Charles Golden, said Vauxhall would 'take up its right' to import Troopers from January 1. IM maintained that GM unlawfully sought to procure the termination of Isuzu (UK)'s contract to operate the franchise in the UK. IM originally filed a suit against GM in the US, but a US court ruled that any proceedings should be heard in the UK. GM has been selling the vehicle through its continental European dealer networks, where it is badged as an Opel, since early last year.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Are you looking forward to another 10 hours of Inspector Morse? He returns (8.00) for the first of five hefty murder stories. ITV's discovery that they could hold a huge audience with two-hour slabs of this middlebrow, inoffensive, beautifully filmed, rather repetitive, deeply English series has changed attitudes towards scheduling. Time was when the broadcasters strained to invent ways of keeping us interested by cunningly building one appealing programme upon another. Now they simply say 'John - another ten tons of Morse, please'. Last week Anita Roddick, rarely off the box for months, was on that awful interview-yourself series. Today she presents The Day The World Changed (8.00 BBC2), choosing the day Britain's first department store opened. Earlier, on The Gloria Hunniford Show Without Wogan (7.00 BBC1), the guests include Mike McShane and Sandi Toksvig, who are in C4's 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?' currently starring in a West End play, and about to open in a new TV comedy. Timewatch shows the first of a two-part programme on Tito (8.10 BBC2).</p>

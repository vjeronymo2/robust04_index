			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, </F> admiral in the Reserves, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio  Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Woyciechowski] Foreign  language skills among our troops will soon prove useful--that is  to say, during joint maneuvers, among others, during the joint  exercises between the Polish Army and NATO. Is it true that  they will take place in September?    [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, I hope so. We are in the midst of  working out the details of the exercises along with NATO  officials. They will take place during the first 20 days or so  of September.    [Woyciechowski] Can you say where they will take place, in  what region of the country, or is that a military secret?    [Kolodziejczyk] No, it is not a military secret. By the  way, we will make efforts for the public to know quite a lot  about the nature of these exercises, about their participants,  about events taking place there, but the final decision has not  yet been made....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Who will come from NATO? Will  they be just generals and officers, or ordinary soldiers as well?    [Kolodziejczyk] There will also be so-called fundamental  subdivisions: platoons and companies. We still do not know how  many countries will send troops, but we do intend to invite  observers to these exercises, which means all of our neighbors  must definitely be here, as well as volunteers from among those  who have declared their willingness to participate in  Partnership for Peace. We simply think that the process of  building mutual trust is [hesitating] a very crucial thing at  this stage, and we want to demonstrate our exercises for the  sake of peace and demonstrate that we want to learn the  standards and procedures that are in effect in NATO. We want to  establish rapid-deployment forces for the sake of prevention and  maintaining peace and...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But, General--I am sorry, I  mean Admiral--could you speak a little more about the exercises?  They will be the first landing operation--it is just a figure of  speech--by NATO in Poland. So my question is: Will NATO troops  be seen around? Will U.S. soldiers be running around fields in  rural areas? Will we see tanks....    [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] Well, not exactly.    [Woyciechowski] Or perhaps the military will be the only one  to see anything like that?    [Kolodziejczyk] To make a long story short: This will be  the first instance of an exercise within the Partnership for  Peace because, by that time, we will have signed an individually  negotiated partnership program. Still, this will not be our  first experience of that type since, for a few years now, we  have been conducting joint training sessions. This year, we  will have the joint exercises. Not so long ago, our mountain  riflemen returned from the French Alps with a great many  memories of their time there. We have also trained British and  Dutch soldiers here in Poland. We will also take part ourselves  in very large-scale peacekeeping [preceding word in English]  exercises in the Netherlands, but....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What is that?    [Kolodziejczyk] Peacekeeping [preceding word in English] is  about having forces for the maintenance of peace, about  preparing [words indistinct] for peacekeeping operations. It is  a very important element when you think about how unstable the  world continues to be and how many dangers... [Kolodziejczyk  pauses] I do not even mention Yugoslavia because everybody  knows about that part of the world, and everybody laments that  the peacekeeping operations there are not efficient enough.  Now, one of the goals of these exercises [with NATO] is to  search for ways of improving efficiency. Still, the thing is  that the issue is not up to the Army but up to the appropriate  provisions of international law.    [Woyciechowski] Let us talk for a moment about the  Individual Partnership Program. You said the negotiations are  about to end and the program will be finalized soon. Will it be  made public in its entirety? Will all that be made public  [words indistinct]?    [Kolodziejczyk] I think that, if one were to publish the  program in its entirety, it would be an extremely boring  document because, apart from the political preamble, which, by  the way, is very short indeed, it is slightly over one page  long, and, in it, I can reveal some secret here by saying that  some formulations were included there that are very beneficial  to us; we have made very strong efforts for that, and they were  indeed included in the preamble. Now, when it comes to the  entire remainder of the program, it consists of a compilation of  tables that implement a gradual harmonization in a step-by-step  way, and they include very specific measures in many different  areas, beginning with....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Let us explain it to our  listeners: The minister means the measures that aim at our  integration into NATO.    [Kolodziejczyk] Exactly.    [Woyciechowski] Are they very [word indistinct] and very  military items?    [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, exactly. You are exactly right. The  items cover integration of communications systems, unification  of procedures, which, after all, were different, tactical signs,  maps, exercises with maps, computer exercises, the command  language, and a whole range of great undertakings [words  indistinct].    [Woyciechowski] My understanding is that it is a very  detailed time schedule that begins in the so-called Year or  Month Zero, and when is the final date in the time schedule,  Admiral? What is the final deadline?    [Kolodziejczyk] The schedule will be of a gradual nature.  Over the years, we will be giving up those undertakings we  deem...    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But can one see an end? In  other words, to put it in different words [words indistinct]...?    [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] No, one cannot see an end  because, up to now, no criteria have been defined that have to  be met by countries to be included in the NATO family. We are  making intensive efforts for that sake, and I hope that, in the  near future, such criteria will indeed be defined. At any rate,  we will be making intensive efforts for that sake because, as  has been said on many occasions, our strategic goal is to  integrate into the European security system; we want to be an  active participant in that system, and we will do everything  possible for the road to be as short as possible.    [Woyciechowski] Do you mean the European security system or  NATO?    [Kolodziejczyk] You know, NATO has become quite a misleading  label. It brings to mind a bloc type of defense system,  whereas, currently, NATO is not a defense bloc of any kind but  is, instead, the basis for constructing a security system and  has been undergoing transformations, while, to many people, the  label is misleading while many others deliberately use it--I  mean our neighbors to the East--by saying: Here comes NATO, an  aggressive bloc, approaching our borders.    [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, what about our eastern  neighbors? What does Russia's participation in Partnership for  Peace imply? In other words, is it a good thing or a bad one  for us?    [Kolodziejczyk] You know, generally speaking, it sends a  good message that means that, at least formally speaking, the  Russians have approved the Partnership for Peace initiative, but  their goodwill will be measured with their level of  participation and involvement in the building of a security  system that, after all, will include Russia as well.

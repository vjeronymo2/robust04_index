			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSMEN CRITICIZE L.A. AGENCIES  </P> <P> A dozen east Wilmington businessmen joined together this week in demanding that  Los Angeles city departments do more to rid their neighborhood of crime,  garbage and vagrants.  </P> <P> "We're very disappointed with the service we're receiving from all branches of  government.  </P> <P> And I think all of us are disgusted that businessmen are so much better off  being just down the road in Long Beach than here in Wilmington," businessman  Manuel Louis told officials of the Port of Los Angeles, the Police Department  and a representative of harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores.  </P> <P> The one-hour meeting, held Monday in the offices of Stoll Engine Co. on East  Anaheim Street, followed weeks of individual complaints by businessmen that  their properties were suffering from ever-increasing crime and a continuing  deterioration of nearby streets.  </P> <P> The blighted area, nicknamed the Third World by local activists, is just east  of the Dominguez Channel and north of Anaheim Street.  </P> <P> Businessmen said port officials should do more to upgrade port-owned properties  in the area. Several businessmen also charged that the port had purposely  ignored problems plaguing local businesses, hoping to acquire more property  from businessmen who would be willing to sell at any price.  </P> <P> "We feel there is actually a scheme here," said Gary F. Duthie, president of  Duthie Electric Service Corp.  </P> <P> But the port's representatives vigorously denied Duthie's claim and other  criticisms of the port's commitment to the area.  </P> <P> "The fact is the properties we've acquired are in far better shape than when we  took them over," said Louis Arreola of the port's property management  department.  </P> <P> Officials said they are willing to look into the businessmen's complaints and  to meet with them again in two weeks.  </P></p>

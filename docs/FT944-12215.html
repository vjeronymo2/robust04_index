			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bolivia plans to sell oil company in one piece Bolivia has decided to sell its state oil company Yacimiento Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) as one single company rather than splitting it up, Mr Fernando Cossio, finance minister, said, Reuter reports. 'We are going to sell the company as a whole. We think the best solution is to offer it complete,' Mr Cossio said. The sale of the oil company is part of an ambitious programme of privatisation which Bolivia has just launched. It plans to sell leading state companies, including the oil group, by the summer of 1995, while 75 small and medium sized businesses will be sold by December 1995, he said. State electricity firm Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) is to be sold first, probably in April, Mr Cossio said.</p>

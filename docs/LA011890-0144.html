			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST INTERSTATE CHAIRMAN PINOLA WILL RETIRE IN JUNE  </P> <P> First Interstate Bancorp Chairman Joseph J. Pinola, who aggressively built the  nation's largest interstate banking network but bid unsuccessfully for rival  BankAmerica, announced Wednesday that he will retire June 1.  </P> <P> Pinola, who turns 65 on May 13, will be succeeded as chairman and chief  executive by Edward M. Carson, 60. Both moves were expected. Carson, currently  president of the Los Angeles-based banking company and former head of its  Arizona operation, is expected to cut costs and monitor daily operations more  closely than Pinola.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, First Interstate's announcement came one day after its chief  Los Angeles banking rival, Security Pacific Corp., disclosed that Richard J.  Flamson III will step down as chief executive to be succeeded by Robert H.  Smith.  </P> <P> First Interstate's move comes at a critical point for the nation's 10th-largest  banking firm. It follows two years of turmoil that included big losses stemming  from soft real estate values in Arizona and an ill-fated 1988 acquisition of a  Texas bank. It also has been hurt by a plunging stock price that has made it  vulnerable to takeover bids, and a spectacular May, 1988, fire that destroyed  four floors of its downtown headquarters building.  </P> <P> First Interstate's strategy of operating banks in 14 states, and franchising  banks in still others, is being increasingly questioned. The company sometimes  is viewed like an engine that is chronically out of tune. Losses in Texas and  Arizona units are offsetting strong profits in California, Washington, Oregon  and Nevada.  </P> <P> Next week, First Interstate is expected to announce a quarterly loss that some  securities analysts have projected may exceed $200 million, stemming from $400  million being set aside for real estate problems in Texas.  </P> <P> Those losses stem from the untimely acquisition for $161 million of Allied  Bancshares in Texas, a move both Pinola and Carson acknowledged as a mistake in  separate interviews Wednesday. First Interstate bought the ailing bank with no  federal assistance. Rivals such as NCNB in North Carolina and Banc One in Ohio  later were given assistance to buy similarly troubled banks.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry I made one giant mistake, but I added a lot of territory to the  bank. I feel good about every aspect except Texas," Pinola said.  </P> <P> In choosing Carson, First Interstate's directors stuck to the bank's  traditional, conservative method of succession. In recent months, there had  been rumors that directors might be considering an outsider or might leapfrog  the younger William E. B. Siart into the job. Siart, 43, who heads First  Interstate's California operation, was named to replace Carson as president,  putting him first in line to succeed Carson as chief executive.  </P> <P> But Pinola said the order of transition has been clear for a long time. He  compared the method of succession to something like a baseball farm system,  where executives serve at other banks in the company before returning to  headquarters. Carson headed First Interstate's Arizona operations before it was  hit by problems, and has served in most other areas of the bank.  </P> <P> San Francisco-based bank analyst Donald K. Crowley of Keefe, Bruyette &amp;  Woods called Carson a "journeyman banker" whose record in Arizona was  admirable.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 3-inch Carson became a banker by chance. The son of a truck driver  from Peoria, Ariz., he studied marketing and advertising at Arizona State  University in the early 1950s, playing basketball and serving as student body  president. While in school there, he led a drive to raise money to build a  student union building. One of the Phoenix executives he hit up for money ran  the First National Bank of Arizona, the bank that evolved into First  Interstate's operation there today. Carson impressed the executive, who hired  him.  </P> <P> Carson said he supports interstate banking as a concept, and said he probably  will be more involved in daily operations than Pinola. Carson also said he  probably would not launch the kind of takeover bid like the one that Pinola  launched three years ago for BankAmerica, although he was quick to add that he  supported the bid at the time. BankAmerica, parent of Bank of America,  successfully spurned the $3.9-billion bid.  </P> <P> Acquaintances describe Carson as methodical and more of an operations  executive. Siart, in an interview, called Carson a "hands-on,  take-care-of-the-machine-you've-got kind of guy" as opposed to Pinola, whom  Siart called a visionary.  </P> <P> One sign of Carson's methodical approach is a vacation home in the Arizona  mountains he has been building himself, doing much of the carpentry and other  work. Carson said he has been working on the home off and on for 35 years.  </P> <P> Both Carson and Siart will move to deal directly with problems in Texas and  Arizona. Siart disclosed that he will spend more time dealing with problems in  Texas, while Carson will deal with problems in Arizona because he is more  familiar with it.  </P> <P> One sensitive subject is First Interstate's vulnerability to a takeover, fanned  by periodic comments from Wells Fargo Chairman Carl E. Reichardt that he would  like to buy First Interstate if Pinola only wanted to sell.  </P> <P> Pinola's belief, according to people familiar with his thinking, is that  shareholders could not get a good deal with the stock so low. He also is said  to fear that any takeover would result in a blood bath where many employees are  laid off.  </P> <P> In 1988, Carson earned cash compensation of $638,510, while Pinola earned  $950,916.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERKIN-ELMER MAJORITY STAKE IN CHIP UNIT  </P> <P> Perkin-Elmer Corp. sold most of its semiconductor business to a California  company Tuesday in a move that should ease concerns about a possible loss of  leading-edge computer technology to Japan.  </P> <P> Silicon Valley Group Inc. of San Jose said it will buy more than 60% of the  Wilton, Conn.-based business for more than $20 million.  </P> <P> Perkin-Elmer will retain a minority interest and International Business  Machines Inc. also will buy a minority stake, officials announced through a  telephone conference call with reporters.  </P> <P> IBM also will provide funds to help develop the division's latest technology  and will place large orders with the unit, officials said.  </P> <P> The division produces machines that are used to manufacture computer chips. As  such, it is a critical link in the semiconductor industry.  </P> <P> Norwalk-based Perkin-Elmer reportedly had been discussing a possible sale of  the division to Nikon Corp. last year. The reports touched off concern that a  loss of such vital technology could hamper the ability of American chip makers  to compete with Japanese companies.  </P> <P> Perkin-Elmer has refused to comment on speculation about a sale in Japan, but  analysts believe that a number of Japanese companies were interested in buying  the business when Perkin-Elmer put it up for sale two years ago.  </P> <P> "The real story here is that we're seeing U.S. companies band together to  defend a key technology for future chip development," said Mark FitzGerald,  senior industry analyst with Dataquest of San Jose.  </P> <P> The division makes machines that use optical lithography to etch patterns on  computer chips. Its critical technology is called the Micrascan System, a tool  that can etch a pattern on smaller wafers with greater sharpness.  </P> <P> The technology still is under development and will not be used in full-scale  manufacturing for two to three years, although IBM is using three machines in  Essex Junction, Vt., to develop new semiconductors, said company spokesman Paul  Bergevin.  </P> <P> FitzGerald said the United States is ahead of the Japanese in developing the  technology.  </P> <P> "The Japanese have such an insurmountable lead at this point in time that if  this technology went to a Japanese company, the U.S. suppliers would be totally  out of leading-edge work" in the semiconductor business, he said.  </P> <P> The deal adds another dimension to SVG's semiconductor business. The company  already makes equipment that prepares wafers for the lithography patterning.  </P> <P> "I can assure you, with the right partners here, we have an excellent chance to  be a global supplier and global competitor," said Papken S. Der Torossian,  president and chief executive officer of SVG. The company earned $9.6 million  on sales of $130 million last year.  </P> <P> He said his company already has paid $20 million for the business, to be called  SVG Lithography Systems Inc. He would not place a total value on the deal but  said the financial arrangements would be detailed in a filing with the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> FitzGerald said he valued the unit at under $100 million.  </P> <P> IBM will provide an unspecified amount of funds to develop the lithography  equipment, along with a chemical compound used to coat the wafer surface for  the etching process.  </P> <P> It also has committed to buying "tens of millions of dollars" worth of the new  machines, Bergevin said.  </P> <P> Sematech, a consortium of government and industry leaders, also will provide  development funding along with technical support.  </P></p>

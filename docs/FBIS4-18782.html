			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Edvard Hoem: "Good Result?"] </F>   [Text] Negotiated result: This is Maastricht realized, in  Norwegian waters and on Norwegian soil.    Negotiations concerning Norwegian membership in the European  Union [EU] have been concluded, the cards are on the table, and  it is up to the Norwegian people to make up their mind. In the  coming debate opponents and proponents will fight over how good  or how bad the outcome of the negotiations is. Some will  continue to insist that there have been no negotiations  concerning the most important items.    It is my honest opinion that the negotiated outcome is  exactly as expected. The Maastricht Treaty contains precisely  the same principles about free access to markets, common prices,  regional support arrangements, and the prohibition of special  national arrangements that the final agreement between Norway  and the EU embodies.    That is why the negotiated result should be an important  element for any one who wants to make up his mind on what  membership in the EU will involve for our country. The  negotiated result is the Union's policy realized, it is the  Maastricht Treaty carried out, in Norwegian waters and on  Norwegian soil.    The government entered into negotiations with demands for  extensive exceptions and with adamant language concerning  fishing quotas and [national] rights.    Not on one single point did the negotiators win acceptance  for special national arrangements that were at variance with the  Union plan. All those positions that were intended to secure  national control were abandoned on the way. Otherwise there  would not have been a negotiated result at all! In this decisive  phase the EU could not hit itself on the head by offering Norway  conditions that were contrary to its comprehensive ambitions.  The Union had no way of yielding anything as far as the  framework in principle was concerned. An independent Norwegian  fishing policy or agricultural policy neither can nor will exist  any longer, just as the Norwegian sea, and definitely  Norwegians' right to their own administrative law or right to  govern will be no more. The fishing policy and agricultural  policy, monetary policy, and trade policy will from now on be a  Union matter and common policy. Our ocean will become a Union  ocean and Norwegian fishermen will be Union citizens, in the  same way that other fishermen and tailors and office clerks are  citizens of the EU. If we do the best we know how, the present  quotas and historical rights might last through the year 2002.  After that day there are absolutely no more legal, political,  moral, or constitutional guarantees for Norwegian fishermen,  either outside or inside the Norwegian 12 mile limit.    That is why it is a political sleight of hand to use the  frictions within the present EU as an example of what the  various nations can determine in the future. The fight over  voting rules in the Council of Ministers is a fight over the  drive and energy of the Union project, not about the direction  and the goal. The Norwegian Government, which has warmly  embraced the plans for union in the Maastricht Treaty, will  logically have to support those who advocate far-reaching  majority decisions and a high threshold for the right of the  minority to block decisions.    Therefore, the only thing left is to state the following:  The  agreement with the European Union is a document of the greatest  historical importance. The government will make our country into  a federal state in a forthcoming, strong union. The agreement  takes away from us our status as a small, but active participant  on the international arena, and makes us live on the fringe of  Europe.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: TO MASH, RICE OR WHIP -- PONDERING THE OPTIONS OF POTATO  PREPARATION  </P> <P> When it comes to mashed potatoes, there is little consensus about what is  correct or incorrect. The answers to such questions as what is the best utensil  to use for mashing the spuds and whether they should or shouldn't have lumps  are strictly a matter of personal preference.  </P> <P> What does make a difference, however, is the variety used for mashing. Of the  two basic types of potatoes -- waxy and nonwaxy -- the latter are best suited  for this procedure because of their low sugar and high starch content.  </P> <P> If placed in a solution of one of pound salt in one gallon of water, waxy  potatoes will float, while more dense nonwaxy potatoes will sink to the bottom.  Unfortunately, this is not a very practical test to conduct while shopping at  the supermarket, so generally speaking, rely on the thick-skinned potatoes such  as russets to be nonwaxy.  </P> <P> Select potatoes that are firm, free from large cuts, growth cracks and  sprouting eyes. Avoid any with green tinged skins.  </P> <P> According to "The Whole Potato Catalog," a publication of the Potato Board,  potatoes to be mashed may be either boiled or steamed:  </P> <P> "To Boil: In a heavy saucepan with tight-fitting lid, cook potatoes in about  one inch of boiling, salted water until fork-tender. Whole, 30 to 40 minutes;  cut-up, 20 to 25 minutes. (If lid doesn't fit tightly, water may boil away so  check occasionally and add more water if necessary.)  </P> <P> "To Steam: Place wire rack on bottom of a kettle or large saucepan and add  water to just below the level of the rack. Bring the water to a boil, add  potatoes and cook, tightly covered, until fork-tender. Whole, 30 to 45 minutes;  cut-up, 20 to 30 minutes. (Check occasionally to see if water should be added,  if lid is not tight fitting.)"  </P> <P> Most people prefer to peel potatoes before cooking, however this step can be  done afterwards, or when using a ricer may be eliminated to save time. During  boiling, pieces of nonwaxy varieties tend to slough off and the potatoes lose  their shape. Once cooked, boiled potatoes should be drained well before  mashing.  </P> <P> Milk, evaporated milk, half and half or cream may be used when mashing  potatoes. Whatever the choice, it should be heated; adding cold liquid cools  the potatoes and tends to make them gummy.  </P> <P> The more liquid used, the more creamy and thinner the end product. The amount  needed also varies depending on the potatoes -- soil, climate and fertilizer  used during growth all have their effects. Softened butter or margarine, salt  and pepper are optional additions.  </P> <P> Use a potato masher, electric mixer or ricer to mash the potatoes. Following  are techniques for using each device.  </P> <P> POTATO MASHER: Press the tool into the potatoes in a downward motion, forcing  them through the cutting grid. Gradually add milk, butter and salt and pepper  to taste, beating with the potato masher, fork or wire whisk until light and  fluffy.  </P> <P> ELECTRIC MIXER: Begin by mashing the potatoes slightly with the stationary  beaters. Turn the mixer on low speed and whip to the desired consistency,  gradually adding milk, butter and salt and pepper to taste.  </P> <P> RICER: Place the boiled potatoes in the perforated cylinder, then squeeze the  long handles together to force the contents through the ricer holes. Let the  rice-like pieces mound in the serving dish. Gradually add milk, butter and salt  and pepper to taste and beat the potatoes with a fork, spoon or wire whisk  until light and fluffy.  </P> <P> Most sources agree that mashed potatoes are best served immediately. If they  must be held, spoon into a buttered casserole and smooth a light film of cream  over the top. Keep warm in an oven heated to 250 degrees.  </P> <P> Another technique is to set the pan of finished potatoes in a larger one of hot  water. Cover with a towel to absorb the steam.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

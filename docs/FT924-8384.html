			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Robert Bass in push for MCC's US businesses The Robert Bass group is pushing for the right to make direct presentations on its offer of about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m) for the main US businesses of Maxwell Communication Corporation. A group of investors led by Keystone, formally the Robert M Bass Group and Acadia an investment partnership including Mr Bass, confirmed yesterday that it had made an offer for the Macmillan publishing businesses and the Official Airline Guides. The offer is Dollars 725m cash plus the assumption of all liabilities to third parties. Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, has rebuffed the approach on the grounds that it is at the bottom end of their Dollars 700m-Dollars 1.1bn expectations net of tax and other obligations. Price Waterhouse and JP Morgan, its US adviser, have said they plan to sell OAG and float Macmillan. Those involved in the approach believe the bid represents full value. It is clear that negotiations over the offer have not been ruled out.</p>

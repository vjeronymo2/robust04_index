			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance given Pounds 98.5m tag INDEPENDENT Insurance, the first insurer to obtain a listing since the second world war, yesterday announced an issue price of 225p per share, valuing the group at Pounds 98.5m, writes Richard Lapper. A placing and intermediaries offer by Lazard Brothers and Noble &amp; Co will raise about Pounds 25.1m net to fund growth. The group issued 11.8m new ordinary shares and 400,600 ordinary shares were sold by existing institutional shareholders. Some 6.67m ordinaries are being placed firm and 5.53m are being placed subject to recall to satisfy valid applications received under the intermediaries offer. COMMENT Independent looks to be an attractive addition to the composite insurance sector where it can be compared against larger rivals. The company is tightly managed and tends to focus on specialised areas of the market. Its exclusive focus on the UK might be viewed as a drawback by some investors, especially amid indications that rate competition is returning to the motor market. However, Independent has placed emphasis on underwriting discipline in the past, which ensured it remained in the black between 1990 and 1992. Earnings per share in 1992 amounted to 10.9p putting the shares on an historic p/e of 20.6. A forecast net dividend of 8.25p puts the shares on a prospective gross yield of 4.6 per cent. Overall, the company looks good value against the composites. The shares can be expected to trade to a premium when dealings begin on November 22.</p>

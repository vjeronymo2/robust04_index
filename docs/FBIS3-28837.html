A British television documentary released this week claims  many survivors of the Dili massacre were later killed by  Indonesian troops as they lay in hospital beds. Mr. Keating  says the Australian Government will seek further information  from the Indonesian foreign minister on the claim. The  Australian journalist, John Pilger, has claimed in a new  documentary that a form of genocide has been going on in East  Timor for 18 years. In the documentary called Death of a  Nation, Mr. Pilger, alleges there were three massacres in Dili  in 1991. Unidentified people in the film claim they were  tortured by the Indonesian military. The film also shows  footage of bones being unearthed from what is alleged to be a  mass grave. Mr. Pilger said the film should provoke new  condemnation of Indonesia and further investigation.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON SHUTS OUT UCLA IN SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Before Cal State Fullerton's softball game against top-ranked UCLA Sunday,  starting pitcher Ann Van Dorchert told Coach Judi Garman that she felt ill.  </P> <P> "I told her, 'Great, that's when you usually pitch your best games because you  are so worried about being sick that your concentration on pitching is better,'  " Garman said.  </P> <P> Van Dorchert left the UCLA hitters feeling ill, pitching a three-hit, 2-0  victory.  </P> <P> The victory gave the fourth-ranked Titans a four-game split in the Big  West-Pacific 10 Showdown, a tournament featuring six top-20 ranked teams.  </P> <P> "Van Dorchert did a nice job today of keeping us off-balance," UCLA Coach  Sharon Backus said. "Give all the credit to the Titans."  </P> <P> Fullerton topped No. 15 Arizona State, 3-2, in its first game Sunday.  </P> <P> Against UCLA, Titan center fielder Mich DeBree, who earned all-tournament  honors, had the key hit in the second inning. Her line-drive single to center  drove in the only two runs of the game.  </P> <P> Van Dorchert took care of the rest, improving her record to 2-1, and giving  Fullerton some much needed confidence.  </P> <P> "Against UCLA yesterday, some of the players were scared to death," Garman  said. "But it will give you confidence when you beat the No. 1 team in a  well-played game.  </P> <P> "Heck, and Ann's only a sophomore," Garman said. "Here we are handing her the  ball for the big game with UCLA, telling her she's our No. 1 pitcher and she's  supposed to carry the team.  </P> <P> "Today, Ann proved that she can handle those big games."  </P> <P> Pitching depth could be a problem for Fullerton this season, with only Van  Dorchert, sophomore Shireen Campbell, who started only four games last season,  and freshman Tracy Tousley available.  </P> <P> But Fullerton's offense features two returning first-team All-Americans, senior  right fielder Carey Hess (team-high .409 batting average, 52 runs scored) and  senior first baseman Missy Coombes (.359 batting average, team-high 29 runs  batted in).  </P> <P> The Titans also returned 12 of 16 players from a squad that had a team average  of .267 last season and averaged more than three runs a game.  </P> <P> "This tournament showed us what areas we need to work on in practice," Garman  said. "I feel pretty good right now, and I think if Ann's healthy, we can beat  anyone."  </P> <P> In the Pacific 10 wrestling:  </P> <P> Cal State Bakersfield 29, Cal State Fullerton 6 -- Lyndon Campbell won a 5-3  decision at 134 pounds and Ramon Diza won a 3-1 decision at 177 pounds for  visiting Fullerton.  </P></p>

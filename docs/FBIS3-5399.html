"The residence of Koreans in Sakhalin is attributable to the  Japanese imperialists who illegally occupied Korea and forcibly  took Koreans there by issuing the unlawful `general mobilization  order', drove them hard and left them there", he noted, and went  on:    "The problem of the Koreans taken to the Far East of Russia  by the Japanese imperialists is not confined to over 40,000  Koreans now residing in Sakhalin. It can be solved only when  the Japanese Government sincerely apologizes and makes post-war  compensations to the entire Koreans living scattered all over  the territory of the former Soviet Union.    "We Koreans in Russia join all other Koreans living in the  territory of the former Soviet Union in strongly opposing the  sinister and crafty scheme of the South Korean and Japanese  authorities to move our fellow countrymen to South Korea we will  wage a vigorous struggle for defence of our national dignity and  interests."</p>

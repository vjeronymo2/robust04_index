			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON FAMILY CLAIMED ACTIONS RUINED FURNITURE BUSINESS;  </P> <P> UNION BANK AGREES TO SETTLE LENDER-LIABILITY LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Union Bank has agreed to settle a lawsuit involving claims by a Compton family  that California's fifth-largest bank ruined the family's  furniture-manufacturing business, an attorney for the family and court records  disclosed Thursday.  </P> <P> The agreement to settle the lender-liability case was reached Wednesday, just  before a Los Angeles Superior Court jury was scheduled to consider awarding  punitive damages to the family.  </P> <P> The jury already had decided the case in favor of Contempo Metal Furniture and  the family of the late Louis Schuster, owners of the defunct company. Last  Friday, the jury awarded compensatory damages of $12.5 million to the business  and various family members. Schuster died last November.  </P> <P> Compensatory damages are designed to cover actual losses. In the second phase  of the trial, the jury was to consider punitive damages, which are supposed to  serve as a deterrent.  </P> <P> The family was seeking an additional $20 million in punitive damages. But  lawyers for the bank and family reached an agreement to settle out of court  before that phase of the trial started.  </P> <P> A. Barry Cappello, a Santa Barbara attorney who represented the Schusters,  refused to disclose how much money the family will receive. He said the bank  asked that the settlement terms be kept confidential.  </P> <P> "Our clients are delighted with the settlement," said Cappello, a pioneer in  the growing lender-liability field in which borrowers are suing banks when they  believe that the lenders contributed to their financial problems.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Union Bank said, "We think it is a good settlement."  </P> <P> The events that led to the lawsuits occurred before Los Angeles-based Union  Bank was acquired last year by California First Bank in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The case stemmed from the closing of Contempo Metal Furniture in Compton in  1985. The bank contended in a lawsuit that the Schusters had mismanaged the  company and caused its failure. The family filed a countersuit charging that  the bank had forced them to hire two outside consultants who were responsible  for the collapse.  </P> <P> The family's suit said the bank failed to disclose that one of the consultants  was a personal friend of the bank loan officer on the account and that the bank  misrepresented the qualifications of the consultants.  </P> <P> The consultants, William M. Leider and Jerald C. Murphy, were named in the  family's countersuit but they settled their portion of the case two days after  the trial began in late December.  </P> <P> Steven E. Young, the attorney for the consultants, said their settlement did  not contain any admission of wrongdoing and they did not pay any money to the  Schusters. "They have categorically denied any wrongoing, but they could not  afford to continue to defend this case," said Young, who added that settlement  talks had begun before the start of the trial.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Contempo was founded in the early 1960s by Louis  and Edythe Schuster. It was a profitable, family-run business until 1979, when  a recession in the industry led to its first loss. The losses continued into  1982.  </P> <P> Robert Schuster, who had been running the company for his father, introduced a  new line of furniture in mid-1982, which he felt guaranteed a return to  profitability. He sought a $200,000 line of credit to finance the manufacture  of the new line from Union Bank, where the company had banked for years.  </P> <P> The family's lawsuit said a bank loan officer, James Goswiller, said the loan  would not be approved unless outside consultants were hired and recommended the  new investment.  </P> <P> The suit said Goswiller, now a senior vice president at the bank, suggested  hiring Leider and Murphy without disclosing that he was a personal friend of  Leider's. The suit also said bank officials inflated the qualifications of the  consultants.  </P> <P> Over the next two years, the consultants took control of the company, received  stock in Contempo and excluded the Schusters from the decision making process,  the family's suit said.  </P> <P> The company's debt to Union Bank rose to $3.2 million, and Contempo was closed  in late 1985 after Union Bank foreclosed on the loans and sold the company's  assets at auction.  </P></p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not really so friendly? Sir, In your report on friendly societies' diversification plans ('Time to put away their knitting needles', January 8/9) you quote one of their representatives as saying: 'If I could pay something now to make sure my mother would never come and live with me, I probably would.' If this is to be the driving spirit in future, surely the societies should be obliged to change the name on the umbrella under which they trade. What does mother think?

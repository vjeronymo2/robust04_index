			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Individual producers are allowed, with respect to some commodities, to participate in the price support program with the eligible commodity stored on the farm. To ensure that individual producers and CMA members may participate in the price support program on an equal basis, this proposed rule revises redesignated &sect;1425.17(c)(2) to allow members to deliver farm-stored commodity, except when prohibited for individual producers not participating in a price support program as CMA members, to an eligible pool. This will allow the efficient use of member farm storage until the commodity is marketed or moved to other storage facilities. Any unauthorized removal of farm-stored loan collateral would be a violation of the regulations and subject the CMA to the same sanctions applied to individual producers for unauthorized removal of loan collateral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual producers may only pledge otherwise eligible commodity as collateral for a CCC loan that is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, or the producer must obtain a lien waiver where any lien or encumbrance exists. While minimum financial requirements that an approved CMA must maintain are sufficient to protect CCC's interest from outstanding liens or encumbrances based on a CMA's member's actions, the risk from liens and encumbrances resulting from the CMA actions could be more severe. Therefore, this proposed rule adds paragraph (c)(5) to redesignated &sect;1425.17 to provide that a commodity offered as collateral for a CCC loan shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances based on the actions of the CMA or the CMA shall obtain lien waivers for such liens. In addition, the CMA shall not take any action that would create a lien or encumbrance on the commodity while it is pledged as collateral for a CCC loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation provides that net loan proceeds, less authorized charges, from loans not repaid within 15 days must be distributed to eligible pool members within 15 days. This is to ensure that members promptly benefit from loans not redeemed within the time period. However, this provision has not been extended to loan deficiency payments. As a result, an approved CMA is under no obligation to distribute loan deficiency payments to members in a timely manner. This proposed rule revises redesignated &sect;1425.18(a) to require that proceeds from loan deficiency payments must be distributed within 15 days. In addition, the proposed rule clarifies that 15 days means 15 work days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of a producer's failure to fully comply with price support regulations, disbursements to individual producers are not made until such obligations are satisfied. This proposed rule extends this procedure to CMA members by adding paragraph (b)(5) to redesignated &sect;1425.18 to require an approved CMA, when notified by CCC, to refrain from making pool disbursements, based on the commodity delivered to an eligible pool, to a member and to reimburse such funds to CCC, as directed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation prohibits an approved CMA from discriminating against or otherwise denying any producer's participation with respect to any benefits resulting from its approval to obtain price support as provided in applicable nondiscrimination statutes. The current regulation does not specifically identify marital status, physical disability, and mental disability as grounds for discrimination. This proposed rule revises redesignated &sect;1425.20 to prohibit discrimination of an approved CMA member based on marital status, physical disability, or mental disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers who participate in CCC price support program through an approved CMA also may participate in the price support programs through county ASCS offices. As a result, CCC must obtain member information from an approved CMA that can be combined with information in county ASCS offices to monitor a member's overall activity. Accordingly, this proposed rule adds a new &sect;1425.23 to provide that an approved CMA shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Annually provide a report of the amount of commodity received from members by farm numbers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. At least annually, report by crop year and commodity the sum of marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments received on behalf of each producer member. This information will help CCC monitor the amount of the commodity delivered from a farm to an approved CMA in order to, among other things, evaluate individual producer requests for commodity disaster payments and to monitor producer payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1425  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cooperatives, Price support programs, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it is proposed that 7 CFR part 1425 be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1425_COOPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATIONS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Men in the News: Five men in a bit of theatre - The Savoy board It's show time]' exulted one City analyst as the curtain rose on the latest act in the Forte group's battle to take over Savoy hotels. Founded by Richard D'Oyly Carte, manager of Gilbert and Sullivan, the Savoy has never lacked dramatic flair. In the past week, a Savoy director has admitted he told a journalist the subject of a document on his desk - but added that anyone who suggested he had revealed the details would hear from his solicitors. His chairman said it was a perfectly acceptable explanation but he had had enough of the whole Savoy business anyway. A managing director has issued a statement from a board which was astonished to hear it had met. The managing director is packing his desk as a result. And the man who could decide how the story ends runs a golf course and was once cornered by police in the south of France suspected of being Lord Lucan. On Tuesday, four of the principal characters in the saga will meet their fellow Savoy directors to see if they can resolve the issues raised by the week's events and other matters which date back 13 years, since Forte first began its quest for control. Forte now has 68 per cent of the shares but only 42 per cent of the votes. The four are Sir Anthony Tuke, 74, the Savoy's chairman for 10 years who is desperate to retire; Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte and a Savoy director since the two sides agreed an uneasy truce in 1989; Sir Michael Richardson, who has just announced his retirement as chairman of securities house Smith New Court and who did not leak the document to the Sunday papers; and Mr John Sinclair, Lucan lookalike, who is chief executive of an East Sussex golf course, and controls shareholding trusts which could give Forte control of the Savoy. The fifth character - Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing director - will probably not be at the board meeting, and, if he is, it will be for the last time. After 15 years of running the Savoy group - whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught - he is leaving, possibly as early as Monday. Some directors are thought to favour as his replacement Mr Ramon Pajares, the Spanish-born general manager of the Four Seasons (formerly the Inn on the Park), one of London's most respected hotels. The unfailingly courteous Mr Shepard always opposed a Forte takeover, saying the hotels would lose their character. Mr Shepard, one of whose hobbies is embroidery, has definite ideas on the right and wrong way to do things. He is always impeccably dressed. Mr Forte once said he would not employ Mr Shepard as a doorman. The oft-told story that Mr Shepard then greeted Mr Forte at the Savoy dressed as a doorman is nonsense; Mr Shepard has his own uniform, which includes a waistcoat, tie pin and highly polished shoes. It is true that Mr Shepard and Mr Forte have no great regard for one another. But Mr Forte has tried to put his acrimony aside. Instead, he has spent the past months persuading fellow directors that the problem with the Savoy hotels is they are not well run, turning in profits of only Pounds 725,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 83.3m. Mr Forte's tactics have been effective. Several of Mr Shepard's allies deserted him - or began to listen to what Forte had to say. One who began listening was Mr Sinclair. Mr Sinclair, who is 41 today, is steeped in Savoy culture. He was a Savoy management trainee, reception manager at Claridge's and general manager of the Lancaster, the Savoy's Paris hotel. He became a Savoy director last year with Mr Shepard's support. Mr Sinclair is trustee for some of the interests of the family of Sir Hugh Wontner, Savoy president until his death in 1992. Sir Hugh ferociously opposed Forte, but trustees have to be guided by their beneficiaries' interests (rather than sentiment) on the question of whether the Savoy hotels' performance would improve if they were merged with Forte's luxury establishments. The discussions continue. If Mr Sinclair allies himself with Forte, it would give the latter control without spending another penny. Sir Anthony Tuke, a Savoy loyalist throughout the 1980s battle against Forte is credited by both sides with having taken an even-handed approach since the truce and Mr Forte's accession to the board. He hopes to announce his replacement on Tuesday. Several close observers believe Sir Michael Richardson would like to be chairman. Sir Michael was also on the Savoy board during the initial battle but he too drifted over to the Forte side. It was while he was being interviewed earlier this month about his retirement from Smith New Court that a journalist asked him about Mr Shepard's document lying on his desk. Sir Michael says he told the journalist it was about the Savoy but revealed no details - an explanation accepted by Sir Anthony. Some of the details did appear, however. Mr Shepard issued a statement which said: 'The board of the Savoy group is dismayed that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has decided to discuss confidential papers with the press.' The board, however, had issued no such statement. Mr Shepard had acted on his own, apparently convinced that, as the guardian of the group's spirit and traditions, he could speak on Savoy's behalf. The board, however, had moved on, leaving Mr Shepard behind. Sir Anthony's even-handedness towards Mr Shepard ended. He described his behaviour as 'extraordinary'. This week, the two warring sides hope to put the dissension of 13 years behind them and appoint a new chairman and a managing director who will represent them all.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Starmin seeks reappointment STARMIN, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former Conservative party minister, will seek shareholders' permission to reappoint a director who resigned as an executive a month before it emerged that pre-tax losses had been understated by millions of pounds. The company's 1992 report and accounts includes a resolution to be put to the annual meeting for the reappointment of Mr Raschid Abdullah, now a non-executive director who, with his brother Osman, relinquished executive responsibilities in July when a review of the company's accounting policies was announced. The two, who earlier built up the Evered aggregates company, had run Starmin since 1989. Under the company's articles, Mr Raschid Abdullah must secure the approval of the company's AGM on September 21, to remain a non-executive director. The review, completed in August, showed that instead of pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.06m, losses totalled Pounds 11.9m in 1992. Turnover should have been reported as Pounds 18.7m rather than Pounds 20.1m and losses per share 3.6p instead of 2.5p. A separate revaluation led to a write-down of tangible fixed assets of Pounds 4.75m. The company rescinded a proposed final dividend of 0.2p. The discrepancies hinged on profits booked on disposals which were later reversed. The report and accounts show that Lord Parkinson was paid Pounds 30,000 for his duties as a non-executive director in the year to December 31. He became chairman in June. In his statement Lord Parkinson apologises to shareholders for the delay in the publication of the accounts and expresses hope that the company can 'look to the future'.</p>

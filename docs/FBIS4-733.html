			<p>BFN     [Text] On 12 April Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] aircraft bombed Quirima in yet  another attack on the armed forces of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] for having tightened their  siege on (?Malange) to ensure the success of relief operations.  A source with the General Staff of the Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] says the bombing was carried out at  1045, resulting in two dead and four seriously wounded. The  dead include 78-year-old Antonio Jose Capando and a two-year-old  child.    Meanwhile, clashes were reported in Bie yesterday. It all  began when an MPLA-PT air force plane overflew UNITA defense  lines and parachuted lethal equipment. Military sources say  that once government troops realized that the supplies had  fallen beyond their positions, they used force to try to break  through UNITA lines.    FALA forces stationed in Bie are instructed not to react to  any provocation, but had to take action in view of the threat  posed by the advancing troops of Brigadier Simeone. Fire was  exchanged for over three hours. The government army suffered at  least 15 killed and an unspecified number of wounded.    It is believed that a number of civilians have been killed  because of clashes in a residential area. FALA's command in the  city of Bie regret the occurrence and has warned Luanda to  desist from overflying the city of Bie with its air force.  Today the situation returned to normal and the residents were  able to go about their lives.</p>

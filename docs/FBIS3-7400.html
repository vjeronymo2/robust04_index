			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Pressure on the ROK To Purchase Its </F> Attack Weapons"]    [Text] As the North Korean nuclear issue, which was likely  to be resolved through dialogue, has entered a phase of extreme  confrontation, the United States is pressuring the ROK to  purchase its ultramodern weapons, including anti-aircraft  equipment, for increasing the ROK Army's military strength. It  was reported that the United States has already begun to hand  some weapons and equipment over to the ROK Army.    The U.S. media has particularly stressed the aggravation of  the military situation on the Korean peninsula since October  1993, when the United States and North Korea continued to hold  contacts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. Reporting  this, the U.S. media mainly quoted high-ranking officials of the  U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. State Department, which is  in charge of contacts with North Korea, has been busy rather  controlling the public heat caused by those reports on  aggravated tensions that spread like wildfire. Watching this,  our people suspected that the U.S. munitions industry has an aim  to let the ROK purchase its weapons, taking advantage of the  tense situation on the Korean peninsula, and that the U.S.  Department of Defense and U.S. media are helping facilitate the  realization of this aim. They harbored this suspicion although  they had experienced a fratricidal war, and though they were  well aware of the significance of the words, "Forewarned,  forearmed."    Our people, who want the North Korean nuclear issue to be  resolved in a peaceful way, were vexed by reports carried in  January on the U.S. plan to dispatch a national intelligence  team to the ROK and to deploy Patriot missiles and updated  Apache helicopters to U.S. forces in the ROK. This is because  they know that the reinforcement of the ROK-based U.S. forces  may further agitate North Korea, which is demanding that the  United States and the ROK suspend the Team Spirit exercise to  resolve the nuclear issue. The government showed a lukewarm  attitude at that time toward the plan to deploy Patriot missiles  to the ROK-based U.S. forces because it was aware of the  people's anxiety.    The situation, however, has changed. The International  Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspection of North Korean nuclear  facilities ended in dissatisfaction, and the North Korean  nuclear issue has been referred to the UN Security Council.  Moreover, the North Korean chief delegate to South-North  working-level contacts made remarks such as "no hesitation in  bringing about war" and "sea of fire," agitating the people.  U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry said in a news  conference held on 25 March: "The reinforcement of the ROK Army  is a matter of the United States' primary concern." He added:  "The United States will recommend the ROK Army be equipped with  gun-locating radar, Apache attack helicopters, and precision  weapons for destroying guided tanks. Gary Luck, commander of  U.S. Forces Korea, and the ROK Army are now holding intensive  discussions on this matter." Of course, I think, his statement  was made not only because of the North Korean delegate's remark.  Secretary Perry also said that the Patriot missiles in question  will be deployed to the ROK within a month. He explained that  the United States originally planned to deploy the missiles in  the second half of this year as a part of a long-term project of  modernizing the Army, but it has decided to advance the date,  regarding this as a prudent preventive measure. The Patriot  missile is one of the updated weapons that the United States  strongly "recommends" the ROK to purchase.    We are well aware that the United States is greatly  concerned  about North Korea's reaction to be shown in case the United  Nations decides to apply sanctions against it since North Korea  has stated that it would regard any sanction as a provocation.    As Secretary Perry said, however, there is no military  crisis  between the ROK-United States and North Korea. We are not under  an emergency situation, in which a military crisis is likely to  come soon, either. It is necessary, however, for the ROK and  the United States to maintain an iron-tight defense posture in  preparation for an emergency. On the other hand, the two  countries should also continue to make efforts to resolve the  nuclear issue through dialogue. The United States should not  force the ROK to purchase attack weapons, taking advantage of  the tensions between South and North Korea.</p>

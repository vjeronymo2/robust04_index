			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Lira falls below floor despite German-Italian intervention THE Italian and German central banks failed to stop the lira falling below its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, despite intervening to buy the Italian currency on the foreign exchange markets. The forced intervention by the Bank of Italy and the Bundesbank came even though the Italian government decided earlier this week to seek emergency powers from parliament which would allow it to rule by decree in the event of an economic emergency. Yesterday, the four parties in the Italian government coalition appeared to accept assurances from Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, that his request for special powers to tackle an economic emergency would not infringe the sovereignty of parliament. But neither this, nor the recent rise in Italy's discount rate by 1.75 percentage points, could steer foreign currency speculators away from a growing conviction that the lira is a prime candidate for devaluation, whatever the result of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20. The Italian currency closed in London last night at L765.7, below its ERM floor against the D-Mark of L765.4. Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy will be forced to support the lira through intervention today if the Italian currency is still at this rate when ERM trading opens. The Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy conducted a modest intervention on the foreign exchanges to support the lira, as is required under ERM rules. But Mr Carlo Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, revealed new tension with the Bundesbank by saying that German interest rates were 'excessively high' and should be cut. Mr Ciampi told a parliamentary committee that 'in Germany the task of rebuilding the east must not prevent interest rates falling from their current levels.' Mr Amato appeared before the Senate yesterday morning to explain his proposal. He said the government needed measures to take rapid decisions to cope with fast changing market conditions at a time of economic crisis. He based the idea on a June 1967 decree introduced by the West German government. He suggested the Senate and Chamber of Deputies should form a commission, each providing 15 members, in the event of an emergency being invoked to monitor government actions. Under the proposal, the governor of the Bank of Italy would decide when circumstances warranted resorting to the emergency powers. The government gave no indication on the timetable for submitting the decree to parliament. But if Mr Amato is confident he has the backing of his four party coalition with a 16 seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it will be processed quickly.

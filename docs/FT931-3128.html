			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan ire on Cocom 'breaches' AN advisory body to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has accused European and US companies of violating restrictions on exporting sensitive technologies to China. The Centre for Information on Strategic Technology, comprising industry representatives, said investigations of Chinese factories had identified a range of sophisticated machine tools, exports of which were prohibited by the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). In recent years, Japanese technology producers have admitted exporting equipment illegally to the former Soviet Union and Iran, but the industry is angry that Japanese companies should be thought less ready than others to respect Cocom regulations. The confidential Cistec report describes results of visits to factories in Chinese cities by member companies, which claim to have found banned equipment apparently from US and European producers. Miti has supported an easing of technology export restrictions, but officials in the Foreign Ministry are concerned that some equipment could be used to help the Chinese army in its ambitious plans to develop high-tech weaponry. This is a view shared by Washington.</p>

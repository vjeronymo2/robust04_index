			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 2 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] As the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  has practically issued an ultimatum on the inspection of nuclear  fuel rods in relation to the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected  development of nuclear devices, the government says: "We will  reach a conclusion in the next few days."    According to a top government official Japan is closely  watching moves by both North Korea and the United States.    The government's basic understanding is that the DPRK does  not recognize IAEA as a viable negotiating partner, and it wants  to break the deadlock through negotiations with the United  States.    At the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 1 June,  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said: "North Korea wants to give  priority to talks with the United States. It is not responding  to Japan's persuasion."    He said that although Japan has been talking with the DPRK  unofficially through its embassy in Beijing and its UN mission,  such efforts had been unsuccessful.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told the committee: "We are  seriously concerned. We hope to somehow win [the DPRK's]  understanding through dialogue."    He stressed Japan's position of approaching this issue  through dialogue.    Kakizawa also said: "If the nuclear issue is resolved, we  would like to go into negotiations to normalize diplomatic  relations."    The normalization of ties would include economic assistance  to the DPRK.    Kakizawa also talked about measures relating to possible UN  sanctions, and indicated that the government was considering  signing an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA) to  enable offering refuelling and other services to U.S. Forces.    Apparently, while the government's basic position is to  promote dialogue, but it is also dealing with the possibility of  sanctions, adopting a carrot-and-stick strategy.</p>

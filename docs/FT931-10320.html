			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Time for taxing the chancellor - In the run-up to the Budget, Charles Batchelor offers a guide for small business lobbyists After decades of neglect small businesses are now rarely out of the headlines. Are the banks being beastly? Have Whitehall and Brussels tied them up in red tape? The climate in which small firms operate is subject to constant scrutiny. But important though these issues are, of even greater significance is the tax regime in which business operates. The run-up to the Budget gives small business lobbyists their best opportunity to influence the man who really matters, the chancellor of the exchequer. The small business groups have been joined in recent years by the more broadly-based business organisations such as the Institute of Directors, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry. All make reference in their budget submissions to the specific problems of small firms. This has been matched by the chancellor's growing willingness to address their particular concerns. The small business community is a large one with basic Tory sympathies. Last year saw changes in the VAT rules, a relaxation of inheritance tax and an easing of the burden of the Uniform Business Rate. In the view of the lobbyists, however, much remains to be done and this year's budget submissions contain a wealth of detailed proposals. The main areas of concern are: VAT. There is widespread concern that frequent adjustments to VAT are turning it into a tax on business instead of, as intended, a tax on final consumption. The IOD warns against it becoming a 'cascade' tax, which 'sticks' and gets built into the costs of businesses further down the chain. The Federation of Small Businesses calls for the elimination of VAT on transactions between VAT-registered businesses by zero rating them. Zero-rating is already applied to cross-border trade within the EC. This would cut administration costs, minimise the problem of bad debts and reduce the risk of incurring penalties without affecting the VAT yield to the Treasury, it says. Raising the VAT threshold to Pounds 50,000 (from the present level of Pounds 36,600) would remove a heavy compliance burden at little cost, the IOD suggests. Capital gains tax. There is widespread agreement among business organisations that by setting this tax at 40 per cent - the same level as the top rate of income tax - the government has put an effective brake on enterprise. Equalising the two taxes took no account of the greater risks associated with building a business, the CBI says. It suggests that assets held for seven years should be exempt. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce limits itself to a call for a review of the tax threshold and suggests treating short-term gains as income. The IOD goes much further, arguing for a drastic cut in or abolition of capital taxes because of their adverse impact on the venture capital industry. The British Venture Capital Association makes its own detailed submission, arguing that the people who build up businesses should enjoy the same tax breaks as entrepreneurs and managers in other countries. In Britain's main competitors these people pay no capital taxes or are taxed at far lower rates. As an interim measure, the association suggests that working directors or managers should qualify for rollover relief on the proceeds of the sale of their shareholdings provided they reinvest the money in an unquoted company within three years. This would enable successful entrepreneurs to start up a second or third business becoming, in the association's graphic phrase, 'serial entrepreneurs'. Alongside rollover relief, the BVCA suggests a further extension of retirement relief, available to people who sell their businesses after the age of 55. It calls for the abolition of the age limit and the raising of eligible gain from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1m. Uniform Business Rate. A reduction in the UBR would be the most effective way of helping businesses survive the recession, according to the IOD and the Forum of Private Business. Business rates form a large part of the total costs of many businesses and cuts would have an immediate impact on cash flow. A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme. For all its faults the BES met a need and its demise at the end of 1993 will leave a gap in the availability of small amounts of equity. Most venture capital companies are not able to provide such small sums economically. The Union of Independent Companies and Federation of Small Businesses have renewed their plea for a small business development bank which would provide inexpensive funds along the lines of the Bank for Reconstruction in Germany. Investment allowances. The chancellor announced a concession in his Autumn statement which permitted businesses to speed up the rate of depreciation for one year only, but business groups are seeking more fundamental alterations. The IOD believes special areas such as research and development spending should have more generous treatment. Together with the CBI, it thinks the accelerating pace of change makes established depreciation criteria look increasingly irrelevant. Is it still realistic, asks the IOD, to expect an industrial building to last for 25 years? It also calls for a change in government policy on what are quaintly known as 'nothings', a ragbag category of business expenses which the Revenue does not allow to be set against tax. They include abortive capital expenditure, lease payments on cars costing more than Pounds 8,000 and, most importantly, the costs of issuing equity capital. The abolition of the BES is an additional reason for a concession on the cost of issuing shares, the IOD says. Inheritance tax. The small business lobby has done quite well in this area in recent years but is keen to finish this tax off for good. Both the IOD and the chambers of commerce are seeking its complete abolition. Even in its present form this tax encourages business owners to retain their assets until death when it might be better for them to pass them earlier to the next generation, the chambers argue. Failing complete abolition, the rate should be halved to 20 per cent and the threshold doubled to Pounds 300,000, the IOD says. Compliance costs. The announcement last week of a comprehensive government campaign against red tape has been given a cautious welcome by the business community, which has nevertheless still targeted instances of bureaucracy in the budget submissions. A decision to levy National Insurance contributions retroactively on benefits in kind has forced many companies to check back through six years of accounts to bring themselves up to date, say the chambers. The different yardsticks that apply to PAYE and National Insurance contributions also complicate life for the small business owner. The heavy costs, in both time and money, incurred by the smaller company in administering VAT, PAYE and National Insurance, justify lower taxes for this sector, says the Forum of Private Business. The recession, coupled with a ballooning public sector borrowing requirement, means Norman Lamont has little scope for cutting taxes on March 16. The small business sector nevertheless believes it has a strong case for sympathetic treatment.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HYATT TO PROVIDE LUXURY HOUSING FOR RETIREES;  </P> <P> HOTEL CHAIN BELIEVES ITS EXPERTISE WILL GIVE IT EDGE IN RUNNING RESIDENCES  </P> <P> Hyatt Corp., the hotel chain renowned for stunning glass atrium lobbies, swank  service and pricey rooms, is planning to try its hand at luxury group-housing  for retirees.  </P> <P> Penny Pritzker, member of the billionaire family that controls Hyatt, said the  Classic Residence subsidiary she heads is part of a broader trend by big  business to get into the fragmented but potentially lucrative market of  residences for retirees.  </P> <P> Classic Residence "was a family-generated idea," she said. "I was very much  involved in it, but we do things as a family."  </P> <P> Those things include 95 U.S. hotels and 50 abroad, a Chicago law firm, casinos,  farmland and about 60 industrial concerns. The Pritzkers are also known for  dabbling in takeover situations, most recently the MCorp banks of Texas and  Eastern Airlines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Study of Housing  </P> <P> Hyatt researchers found that the top 10 providers of group housing for senior  citizens had less than 10 facilities each, Penny Pritzker said in a telephone  interview from Chicago, where the family's operations are based.  </P> <P> "It's been basically a developer-driven business," she said, "and in our view  it's a service business and that's something we know very well."  </P> <P> She predicted there eventually will be "brand consolidation, and we'll be able  to capitalize."  </P> <P> "Our expertise in food and beverage and maid and linen service, and our general  knowledge of consumer services, will give us an edge in the business."  </P> <P> Hyatt is developing Classic Residences in Dallas, Reno and Teaneck, N.J.,  scheduled to open within weeks of each other this summer. Others are under  construction in Riverdale, N.Y., and Chevy Chase, Md.  </P> <P> "Our hope is to do four or five projects a year," Pritzker said.  </P> <P> The Dallas version includes an atrium, a trademark of Hyatt hotels, but that is  just coincidence since the building was purchased by the company from another  developer who originally intended it to be a condominium, said Gary Anderson,  the director of the 147-room project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Not Cheap  </P> <P> It won't be cheap to live in one of the Hyatt homes -- rents in the Dallas  Classic Residence range from $1,800 to $2,600 per month. But Anderson said the  cost is comparable to expenses for maintaining a house, buying groceries and  paying for transportation.  </P> <P> There will be maids, linen service, 24-hour security, planned activities, a  library, 25 meals a month and a concierge to handle requests.  </P> <P> "Hyatt got into the business because we think . . . our ability to provide  quality service, as well as our brand recognition, is something that is  familiar to seniors," Pritzker said.  </P> <P> Potential residents are "individuals who have generally set aside some money  for retirement," Anderson said. "We're looking for the retired school teacher,  the guy who retired from GM . . . fairly everyday people."  </P> <P> The idea is that retirees who have recently sold a house will have a large  amount of cash that they can add to pensions and Social Security to afford the  rent easily.  </P> <P> "The only concern we have . . . is the real estate market," Anderson said.  Houses in Dallas frequently sit unsold for months at a time, a consequence of  the state's depressed economy.  </P> <P> "It's just a fact of doing business in Texas right now," Anderson said.  </P> <P> He predicted Hyatt's Classic Residences will appeal to people who have  sufficient resources to rent out their homes and live in luxury facilities.  </P> <P> Included in the rent is long-term care insurance, which will pay residents $40  a day toward nursing-home care should they need it eventually. Anderson said  the insurance, combined with what residents already were paying in rent, should  cover nursing homes charges.  </P> <P> Hyatt was able to buy the Dallas building, which is within a block of a nursing  home and two blocks of a major Dallas hospital, for less than it could build a  in a similar location, he said.  </P> <P> Hyatt has reached agreement with the nursing home to provide assistance to any  residents who might need it. In other planned locations, a section of the  residence will be set aside for people who need "assisted living."  </P> <P> The Teaneck project already is 25% to 30% leased, and "we're very pleased with  that," Pritzker said.  </P></p>

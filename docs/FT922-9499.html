			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Brazil may request loan tranche delay BRAZIL is likely to ask the International Monetary Fund to delay the second tranche of a Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.18bn) loan agreed earlier this year because it has failed to meet some targets agreed with the Fund. Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, does not want to ask for a waiver fearing this will reflect badly on Brazil, which has never previously come anywhere near completing an IMF programme, according to an Economy Ministry official. Instead, Mr Moreira has apparently suggested to Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, that the Dollars 250m payment due in May be delayed to August, when a six-month review of the programme is due. A collapse of the IMF standby programme would jeopardise the government's economic reform plan and severely set back Brazil's negotiations with creditor banks over a reduction in its foreign debt burden. Mr Pedro Parente, planning secretary, said yesterday the economic programme was going well. 'We have met the majority of targets but some have been missed by a small margin.' The problem lies on the fiscal side. As a result of falling tax revenues, Brazil's economic team has been unable to bring the operating deficit under control. An operating deficit means government revenues have fallen short of expenditures, including interest payments on its debt. Tax receipts fell by 14 per cent in real terms between January and March. Under the terms of the accord signed in January, Brazil must produce a primary surplus - which does not factor in interest payments  - of 3 per cent of GDP by the end of this year. 'We already have a primary surplus but it's just not enough,' Mr Parente said. The economic team hopes that by delaying the second drawdown to August it will gain time for an increase in tax revenues as a result of tax reforms coming into effect this month. The news is likely to increase instability in the Brazilian financial markets. The central bank started intervening again in the gold and parallel (black) dollar markets yesterday after a six-month absence.</p>

In fact, this should help mitigate adverse economic impacts expected by the more conservative red snapper bag limits. NMFS agrees that the shift in effort could increase harvest of Spanish mackerel and the other reef fish species listed in the letter. However, increased effort on those species is less risky than allowing continued overfishing of red snapper, which are more severely overfished. NMFS will continue to monitor harvest of these species under the existing data collection program and will recommend action as appropriate in cooperation with the Regional Fishery Management Councils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Council's letter that requested a seven-fish bag limit noted that charter vessel operators testified to the Council that it was incorrect to assume constant demand for charter trips if the bag limit was reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS acknowledges the possibility that demand for charter trips may decrease, depending on customer reaction to the more conservative bag limit. This was strongly indicated by public comments on the proposed rule, as well as the comment in the minority report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments from the Center, however, indicated substantive concerns over a significant overrun if demand stays constant. Accordingly, NMFS has requested the Council to continue to monitor recreational harvest of red snapper closely throughout the 1995 fishing year and to consider further restrictions if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thirty public comments predicted severe economic impacts following implementation of the more conservative limits. Twenty-one objected to the five-fish bag limit, not the size limit increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS disagrees with these comments. The approved red snapper catch restrictions are being implemented to reduce excessive recreational harvest and thus prevent overfishing of red snapper in 1995. Any adverse economic impacts that may result upon implementation of the final rule depend on the ability of fishermen to switch to alternative species. Negative impacts are expected to be less severe than those that would result from continued overfishing of red snapper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two minority reports were submitted opposing the Council's vote for a seven-fish bag limit and rescission of the regulatory amendment. The first report, signed by one Council member, noted that: The seven-fish bag limit would jeopardize the stock, thereby violating national standard 1; analysis of the seven-fish bag limit was absent, thereby violating national standard 2; two charter vessel operators supported a five-fish bag limit in their testimony to the Council; no public testimony to the Council suggested that implementation of only a size limit increase (as proposed in the Council's letter of November 23, 1994) would reduce the number of trips or level of fishing effort; and maintaining a 7-fish bag limit and increasing the size limit to 15 inches (38.1 cm) would cause a greater overrun than projected by the Center for a more conservative bag limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second minority report in opposition to the Council's vote for a seven-fish bag limit referred to NMFS stock assessment information and public testimony, which indicates that more conservative catch limitations are needed than would be provided under a seven-fish bag limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS agrees with these comments. Maintaining the 7-fish bag limit would not constrain the recreational fishery to its allocation or prevent overfishing. More conservative limits are needed to reduce fishing mortality at the start of the 1995 fishing year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Size Limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Council and 10 of the public comments support the proposed increase in the size limit for recreational catches of red snapper as a substitute for reduced bag limits. The Council's letter requesting the seven-fish bag limit also stated that the increased recreational size limit for red snapper in 1995 would result in reduced availability of legal-sized red snapper to the recreational sector, compared to commercial harvesters under the 14-inch size (35.6 cm) limit during that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

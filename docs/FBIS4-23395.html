			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mohamed Okorijo] </F>   [Text] It is not too much to revisit the Bakassi problem  every now and then. The truth is that the Bakassi crisis, which  has embroiled Nigeria and Cameroon in a near-war situation, is  now like a dormant volcano. Dangerous as this already is, it  seems Cameroon is foolhardy enough to be playing with the tail  of a sleeping cobra. We all know that this can result in the  cobra asserting its self-defensive prowess. Besides, the  Cameroonian press is not helping matters by not being objective  and resorting to self-deception.    For instance, the press in Cameroon anticipates the  withdrawal of Nigeria from Bakassi Peninsula as a result of what  it perceives as sustained international pressure. They believe  that the pullout is probably being delayed while Nigeria  searches for a way to keep its prestige intact as giant of  Africa. Well, this imagined international pressure is a figment  of the imagination of the Cameroonian authorities because  Nigeria feels no such pressure from any quarter.    The fact of Nigeria being the giant of Africa is not  self-aggrandizement. The appellation was thrust on Nigeria by  countries like Cameroon which had at one time or the other  enjoyed enormous largess and support from Nigeria. It is a pity  that the Cameroonian press is mounting a propaganda war that is  giving it ego problems.    The truth is that the Biya administration is struggling  against a dwindling reputation. The press is, therefore,  offering Cameroonians a distraction. But the frustration of the  populace will surely come back once the inebriation of the press  propaganda wears off.    In spite of the heavy propaganda, mounted by Cameroon in  international circles, its case is not progressing well. A good  number of African countries, including Ghana and Guinea, have  blamed Cameroon's threat antics over the Bakassi problem. In  fact, President Rawlings of Ghana is not happy about the  handling of the matter, particularly, at the ECOWAS [Economic  Community of West African States] level.    He is known to have blamed President Soglo of Benin  Republic,  who is current chairman of ECOWAS, for allowing the  Franco-Beninois military exercise at a time Nigeria was having  problems with Cameroon. Although President Soglo apologized for  his action, it is probably belated because his support for the  French in their effort to intimidate Nigeria is what has given  Cameroon the false security that has prolonged the dispute.  Nigeria hopes that level-minded leaders like Rawlings will see  the Bakassi dispute in its true perspective and openly call the  bluff of France's Hitlerism.    While Cameroon is working hard to deceive the world about  the  real situation on the ground in Bakassi Peninsula, it is still  massing French military support. Even as recently as mid-April,  22 military vehicles and a cache of assorted arms and ammunition  came into Cameroon from France to boost the already superfluous  arsenals in the hands of Biya's unwilling soldiers.    But the truth is that the Bakassi topsy-turvy by Cameroon is  a ploy to detract from a restive population. Even those who  want a war do so because they want Biya's administration to be  weakened so that they can have their way. Right now, the  Bakassi campaign has embolden various movements to move from  their desire for restoration of federalism to outright secession.    A forum known as All Anglophone Conference, an umbrella of  many English-speaking groups, is spearheading the campaign. It  has warned that unless the status quo in Cameroon is changed,  secession is the alternative. But Paul Biya, ever so  insensitive about the real problems of his countrymen and  concerned only with his own personal interests, has other  distractions.    At the time the morale of Cameroonian soldiers is very low  with those from the north complaining that they were being  deployed to Bakassi to be eliminated so as to reduce their  population in the Army, Biya was more concerned with erotic  pleasures. At 61, he married 24-year old (Chantal Bevgoron)  last April and left immediately with her to Europe on honeymoon,  leaving Cameroonians to wallow in the depression his Bakassi  campaign has caused.    Well, Cameroonians now know better who their real enemy is  because although Biya has fooled many of them most of the time,  he cannot fool all of them all the time.</p>

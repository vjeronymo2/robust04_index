			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At today's ordinary session, Romania's Government  adopted the following statement in connection with the aberrant  and insulting stands made by the ultranationalist Russian leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy against Romania and the Romanian people.    Our country has recently been included in the cascade of  insults, warnings, ultimatums, and revanchist slogans recently  launched by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party of the Russian Federation, the statement reads.  In the most insulting way, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy went so far as  to state that Romania is an artificial state, consisting of  Italian Gypsies who seized territories from Bulgaria, Hungary,  and Russia. Although these pronouncements look more like the  outcome of a certain pathological rather than political state of  mind, such public statements should not be ignored at all, since  they can become starting points for developments that might have  nefarious consequences for the countries and peoples of Europe  and for humankind in general.    Romania's Government, the statement reads, firmly rejects  and  condemns such beliefs revived from a propaganda arsenal, which  has bloodied the entire planet 50 years ago. In our entire  history, no one has dared to insult the Romanian people in such  an indescribable manner. No criminal plotter against our  national being and identity has ever dared to utter such dirty  invectives against us. We have never allowed and will never  allow anyone to hurt our national dignity. Romania and the  Romanian people have never tolerated and will not tolerate such  aberrations.    Romania's Government unanimously expresses this steadfast  position vis-a-vis Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's irresponsible insults  and is convinced that all the country's citizens and all  Romanian political groupings will have the same intransigent  attitude of condemning and rejecting such a serious affront.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's irresponsible statements are  actually  an attempt on our national security. Other extremist statements  of his made about European matters are quite inflammatory and  jeopardize the stability and security in our region and Europe.  This fully justifies our concern with defending our national  security interests, especially now on the eve of the forthcoming  NATO high-level meeting.    At the same time, Romania's Government again points out that  our country has supported and continues to support the  democratic process in the Russian Federation and President Boris  Yeltsin's reform program. We also consider their success as a  guarantee for security and stability in Europe and the world.  We are interested in developing good relations with the Russian  Federation. Therefore, we express the hope that the president  and Government of the Russian Federation will distance  themselves most clearly from Zhirinovskiy's positions, including  his insulting statements against Romania.    We express the conviction that the realistic and reforming  forces in the Russian Federation will prevail in the positive  evolutions toward democratic reconstruction, so as to bar the  way of extremism and ultranationalism, facilitate the  development of a Europe of peace and good understanding, and  further consolidate the traditional Romanian-Russian relations  -- the declaration of the Romanian Government, which we received  by fax from the spokesman of the executive branch, concludes.</p>

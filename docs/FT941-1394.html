			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Technology: A spy looks down - A look at a satellite designed to watch for signs of nations assembling nuclear weapons As international arms control negotiators continue a frustrating diplomatic struggle with North Korea over access to facilities that they suspect may be part of a secret nuclear weapons programme, US intelligence agencies are focusing on a military satellite orbiting far above the Korean peninsula. The satellite is keeping tabs on a 5MW nuclear reactor near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. As long as the satellite continues to detect heat from the reactor, US officials can be relatively confident that North Korea is not in the process of building a bomb: it would need to shut down the reactor before it could extract waste fuel and process it to make plutonium for a nuclear weapon. But if the satellite detects any significant cooling - the first sign of a shutdown - all bets are off. Korea could have a working weapon within months, and the time for diplomacy will have passed. If a major US research programme quietly launched over the past two years is successful, this satellite may be joined by many others keeping similar vigils - an entirely new generation of remote-sensing orbiters, all watching for signs of some nation trying to assemble a nuclear arsenal. Scientists in the programmes say such satellites will never totally replace ground inspections and traditional intelligence for spotting nuclear outlaws in the making. But the lessons of the 1991 face-off with Iraq are still fresh in the minds of non-proliferation specialists: Iraq kept international monitors at bay for months, and when the inspectors did get in they found Iraq's nuclear programme was far more advanced than they had suspected. The appeal of satellite monitoring is that it provide a means of detecting the signs of nuclear proliferation without the diplomatic brinkmanship and face-offs that plague traditional inspections. At US government laboratories in New Mexico and Livermore, California, researchers who were once designing Star Wars satellites to shoot down nuclear-tipped enemy missiles are now working to see that these nuclear warheads are never built at all. Their new project is a space shield of a different sort: a nuclear proliferation-sensing network of surveillance satellites. The early warning technologies they will carry go far beyond the cameras and simple sensors of most current remote-sensing orbiters. In one part of the programme, which is expected to cost Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) a year by 1995, researchers are developing multi-spectral sensors that could spot anything from chemical residue released during plutonium reprocessing to the distinctive heat signature of a nuclear reactor in a weapons material production cycle - even before the nuclear material is removed. Meanwhile, other researchers are looking at the possibility of detecting even more subtle warning signs, such as the electromagnetic signals emitted by isotope-separating centrifuges and the characteristic vegetation damage near tanks storing waste from weapons production. The details of which signatures the researchers are focusing on and how they will achieve the needed sensitivity are secret. 'The real concern is that if you show your hand, there may be counter-measures that make your job harder,' says Robert Scarlett, who manages the proliferation detection programme at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico. First in operation will be a technology that has its roots in sensors carried aboard secret satellites used since the 1970s to spot nuclear tests. In 1995, the US Department of Energy plans to launch a satellite known as Forte, for Fast On-board Recording of Transients Experiment. The satellite is designed to use on-board electronics to distinguish between the electromagnetic signature of lightning and that of a nuclear explosion. Lightning has been the source of false alarms in the past, says Max Koontz, the department's programme manager. A year later, the US plans to launch the first of a new generation of proliferation-sensing satellites that may be able to spot nuclear signs even earlier. The Dollars 70m Multi-Spectral Thermal Imager should be able to detect heat fluctuations from reactor cooling towers and waste water, even through clouds. In an initial test, researchers on the ground will directly measure heat output at the Savannah River weapons production facility in Tennessee, which has several nuclear reactors that can produce weapons materials; at the same time, the satellite will measure the same thermal emissions from space. Comparing the 'ground truth' with the space readings will allow the researchers to gauge the sensitivity of space detection and calibrate the sensors. Later, the Los Alamos group hopes to design and fly other multi-spectral sensors which will attempt to use techniques similar to those of their brethren in environmental remote sensing to detect vegetation changes around nuclear processing plants. Uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing yield large amounts of chemical waste, including organic compounds, acids and fluorine. Laboratory scientists say satellites could spot characteristic 'kill zones' around waste holding tanks, where chemicals associated with nuclear processing have contaminated the soil or ground water and killed vegetation. Other teams are hoping to use laser beams to probe gaseous emissions from suspected bomb factories, looking for unique reflections and absorptions that might indicate the presence of tell-tale weapons production by-products. Even the optimists in the programme expect that it will be more than a decade before any of the new proliferation-sensing technologies are actually in use. 'The further we get into this, the harder we realise it is,' says David Dye, leader of the Lawrence Livermore laboratory's intelligence and national security technologies programme. But with half a dozen nations threatening to join the nuclear fraternity, there are plenty of reasons to find better ways to spot the early signs of proliferation. No one expects satellites entirely to replace ground-based sensing and actual inspections. But while North Korea continues to play cat-and-mouse over on-site inspections, Washington policymakers are finding the prospect of space detection - in spite of its technical complexity - hard to resist.</p>

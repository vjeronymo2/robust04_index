			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Montedison and Shell propose plastics merger THE LARGEST restructuring of Europe's troubled petrochemicals chemicals industry during this recession was proposed yesterday by Montecatini, the chemicals subsidiary of Italy's Montedison, and Shell Chemicals, part of the Anglo-Dutch oil group. They announced a plan to merge their activities in polypropylene and polyethylene, both plastics feedstocks. The joint venture would link Europe's two largest polypropylene makers. Montecatini, which also owns the Himont chemicals group in the US, will integrate all its polyolefins activities into the new deal, while Shell, which already has some existing joint ventures in the field, will put in the majority of its businesses. Full details of the transaction, which will create a unit with estimated annual sales of Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn), have still to be settled. The deal depends on approval from the European Commission. The commission is likely to be more worried about the implications for the European polypropylene sector than the polyethylene industry. Shell has a European capacity of about 550,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year, excluding a joint venture with Germany's BASF, according to Mr Jeremy Chantry, a chemicals analyst at Kleinwort Benson. In Europe, Montecatini can produce about 500,000 tonnes a year. Together they would have about 20 per cent of the European capacity, which is about 5m tonnes this year. The new venture is expected to have worldwide capacity of 3m tonnes of polypropylene and 500,000 tonnes of polyethylene. The move made strategic sense, chemicals consultants said, and Himont's polypropylene technology was the best in the world. The Italian group is short of propylene and Shell has excess propylene capacity. The transaction should help both companies cut costs in a sector of the petrochemicals business which has been suffering from growing over-capacity and plunging product prices. 'This is only the first part of the restructuring of the European petrochemicals sector,' said Mr David Glass of Chem Systems, the chemicals consultants. 'Most of the industry is losing its shirt. The number of polypropylene producers needs to fall from about 17 at present to 12.'</p>

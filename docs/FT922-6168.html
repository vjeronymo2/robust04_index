			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television A promising evening. BBC2 continues its series of five-minute Dance House programmes, a film choreographed by Jacob Marley, known for his work with the Pet Shop Boys (7.55). Channel 4's consumer series Check Out 92 returns with a programme which asks why, even after the recommendations following the 1985 Manchester air disaster, safety measures which have been understood for decades (rear facing seats for example) are still, apparently, being ignored by the Civil Aviation Authority (8.30). In the week before Czechoslovakia's general election, Dispatches reviews the state of the country's economy and discovers that many of those now running large businesses were communist bosses not long ago (9.00 C4). BBC2's re-run of the drama about politics, Edge of Darkness reaches its penultimate episode (9.25). Inside Story offers what sounds like a harrowing documentary about Baragwanath Hospital in the South African black township of Soweto where 100 victims of assault arrive every night (9.30) BBC1).</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Car dealers may keep special terms Carmakers may be able to retain exclusive distribution networks after 1995, Mr Martin Bangemann, the Industry Commissioner, indicated yesterday. Exclusive distribution networks are against EU competition rules, but the motor industry was given a ten-year exemption in 1985. The industry had argued that the complexity and safety implications of vehicles required dedicated dealers who had to invest heavily in order to repair and maintain vehicles adequately. The industry has become anxious that friction over car pricing within the EU might lead to the exemption not being renewed after 1995. Mr Bangemann said yesterday he will propose an extension of the exemption in a report he is drafting on the competitiveness of the motor industry. However, carmakers might be required to make further progress towards price harmonisation as part of Mr Bangemann's proposals.</p>

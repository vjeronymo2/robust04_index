			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Japanese move for Amersham - Deal sets company on path to become a global healthcare business Amersham International yesterday took a stride towards becoming a global healthcare business by paying Y8.52bn (Pounds 55m) for a 22 per cent stake in Nihon Medi+Physics, Japan's largest manufacturer of 'nuclear medicines'. The move follows three years of talks with Sumitomo Chemical Company, NMP's parent, which has granted the UK health science group options to acquire a further 30 per cent stake before the end of the decade. 'This will help Amersham to achieve market leading positions in each of the world's three major nuclear medicine markets - Europe, North America and Japan,' said Mr Bill Castell, Amersham chief executive. If the UK group takes up the options, it would greatly enhance its presence in the Japanese market for nuclear medicines, worth some Pounds 220m a year. The world market for such medicines, which use radioactive materials to identify diseased or damaged organs, is worth an estimated Pounds 700m. The deal - financed from Yen-denominated borrowings - promises to increase the size of Amersham's healthcare division by more than 60 per cent and could contribute sales of Pounds 65m. This compares with last year's group total of Pounds 324.2m. Initially, the venture will allow the UK group to use NMP's facilities to make and distribute its products in Japan, where it currently supplies 7 per cent of the market. In particular, Amersham forecasts growing demand for Ceretec - its brain imaging agent - and an injectable version of Myoview, which detects heart disease. It also hopes to launch Metastron, a pain relief agent for cancer, in east Asia. If Japan's Fair Trade Commission approves the link-up, Amersham will pay up to Y9.78bn to raise its NMP holding to 50 per cent. 'While we're happy to take the first part of the acquisition on the balance sheet, the second tranche could involve an equity placement,' said Mr Castell. For NMP, which enjoys a market share of close to 60 per cent, the deal promises access to Amersham's lucrative international distribution network, particularly in North America. Last year, the Japanese company saw pre-tax profits rise 37 per cent to Y3.4bn on sales ahead 13 per cent at Y20.7bn. While hailing NMP's likely contribution, Amersham has insisted on an exit clause allowing it resell the 20 per cent stake to Sumitomo at the original purchase price should regulatory approval be withheld. Although interest payments are expected to make the deal earnings dilutive next year, City analysts welcomed the announcement. 'It's a good deal and will be earnings enhancing if the 50-50 partnership goes ahead,' said one analyst. Amersham's shares closed up 17p at 943p. See Lex</p>

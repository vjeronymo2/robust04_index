			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP BRADLEY VOTE FUND SUPPORTERS REWARDED  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley reported Monday that his reelection campaign  committee has spent $13,300 for limousine service, $11,837 for flowers and  about $44,000 at a Manhattan hotel and expensive Los Angeles restaurants, all  as part of its fund-raising effort.  </P> <P> The spending, according to campaign spokeswoman DeeDee Meyers, went for food  and entertainment for campaign contributors and for a trip to New York that was  offered as a prize for top fund raisers in a campaign Bradley is expected to  win easily.  </P> <P> His best financed opponent, Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, in  contrast, said his entire spending for this year has been $41,454, most of it  going for the purchase of semiautomatic assault rifles he had offered to buy  from residents in an effort to get the weapons off the streets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cover Two Months  </P> <P> The campaign reports, submitted to the city clerk, cover the first two months  of this year and showed Bradley had received $192,165 in that period, and spent  $314,004. That left him with a balance of $1,697,370, counting what he had  collected previously.  </P> <P> Holden, after spending $41,454, had just $162,872 in the bank. The other  well-known mayoral contender, former Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward,  is not accepting campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Seven others also are running for mayor.  </P> <P> The figures in the reports were strong evidence of the one-sidedness of the  race.  </P> <P> Bradley has deployed a small-scale political army against his under-financed  foes. Meyers said the expenditures had been planned when Bradley thought he  would be opposed by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. But the mechanism remained  in place even after Yaroslavsky decided not to run.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computers Rented  </P> <P> The mayor has rented computers, hired a computer consultant, employed expensive  campaign managers and even paid $30,000 to a polling firm, which told him he  would win.  </P> <P> For food, room rentals, transportation and decorations for fund-raising events  in Manhattan and Los Angeles, Bradley reported: $13,712 to the Regency Hotel on  Park Avenue, $13,300 to Manhattan Limousines, $11,837 to Atlas Floral  Decorations of New York, $19,860 to Chasen's, $5,000 to Ambrosia Catering of  Santa Monica, $2,121 to The Regency Club of Westwood and $2,807 to the Friars'  Club.  </P> <P> Meyers said the New York trip was a prize for supporters who raised at least  $25,000 each for Bradley's campaign.  </P> <P> The trip took place in November, during an intense period of fund-raising  before Yaroslavsky's withdrawal.  </P> <P> The supporters were flown to New York, put up at the Regency, taken around the  city in limousines and entertained. Although bills for the trip were high, the  contributors had brought in about $500,000, Meyers said.  </P> <P> The reports showed campaign manager Christopher Humes received $28,000 and his  assistant, Chris Hammong, $15,000.  </P> <P> The polling firm of Fairbank, Bregman &amp; Maullin received $30,000 for a poll  that Meyers said was taken in December, when Yaroslavsky was still in the race.  </P> <P> Committee Communication, got $5,291 for printing dinner invitations and $11,249  was paid to rent a computer system from Practical Systems Inc.  </P></p>

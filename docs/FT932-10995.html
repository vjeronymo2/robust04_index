			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: Ozal had few options in his relationship with EC Sir, Edward Mortimer's article about Turgut Ozal's funeral ('Friend when in need', April 28) deserves some comment, in particular on the small but significant incident in EC-Turkish relations to which he refers. President Jacques Delors of the EC Commission was accused in 1989 by many Turkish personalities of wanting to reserve EC membership to the Christian countries of Europe. What happened in reality was that Delors, speaking before the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe on September 26 1989, referred to Fernand Braudel's remark that Europe's common destination is determined by its Christian religion as one element among several which he named. In the immediately following press conference a Turkish journalist lifted the Christian religion out of the context of the speech and asked if this was meant as a message for Muslim Turkey. Delors categorically denied such intention and explained that he had simply referred to factors that had contributed to Europe's cultural identity, such as Christianity, Roman law, Greek humanism and Arab civilisation. Ozal could never have 'courted this reaction when he slammed in Turkey's EC application in 1987', as Mortimer says, because it took place more than two years later. Neither do I agree that Demirel is 'more sincerely . . . European' in going for a customs union. Turkey has not many political options and the Europeans know that. It is, in a manner of speaking, in Europe but not of Europe. Turkey's customs union with the EC (not invented by Demirel but offered to Turkey by the EC in 1990) is the only realistic basis for a stable and long-lasting relationship in which the EC is not demandeur. Politics are often hard and merciless; Ozal would have been the first one to admit that. Symbolic gestures at the occasion of a state funeral of an important president seldom go beyond the perceived balance of interests of countries concerned. That explains the level of European presence at Turgut Ozal's funeral. Johannes Pieter van Rij, Churchilliaan 113 - E, 1078 DM - Amsterdam, Netherlands</p>

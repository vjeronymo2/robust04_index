			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Management buys Netlon for Pounds 40m Netlon, which makes plastic nets, mesh and grids for the food packaging, agricultural, horticultural and construction industries, has been bought by its management for about Pounds 40m. The Blackburn-based company, which employs 380 people, was founded in 1959 by Mr Brian Mercer who has sold his 88 per cent shareholding in order to retire. A six-strong management buy-out team, which had a 9 per cent stake, has sold its own shares to itself and reinvested the post-tax proceeds in a bigger stake. An equity and loan package will give 3i, the investment capital group, and Electra, the venture capital fund, substantial minority stakes, believed to be up to a third each. Intermediate Capital Group has provided mezzanine funding, with senior debt and working capital facilities from Bank of Scotland. The final price has not been disclosed, but Netlon is understood to have been valued at 10 times earnings: pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.2m in the year ended September 30. This means the buy-out team would have had about Pounds 2.3m net to invest.</p>

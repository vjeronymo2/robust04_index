			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand and South Korea agreed yesterday to expand  economic cooperation between their countries and increase  regional security ties.    The agreement was reached during a meeting between Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai and South Korean President Kim Young-sam.    The two leaders also discussed ways to ease tensions over  North Korea's suspected diversion of plutonium to build nuclear  weapons, officials said.    Prime Minister Chuan, who arrived Thursday for a four-day  official visit wished President Kim success at the first-ever  inter-Korean summit, which is currently being planned to help  defuse the nuclear impasse.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, reaffirming Thailand's  support of the non-nuclear proliferation treaty, said he hoped  North and South Korea would be able to reach an accord on the  issue through their talks.    He said Bangkok hoped that North Korea would return to the  Non-nuclear Proliferation Treaty and the United Nations'  Security Council would not resort to harsh measures against the  nation to force it to comply with the treaty.    The United States is calling on the UN Security Council to  impose economic sanctions against North Korea and Thailand, as a  UN member, will have to comply with any resolution, he said.    The Foreign Ministry's Southeast Asian Department Chief Don  Paramatwinai quoted President Kim as saying that the nuclear  conflict between South and North Korea posed not only a threat  to the Korean Peninsula but the entire world.    The South Korean President expressed hope that the June 28  summit would be successful.    South Korea was prepared to negotiate with North Korea on  mutual interest and world security issues, Mr Don quoted  President Kim as saying.    Mr Kim asked that regulations be eased to allow more South  Korean firms to invest in construction and communications  projects in Thailand, while Prime Minister Chuan asked that  South Korea import more Thai agricultural goods.    South Korea is Thailand's seventh largest trading partner,  with two-way trade last year totaling US$1.94 billion, a  two-fold increase over the past five years.    South Korea exported US$1.47 billion worth of goods to  Thailand last year, mostly in machinery, oil, Iron, steel, and  automobiles, while importing sugar, computer parts, tapioca and  rubber from Thailand.    The two leaders also agreed to improve South Korea's  relations with the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN)  whose members include Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei.    During the meeting, Mr Don said President Kim also agreed in  principle to a Thai proposal that a joint commission be set up  between the two countries to promote trade and economic  cooperation.    No actual agreement has been signed on the proposal as both  sides would need to discuss how the commission should be formed,  he said.    Prime Minister Chuan also extended an invitation to the  South  Korean leader to visit Thailand.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Blair announces whips' office team Labour last night announced eight new appointments to its 16-strong whips' office in the last stage of Mr Tony Blair's shake-up of the party's frontbench team. The injection of new blood - all eight newcomers come from the ranks of the 1992 parliamentary intake - was in keeping with the Labour leader's strategy of giving the whips' office a fresh role as a training ground for promising MPs. The announcement, expected last week, was delayed after Mr Don Dixon, the deputy chief whip, complained that he had not been consulted. The newcomers include Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former communications director, Ms Tessa Jowell, MP for Dulwich, Ms Estelle Morris (Birmingham Yardley) and Ms Barbara Roche (Hornsey and Wood Green). The other appointments are Mr Stephen Byers, (Wallsend), Mr Eric Clarke (Midlothian), Mr Geoff Hoon (Ashfield) and Mr George Mudie (Leeds East). Mr Gordon McMaster (Paisley South) was promoted from Scottish whip to deputy chief whip's assistant.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: US insurer paid on overdue mortgage OLYMPIA &amp; YORK yesterday gained another reprieve by agreeing to make an overdue interest payment on a mortgage held by Prudential Insurance of America. The agreement with Prudential could, however, spell trouble for O&amp;Y from other debt-holders who have not been paid since the developer's liquidity problems surfaced in late March. The New Jersey-based insurance group said the two parties had reached a verbal agreement resolving an interest payment due in April on a USDollars 155m mortgage secured by the Aetna Centre in Toronto. It declined to give details of the agreement, but noted that 'if a property is performing, we would expect mortgage payments to be current'. O&amp;Y failed to make the April payment on time, despite the fact that rental income from the 45-storey building was sufficient to meet the property's debt-servicing obligations. Prudential responded on Thursday afternoon by notifying Aetna Centre's tenants that it was seizing all rents from the property. The move to assign rents appears to have caught O&amp;Y by surprise. The company has spent the past few weeks asking banks and other holders of its Dollars 12bn debt for a debt standstill and an infusion of funds, while it negotiates a more comprehensive debt restructuring. A group of Japanese institutions last month agreed to defer interest due on a Dollars 800m Eurobond secured by a building at the World Financial Centre in New York. On the other hand, O&amp;Y paid Dollars 6m in interest to public holders of floating-rate notes secured by three other Manhattan buildings. Like Aetna Centre, the World Financial Centre is generating enough rental income to meet interest payments. However O&amp;Y has been forced to channel cashflow from these buildings to less liquid parts of its far-flung property empire. The company earlier this week won another breathing space with the agreement by a group of banks to advance Pounds 5m (Dollars 8.85m) for the Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands. Negotiations are continuing for a bigger credit facility for Canary Wharf.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, [no dateline as received] -- A statement  by Volodymyr Lephykhov, the chairman of the Security Service of  Crimea, was circulated in the republic today.    Volodymyr Lephykhov believes that the decree by the  president  of Ukraine "On the Main Directorate of the Security Service of  Ukraine in Crimea," signed on 18 May, violates the law of  Ukraine "On the Security Service." The Supreme Council of  Ukraine did not consider the changes connected with the decree  by Leonid Kravchuk, and there is no resolution by the Supreme  Council of Ukraine that would legally fix the changes in the law.    In the opinion of Volodymyr Lephykhov, all this gives  grounds  to believe that the decree by the president of Ukraine of 18 May  "is illegal and illegitimate in all respects."    "In the present-day complicated situation such actions raise  strong doubts about the assurances by the official circles of  Ukraine that they wish to ensure durable civil peace and accord,  the rights and freedoms of every citizen in Crimea," says the  statement by the Crimean Security Service chairman.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy turns in top performance for August ITALY was the top-performing government bond market last month with a 1.67 per cent return in local currency terms, according to JP Morgan's bond index. The Italian bond market has been one of the more volatile government markets since June 2, when Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty and threw the future of European economic and monetary union into a state of confusion. The Bank of Italy's decision to cut its official discount rate by half a percentage point to 13.25 per cent on August 4 provided a boost for the bond market. However, the return on the Italian government bond market so far this year is only 2.8 per cent, placing Italy well behind most of the other European and the dollar bloc bond markets in local currency terms. Germany and the Netherlands were the next best-performingmarkets after Italy, with returns of 1.21 per cent and 1.03 per cent respectively in August: the gains reflect the decision by investors to shift assets into the D-Mark bloc due to concern over the future of European economic and monetary union, and fears that there might be a realignment of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Last month's worst-performing markets were Australia (-3.59 per cent), Sweden (-2.67 per cent), Spain (-1.09 per cent) and the UK (-1.01 per cent). Australian government bond prices suffered losses of nearly 4.5 per cent in August, mainly due to foreigners' lack of confidence in the Australian dollar and uncertainty over the timing of the next cut in interest rates. Sweden's government bond market tumbled after the central bank jacked up interest rates to stem heavy outflows of currency. US dollar-based investors enjoyed 'outstanding returns . . . in foreign bonds' according to JP Morgan, due to the US currency's recent decline against the ERM currencies. The German bond market showed a gain of 6.84 per cent in dollar terms over the month and of 14.31 per cent since the start of the year.</p>

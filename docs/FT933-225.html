			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / BA fuels fight for off-season travellers BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday started an incentive war to attract passengers during the slack winter season. The company's Pounds 15m promotion doubles the benefits of its Frequent Flyer programme for the next six months. Passengers buying full-price tickets in any class will get double 'air miles' towards free tickets. Passengers must say by the end of March where they want to fly. The time limit for taking the flight varies according to the country of residence of the traveller. The UK's other scheduled long-haul carrier, Virgin Atlantic Airways, will soon announce its own incentives. This will include new ways of collecting Frequent Flyer points. There are links with American Express, Air New Zealand, British Midland and Scandinavian Airline System. Virgin and American Express will spend Pounds 3m on a promotional programme and the airline plans to announce several more partners. United Airlines, one of the biggest US carriers, is preparing direct mailshots offering bonus points for trips this winter, while Japan Air Lines is already four weeks into a double-points promotion. BA's promotion differs from many others because it forces travellers to specify their free destination.</p>

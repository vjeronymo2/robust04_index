			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "President Defends Judicial </F> Independence"]    [Text] (ANSA) Frascati, April 11 -- President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro on Monday [11 April] issued a defense of judges'  constitutionally guaranteed freedom from political interference  and warned magistrates to stay away from politics during this  transition period. "In this so very delicate period of  transition in Italy's political history and life," Scalfaro  said, "the judiciary must represent a firm point of absolute  certainty."    Scalfaro then warned against "anyone touching these  fundamental constitutional principles, that are the breath of  life for democracy." He also urged magistrates to avoid  "polemics and speculations" and not to fall into "weaknesses"  towards those colleagues who fall astray.    His statements appeared to be a multiple reference to a  proposal by Forza Italia that would have public prosecutors  appointed by the government, eliminating current career  procedures within the judiciary itself, and to polemics over the  handling of corruption cases.    The independence of the judiciary is now "more important  than  ever" and judges must "make the abuse known if anyone touches  it," Scalfaro said, adding: "Even more important, judges must  not give in to polemics and speculation."    Scalfaro, who as president is also chairman of the judges'  self-governing body, the Council of Magistrates, apparently  objects to the suggestion that the separation of powers between  judiciary and executive be eliminated, a move critics claim  would protect corrupt politicians from prosecution.    His latter statement could also refer to several recent  controversies involving magistrates, including criticisms of  judges accused of using corruption cases for political ends and  the proposed blacklisting of hundreds of leading figures,  including several chief public prosecutors.    The list was published by a right-wing weekly, which named  people "whose heads should roll" under the new conservative  regime of the Freedom Pole. The editors later defended the list  as a satirical "spoof" but it was described by critics as the  sort of purge to be expected if Forza Italia and its allies, the  Northern league and the National Alliance, run the country.    Scalfaro also had a word for magistrates who find themselves  in the limelight because of corruption investigations involving  famous or powerful people. He warned judges not to give in to  temptations of notoriety and popularity, to maintain at all  costs pretrial judicial secrecy and to avoid making comments  about their colleagues "who make mistakes."</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Accountancy Column: Conservative balancing act shows signs of strain - Andrew Jack wonders about the wisdom of a 'pick and choose' approach in party accounts ONE THING unites and another divides two recent political documents tinged with more than a hint of blue. The first is 'The Downing Street Years', the reminiscences of Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister. The second is the freshly revamped Conservative party accounts. Both are alike in portraying events in the best possible light, where necessary with a highly partial view of events. But while the former is voluminous in its justification, ranging over more than 900 pages, the latter is, in contrast, extremely thin on detail. Which of the two is more readable or more controversial is open to debate. The details in the Conservative party accounts, and the inadequacies in the accounts of the two major opposition parties, raises the case for a greater degree of standardisation of financial reporting among political organisations, and perhaps even for a formal set of guidelines. There is no doubt that disclosure has increased markedly in the Conservative party. The 1992 accounts were just four pages long, and contained a minimum of information. There was a simple income and expenditure account, showing a deficit for the year of Pounds 5.5m. In comparison, those for the year to March 31 1993, which were released just before the Conservative party conference at the start of this month, run instead to 20 pages enclosed in glossy covers. The party has made the most of its auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which it says advised it on greater disclosure, and which it paid Pounds 27,500 for audit work and Pounds 17,700 for other accounting work last year. It also enlisted the help of Andersen Consulting, to advise it on reorganisation. As a result, Mr Nicholas Edwards from the firm sits on a working party designed to help with restructuring. Perhaps most important in the 1993 accounts, there is, for the first time, a balance sheet, which highlights the fact that the party has a net deficiency of assets of Pounds 13.3m. That is far more than either the Labour Party, with a deficit of Pounds 10,000, or the Federal executive of the Social and Liberal Democrats, with a deficit of just over Pounds 122,000. But that raises a difficulty. Auditing standards state that 'the facts should be explained clearly' if there is any doubt about whether the company is a 'going concern'. Labour notes that its accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis because Unity Trust bank will provide an overdraft of up to Pounds 825,000 for 1993, and the Co-Operative Bank has agreed conditional overdraft facilities of Pounds 1.9m. The Liberal Democrats note intriguingly that 'funding required in excess of the joint overdraft facility is provided by certain individuals in the form of interest free informal loans'. Again, there is some reassurance. But there is no such guarantee for the Conservative party, despite its far larger deficit. Nor is there any indication that the directors are required to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. The Conservative accounts give the appearance of being forward-looking by adopting the new-style audit report and statement of directors' responsibilities, which is not yet compulsory for companies. But the party has been selective, including all elements except the one that requires the directors to remind readers of their obligations. There are some other areas where this pick-and-choose approach is evident. The accounts apparently adopt Fred 4, the accounting standard still in draft form which stresses economic substance over legal form, by including five 'quasi-subsidiaries' which the party does not formally control. Just three of these have filings at Companies House, and do provide some interesting revelations. Not least is the fact that the auditor to Bourne Association is also a shareholder in the company, a position which could be perceived as jeopardising his independence. The inclusion of the quasi-subsidiaries strengthens the Conservative's balance sheet considerably by including Pounds 5.9m in properties - mainly representing the London headquarters at Smith Square, which is held directly by a company called Bourne Association. But Fred 4 says 'a summary of the financial statements of each quasi-subsidiary should be included in the notes to the accounts'. There is no such disclosure. Nor do the accounts include financial details of the constituency associations, which the accounts show provide it with interest-free loans repayable on demand totalling more than Pounds 2.7m in the last financial year, and which could also arguably be considered as quasi-subsidiaries. The Conservatives can claim that the party is not obliged to comply with accounting standards or company law. But its accounts state that they have been prepared 'in accordance with accounting standards and, so far as is pertinent, the Companies Act'. In addition, the Coopers' audit report - which is not qualified - does state that the accounts give 'a true and fair view', which suggests they follow the financial reporting rules laid down in company law and accounting standards. The legal status of all the political parties is rather vague. The Conservatives won a victory against the Inland Revenue in the early 1980s that determined it was not liable to pay tax on income - though it does on investments. But since it is not incorporated, that raises the question of whether all the members of the Conservative Party are protected by limited liability and may be called upon to make good any deficit to creditors. The Liberal Democrats note that its parties are unincorporated associations, which do not have a legally separate identity of its members, and who do not have limited liability. There is no such detail in the Labour and Conservative accounts warning of such a similar potential exposure to members. There are some other points of interest in the Conservative accounts. For example, the party revalues its property - reducing its value by Pounds 2m - but then knocks off a further depreciation charge to reach the assets figure shown in the balance sheet. It says the assets exceed the liabilities of its defined benefits pension scheme by Pounds 367,000. But it gives this figure rather than expressing it as a proportion, as required by SSAP 24, the accounting standard on pensions. That is not to say the accounts of the opposition parties are by any means perfect. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats insist on using a confusing selection of different fund statements - the latter with interlocking accounts from the Federal party and the English party, for instance. Labour's auditor, Hard Dowdy, makes reference to a true and fair view of 'the financial statements' although the numbers are consistently referred to the 'statement of accounts' in its document. There is no accounting policy note on leases, though the accounts make it clear the party has some. The Liberal Democrats, audited by Grant Thornton, tuck away in reserve movements Pounds 17,189 shifted between the income and expenditure account and the general election fund from a Visa card product. What is needed is a far clearer set of guidelines on how to define the entity for which all three parties' should be accounting; more consistent application of standards; and clearer thought about the format used to show figures. At present, there are clearly still a few too many partial political slants on the accounts presented by Britain's parties.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFGHANS TOLD TO EVACUATE SALANG HIGHWAY AREA  </P> <P> The Afghan army warned residents along the Salang Highway to flee their homes  because of fierce fighting expected on the vital supply route between Kabul and  the Soviet Union, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> With only one week before the last Soviet troops are due to leave Afghanistan  under a peace accord, Tass said Muslim rebels battling the Soviet-backed Kabul  government are again attacking food and fuel convoys.  </P> <P> "If the criminal activities of the rebels do not stop, the Afghan armed forces  will take the most decisive measures," Tass quoted the Afghan army command as  saying. "The commander in chief is calling on citizens of those regions to  leave their places of residence for some time to avoid any unnecessary  victims."  </P> <P> In Kabul, President Najibullah's beleaguered government said it has distributed  guns to 30,000 members of the ruling party. It said about 45,000 party members  who had already completed their military service have volunteered for reserve  duty or joined self-defense and border units.  </P> <P> Kabul Radio reported Tuesday that more than 150 "extremists" -- its term for  the rebels -- were killed by government forces in the previous 24 hours, many  of them in the eastern province of Nangarhar, according to the British  Broadcasting Corp.  </P> <P> Earlier, Tass said, the guerrillas launched dozens of rockets at the airport at  Kandahar, Afghanistan's second city, but were driven off and sustained 16  casualties.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Soviet officials said at a news briefing Tuesday that their  government is still behind Najibullah. "There have been no nuances or changes  with regard to President Najibullah from the Soviet side," said Deputy Foreign  Minister Igor A. Rogachev.  </P> <P> Yuri K. Alexeyev, another ministry official, said about 15,000 Soviet soldiers  were killed during the nine-year Afghan conflict -- 2,000 more than the Kremlin  reported in May, 1988. However, he seemed unable to explain the discrepancy and  said the new figure "doesn't mean . . . we had the bloodiest period of the war"  during the withdrawal period.  </P></p>

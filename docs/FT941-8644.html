			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Guangdong Fund to begin trading after raising Dollars 91m The Guangdong Development Fund, a China direct investment fund co-managed by the investment arm of the Guangdong Provincial Government, will start trading on the London stock market on Wednesday, after raising Dollars 91m (Pounds 62.3m). The fund was targeted to raise between Dollars 75m and Dollars 100m, but it can raise a further Dollars 9m within the coming weeks, to take it up to the maximum limit. The fund will focus on direct investments in Guangdong Province, which borders Hong Kong and has become the most affluent of China's provinces since Deng Xiaoping launched his Open Door Policy in 1979. The managers, Guangdong Capital and First Eastern - a company controlled by Mr Victor Chu - have already signed letters of intent on five investments, which would cost Dollars 26.5m.</p>

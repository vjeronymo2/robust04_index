			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the Expert </F> Institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, leader of work group under the chairman of the  Government of the Russian Federation, by Arkadiy Lapshin: "A  Social-Market Economy Is the Lot of Rich Countries"]    [Text] So thinks Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the  Expert Institute of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, work group leader under the chairman of the  Government of the Russian Federation.    [Lapshin] Many postcommunist states, after the initial stage  of tough reforms that were painful to the population, came to a  "softening" of the socioeconomic policy. Do you have the  possibility of carrying out an adjustment toward "softening"  without slipping into the "comfortable" bosom of the  administrative-command system?    [Yasin] If we were to slip that way we would arrive at  either  a distributive economy or hyperinflation. When they proclaim the  slogan "socially oriented market economy" and, moreover, suggest  making this phrase the banner of the reformation, I do not  believe in it. Not because I consider it necessary to cast the  person who has ended up below the poverty line to the will of  fate and not because everything that is being done seems fair to  me. But what can we suggest? Increasing pensions and wages? But  unless we increase production, all this will end up tomorrow as  higher inflation and nothing more. We must be clearly aware that  inflation is the most reliable means of fleecing the poor. I  will say outright that talk of a social-market economy is cheap  demagoguery.    [Lapshin] But do you really not think that certain aspects  of  the social policy must be reinforced?    [Yasin] Yes, I think we need serious measures that would  contribute to fairer distribution. But this does not mean the  onset of a stage of a social-market economy. The latter is the  destiny of rich countries. After all, it is no accident that  when Erhard conducted the reform in Germany he said nothing  about it. Only after the very severe policy had led to financial  stabilization, an upsurge of the economy, and an increase in  business activity was it possible to begin to speak about  distribution. After all, what is a social-market economy? It is  above all the principle of distribution. Take from some and give  it to others through the state. As for the countries of Eastern  Europe, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have just reached  the stage where they have basically achieved macroeconomic  stabilization. They are now faced with the problem of  production, and they do not know what to do with it.    All countries that are in a process of transition from a  communist system of economy are experiencing largely similar  stages. Achieving macroeconomic stabilization is the simplest  thing. But then comes the most difficult task: how to breathe  life into this economy, how to make people work, how to make  goods appear.    [Lapshin] Do you think the Russian economy has reached this  point?    [Yasin] Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved  macroeconomic  stabilization. But I think that, while continuing our efforts to  achieve it, we must now create the necessary mechanisms, above  all financial ones, for increasing the effectiveness of our  development.    [Lapshin] There is a point of view according to which the  economic reform is being conducted in the interests of less than  10 percent of the population of Russia. If this is so, it is  almost frivolous to speak about any nationwide campaign for  increasing effectiveness.    [Yasin] I do not subscribe to the theory of conspiracies  against Russia and its people and I do not think that anyone in  the government is conducting a policy in the interests of a  narrow stratum of the population. Anyone who exploits the  conspiracy thesis is a demagogue and a populist. The current  policy basically reflects the interests of Russia and its  future. Of course one could say that it is turning out to be bad  and wrong. But the possibility of changing the policy that is  being conducted exists within a very narrow range. I have  emphasized repeatedly that any reasonable government of Russia  would have to pursue approximately the same policy. There are no  alternatives to it.    [Lapshin] Let us assume that there are no alternatives. But  it is possible and probably even necessary to make some  adjustment to the course.    [Yasin] We can now begin to focus on the tasks of the next  stage, which involves the creation of preconditions for economic  growth. We can relax our monetary policy and pay wages to  miners, peasants, and scholars, from whom the state (not the  suppliers and not the consumers, but namely the state) is  holding back payments. This will lead to a certain rise of  inflation, but all of these steps must be taken within that  narrow range of possibilities I mentioned earlier. In other  words, we must set in motion a very delicate and precise  mechanism for fine-tuning our economy. And we simply do not have  the possibility of making any global changes: If we pursue any  true alternative, social explosion and economic chaos are simply  inevitable.    [Lapshin] Nonetheless the policy being implemented now is  also generating mass dissatisfaction among the population.    [Yasin] Indeed, it will lead to significant negative social  consequences. And we have reached a point where we must regulate  it. For example, it is necessary to regulate the growing  differentiation of incomes, but only in a reasonable way. Thus  if you put the squeeze on the rich again now it will be bad not  only for them. Because the appearance of this stratum of people  is a positive phenomenon for the Russian economy. If the  authorities provide the possibility of investing private capital  in the economy, they will do it more quickly and effectively  than the labor collectives who have seized a large share of the  property of privatized enterprises.    [Lapshin] You frequently meet with representatives of our  private business circles, what do they absolutely insist on?    [Yasin] First of all, personal security. Second, guarantees  for their private property. Third, certain tax breaks which they  could have by investing capital namely in the Russian economy.    [Lapshin] Excuse me, it is impossible to speak about any  stage of effectiveness when a decision is being made to unify  the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It would seem, thank  God, that the unification process has proceeded, but why should  Russia have to pay for it?    [Yasin] So far there is no actual agreement. There is some  kind of memorandum about intentions. It seems to me that the  unification must be carried out in a well-thought-out way,  precluding, for example, a "one for one" exchange of the ruble  for the "rabbit," having agreed on a single well-controlled  mechanism for emission.    [Lapshin] Will it not turn out that all your discussions of  a  new stage of Russian reforms will remain merely good intentions?  After all, many citizens of Russia will not take any more, they  are tired, and they are ready to believe in another miracle.    [Yasin] If we decide to curtail the reforms we will be  defeating ourselves once again. I am in favor of applying state  power and supporting the reformation. Out-and-out populism is  incompatible with the reforms and life without the reforms holds  no promise. And if such a policy is begun it is above all the  simple people who will have to pay for it.</p>

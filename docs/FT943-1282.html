			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: A lingering gaze into the well of loneliness - Hellman's theatrical exploration of lesbianism How wonderful: a new production of an old play that - despite (or rather because of) the general excellence of its acting and staging - sends us out talking about the play itself. And how wonderful: at last, a play about homosexuality (after a million other plays about homosexuality we have seen this year) that is neither agitprop nor sentimental nor evasive. The play, Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour, will be 60 years old this November, and Howard Davies's production makes us see that it works on three levels. On level one, it is about the unjust scandal caused by accusations of homosexuality among teachers - unjust because those accusations are unfounded. This is the level that almost any audience can take, and Hellman was able to bring it to the movie version, These Three (1936), for which she wrote the screenplay. Karen Wright (Harriet Walter) and Martha Dobie (Clare Higgins) are young women who run the school for girls they have founded. Mary (Emily Watson), a peculiarly evil 14-year-old, wrecks the school, to which her grandmother (Gillian Barge) has sent her, by accusing them of lesbianism. The accusations also blight the engagement of Karen Wright to the pleasant Dr Joe Cardin (William Gaminara). On the second level, it is about the unjust scandal caused by homosexuality among teachers - unjust because homosexuality is not a crime or sin that should cause social ostracism, even when one of the teachers finally admits to, or discovers, homosexuality in her own thoughts. This is the level that could not be brought to the screen until 1962. . Martha Dobie is the one who confesses lesbian desires. Feeling that she has brought ruin upon everyone, she shoots herself. And on the third level, it is about the difficulties of repressing or admitting homosexuality in oneself. This is the level that has seldom hitherto been seen as a major theme in The Children's Hour. Here, however, we not only see it in the character of Martha; we also see it, at any rate in potential, in Karen - who has been delaying the marriage, who finally sends Joe away, and who almost lets Martha kiss her 'that way'. Later, when Martha is dead and when Mary's grandmother (not knowing of the death) comes to start righting the wrongs that she has done the two teachers, Karen has moved beyond the issues of right, wrong and injustice. And, when she is then left alone, she mounts the stairs to the room where the dead Martha lies. It is at least possible that Karen means to join Martha in death; or that she wishes now at last to be united with her in desire. These are only possibilities, I stress. A contrary option is also possible: that Martha only thinks herself a lesbian and kills herself because of the intolerable pressure of the situation; and that Karen's final ascent of the stairs is simply her wish to repent her own homophobia. The beauty of this production is not that it forces us to think worthy, glib thoughts about the evils of repression, but that it brings these and other ambiguous interpretations to the surface. So much so that Hellman, as never before, seems to be kin to Henry James. In Mary's disturbing influence on her educators and other children, one thinks of the evil things known by the child Miles in The Turn of the Screw (and here Martha is also the victim of a turn-of-a-screw situation); in the triangle of Martha-Karen-Joe, one thinks of the Olive-Verena-Basil triangle in The Bostonians. Let me not sound carried away. The Children's Hour is, on the whole a melodrama. Its first act is far too diffuse, and Martha's third-act revelation awkwardly sudden. But the play is given here, in almost all respects, with such fine fluctuations of tone and mood that it keeps going beyond melodrama; and Karen's final solitude - stressed in this production more than Hellman's stage directions suggest - approaches tragedy. If I have left little space to praise the performances, I hope my praise is already implicit. It is easier to cite the production's flaws. Jason Carr has provided film-type music to underline the big moments: can this please be cut? Some American accents have minor problems. Alison Fiske's account of the silly old aunt applies too much vocal caricature; Emily Watson does not suggest the most disturbing or most real aspects of Mary's evil and spoilt nature. However, to watch Harriet Walter, Clare Higgins and Gillian Barge in their roles is a rare privilege. There are a thousand telling details in their performances, and all of them work together to make the stage world more absorbing. In repertory at the Lyttelton Theatre, South Bank.</p>

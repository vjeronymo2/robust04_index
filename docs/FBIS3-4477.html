			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 29 (CNS)--The People's Insurance  Company of China signed a document with its 44 branches today  for reform of management to bring their business into line with  the international insurance market.    General manager of the company Mr. Li Yumin said that he  hoped the restructuring of the company's international opeations  would help China's insurance business move in step with its  international counterparts as soon as possible. The move is  considered as a preparation in the insurance sector for the  restoration of China's signatory status to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade.    According to the document, the company will to some extent  allow autonomy to its branches for various measures to be  adopted in accordance with their own business situation. The  branches are free to implement measures in terms of insurance  charge rate, insurance provisions and insurance cost while at  the same time being responsible to the parent company in terms  of profit, insurance premiums and indemnity. If a branch  fulfills a particular set target, then it will be given a reward  or a penalty if the case is the oposite. Mr Li said that he  hoped this practice would help increase the revenue from  premiums by 15 percent this year compared with that in the year  before.    The insurance company founded on October 20, 1949 has an  employment of 110,000 and premium revenue was RMB 49.96 billion  [renminbi] last year, 35.6 percent up over the previous year.  The total amount in indemnities paid at home and broad was  valued at RMB 27.85 billion.</p>

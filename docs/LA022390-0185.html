			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCENROE LOSES APPEAL OF FINES; COULD FACE BAN FROM GRAND SLAM  </P> <P> John McEnroe has lost his appeal against fines imposed during the Australian  Open and could be banned from playing other Grand Slam tournaments if he runs  into further trouble this year, tennis officials said today.  </P> <P> The fiery American was disqualified from the Australian Open last month and  fined $6,500 after incurring three code violations during his fourth-round  match against Sweden's Mikael Pernfors.  </P> <P> "All the fines have been upheld and McEnroe is now $1,000 away from being  denied entry to the following Grand Slam if he incurs more fines,"  International Tennis Federation spokesman Ian Barnes said.  </P> <P> Any player who collects fines totaling $7,500 in the Grand Slam events within a  12-month period is banned from the next of the big four tournaments.  </P> <P> McEnroe has yet to decide which events he will take part in this year, but if  he played the French Open and was penalized he could be barred from Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Barnes said McEnroe's appeal was considered by Grand Slam tournaments  administrator Bill Babcock in London earlier this week.  </P> <P> Barnes emphasized that today's decision by the federation applies only to Grand  Slam events. McEnroe still could accrue fines at regular ATP tournaments and  not be forced to miss any of the Grand Slam events this year.  </P> <P> In his match against Pernfors, McEnroe first was warned for unsportsmanlike  conduct, then was docked a penalty point for racket abuse and was assessed a  fine of $500.  </P> <P> He was then defaulted after verbally abusing the referee and supervisor. The  third code violation cost McEnroe another $5,000, plus an additional $1,000  penalty for being disqualified.  </P></p>

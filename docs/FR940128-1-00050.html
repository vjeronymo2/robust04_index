			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, FDA is proposing to make importers subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general provisions of subpart A. Thus, FDA is proposing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.11(a) to require that products that are offered for import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be produced under the same HACCP and sanitation controls that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposing to apply to domestically produced seafood. FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to require that importers adopt an HACCP plan that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the criteria for how they will decide to purchase and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then handle seafood while it is under their control. They must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also establish ways to determine that these requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More specifically, the plan must include hazard analysis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points, and critical limits for each type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product imported as well as a copy of each supplier's HACCP plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those products, as required in &sect;123.11(b). Under proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.11(b), these plans must be available on file at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer's U.S. place of business. As stated above, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is developing a hazard analysis book to assist importers, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as processors, in designing their individual plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the proposed requirement of &sect;123.11(b) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers must have on file an HACCP plan from each of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign suppliers, foreign processors who wish to offer their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products for import into the United States after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of this regulation will have to operate under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valid HACCP plans and sanitation control procedures and furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copies of those plans to the U.S. importers. The foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors should maintain appropriate monitoring records, as dictated by the principles of HACCP already discussed. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records should be kept at the foreign processors' places of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Importers will be required under proposed &sect;123.11(c) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take affirmative steps to monitor that their suppliers are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact operating under their HACCP plans. Thus, under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal, the importer will need to take such steps as: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obtaining records from the foreign processors' facilities; (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining certification from foreign governments that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers are operating under valid HACCP plans or obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification lot by lot; (3) visiting the facilities to inspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them on a regular basis; or (4) taking some similar type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action, e.g., end product testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, importers of swordfish may specify to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers that the mercury level in the swordfish that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase cannot exceed FDA's action level of 1 part per million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methyl mercury. The importers may decide to require certificates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of analysis for methyl mercury on a regular basis from their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers as a means of ensuring that the swordfish that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer for import into the United States is not adulterated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 123.11(d) provides an option for those importing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a country that has an active memorandum of understanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (MOU) or similar agreement with FDA. If the MOU is current, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if there is equivalency between the inspection system of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign country and the U.S. system, the importer will be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rely on the MOU in lieu of the actions required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.11(c). An active MOU must accurately reflect the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation between the signing parties and be functioning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable in its entirety. It is the importer's responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine whether the MOU is in fact active, and whether it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covers the products that the importer intends to receive from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the agency strongly encourages importers (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in proposed &sect;123.11(e)) to require their suppliers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain HACCP training such as is required in &sect;123.9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;123.12 provides that there must be evidence that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood offered for import has been produced in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 123, subpart A. As stated previously, FDA is including this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to ensure that there is equivalent treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported and domestic products. FDA can ensure that domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product is being produced in accordance with the HACCP plan and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sanitation controls in &sect;123.10 through direct observation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and review of records. Similar inspection of foreign processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be prohibitively expensive. However, FDA tentatively finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that mere reliance on the existence of an HACCP plan is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough, and that additional evidence of compliance must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided. FDA tentatively finds that this evidence can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the means listed in proposed &sect;123.12(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the ways that the agency contemplates obtaining this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence would be by inspecting, at the importers' U.S. place of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business, the importers' and foreign suppliers' HACCP plans,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation procedures, and records associated with the importers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans. If these records demonstrate that the foreign processor and the importer are operating in accordance with adequate HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans, agency will have assurance that the food is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also intends to pursue MOU's with countries that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that their inspection systems are and continue to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially equivalent to those in the United States (proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.12(a)(2)). The existence of an active MOU between FDA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the country of origin covering the seafood products being offered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for import will provide assurance that these products covered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MOU are being produced under appropriate conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If there is no MOU, the agency will take into consideration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of verifying the compliance of imported seafood,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> knowledge that a foreign country has an advanced seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection system that provides for plans that are HACCP based,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as provided in proposed &sect;123.12(a)(3). The existence of such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory system and its enforcement will provide assurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the conditions under which products exported from that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country are being produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;123.12(a)(4) provides that inspection of foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors by the agency or other organization designated by FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may also be used to establish compliance with these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the agency intends to use other measures as it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds appropriate to make determinations about the acceptability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the product being offered for import, including but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to end product testing, as in proposed &sect;123.12(a)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

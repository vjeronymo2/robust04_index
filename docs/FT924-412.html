			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Japan's economic woes compounded by political disarray: Tokyo is playing to an overseas audience BEFORE THE Japanese government halved its growth forecast for this year, most consumers knew something was definitely wrong with the economy - for the past few weeks they have been flooded with retailers' catalogues offering deep discounts well ahead of the traditional New Year sales. The delay in cutting the growth estimate from 3.5 to 1.6 per cent partly shows the government is playing to an international audience as much as to Japanese consumers more inclined to believe retailers' promises than the government's optimistic economic projections. The US is pressing Japan to prove it is stimulating the domestic economy and making a contribution to international recovery. Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry, now making final adjustments to the 1993-1994 budget, confessed spending would be limited by a fall in tax revenue, leaving the government's forecast of 3.3 per cent growth next year open to mockery even from within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of an LDP faction, suggested the forecasts were made 'for another country, not our own'; the Association of Corporate Executives said the growth target already seemed out of reach. The budget draft calls for a 0.2 per cent increase in total spending, but a 4.8 per cent increase in public works outlays, which the Finance Ministry hopes will encourage a recovery. But most private economists and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, believe another spending package and income tax cuts are necessary. Even so, the economy is unlikely to grow by the estimated 3.3 per cent next year. Private growth forecasts range between 2.3 and 2.8 per cent, and a few Japanese economists expect no more than 2 per cent, believing things will get worse before getting better. Personal consumption is especially weak and corporate fixed investment, estimated to be down 3.8 per cent this year, is still falling. Department store sales are about 5 per cent down on a year earlier and shipments of personal computers in October were 29 per cent lower than in the same month last year. Another sign of the continuing slowdown was a 0.5 per cent contraction in money supply growth last month, against a year earlier. The Bank of Japan argues the decline was due more to a fall in demand for new lending than to banks' inability to lend, but it is clear these institutions, burdened by an ever larger pile of non-performing loans, have become extremely risk-averse. The banks are scheduled to launch a loan and land buying agency next month, but it will speed the write-off of bad loans rather than stimulating the ailing property market, the prime cause of their problems. Mr Miyazawa has hinted that public funds might eventually be used to support the banking system, though that would require a decisiveness not seen in his first year of rule. Some of the confusion over economic policy follows this year's political scandals. Finance Ministry officials have generally relied on the political guidance of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, in drafting budgets, but he has been sidelined by scandal. The influence of Mr Shin Kanemaru, until recently the 'godfather' of Japanese politics, was frequently sought in settling sensitive financial issues. The LDP is still in disarray, with talk of new parties and the present factions trying to poach new members, but the government will need to find a new policy fixer. A forecast Dollars 135bn (Pounds 88.8bn) trade surplus next year is likely to create problems with the US and EC, while squeezing tax cuts past the Finance Ministry will need deft negotiation. Having got this year's figures very wrong, the Economic Planning Agency has declined to say when a recovery will begin. It admits no sudden upsurge will occur in consumer demand or capital spending. The EPA insists Japanese companies face a cyclical rather than a structural downturn; the agency expects little rise in unemployment above the present 2.2 per cent. But signs exist that Japanese manufacturers, with their third year of declining profits, will lay off employees if demand keeps weakening. Car makers have transferred office staff to production lines and reduced part-time working, yet car sales keep falling. Production in November was down 9.3 per cent on a year earlier. Over the next year, the government may face not just lower-than-forecast growth, but also higher-than-imagined jobless figures.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: MOM 'DOESN'T WORK'? HA!  </P> <P> She described herself as a "rare breed who made a conscious decision to stop  work, stay at home and raise our child."  </P> <P> She went on to say that she's discovered it was a heck of a lot simpler to  manage an office of 20 employees (10 with PMS) than to be a full-time  homemaker.  </P> <P> The only problem, she writes, is, "How do you explain to people who ask, 'What  do you do with yourself all day?' "  </P> <P> It's the oldest question in the world. People never wait around for the answer.  They probably won't read to the end of this column, but here are some of the  answers shared by my readers through the years:  </P> <P> Thaw hamburger in the dry cycle of the dishwasher. Worm the dog, play cards  with a sick child who cheats, dress naked dolls, take phone messages for people  with a social life, make Christmas ornaments out of lint. Nurse a dead fern  that cost $20.  </P> <P> * "I spent an entire morning at the hospital when one of my kids swallowed a  rock," wrote one mother. "When I asked her why, she said she wasn't allowed to  eat any food before dinner and she was hungry. Surgery is scheduled for  Monday."  </P> <P> * "We looked everywhere for Marlene's sock. It turned up on the inside of her  brother's shirt during a social studies test."  </P> <P> * "It took a whole day to clean the stove, but it was worth all the chipping,  scrubbing and asphyxiation. My husband looked at it and said, 'You missed a  spot.' "  </P> <P> Cook 2,000 meals a year. Find everything that is lost. Wait for repairmen. Get  sitters who won't do for minimum what you do for free. Change toilet tissue  spindle.  </P> <P> * "The policeman pulled me over and said, 'I'm giving you a ticket for no plate  on your car.' I couldn't believe it until I looked at my son and his friend in  back. They had been playing gas station with it and didn't put the screws on  tight."  </P> <P> * "My sons belonged to Little League, and I spent my springs on a lawn chair in  a field. We ate supper at 4 p.m. and again at 8. I did my Girl Scout work while  I waited for my sons to be in left field for the one inning they played to miss  all the balls."  </P> <P> * "I fed the dog a new dog food and he threw up on the new beige carpet and it  left a hot-pink stain. It took a folder full of correspondence from me to get  the product off the market."  </P> <P> Make a meat loaf shaped like a heart for Valentine's Day, keep children from  killing one another, check food daily to see what expired as I slept. Teach  morality, respect, cleanliness, goodness, and how to say thank you. Drive.  Drive. Drive.  </P> <P> What do we do all day? Even if people stopped to listen, they wouldn't believe  it.  </P></p>

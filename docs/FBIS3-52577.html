A spokesman for IM in London told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  yesterday  that "over the past two days, a large IM force occupied the  mountain range of Ahmad Awah" overlooking the road between the  towns of al-Sulaymaniyah and Halabjah near the borders with Iran.    He added that the villages of "Balkhah, Ahmad Awah, Byara,  and Tawilah are now under the control of IM forces" and that the  IM forces "have killed or wounded no less than 15 PUK members  and taken prisoner 25 others."    PUK sources denied that, but said that "limited fighting"  took place the day before yesterday near the village of Tawilah  on the border with Iran. They added that "remnants of the IM  along with some members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard  attacked the village but were immediately driven out of it."    According to the same sources, the "IM remnants are trying  to  regroup inside Iranian territory with the help of the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard." [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dr. Barham Salih,  member  of the PUK and "Kurdistan region government" representative in  Washington, said that his party "which was compelled to fight  the IM" did not wish to end the IM "as a political  oraganization.... We just want it to comply with the decisions  and laws of the (Kurdish) parliament and government, and to  operate in accordance with the law organizing freedom of  partisan action in Kurdistan, which prohibits the presence of  armed party militias outside the framework of the unified  Kurdistan army."</p>

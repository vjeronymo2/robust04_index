			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 14 Mar -- I am satisfied that the Serb  side is thinking positively with regard to what is happening in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, including using the idea of a  Muslim-Croatian federation to advance a Bosnian settlement.  This was stated by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's  special envoy and deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia,  following meetings today with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic and members of the Bosnian Serb leadership.    The Russian diplomat said that several formulas for a future  structure of Bosnia that takes account of the interests of all  its three peoples are now being examined. Alongside the  promising possibility of a Croatian-Muslim formation joining a  confederation with Croatia, the possibility of the Bosnian Serbs  joining a confederation with Yugoslavia is also a quite logical  option.    Replying to a question about the possibility of the United  States recognizing a Serb republic in Bosnia, Churkin said that  the United States understands that when the sovereign rights of  two peoples of Bosnia are recognized, the sovereign rights of  the third -- the Serb people -- must also be recognized. I  simply cannot see any arguments in favor of any other approach,  he stressed.    Speaking about the most difficult problem of the Bosnian  settlement -- the territorial demarcation of the communities,  Churkin said that the new American approach does not envisage  new territorial concessions by the Serbs. The previous  proposals by the EU, with which the Serb side agreed, remain in  force, he said.</p>

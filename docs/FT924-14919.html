			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / VAT man finally lets shellfishers off the hook DEVON fishermen angling to keep crab and lobster bait free of value added tax have landed a resounding victory against HM Customs and Excise thanks to the sophisticated palates of shellfish. After an intensive 15-month campaign, Customs has agreed that fresh fish used to catch shellfish will not be liable for VAT - as long as they are fit for human consumption. Maggots, lugworms and other bait used by anglers will retain the 17.5 per cent levy. At the heart of the case is the fact that crabs and lobsters are highly discriminating creatures which will not eat anything that humans will not eat. Mr Chris Venmore, honorary secretary of South Devon Shellfishermen, said: 'As a rule of thumb, if a human won't eat it, a crab won't eat it. The fresher the fish, the better the catch.' Mr Peter Watt, who sells fish to shellfishermen and was faced with a possible backdated VAT claim of Pounds 78,000, said yesterday: 'I am very relieved. This was one of those silly laws that should never have been there.' The problem came to light several years ago when a local VAT inspector noticed an invoice including VAT from a fish merchant to a crab fisherman and decided that all fresh fish for that use was bait - liable to tax. The fishermen argued that their fish is not bait but food fit for human consumption, which is zero-rated. They say that bait is bought in small quantities by hobbyist anglers, while fish is bought in large quantities for commercial shellfishing. The fishermen could have claimed back the VAT, but this would have taken three months. This led to the launch of a campaign in July last year by the association, which represents 200 fishermen and crew accounting for more than half of the UK's crab and lobster harvest. Three letters sent via Mr Anthony Steen MP, to the Treasury and the paymaster general, who is responsible for Customs, were rebuffed. Only after the association threatened to appeal to the VAT tribunal and was given a meeting to put its case did Customs relent.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Moves in dispute at Bank of Italy A long-running wages and conditions dispute involving the bulk of the 9,400 employees at the Bank of Italy has reached partial solution following agreement between the central bank and union representatives on a new package after three days' negotations, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.

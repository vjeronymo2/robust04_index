			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Retailers warned of US discount threat RETAILERS were warned yesterday of a threat from 'warehouse clubs' which have have had a 'devastating price impact' on traditional supermarkets in the US. Mr Tony MacNeary, an analyst at stockbrokers County NatWest, told a retailing conference in London that Costco, one of the biggest US clubs, planned to open two stores in the UK in the next 18 months. The clubs, dubbed the 'silent enemy' in the US, sell a limited range of deeply discounted goods from large, rudimentary stores. Shoppers are required to join a 'club' to benefit from the low retail prices. More than 65 per cent of volume sales go to wholesalers. Since 1985 the US clubs have increased food sales at an annual rate of 37 per cent, with gross margins of 8 per cent to 10 per cent compared with the 25 per cent enjoyed by traditional supermarkets. The club sector in the US has expanded from four stores with total sales of Dollars 275m in 1980 to 500 stores with Dollars 28bn of sales by last year. 'What the club stores in the US are inflicting on the traditional supermarkets today could prove as momentous as the change bought about in the industry in the 1950s,' Mr MacNeary said. That was when supermarkets challenged the then-traditional stores. International competition in the UK discount food market has recently intensified with the arrival of the Aldi chain, from Germany, and Netto from Denmark. Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of Gateway, told the conference that the UK supermarket group would open three more Food Giant superstores by April, making 18 in all.</p>

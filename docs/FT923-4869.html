			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / FT Conference (World Aerospace and Air Transport): Aircraft launch programmes cut OVERCAPACITY in the commercial aircraft industry, rising costs of new product development, and airlines' continuing financial problems will lead to a sharp cut in programme launches over the next two decades. This warning was given by Mr Adam Brown, planning director of the European Airbus consortium, at a Financial Times conference yesterday. The three leading aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas, had launched a total of 19 new or important aircraft derivative programmes during the past 20 years. 'I find it extremely difficult to envisage more than a quarter this number - that is, at a maximum four or five - major product launches in the next 20 years', Mr Brown said. Future programmes are expected to include a new 400-600 seater super jumbo aircraft, a second generation supersonic airliner to replace Concorde, and new derivatives of existing widebody and narrowbody twin-engine airliners. Overcapacity has largely resulted from the new aircraft order frenzy by airlines from 1988 to 1990 which has created a total firm order backlog equivalent to five years of future production compared to the industry's historical average of just over two years. From peak delivery levels of this year, Mr Brown expected aircraft industry business volumes to shrink from 800 deliveries this year to about 400 in 2004, picking up to around 600 aircraft a year by 2008-2010. The industry remains optimistic about long-term growth prospects for air travel and new aircraft demand, but future aircraft delivery forecasts would ultimately depend on the ability of airlines to finance new aircraft purchases. 'The key challenge facing airlines in the 1990s is not one of shortage of aircraft as in the late 1980s, but of a shortage of capital,' Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman of GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group, said. The airline industry's huge losses during the past two years were catastrophic for a business which needs to finance at least Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15bn) a year in new aircraft. 'Since mid-1990, the world airline industry has lost at least Dollars 10bn, an amount roughly equivalent to its entire earnings in the previous six years,' Mr Foley said. 'For any industry, such a setback would be a significant blow: for one which must finance over Dollars 30bn-worth of assets per year on average, it is a catastrophe.' Similar concerns were echoed by Mr Brian Rowe, head of US General Electric's aero-engine activities. He said the main question facing the industry was: 'How do we continue to develop large commercial engines when our customers are losing multi-billions of dollars a year and it seems they are still a few years away from relief?'</p>

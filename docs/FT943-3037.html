			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Greek deputies vote to indict former premier: Mitsotakis faces bribe charge The Greek parliament voted last night to indict Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former conservative prime minister, on charges of accepting a bribe and breach of trust in the sale of Heracles General Cement to Calcestruzzi of Italy in 1992. Mr Mitsotakis, now a backbencher, is accused of taking a Dollars 22.5m (Pounds 14.5m) bribe to expedite the sale of the company to Cal-Nat, a joint venture of National Bank of Greece and Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of the Ferruzzi group. The joint venture paid Dollars 225m to acquire Heracles, the largest cement exporter in Europe, in the only big privatisation deal to proceed while the conservatives were in power. In a secret ballot held at midnight, 160 of the 300 deputies voted in favour of indicting Mr Mitsotakis. Deputies from the conservative New Democracy did not take part in the vote. The former prime minister will be tried by a special criminal court consisting of 13 senior judges. Two other former conservative cabinet ministers, Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos, who as industry minister headed the government's privatisation programme, and Mr Ioannis Paleocrassas, the ex-finance minister, were also indicted on breach of trust charges in the Heracles sale. Mr Mitsotakis denied the charges in parliament, saying the governing socialists' decision to investigate the Heracles sale 'was motivated by purely political reasons.' The case is widely seen as an attempt by the socialists to take revenge on Mr Mitsotakis and his New Democracy party for taking Mr Andreas Papandreou, then opposition leader, to court in 1991 on corruption charges arising from a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete. Mr Papandreou, who refused to attend proceedings, was acquitted by a special court. The case against Mr Mitsotakis and his former cabinet ministers has triggered a crisis in the New Democracy party, which was divided over whether to support the former prime minister at yesterday's debate on the charges. Privatisation was a contentious issue for New Democracy while it was in power. It was opposed by the party's present leader, Mr Miltiades Evert, and contributed to New Democracy's fall from power last year, when a group of conservative MPs opposed to the planned disposal of OTE, the state telecoms company, defected.</p>

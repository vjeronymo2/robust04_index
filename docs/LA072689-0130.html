			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH DISAGREES WITH REAGAN, BACKS LIMIT OF 2 TERMS IN OFFICE  </P> <P> President Bush said in an interview released today that he does not agree with  former President Ronald Reagan that the Constitution's 22nd Amendment limiting  the chief executive to two terms should be repealed.  </P> <P> Bush told Knight-Ridder Newspapers that he supports the "status quo," unlike  his predecessor who complained about the limit and even indicated that he would  have enjoyed seeking a third term despite being the oldest President in  history.  </P> <P> Reagan, 78, vowed to campaign for repeal of the amendment after he left office  six months ago. The amendment was promoted during his own younger political  days by Republicans upset at the four White House terms won by Democrat  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  </P></p>

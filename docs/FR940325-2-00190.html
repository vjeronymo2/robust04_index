			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is presently seeking approval to add certain Exchange rules to the list of rules subject to possible imposition of fines under Rule 476A procedures. The types of rules covered generally include reporting, required approvals, record retention and conduct of accounts for which determinations of violations can be made objectively.

Rule 346(e) provides that persons delegated supervisory responsibilities must devote their full time to the business of the member organization during business hours, unless otherwise permitted by the Exchange (Rule 346.10). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 346(g) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Provides that no member, member organization, allied member, approved person or employee of any person in a control relationship with a member or member organization shall be associated with any person subject to a statutory disqualification as defined in the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 352(b) and (c) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Prohibits a member, member organization, allied member, registered representative or officer from guaranteeing any customer against loss in any account and from sharing in profits or losses in a customer's account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 440C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _States that no member or member organization should ``fail to deliver'' against a short sale until a diligent effort has been made to borrow necessary securities to make delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 472(c) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Requires members and member organizations to retain communications with customers and the public ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> advertisements, research reports, sales literature) for at least three years. The communications must also contain the name of the person who prepared the material, the name of the person approving its issuance, and be readily available to the Exchange upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure whereby members, allied members, employees and member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those instances when a rule violation is minor in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter is appropriate. The proposed rule change provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with the requirements of sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=3 --> III.

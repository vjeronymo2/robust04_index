			<p>BFN     [Text] An explosion occurred early this morning under a car  from a foreign embassy. The car, a Volvo, belonged to the  Swedish Embassy in Athens, and was parked on the corner of Iason  and Dhios Streets in Vouliameni. Firemen discovered the  homemade device and linked it with a group of anarchists. No  group claimed responsibility for the explosion.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HEARING RENEWS CALL TO SHUT LOPEZ DUMP;  </P> <P> AIR QUALITY: AREA RESIDENTS TESTIFY THAT THEY SUFFER HEALTH PROBLEMS CAUSED BY  TOXIC GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE LANDFILL.  </P> <P> Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon residents told air quality officials Friday  that foul odors from the Lopez Canyon Landfill have become worse and more  frequent in the last six months and once again called for the dump to be shut  down.  </P> <P> Several residents also told the South Coast Air Quality Management District  hearing board that they or their children have suffered health problems they  believe were caused by toxic gas emissions from the dump.  </P> <P> "I am so angry," said Kagel Canyon resident Ellen Shaheen. "Daily, I smell the  odors and they're getting worse. My son has sneezing fits."  </P> <P> Several participants said the dump would not remain open if it were located in  a more affluent neighborhood.  </P> <P> Residents said that odors were particularly strong Wednesday night, when the  AQMD issued a citation to the city for causing a public nuisance, the second  citation since March.  </P> <P> "In the past six months, the odor has gotten worse and worse," said Kagel  Canyon resident Neal Morris. "I've felt it going into my lungs."  </P> <P> Friday's hearing at Dexter Park in Kagel Canyon was the third time this month  that members of the AQMD board have traveled to northeast San Fernando Valley  to take public testimony on toxic gas emissions at the landfill.  </P> <P> Residents and elected officials representing the area have charged that the  city of Los Angeles, which owns the landfill, is violating state laws on  methane gas emissions. They have asked the board to close the dump until gases  are controlled.  </P> <P> City Bureau of Sanitation officials have admitted that gas emissions at the  dump violate state law, but said they will be in "substantial compliance" with  the law by Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The hearing board, a quasi-judicial panel, will continue taking testimony at  the AQMD headquarters in El Monte on June 8. They are scheduled to hear a  doctor who treated an 11-year-old girl who became sick after she inhaled gas  from the dump. Deputy City Atty. Christopher Westhoff, representing the Bureau  of Sanitation, said he will present his own health experts then.  </P> <P> About 100 residents attended some part of Friday's six-hour hearing.  </P> <P> Kagel Canyon resident Mary Shannon held up a large picture of her sons, ages 2  and 4, as she urged the hearing board to shut the landfill.  </P> <P> "The dump must be closed in order for the city to take my children's health  seriously," she said.  </P> <P> Michelle Zapple of Kagel Canyon said her pediatrician has told her that  long-term exposure to gases from the dump could be harmful to her two small  children. She is pregnant with her third child.  </P> <P> Lake View Terrace resident Patricia Rivera said her year-old daughter became  ill and was diagnosed as having a bacterial infection in her bloodstream caused  by "something airborne" after walking outside near her home.  </P> <P> In addition to calling for the board to close the landfill, Anson Burlingame of  nearby Shadow Hills asked that a planned expansion of the dump be halted until  gas emissions are brought under control.  </P> <P> After the hearing, J. Malcolm Toy, the city's principal sanitary engineer, said  the city will have spent $2.7 million to install a gas collection system to  control the problem. He said 48 wells to control emissions have been installed  and that 200 more are planned.  </P> <P> "We'll do whatever it takes," he said.  </P></p>

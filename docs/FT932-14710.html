			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / EC-US buying row continues EC and US negotiators have apparently failed to make a breakthrough in two rounds of talks this week in Brussels aimed at resolving the trans-atlantic dispute over government buying rules. The impasse raises the stakes ahead of next week's talks in Washington between Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. 'Everything depends on the Brittan-Kantor talks,' the Commission said yesterday. The US has threatened to impose sanctions against the EC unless the Community agrees to suspend Article 29 of its utility directive which gives a 3 per cent price preference for EC businesses bidding for contracts in the gas, water, transport and telecommunications sectors. The EC is prepared to waive the article, but only in return for reciprocal concessions in the US market. The sanctions would amount to just Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m) on existing EC contracts in the US, but the political fall-out would be much greater. EC-US relations have soured over disagreements on steel subsidies and the stalled Gatt world trade talks. During next week's talks, both sides will discuss how to give fresh impetus to the Gatt Uruguay Round, focusing on improving market access through lower tariffs. EC officials expressed disappointment yesterday with US tariffs proposals, but said President Bill Clinton's decision last week to press ahead with 'fast track' negotiating authority for the Gatt round was encouraging.</p>

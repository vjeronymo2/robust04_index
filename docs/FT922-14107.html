			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Close battle in the land of zero poll tax - Labour has the edge in Tooting but may struggle to take Battersea IF LABOUR fails to secure the London seats it needs on April 9, it will be because it has not got its message through to people like Peter Davies. A plasterer and first-time voter, he lives in a tatty housing estate on the north side of Lavender Hill, in Battersea, south-west London. With the recession biting, he earns well under Pounds 20,000 a year, but will be voting Tory. 'Labour are only going to put up taxes,' he explains in a remark which is likely to exasperate John Smith and his shadow Treasury team. Battersea, with the second smallest Tory majority in the capital - 857  - was won by John Bowis in 1987, after 52 years in Labour hands. Neighbouring Tooting has been held for Labour by Tom Cox since 1970, but with an increasingly precarious majority. The two seats may confound any national or capital-wide swing to Labour on polling day. Both are in Wandsworth, the Conservatives' model borough, renowned for its low poll tax and which voted decisively in favour of the Tories and against the prevailing trend in the council elections of 1990. Both have been affected by gentrification, with thousands of professionals moving in at the expense of comparatively low-paid manual workers. It has been widely assumed that these factors would turn Labour's task of winning Battersea and holding Tooting into an uphill battle. The comments of people like Peter Davies suggest a third element - the continuing alienation of residents in traditional Labour-voting areas. Several of his neighbours have expressed the same voting intentions. Their reasons range from gratitude for implementing the council house right-to-buy scheme to opposition to Labour's perceived bias in favour of gays and ethnic minorities. Alf Dubs, Labour's self-effacing and experienced candidate, concedes that many traditional Labour supporters believe there is nothing the three main parties can do to help them. The level of 'undecideds' is still quite high. Dubs, Battersea's MP for eight years before he was unseated, is more upbeat about the impact on his prospects of Wandsworth council's antics. Like Tom Cox in Tooting, he claims there is a mounting feeling that a low poll tax is 'too high a price to pay' for cuts in services. Both Labour candidates expect to be helped by publicity surrounding the borough's hurriedly withdrawn plans to cut more than Pounds 3m from local school budgets. Both argue that gentrification has slowed and will therefore load the dice against them less than it did in 1987. Cox believes that the Tories cannot count on the yuppie vote. Rising unemployment and the moribund property market have left them 'very, very bitter', he says, acknowledging that he would be more worried about the potential impact 'if the economy was bubbling.' Well-drilled and resourceful though his team is, Dubs faces a further obstacle - the impressive and individualistic campaign being waged by John Bowis. There can be few Tory candidates who make such abundant use of the colour pink in campaign materials. He has also rejected Central Office's Henry Purcell campaign theme in favour of a ditty by Andrew Lloyd Webber. 'We won with it last time,' he explains. With his dumpy frame and wide-set eyes, Bowis has the priceless knack of exuding integrity on the doorstep. In contrast to the torpor and disorganisation which have dogged the Conservatives' national campaign, his team bristles with vigour and military discipline. Asked about polls indicating a substantial swing in the capital to Labour, Bowis chuckles and brands them 'absurd'. In Tooting, it is the Tories who are likely to emerge disappointed as a revitalised Cox campaign - supplemented by a squadron of helpers from Surbiton - appears to have got its act together, making the constituency office hum. The former junior Treasury minister, who entered parliament at the same time as Neil Kinnock, has not been among Westminster's most prominent characters. But leafletting on Tooting Broadway, he is in his element: a Captain Mainwaring figure in blue anorak and sensible shoes, exchanging pleasantries and barking advice to constituents, with many of whom he clearly enjoys a close and cordial relationship. Martin Winter, his main opponent, has spent most of the campaign hobbling around on NHS crutches. His broken ankle may symbolise his prospects. He may find his best chance of winning the seat came and went with the buoyant economy of 1987. In a morning rendezvous with a dozen pensioners, he is cheerful and articulate, but describes his early experience of the City as if addressing a bunch of merchant banking trainees. 'He is a very charming young man but he is too soft,' concludes Ethel Hammond, who is 80-ish going on 35. That is a judgment few would level at his canny opponent.</p>

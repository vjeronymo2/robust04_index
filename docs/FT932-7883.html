			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / The Property Market: The end of the Georgian reign - The exodus of companies from Edinburgh's traditional business district Charlotte Square in Edinburgh, as the firms which operate there like to boast, is the best business address in Europe. Yet many of its occupants are deserting it. In the past 18 months the whole of the south side of the square has become vacant, there are empty buildings on both the east and west sides, and a building on the north side is for sale. As the 'for let' signs proliferate, some people fear that parts of the square, designed by Robert Adam, may soon look tatty. In one sense Charlotte Square is only the most spectacular victim of the downturn in the Edinburgh office property market which has left vacant about 200 Georgian houses used as offices throughout the city's New Town. In a normal market about 40 would be vacant, says Mr Andy Irvine of Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors. But Charlotte Square's plight is also the product of another trend which many people involved in the city's development regard positively: the expansion of the business district from the New Town out to Lothian Road to the south. Edinburgh's prime office district has traditionally comprised the dumbbell formed by Charlotte Square to the west and St Andrew Square to the east, connected by George Street. Most firms in the New Town occupy Georgian houses. In Charlotte Square the solicitors Dundas &amp; Wilson until recently occupied five houses. The tightly enforced rules for grade A listed buildings meant that to install computer wiring meant getting planning permission to drill holes in thick walls. But the area was prestigious and there was virtually nowhere nearby with good open-plan accommodation. The constraints on development in the New Town, the slow process of getting planning permission and the lack of office space elsewhere meant that when businesses expanded in the late-1980s rents for the best office accommodation trebled from Pounds 7 per square foot in 1985 to Pounds 21 in 1989. It was not until late 1991 that alternative accommodation attractive to Charlotte Square occupants became available, when Saltire Court, a high quality stone-faced office building in Castle Terrace off Lothian Road was completed. Saltire Court went ahead after Edinburgh district council reversed years of opposition to fostering the financial sector, and released the site. The first occupants were Martin Currie and KPMG Peat Marwick from Charlotte Square, followed by Dundas &amp; Wilson. But Scottish Metropolitan, the developer, was unlucky: by the time Saltire Court was finished the approaching recession made companies wary of moving, especially if they were unable to find tenants to take on their existing properties. (Some tenants of Saltire Court are still paying rent on their former properties, in addition to the headline rent of Pounds 22-Pounds 23 per sq ft in the new building). Only now, after solicitors Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn decided in March to move from Charlotte Square, is 92 per cent of Saltire Court's 175,000 sq ft of office space let. But people working in Saltire Court and other developments near Lothian Road will still feel slightly out on a limb until a long-standing 10-acre site between the Caledonian Hotel and the Sheraton fills up. Progress there is at last being made, sufficient to allow Mr Jim McFarlane of Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise (Leel), the local enterprise company, to claim that Edinburgh is 'bucking the recession'. Work began in January on a Pounds 38m conference centre, designed by the post-modernist architect Terry Farrell and capable of holding 1,200 people, on a site on Morrison Street. The conference centre has long been considered the cornerstone to the development of the Lothian Road site. The council and Leel set up a company to build and run the conference centre and to develop the rest of the site, after the original consortium of Sheraton Securities and Greycoat, which was to have developed the centre, collapsed. That gave Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based life assurance company, the confidence to choose Lothian Road to accommodate its expansion. It should shortly get consent for a 270,000 sq ft office complex on a site which it will buy from the council and from Queens Moat, owner of the Caledonian Hotel. Further south Scottish Widows is seeking planning permission for a new 800,000 sq ft headquarters on the 6.5-acre Port Hamilton site, which it would buy from the receivers of Ford Sellar Morris, another victim of the property collapse. Meanwhile a joint venture between Cala and Morrison Group, both Scottish companies, says it will proceed with a 190,000 sq ft office building close to the conference centre. The consortium is confident of obtaining a pre-let before going ahead. If all these schemes go ahead the central business district will have been extended southwards and the Lothian Road area will have become Edinburgh's main area for large city centre offices. But though Saltire Court has shown that Edinburgh firms can be tempted out of their Georgian splendour, some people doubt whether occupiers requiring up to 30,000 sq ft of space will rush to abandon the New Town. Mr Peter Smolka of Hillier Parker points out that several offices with open-plan space are finished or under construction behind Georgian facades in the New Town. 'I'd say there are enough developments under construction to retain a lot of prospective tenants in the traditional core. Suddenly Edinburgh has become a city that offers a choice of accommodation,' he says. Rents have come back to Pounds 16. So where does this leave Charlotte Square? Mr Smolka believes the council will have to allow more alterations behind the facades if the exodus is to be halted. Significantly, Mr David Murray, a Scottish tycoon, recently obtained consent to redevelop the Roxburghe Hotel on the corner of the square, mainly as offices. Mr Roy Durie of chartered surveyors Ryden says there are a number of smaller occupiers - 'public relations companies, advertising agencies and professional firms' - which would dearly like a Charlotte Square address. Jones Lang Wootton's Mr Irvine says: 'I am not at all gloomy about Charlotte Square.' Despite the attractions of open-plan offices, Georgian houses 'work very well for businesses with up to 25 people.' But though sentiment in the market has begun improving, Mr Irvine says many businesses which would like to move are locked into long leases.</p>

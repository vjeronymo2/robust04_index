			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE WARNS L.A. OF DUMPING FINES;  </P> <P> $1,000-A-DAY THREAT IS LATEST ROUND IN GROWING FIGHT OVER LOPEZ CANYON  </P> <P> State solid waste officials threatened Friday to fine the city of Los Angeles  $1,000 a day unless operations are cut back at the city's Lopez Canyon  Landfill.  </P> <P> The California Waste Management Board's orders escalated the growing conflict  over alleged violations at the landfill. City officials said they will fight  the orders in court Monday.  </P> <P> The state wants to restrict the amount of daily dumping and reduce the  long-term capacity of the landfill. If the city obeys the orders, said Edward  J. Avila, president of the city Board of Public Works, the dump will be filled  and shut down in about a year, heightening Los Angeles' trash crisis.  </P> <P> The dump above Lake View Terrace receives two-thirds of the city's household  trash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State 'Unreasonable'  </P> <P> "We will go to court to protect Lopez Canyon Landfill," Avila said. "What's  incredible is that the state has chosen to attack the city's only landfill and  is being totally unreasonable."  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Christopher M. Westoff said he will seek a temporary  restraining order in Los Angeles Superior Court to halt the immediate effect of  the state's orders.  </P> <P> State officials said they intend to counter with a request for the court to  force Los Angeles to abide by the rules.  </P> <P> The state's action was spurred by Los Angeles County's refusal to carry out  earlier state orders to reduce intake at the landfill and limit the area in  which trash can be dumped. The county Department of Health Services enforces  state laws at Lopez Canyon, but refused to impose limits that would force the  city to use county landfills, which are also filling rapidly.  </P> <P> The central issue is whether Lopez Canyon is bound by a restrictive 1978 state  permit that limits trash intake to 400 trucks a day, caps the height of the  landfill at 1,725 feet and confines dumping to 140 acres of the 392-acre site.  </P> <P> The state says the 1978 permit is valid.  </P> <P> The city, however, says a less stringent, 1983 engineering report filed with  the state had amended the permit. That report, which reflects current landfill  operations, allows up to 600 trucks a day, a 1,740-foot height and a wider  dumping area.  </P> <P> The dump takes in about 4,000 tons of trash a day. The state orders would  reduce that to about 3,100 tons a day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Permit Application  </P> <P> In refusing to enforce the state orders, the county allowed city officials to  operate under the 1983 permit as long as they applied to the state for a new  one.  </P> <P> "We had hoped the county would enforce the orders," said Chris Peck, spokesman  for the state Waste Management Board. "Our position is that the state is  ultimately responsible for enforcing the permit."  </P> <P> The city filed suit last month to settle the dispute. A Sept. 26 hearing date  has been set.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is the state is acting in bad faith because this matter is  already before the court," Westoff said, adding that he believes the city is on  firm legal grounds because it is abiding by the county order and has applied  for a new permit.  </P> <P> In addition, both city and county officials argue that the state orders are not  valid because they were issued by executive staff members of the waste board  and not by a vote of its nine members.  </P> <P> Peck said board regulations allow the executive staff to issue such orders.  </P> <P> Lake View Terrace residents, who have long complained of noise, odors, blowing  trash and heavy truck traffic in their hillside neighborhoods, expressed anger  at the city's refusal to abide by state orders.  </P> <P> "It is a waste of energy and taxpayers' money for the city to fight this," said  Dennis Ghiatis, of the Kagel Canyon Civic Assn. "The time and money can be  better spent solving the problems."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: BUSHES BEG OFF, BUT THE $1-MILLION BENEFIT IS ON  </P> <P> It was going to be the power ball of power balls, an Orange County gala so  chock-full of political connections that it would be the envy of every charity  committee outside the White House. Until very recently, there was reason to  think that President Bush and his popular First Lady might be the guests of  honor at Saturday night's Orangewood Ball.  </P> <P> But the hopes of ball organizers were dashed when the call came from  Washington: thank you very much, but no thank you. One insider chalks up the  disappointment to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's recent visit: "President  Bush is just too busy."  </P> <P> Why would a local ball committee send an invitation to the President of the  United States? Give yourself 200 Social I.Q. points if you know the answer: a  few Orangewood activists -- William Lyon, Kathryn Thompson, George Argyros --  are members of Team 100, donors of $100,000 to Bush's presidential campaign. In  fact, when Kathryn Thompson and her husband, Gus Owen, dined with the First  Couple at the White House last year, Mrs. Bush remembered the tour of  Orangewood that Thompson gave her in 1988.  </P> <P> The good news is that the gala will raise more than $1 million, making it  Orange County's biggest single fund-raiser ever. How does one little ole soiree  rake in so many smackers? Simple. Forbes 400 developer William Lyon is at the  helm (ably assisted by developer and good friend Kathryn Thompson). Not only  have Lyon and his wife, Willa Dean, inspired commitment by tossing an  underwriting bash that pulled in $300,000 (more than enough to pay for ball  costs), they also plan to ante up $250,000 out of their own pockets. Ditto  developer Peter Ochs, president of the Fieldstone Co. And something new has  been added to everybody's favorite spring gala: a Gold Circle consisting of  donors of $25,000 or more. So far, 13 Orangewood supporters -- Tommy Tucker,  Glen Stillwell, Leo Cook and Marvin Weiss among them -- have joined those  ranks. Add 750 guests who have paid $300 each and you've got a gala that's  sitting on a powder keg of record-breaking dollars.  </P> <P> Festivities, themed "A New Beginning," begin at the Irvine Hilton with a  pool-side reception followed by dinner in a room hung with silk butterflies.  Dinner will include something tres nouvelle: caviar asparagus frappe served in  a martini glass. Dessert will be to die for: a hazelnut ladyfinger charlotte  topped with a chocolate filigree butterfly.  </P> <P> Speaking of Gorby: Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and wife Lois were in the  Soviet Union 10 days ago as guests of H.R. Haldeman. Seems Haldeman is working  with a couple of local businessmen to bring Moscow a thoroughly modern  business-hotel complex. As such, he was invited to attend a meeting of the  World Trade Council and he invited the Aldrins to come along. A few days into  the trip, the Aldrins found themselves at a party with about 500 guests,  including Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Mindful of his hero status, and  always gracious, Aldrin thoughtfully handed Gorbachev a picture postcard of  himself in his spacesuit. Gorbachev whipped out a pen, signed the card, and  handed it back to Aldrin. "He thought Buzz wanted his autograph!" Lois said  this week. "Isn't that a scream?"  </P> <P> Catching up with the Segerstrom salute: There are 50 seats still available for  the tribute that will mark a decade of involvement in the Orange County  Performing Arts Center by philanthropist Henry Segerstrom. Set for June 22 at  the Center, the $500-per-person gala has received "oui-oui" replies from 250  Center supporters. The elegant ivory invitations, which arrived two weeks ago,  feature the Center's famed Firebird metal sculpture in embossed splashes of  gold and bronze.  </P> <P> The party -- which Center President Thomas Kendrick describes as "simple,  elegant and classy, a party to embrace the Center family" -- will have a  Firebird theme and begin with a reception in the Center's backstage area.  Dinner will be served on stage in Segerstrom Hall, where guests will dine on  fare whipped up by the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. On the tentative menu: a  main course of lobster-stuffed veal chop. Decor? A huge screen will provide the  backdrop. During the festivities, the screen will be used to present a video  tribute to Segerstrom as well as project a blazing image of the Firebird. After  dinner, pianist Michael Feinstein will play for guests. The Segerstrom family  plans to attend, en masse, as does the entire Center board.  </P> <P> Chanel of New York in town: Who could miss the bevy of beauties dining at the  Emperor's Fortune restaurant in Santa Ana on Wednesday? None of the elegant  eatery's lunch crowd. Having a bite of gourmet Chinese while discussing plans  for the Opera Pacific gala that will open South Coast Plaza's new Chanel  boutique this fall were Barbara Cirkva and Arlette Thebault of Chanel, New  York; Jeanette Segerstrom, a member of the Opera Pacific board, and gala  co-chairwomen Donna Bunce and Gayle Anderson.  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Japan to become biggest donor Japan plans to extend about Dollars 120bn (Pounds 81bn) in foreign aid in the next five years, almost twice the amount it disbursed in the previous five years, and making it the world's biggest donor, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. The aid programme is designed to promote private capital investment in developing countries and undermine foreign criticism of Japan's growing trade surplus. Japan argues that the surplus does not damage the world economy because it recycles its export earnings as a capital outflow to the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong] </F>   [Text] China has allocated more funds for research on  natural sciences in a bid to encourage projects that have less  obvious commercial applications.    Professor Sun Shu, vice-president of the National Natural  Science Foundation of China, said the foundation had received an  average annual increase of 20 to 30 per cent of its budget since  1992.    This year, the foundation will receive about 366 million  yuan  (HK$326.5 million) from the Government, which will increase by  about 19 per cent to 430 million yuan next year, Professor Sun  said. The foundation is China's major research institution for  the natural sciences.    Lack of funding has long been a problem for China's  educational and research organisations, resulting in a serious  brain drain and a large proportion of the population remaining  illiterate.    Every year, Beijing allocates about 0.7 per cent of its  gross  national product on scientific research while across the Taiwan  Strait, Taipei allocates 1.7 per cent of its GDP on science.  [sentence as published]    Professor Sun, who is also a geology lecturer at the  prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "As a scientist,  I would say that not enough money has been injected into the  research and development of science and technology."    But the scholar was quick to add that the Chinese Government  had done its best for a developing country.    Qian Haoqing, division chief of the foundation's planning  bureau, said the Government had adopted a policy of supporting  commercial research only if it was economically viable, while  continuing to fund the less-commercial natural sciences.    Professor Sun said there were a series of measures to  encourage and groom young scientists to work in industry.</p>

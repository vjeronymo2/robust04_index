			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: LEGENDARY, BUT STILL ACTIVE, BENNY  CARTER TO PLAY ELARIO'S  </P> <P> Alto sax man Benny Carter didn't shred jazz traditions to establish new forms  like Charlie Parker did. Instead, Carter, whose roots are in the days of Big  Band swing, built a career around his sophisticated composing and arranging  skills and a subtle sound that emphasizes warm, melodic ideas above all else.  </P> <P> At 83, Carter continues to turn out the polished, swinging improvisations and  catchy, original songs that have been his trademark since he launched his  career in Big Bands during the 1920s. In the '30s, he emerged as a leader, and  has since fronted numerous Big Bands and small groups.  </P> <P> Proof of his enduring finesse is this year's "My Man Benny, My Man Phil," an  album with fellow alto man Phil Woods. Including six of Carter's own tunes, the  session captures Carter in fine form, his bright, full sound as strong as ever.  </P> <P> Carter plays Elario's Friday through Sunday in a quartet with Larry Nash on  piano, Larry Gales on bass and Sherman Ferguson on drums. Show times are 9 and  10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> As a crack studio musician, guitarist Tommy Tedesco shows up for work hauling a  suitcase loaded with string instruments. For example, he's spending the first  part of this week adding mandolin and guitar to the sound track for the movie,  "The Godfather Part III." But this Friday and Saturday nights at All That Jazz  in Rancho Bernardo, Tedesco, the closet be-bopper, will be free to play  whatever he wants. Sets each night are at 8, 9:15 and 10:30 at the new club  adjacent to the Wall Street Cafe.  </P> <P> The format will be something Tedesco calls "Confessions of a Studio Player." In  between songs, he regales audiences with stories of some of the things he has  seen and done during more than 30 years of studio work. Tedesco will  concentrate on acoustic and electric guitars, accompanied by local bassist Bob  Magnusson, but he also plans to hoist a mandolin to show how well it can work  for jazz.  </P> <P> The material will include several of his own tunes, many of them built around  Brazilian rhythms. Tedesco has played on hundreds of albums, either under his  own name or behind musicians as diverse as the Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, Ray  Charles, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. His most recent album was last year's  "Hollywood Gypsy." Tedesco's credits include soundtracks for the television  programs "MASH," "Ozzie and Harriet," "Gilligan's Island," "My Three Sons" and  "Charlie's Angels" on television, and for movies including "Bonnie &amp;  Clyde," "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" and "The French Connection."  </P> <P> Pianist Cecelia Coleman has been stirring things up in L.A., getting solid  reviews and winning this year's Shelley Manne Memorial New Talent Award from  the Los Angeles Jazz Society. Coleman, 28, plays the Horton Grand Hotel  downtown Saturday night at 8:30. She hasn't recorded an album of her own, but  she plays on a new one from saxophonist Ben Clatworthy. Schooled by pianists  Charlie Shoemake and Joanne Grauer, Coleman says her roots are "in be-bop, but  more of the straight-ahead kind, an Art Blakey kind of thing." She counts  pianists Red Garland, Bud Powell and Mulgrew Miller as influences.  </P> <P> In search of a recording contract, Coleman plans to record a demo tape of  original music later this year. She may include a few of her own songs this  weekend, teaming with locals Gunnar Biggs on bass and Holly Hofmann on flute.  Incidentally, Hofmann's new album, "Further Adventures," with Mike Wofford, Bob  Magnusson and Sherman Ferguson, is finally in music stores following an August  release. Pianist Wofford wrote the title cut. Bassist Magnusson contributed  "Jillian's Waltz" in honor of his daughter, and other tunes are by Art Pepper,  Thelonious Monk and Djavan.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Saxman Spike Robinson makes his first appearances at Elario's Wednesday  and Thursday nights at 8:30 and 10:30. Robinson is back to health after two  bouts of meningitis last year, which left him with a three-month gap in his  memory and a slight limp. Based in Denver, Robinson lives several months a year  in England. A new album is his second with trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison. San  Diego-based guitarist Mundell Lowe returns from a tour of England on Thursday,  and may show up to jam with Robinson Thursday night. . . .  </P> <P> Basia fans who still have tickets for the singer's canceled July show in San  Diego can exchange them to hear her next Monday night at 8 at the Civic Theatre  downtown. With music that layers her smooth, sexy vocals over Brazilian  rhythms, the singer has captured a wide light jazz and pop audience. Her first  album, the 1988 "Time and Tide," topped Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart for  eight weeks and went platinum (1 million sales). "London Warsaw New York,"  released earlier this year, quickly went gold (500,000) and is close to  platinum, according to a publicist. . . .  </P> <P> Singer Peggy Lee has canceled her Nov. 17 appearance at the Civic Theatre due  to exhaustion. . . .  </P> <P> Inspired by Time magazine's story last month on young players keeping  traditional jazz alive, San Diego drummer Chuck McPherson is into  straight-ahead jazz more than ever with his new Modern Jazz Disciples,  featuring Alan Eicher on piano, Dave Marr on bass and Dale Fielder on sax. The  group plays Friday nights at 8 through November at Barnett's Grand Cafe at the  Embassy Suites Hotel downtown. . . .  </P> <P> Friday night at 8:30 at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, pianist Rick Helzer,  who teaches jazz at San Diego State University, teams up with flutist Holly  Hofmann and bassist Gunnar Biggs. . . .  </P> <P> Next Wednesday night at 8, Fattburger plays the Cannibal Bar at the Catamaran  Resort Hotel in Pacific Beach. . . .  </P> <P> Part 2 of a seven-part radio series on Miles Davis airs on KSDS-FM (88.3) at 11  a.m. Thursday. This episode covers "The Early '50s: Drugs and Early Fame," with  comments from Gerry Mulligan, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Art Farmer and Art  Taylor. The sound quality is excellent, and interviews often include  spontaneous musical demonstrations. Part 3 airs at 8 p.m. Sunday and repeats at  11 a.m. on Thanksgiving.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / BT takes global step with Dollars 4.3bn US deal: MCI agrees to joint venture BRITISH TELECOM and MCI of the US yesterday made a bold bid for leadership of the international telecommunications industry. BT is to take a Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.8bn) stake in MCI, the second largest US carrier, and set up a Dollars 1bn joint venture with it in a development that could reduce significantly the cost of trans- atlantic calls. BT will take 20 per cent of MCI and put up three-quarters of the capital for the joint venture, which is designed to exploit the fast-growing market among multinational companies for international voice and data transmission services. The moves will not delay the sale of the UK government's remaining tranche of BT shares, the prospectus for which will be issued at the end of this month as previously planned. Coming a week after American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US carrier, launched its Worldsource venture to exploit the global market, the new alliance will intensify the battle between AT&amp;T and BT and MCI for international custom. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said the investment and joint venture lay at the centre of the company's strategy 'to become a leading global provider to multinationals'. Under the deal, BT will put up Dollars 830m immediately; the balance will come from cash and borrowings, offset by the Dollars 1.8bn BT expects to receive in this financial year from the sale to AT&amp;T of McCaw, its US cellular telephone subsidiary. BT will gain three directors on the MCI board; the chairman of MCI, Mr Bert Roberts, will join the BT board. BT is paying an average of Dollars 64 a share for its MCI stake, a premium on the Dollars 52 closing price on Tuesday. As part of the deal, MCI is taking over most of BT's North American assets. The joint venture, to be located in either Washington or London, will eventually subsume Syncordia, BT's US-based global outsourcing operation. Apart from attracting business, it will undertake research and development for the two companies, providing a 'global platform' for value added services such as frame relay and outsourcing. Mr Roberts said the alliance was 'indicative of future opportunities' in the telecommunications industry, and would help MCI to continue its growth in the US domestic market while competing on the world market. Both companies stressed the link-up would not affect existing relationships with other international carriers, and made light of potential regulatory hurdles. US regulations limit foreign ownership of a US carrier to 25 per cent. Talks between the two companies, which already have close commercial links, have been progressing for several years. 'BT thought they could conquer the US; MCI thought it could conquer the world,' said Mr Roberts, explaining why an alliance had not materialised earlier. Last night, Moody's, one of the big US debt rating agencies, said it was considering downgrading about Dollars 8.7bn of long debt at British Telecom, in the wake of the MCI deal. However, the agency also said that it would consider raising MCI's debt rating, given the company's 'potential for an improved operating profile and increased financial flexibility'. In New York, BT ADRs closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 65 1/8 , while MCI shares gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 54 3/8 , a 52-week high. AT&amp;T shares were unchanged by the close, at Dollars 62, having fallen initially on the news. In London, the City reacted cautiously to the announcement. The move was thought to make strategic sense for the UK carrier, but institutional investors were concerned about the price paid for the MCI stake and likely returns. BT's shares closed 5p down at 421 1/2p. BT was advised by N M Rothschild and MCI by Goldman Sachs.

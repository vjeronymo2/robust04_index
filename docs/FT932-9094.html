			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Knives out for Lamont again: A lavish dinner laid on for the MP for Kingston AT THE end of one of the most difficult weeks in his political career, the knives were out again for Mr Norman Lamont last night - this time in his Kingston upon Thames constituency. But for once the embattled chancellor appeared not to mind. The reason, after all, was a lavish dinner given by his constituency party to celebrate the 21st anniversary of his election as the local MP. Mr Lamont said that of all the opponents he had faced in general elections, the Monster Raving Loonies had produced the best manifestos. The light-hearted tone of the occasion was enhanced by the pun-laden menu. This also showed a touching faith in the chancellor's ability to hold on to his job, because it showed considerable forward planning. The meal, served to 100 guests, started with Dorneywood Cocktail followed by Chancellor's Soup and ended with Number 11 mints. The piece de resistance was Lamb Rosemary - an allusion to the chancellor's wife. This was accompanied by Treasury Potatoes and that previously elusive vegetable known as 'Green Shoots'. The general mood was convivial and supportive. Lord Boyd-Carpenter, Mr Lamont's predecessor as the local MP, gave a speech acknowledging the chancellor was having a very rough time, but said he was fighting back with great courage and determination. In an earlier remark - sure to spark waves of nostalgia in Conservative Central Office officials - he remembered that the mid-term by-election which sent Mr Lamont to Westminster in May 1972 had been 'vigorously fought'. Those were the days when Conservative governments used sometimes to win mid-term by-elections. Mr Richard Tracey, Tory MP for neighbouring Surbiton and a guest on the top table, said he had always worked very closely with Mr Lamont. He acknowledged local businesses had suffered during the recession but said the feeling now was that things were taking a turn for the better. Mr James Copeman, a constituency vice-chairman, said he thought Mr Lamont had done well in what 'must be the most difficult job in the country' while expressing doubt that he would still be chancellor at the end of the year. 'We have seen more of him in the last 18 months as a constituency MP than we did previously,' he added. Towards the end of the festivities, Mr Lamont was presented with three gifts: a Waterford crystal clock, a painting of Kingston marketplace and an elaborately iced cake. It was, said Mr Jeffrey Reardon, a consultant rheumatologist and chairman of the constituency association, a way of saying thank you for 21 years.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Director is jailed for five years: Pounds 2.1m tax fraud conducted through 'phoenix' companies A COMPANY director was yesterday jailed for five years for his part in a Pounds 2.1m tax fraud through 'phoenix' companies. The sentence is believed to be the most severe custodial penalty yet imposed for contrived liquidations. The 3 1/2 -year investigation spanned more than 16 companies in four linked phoenix operations. The prosecution said the liquidations, involving a number of City and West End employment agencies, were contrived to avoid tax. The case follows calls by the Confederation of British Industry for reform of insolvency legislation to prevent 'reckless' directors from leaving behind a 'trail of debt' while continuing to trade in phoenix companies. It also prompted warnings by Customs and Excise that the use of phoenix companies is increasing. Phoenix companies are businesses which fold only to rise again, often under a slightly different name in the hands of the same directors and management. Debts, usually unpaid tax, are left in the original company, leaving creditors to claim from an empty shell. The new company often buys the stock of the first company at big discounts and continues to trade with its customers who may not know they are dealing with a new company. In addition to the jail sentence, Mr Christopher Tarpey, of Swiss Cottage, north London, was disqualified from being a company director for 12 years. He was ordered to pay the tax authorities Pounds 106,000 in compensation. A Middlesex Crown Court jury had found him guilty on eight counts of cheating the Inland Revenue under common law. Two other men, Mr Kevin Nolan and Mr Paul Cressey, also from the London area, both of whom pleaded guilty, were also jailed for 18 and 15 months respectively. They were both barred from being company directors for five years. One of the agencies, Sandhurst Recruitment Services (SRS), traded as Legal Staff. It was set up in September 1985 and liquidated in October 1989, with Crown debts of Pounds 270,862. A second company, this time registered as Legal Staff, was set up in April 1988, and took over the business of SRS. It also traded as Legal Staff from the same London address. It was liquidated in November 1990 owing Pounds 191,244 in tax. A third company, Dulagood, set up in November 1990, also traded as Legal Staff from the same address but did not accrue a tax debt because the principals were arrested in December of that year. Customs and Excise said the prosecution, which it led with support of the Inland Revenue, is the most recent evidence of an increase in contrived liquidations. It said: 'Phoenixism is on the increase and has been on the increase for a number of years now. The amount of Crown taxes lost by this means of fraud is of great concern to the revenue departments.' The sum ran into millions, Customs added. The CBI said yesterday: 'CBI members report a regular incidence of phoenix companies. Experience has clearly shown that current legislation is not effective and does not appear to be enforced.' The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday published proposals to reform aspects of company insolvency law, but they do not affect contrived liquidations. It said it believed the present law was adequate although all legislation was constantly under review.</p>

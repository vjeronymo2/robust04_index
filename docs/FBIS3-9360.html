Beginning 2 January 1990,  General Nicolae Militaru, [then] minister of national defense,  and Gelu Voican led the takeover of the Securitate structures by  the Ministry of National Defense. They elaborated a draft  decree stipulating the establishment of the National Security  Council [Consiliul Sigurantei Statului], but Ion Iliescu refused  to sign it. Nicolae Militaru ordered the 566 officers working  for the Bucharest Municipality Securitate and the majority of  the officers of the former 4th Directorate for Military  Counterespionage to be transferred to reserve duty. During the  month of January [1990] Gelu Voican obtained the assent of the  Provisional Government and Ion Iliescu to utilize the officers  of the former Bucharest Municipality Securitate to set up a  special directorate of the Ministry of Interior, which was done  in maximum secrecy. They named that directorate UM [Military  Unit] 0215. Its first commander was Admiral Cico Dumitrescu.  However, the person that actually had command over the unit was  Gelu Voican Voiculescu, who was also deputy prime minister. His  first counselor was reserve General Nicolae Voican. One of his  closest aides was Viorel Tache, formerly subordinate to General  Doicaru at UM 0920, later officer of the "Inimical Writings"  [Inscrisuri Dusmanoase] Bureau of the Bucharest Municipality  Securitate, and currently owner of the Georgiana Ltd [company].  Later on the command [of UM 0215] was taken over successively  by counterespionage Colonels Florin Calapod, Cristescu, and  Harosa. An ample report that was broadcast on 11 February  [1990] by Radio Free Europe revealed that during the time when  Mihai Chitac was [interior] minister, the officers and  noncommissioned officers of UM 0215 owned a number of false  identification cards, each using various names, in the same way  the Greek General Grylakis [involved in the Petromin scandal in  Romania] and his men do, all of whom currently are under penal  investigations in Athens. Following the 20 May 1990 general  elections, UM 0215 was involved in every dirty affair: in the  printing and circulating of the so-called Iron Guard fliers in  Bacau and Bucharest, and the fabrication of false documents  intended to discredit Corneliu Coposu, Radu Campeanu, and Marian  Munteanu [opposition personalities]. On 18 February 1990 they  staged the mob's forcing its way into the government  headquarters, later on they acted to discredit the marathon  rally in University Square, and in June 1990 they directed the  moves of the miners in Bucharest. The Radio Free Europe report  also mentions the fact that over that period of time the main  opposition parties and the persons close to the significant  opposition leaders were penetrated by officers of that unit. On  14 June 1990, Colonel Ion Nicolae and First Sergeant Corneliu  Dumitrescu of UM 0215 supervised the stealing of documents and  valuables from the home of [opposition leader] Ion Ratiu.  Following the appointment of Doru Viorel Ursu as [interior]  minister, they ceased to use false identification cards and  manifold identities. The leadership of the unit was replaced by  appointing Colonel Jenica Iosif as its commander and Colonel Ion  Condoiu as deputy commander. That is when the rivalry began  between UM 0215 and the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service]. It  seems that as long as the portfolio of interior was held by Doru  Viorel Ursu and Victor Babiuc, the actions against the political  opposition ceased. About 100 officers of the unit were  transferred to SRI. This was followed by the firing of Colonel  Ion Rusu. The current official structure of the leadership of  UM 0215 is as follows: The Counterespionage Division is headed  by Colonel Gheorghe Stan, former deputy of General Emil Macri;  the Intelligence Division headed by Colonel Ion Condoiu; the  aforementioned division consists of three services: The  Antihooligan Fighting and Protection Service, headed by Colonel  Dumitru Ionel; the Delinquency and Parasitism Service, headed by  Colonel Dumitru Constantin; and the Economic Intelligence  Service, headed by Colonel Ion Mandrila.</p>

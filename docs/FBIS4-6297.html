			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] U.S. monetary authorities are increasingly pursuing  a tight money policy following the economic recovery. Asked to  comment on the U.S. tight money policy at a news conference on  19 April, Finance Minister Hiroshi Fujii said, "I have no  intention of commenting on another nation's monetary policy."  Being affected by the U.S. tight money policy, Japan's bond  prices plummeted and long-term interest rates jumped on 19  April. Influenced by a fall in stock prices in the United  States, the yen has further appreciated against the dollar. At  the news conference, Finance Minister Fujii did not raise any  objection to the "U.S. tight money policy aimed at keeping  inflation in check" but rather expressed his understanding of  the U.S. policy.    The G-7 talks of finance ministers and central bank  governors  [to be held on 24 April in Washington, D.C.] will almost  certainly take up for discussion the issue of high long-term  interest rates worldwide. The Finance Ministry and the Bank of  Japan for now have no intention of claiming at the G-7 summit  talks that the U.S. tight money policy has triggered a worldwide  rise in long-term interest rates and that the policy has  adversely affected the world economy. The Bank of Japan says:  "The United States is raising long-term interest rates to rein  in inflation. If the tight money policy generates the effect of  curbing inflation and if the U.S. economy stays stable for a  long time, long-term interest rates will go down."    The Finance Ministry takes the view that "monetary  authorities can only manipulate short-term interest rates, and  long-term interest rates are determined on the financial market"  (according to the International Financial Bureau). The Finance  Ministry stresses that the high long-term interest rates in the  United States will not become a major item on the agenda of the  G-7 talks.    The Japanese Government has almost firmed up Japan's stand  at  the G-7 talks. At the G-7 talks, Japan will stress two points:  1) The Japanese economy is increasingly showing signs of a  recovery, and Japan has steadily been taking steps to expand  domestic demand; and 2) Japan has been promoting improvement in  its economic structure while mapping out in March a package of  measures to spur its economy. Japan intends to stress the two  points in a bid to avoid being criticized at the G-7 talks for  its huge trade surplus. The Japanese Government takes the view  that it is a good policy for Japan to take the position of  explaining its domestic measures rather than commenting on the  economic policies of the rest of the G-7 industrialized nations.    If Japan clumsily criticizes at the G-7 talks the United  States for pursuing its tight money policy, it would come under  a barrage of criticism from other nations for its trade surplus,  which hit a record high in 1993. In particular, the United  States is still strongly discontented with Japan's failure to  cut taxes more deeply and to take more aggressive steps to  correct the trade imbalance between the two countries.    Japan's "huge sums of trade surplus" have become its weak  point. Japan is different from European nations that are in a  position to express relatively candidly their concerns over the  step taken by the United States to raise long-term interest  rates. Japan will be placed in a difficult position at the G-7  talks.    Japan's long-term interest rates are not necessarily  affected  directly by U.S. long-term interest rates. The recent increase  in Japan's long-term interest rates was triggered by Japan's own  financial factors. Japan's long-term interest rates have been  increasing since January, when the government announced plans to  sell bonds to raise funds to finance public works projects for  economic stimulation.    The high long-term interest rates in the United States have  increased Japanese enterprises' cost of raising funds. Japan's  high long-term interest rates, coupled with the appreciating  yen, will undermine Japan's economy, which is just showing signs  of bottoming out. Private sector banking institutes are voicing  concerns that the high U.S. long-term interest rates will have  an adverse impact on bond prices in Japan and on the yen's  exchange rate against the dollar.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Management: Workers who want to make the grade / A look at an innovative IBM retraining programme Adrianne Goodman, a worker at IBM's printed circuit board plant in Austin, Texas, was less than enthusiastic when it was first suggested she should take some maths lessons. 'I had been here for 10 years and I did not see why I should go back to school,' she says. Goodman was only convinced when the lessons allowed her to take on more responsibility. 'There used to be process technicians everywhere in here. They used to run the place,' she says. These days, workers exert more control over how the plant runs. 'I feel I am a part of it,' she says. Like the other retrained workers, Goodman is now known as a technical associate. IBM's effort at Austin is a rare beacon of hope for the corporation as it tries to raise profitability: the plant's success shows that investment in skills can improve profits. Yet it is still moving away from its tradition of employment security: it expects to cut its worldwide workforce by about 40,000 this year through voluntary reductions. The company has a number of measures for the success of the training initiative. It says that productivity has doubled in the panel plant and at a nearby card assembly plant, where the components are assembled on boards. It also estimates that stockpiles have been reduced by 40 per cent, production has increased and there has been a 5 per cent quality improvement. The re-education effort at Austin was launched in 1985, when the plant's future was in doubt. The plant's quality was low, it was over-staffed - three workers carried out indirect tasks, such as engineering maintenance, for every one direct production worker - and it was estimated to be losing Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.7m) a year. It needed fewer, but more skilled, workers. Because production methods were then unsophisticated, IBM could instead have relocated to a lower-wage economy such as Mexico and employed the same number of workers more cheaply. But Abe Clay, plant manufacturing manager, says its tradition of retaining workers made that option unlikely. IBM instead decided to use the plant as a test-site for a work re-organisation plan known as Manufacturing Technical Associates (MTA). The principle was to combine a cut in the indirect workforce with re-training for the others so they could take on broader tasks. The hope was that the newly-educated workers could both improve quality levels and cut the cycle times. The company devised a new job structure, based on seven grades, cutting out more than 200 former job classifications. Those on the lowest grade spend more than 90 per cent of their time on production work, and the remainder on technical tasks such as materials analysis. As the worker acquires more skills, and higher pay, the proportions gradually alter. Even those in the first grade required mastery of basic statistical process control and systems administration, along with production and technical skills. This required up to 40 hours of skill-based classroom training, as well as basic maths and reading for those who needed to supplement inadequate or ill-remembered high school classes. Clay says any deficiency in basic education was less striking than the untapped potential of the 800-strong direct workforce. 'There were a lot of people who you would have said were incapable of doing this or that until you tested it. It made me think that we have not really tapped the resident skills of a lot of the workforce,' he says. However, the change in work style is not entirely painless. Jerry Schiappa, a Grade 5 worker, says the new structure has clarified what was previously a murky grading system and made explicit what the company expects of workers. 'It tells me my limitations. It is the first time I have known what I need to do to get to the next level,' he says. Although the grade structure provides a single ladder to move to what would formerly have been supervisory work, the degree of specialisation increases at the fourth level. Workers then specialise either in technical manufacturing or quality control, acquiring a series of skill modules. This has allowed IBM to cut materials handlers and engineers. Clay says quality control standards have improved markedly. 'We are identifying Dollars 250,000 of products each year that we would have shipped out before, but we are just not accepting any more,' says Clay. Like Motorola, which has also been praised for training and education efforts linked to quality improvement, the IBM plant is trying to reduce flaws to below one in a million within two years. The quality improvement drive has provided the clearest incentive for IBM to invest in re-education and training, and to that extent, the demand for higher skills is unlikely to abate. IBM has now put about two-thirds of its 30,000 direct workers through the MTA programme, or similar initiatives in other plants. Clay says quality is the clearest benchmark for assessing whether the investment in education was worthwhile - a difficult calculation to make. 'There has been a dramatic shift in the quality curve. Some of that is design and engineering, but a big piece of quality comes from what a person does every day,' he says. The company has tried to stimulate interest in quality improvement through a separate initiative under which any worker can form a team of around 10 people to solve a particular problem. Each gets a bonus for identifying a problem and working on it: the three teams which are judged to have solved most each year receive Dollars 15,000. Yet despite the plaudits won by the effort at Austin, the future of such initiatives is made less certain by IBM's corporate restructuring efforts. Given the strong pressures to reduce costs - IBM is planning to reduce costs and expenses by Dollars 4bn a year, beginning in 1993 - and its efforts to cut staff, training investments will inevitably come under scrutiny. Paul Osterman, professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says companies such as IBM which have pursued 'full employment' policies have had a strong motive to invest in skills. Because they have not been able to hire and fire at will, they have been forced to think carefully about how to use employees. Osterman says the future of investments like the MTA programme is vital if US industry is to move towards an industrial model based on workers allowing job flexibility in return for job security and investments in training. The alternative is that more manufacturing plants may end up moving from Texas towards the pool of cheaper labour south of the Mexican border.

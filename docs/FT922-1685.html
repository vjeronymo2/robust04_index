			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Another abortion battle looms - Dublin THE Irish government may have cleared the referendum hurdle, but it faces a tougher battle to resolve potential conflicts between EC law and Ireland's anti-abortion laws. The anti-abortion lobby, prominent in the No campaign, has promised to do battle again in the autumn, this time on another referendum specifically on abortion. At Ireland's behest, a protocol was inserted into the Maastricht treaty under which the subsidiarity principle would apply to Ireland's right-to-life 1983 constitutional amendment, giving EC courts no jurisdiction over Ireland on this issue. However, a Supreme Court ruling last February, allowing a 14-year-old rape victim to go abroad for an abortion, interpreted the 1983 amendment and the protocol in such a way as to permit abortion in Ireland in cases where the mother's life was threatened. A subsequent memorandum of understanding has been signed by EC foreign ministers, committing them to accommodating within the Maastricht framework any further changes in Ireland's abortion laws.</p>

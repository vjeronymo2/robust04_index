			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA found that the fish mislabeled as red snapper had been shipped from Ecuador and processed in Panama. Had the fish been labeled as mahi, it would not have been permitted entry into the United States because FDA had an automatic detention for mahi from Ecuador at the time because of problems with high levels of histamine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another instance involving species substitution resulting in a negative public health consequence occurred in Hawaii in 1987. Fifty illnesses, 32 of which required medical attention, were attributed to the consumption of limpets misbranded as ``Baby Abalone.'' The symptoms displayed were those of a histamine-type reaction. Because abalone is not one of the species expected to form histamine, substituting limpets for abalone put consumers at risk from a food that they had not intended to eat. Thus, accurate identification of species is essential to public health protection and prompt accurate diagnosis and treatment of illness when that protection fails.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Processing practices traditionally used in the seafood industry also are easily abused to increase a product's weight, in the form of ice or water. For instance, frozen fillets, shrimp, crab legs, and other products are normally protected from dehydration (freezer burn) while frozen by the application of a light glaze of ice. A packer then includes added product in the package to compensate for the weight of the glaze. Excessive amounts of glaze, however, not compensated for in this manner, can deliberately be used to increase the apparent weight, and therefore the apparent value, of the product delivered. Percentage weight increases from overglazing are most dramatic for foods with high surface area to volume ratios, such as shrimp. Overglazing is a practice that violates section 402(b)(4) of the act because a substance has been added to increase a food's weight or to make it appear of greater value than it is.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A similar type of fraud frequently results from oversoaking fish and shellfish meats in dip solutions. Dip solutions are customarily used to retard the natural loss of moisture (drip loss) from products such as scallops, which are particularly susceptible to drip loss. However, exposure to the dip may deliberately be prolonged to add weight in the form of water. Dip solutions may contain chemicals, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, that can greatly enhance the amount of water absorbed by the scallops. The net effect of such practices is to mislead the consumer into purchasing added water at scallop prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seafoods generally represent a high dollar value per unit weight compared with other foods, particularly crab, lobster, shrimp, and certain shellfish. Thus, even relatively modest percentage weight increases from abusive glazing or water uptake from dip solutions represent a substantial loss of value to the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the same reason, the potential fraudulent profit from similar practices of adding less valuable ingredients, such as breading on shrimp and fish sticks or water to shucked oysters, to increase the size or weight of products are enticing to unscrupulous processors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

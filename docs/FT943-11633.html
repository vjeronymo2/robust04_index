			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Construction sector chiefs expect pre-election boost Government attempts to stimulate the economy in the approach to the next general election are likely to lead to a much bigger rise in construction output in 1996 than previously forecast, industry leaders said yesterday. The latest an election could be held is spring 1997. Construction companies believe ministers are determined that by then work will have started on the Pounds 2bn Channel tunnel rail link. Work is also likely to have started on the first generation of roads under which contractors would receive a fee from the government to finance, build and maintain a road for an agreed number of years. The fee would depend on road use. The National Council of Building Material Producers said yesterday that this could lead to a modest increase in road construction in a potential election year. As a result the council, which represents companies with a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, has increased its forecast for construction growth in 1996. It expects output to rise 4 per cent in the year, compared with only 2.5 per cent when it last published forecasts four months ago. The biggest change is a much improved forecast for infrastructure work, which is expected to rise 3 per cent in 1996. Previously the council forecast a 3 per cent fall. Cuts in public spending mean infrastructure output is expected to fall sharply in the next two years - by 7 per cent this year and 5 per cent next year - before increasing in 1996. The council has not changed its forecast that total construction output will rise 2 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent next year, although it expects the recovery in private housing to be slightly slower than previously forecast. It had forecast that builders would start work on 160,000 private-sector homes this year. It has reduced this forecast to 155,000 to take account of a slower rate of recovery in the housing market since Easter.</p>

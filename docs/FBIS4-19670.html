			<p>BFN     [Text] The government is not handling the monitoring of  National Guard work at Larnaca Airport as espionage. The  security authorities, however, are continuing to follow the  moves of members of foreign embassies who are trying to collect  information on Cyprus' defense.    Alternate British High Commissioner Colin Jennings visited  Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Tasos Panayidhis to explain  the presence of British military officers at Larnaca Airport  last Sunday [17 April]. According to information from British  sources, Jennings claimed that the military officers--two of  whom were at the airport with their children--were observing  airplanes landing and taking off. According to the Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Lieutenant Colonel John  Anderson, the British military charge d'affaires, was one of the  military officers. He gave his identification to security men  when they asked him for it and left the airport. The British  claim that Anderson was not at the airport last Sunday, but they  have confirmed that he was on a one-week leave of absence from  the High Commission.    Denying reports by other media, a reliable source explicitly  told CyBC that no Cypriot is involved in the case. Government  spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today told reporters that the  government is not handling the case as espionage.    According to CyBC's information, foreign missions in Cyprus  and Greece have recently embarked on a campaign to collect  information on the implementation of the new defense doctrine.  The same sources said Cypriot security authorities are trying  to limit the efforts of foreign missions to collect information  on the National Guard.</p>

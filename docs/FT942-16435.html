			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Workers set to back Air France rescue A vote by Air France's 40,000 employees is likely to show support for a rescue plan for the loss-making airline when results are announced tonight, according to union officials at the state-owned carrier. But they said it was still uncertain whether the margin of approval or the participation rate would be enough for Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman, to claim the clear show of support he has demanded to proceed with his restructuring plan. Mr Blanc has said he will resign if he fails to receive sufficient support for his package, which he claims is vital for the survival of Air France. His measures, which include 5,000 job cuts and a wage freeze, are designed to curb losses estimated at FFr7.5bn (Pounds 870m) last year. A capital injection of FFr20bn from the French government over the next three years is dependent on staff acceptance of the plan. Opposition from airline workers, and a wave of violent strikes, prompted the collapse of a previous rescue package in October last year. Mr Blanc decided to hold a referendum after he failed to win the backing of all 14 of the airline's unions for his rescue package. His chances of success in the vote have been boosted by the support of Force Ouvriere, the largest union at the airline, and one of the six unions which signed the restructuring plan. Mr Blanc has not specified the level of support he requires for the plan, but is thought to be seeking more than 60 per cent approval.</p>

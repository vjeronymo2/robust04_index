			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S CORNER  </P> <P> Why is this Dan standing?  </P> <P> Because he wants to.  </P> <P> "I feel comfortable with it," says Dan Rather of his new posture.  </P> <P> After eight years of anchoring from the seat of his pants, Dan Rather has  decided to stand up while he delivers "The CBS Evening News." He thinks the  three network newscasts look too much alike, and he likes being on his feet.  </P> <P> Rather, managing editor as well as anchor of the top-rated newscast, taped a  few sample stand-up editions last summer and liked the feeling. Word got out  and Rather was deluged with phone calls from people asking if and when this new  era would begin.  </P> <P> On Sept. 19, from his office in New York, Rather said that if he did start  standing up, it would be later in the season. "We may or may not do it," he  said then. "When and if we get to the point that we think it will accomplish  the things we want it to accomplish, then we might actually do it."  </P> <P> The next night, he did it. What happened? Hurricane Hugo blew Dan Rather out of  his chair. With the approach of the hurricane, and the need to use maps to  chart its path, Rather decided it was a good time to start standing.  </P> <P> And he's standing still.  </P> <P> "So far we've had not much feedback at all," Rather said a few days later from  his office in New York. "What I hear most is 'We didn't know you were  standing.' "  </P> <P> Rather said there were three main reasons why he likes the new stance. "No. 1,  we can handle graphics in a different way and with a different look. I have a  gut full of the floating window." By "floating window," he means that little  superimposed news rectangle over his and every anchor's shoulder.  </P> <P> Second, Rather said, he felt it was "awkward" when a guest expert or a  correspondent joined him in the studio to talk about a story. He thinks this  works more easily if they both stand up. And the third reason, he said, was his  own comfort; he doesn't like being bolted down by a chair.  </P> <P> Rather wanted to stand up when he took over "The CBS Evening News" from Walter  Cronkite on March 9, 1981. But Sanford Socolow, then executive producer of the  broadcast, opposed it. "Sandy was under tremendous pressure not to change  anything," Rather says.  </P> <P> There was tremendous fear within CBS that the public would go into shock and  withdrawal when Cronkite left and that nothing should be done to remind them of  the fact that he was gone.  </P> <P> Instead of standing for his first newscast in 1981, Rather did it leaning  against the desk. Some people referred to it as "squatting." This was deemed a  flop, so Dan sat down. Ratings dipped for awhile, until another cosmetic touch:  Rather started wearing sleeveless sweaters under his coat, and the ratings went  back up. Not to mention sales of sleeveless sweaters.  </P> <P> Will his standing for the news affect his standing in the ratings? Neither  Rather nor his colleagues seem to think it will.  </P> <P> "We don't want to change the overall look of the broadcast dramatically or  radically," Rather says. "But if you don't keep trying new things, you run the  risk of the broadcast becoming stagnant."  </P> <P> Dan Rather has been our most closely watched anchor ever since he started. He's  the newsman presidential candidates are most likely to pick on and he's been  the anchor most often in the news himself.  </P> <P> Most recently, allegations surfaced that "The CBS Evening News" aired phony  footage of fighting in Afghanistan between rebels and Soviets during the  mid-'80s. CBS sources said the footage was shot by a freelance photographer and  were looking into the charges. Rather himself went to Afghanistan twice to  report on the Soviet invasion.  </P> <P> The report followed by several weeks revelations that ABC News aired fake  footage that purportedly showed accused spy Felix Bloch accepting a portfolio  from another agent.  </P> <P> During the summer, while Rather was doing in-house tests of his stand-up  newscast, he tried out a new sign-off on the air. An earlier attempt,  "Courage," had bombed. But the new one seems to have survived the test of time,  in this case a few weeks.  </P> <P> Rather now sometimes ends the newscast saying, "And that's part of our world."  But not always. Sometimes he just says, "And that's tonight's 'CBS Evening  News.' " The sign-off may fluctuate, but it looks like the new anchor position  is permanent. Or as permanent as anything gets in television.  </P> <P> No one, in other words, should call it Rather's Last Stand.  </P></p>

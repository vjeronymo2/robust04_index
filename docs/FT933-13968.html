			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Personal View: A big dimension to the small screen Forecasting the success of new media has not been a conspicuous success. Kenneth Baker is still remembered as the technology minister who, in 1982, predicted that multi-channel cable television would be in every British home by the end of the 1980s. Even when cable failed to materialise, the optimists were undaunted: the launch of direct-to-home satellite (DTH) television in 1989 saw forecasts of 8m dish households by the middle of the 1990s. The year of take-off was to be 1993. Instead, the first few months have been among the worst for dish sales since satellite TV started. With satellite's share of viewing hovering at about 5-6 per cent of the total, it now seems that satellite channels are unlikely to challenge the mainstream terrestrial broadcasters, and will remain at the margins of most people's viewing behaviour. This is not so much a verdict on the nature of these channels as a statement about the need for more television. Increasing the number of channels has made very little difference to the amount people watch, and the principle of paying for television beyond a licence fee is still an alien concept to a country brought up on 'free' consumption. As the disappointing take-up for Premier League soccer on Sky Sports has shown, most households will not pay even for programmes they watched when there was no subscription fee. Given Kenneth Baker's embarrassing pronouncements 10 years ago, it might therefore seem foolish to start predicting a big expansion for cable. But cable is different because it offers enormous potential beyond the simple addition of more TV channels. Even now fibre-optic technology allows cable subscribers to shop or bank from home, to choose coverage of a soccer match from four different channels or to participate in quiz shows. The interactive capacity of cable offers a dimension to the small screen more in tune with the new generation of domestic technology than old-fashioned notions of passive TV viewing. Cable has two further advantages which a survey commissioned by the Henley Centre suggests will be vital selling points. First is the opportunity to offer cheaper telephony than the existing BT or Mercury tariffs. When non-cable or satellite subscribers were asked whether they would subscribe to cable if it offered cheaper telephone bills, 24 per cent said they would be very or fairly likely to. This contrasts with the 9 per cent who said they were very or fairly likely to get satellite television in the next year. Cable's second advantage - potentially the most powerful, and so far the least exploited - is the facility for making local TV programmes, aimed at communities of much smaller size than ITV regions. For largely historical reasons local television has never featured in Britain, but when this option was put to non-cable or satellite subscribers in the survey 31 per cent said they would be likely to subscribe to cable if it offered local programmes. The attraction of cable presupposes the ability and willingness of cable companies to exploit fibre-optic technology in a way that will maximise consumer interest. Some have already started to switch their emphasis from television to telephony and are reaping the benefits. It means investing money in local entertainment, information and current affairs programmes. It also means persuading other organisations, businesses and agencies to participate in the electronic revolution. Home shopping is only possible if the local branch of Sainsbury or Marks and Spencer is prepared to offer and respond to screen-based shopping lists. Local information benefits are only realisable if local authorities use the opportunity to convey the kinds of information which local citizens require. Assuming cable companies can harness these advantages, it seems that a genuine demand exists for something different from and more sophisticated than traditional TV. Satellite's technological limitations will, within five years, make the dish an anachronism, and our own forecasts suggest that by the end of 1998 cable penetration will have overtaken satellite. It is a new dimension to the TV screen which will transform the living room in much the same way that computers and IT have transformed the office.

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTORY FOR LIBRARY AND CITIZENS, TOO  </P> <P> The Friends of the Library of Monterey Park are justifiably elated with the  Appellate Court's decision to reinstate the Board of Library Trustees which was  abolished by the Monterey Park City Council.  </P> <P> This is not only a victory for the Friends and the people of Monterey Park with  its tradition dating back to 1929 of a management board, but a  precedent-setting case as well. There has never before been a California court  ruling that libraries should be overseen by an independent board and that city  officials cannot legally disband the board. This decision affects libraries  throughout the state of California and is also of nationwide interest.  </P> <P> While (the council majority) considered the funding requirements of the Library  Municipal Act archaic, the facts are that the council exercises final budget  approval and it even has the much coveted line-item veto. How much more control  does the council need? So all we can conclude is that the members wanted  absolute control. But such control . . . politicizes the library to the  detriment of the community. Even George Washington feared the absolute control  of kings!  </P> <P> The Friends are committed to preserving the library as a center to supplement  the formal system of free public education and as a source of information and  inspiration to persons of all ages, cultural backgrounds and economic status.  </P> <P> TISA LEVINE  </P> <P> President, Friends of the Library  </P> <P> of Monterey Park  </P></p>

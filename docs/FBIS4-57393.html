			<p>BFN     [Text] The tension in strifetorn Haiti appears to be  mounting as the opposing factions seem set on a collision  course. As we hear in this dispatch from (Valery Albert),  President Clinton's threat of invasion was met with outright  defiance by the military led by Raoul Cedras. Now has come a new  move on the part of the legitimate leader, Prime Minister Robert  Malval.    [Begin (Albert) recording] Acting Haitian Prime Minister  Robert Malval, breaking a six-month silence with a bold act of  defiance, on Monday called on Army chief General Raoul Cedras to  resign immediately. Shaking with anger, Malval accused Cedras of  disgracing his uniform and locking the country in the darkness  of night by defying international sanctions, and demanding the  return of democracy and of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,  ousted in the 1991 coup.    Malval also called on Haiti's civil servants to disobey  orders from the provisional regime installed by the Army last  week. Malval has been Haiti's acting prime minister since  resigning his post in December after the breakdown of the UN  accord restoring Aristide to power. [end recording]</p>

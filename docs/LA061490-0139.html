			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY;  </P> <P> DOCK DEFICIENCIES DOWN  </P> <P> Despite recent complaints from several boat owners about shoddy maintenance of  Marina del Rey docks, a survey has found deficiencies in the condition of only  206 boat slips -- fewer than the previous inspection.  </P> <P> The survey found that the number of deficient slips was down 36% from a check  last year, which identified maintenance problems with 326 slips.  </P> <P> There are more than 6,000 slips in the marina, the world's largest man-made  small-craft harbor.  </P> <P> The latest examination found maintenance problems at 19 locations in the  marina, down slightly from 23 locations in the earlier survey.  </P> <P> A handful of boat owners have told the county's Small Craft Harbor Commission  in recent months that some docks are not being maintained properly and that  boat owners who complain have been harassed in some cases.  </P></p>

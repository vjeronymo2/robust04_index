This species occurs in vernal pools and is threatened by a variety of factors including: Habitat destruction and fragmentation from agricultural and urban development, alterations of wetland hydrology by draining, off-road vehicle activity, and cattle and sheep grazing. This proposed rule, if made final, would extend the Act's protection to the San Diego fairy shrimp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments from all interested parties must be received by October 3, 1994.

The species was first described by Michael Fugate (1993) based on collections made at Del Mar Mesa in San Diego County in 1990 by himself and M. Simovich. The San Diego fairy shrimp is closely allied with, and has historically been misidentified as,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. lindahli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a species widely distributed in western North America. The San Diego fairy shrimp was first collected (but then identified as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. lindahli <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in Poway and Ramona, San Diego County, in 1962; additional collections were made on Kearny Mesa in 1979 (Simovich and Fugate 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Diego fairy shrimp is restricted to vernal pools, which occur in areas with shallow depressions that have a clay hardpan soil layer that inhibits water percolation. This results in a perched water table during the winter rainy season and the following spring. Vernal pools retain water only long enough to support relatively few species of aquatic emergent plants and invertebrates. As the pools dry and the surface water recedes toward the center of the pool, a unique and dynamic flora develops in its place. Vernal pools typically occur on mesa tops or valley floors and are surrounded by very low hills, usually referred to as mima mounds (Zedler 1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Diego fairy shrimp is a small and delicate animal with large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs of swimming legs. Mature males are from 9 to 16 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in length and females are 8 to 14 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) in length. They swim or glide upside down by means of complex beating movements of the legs that pass in a wave-like anterior to posterior direction. The second pair of antennae on the adult female are cylindrical and elongate, but in the male are greatly enlarged and specialized for clasping the female during copulation. The female carries the eggs in an oval or elongate ventral brood sac. The eggs are either released or remain attached to the female until she dies and sinks. The thick-shelled eggs are capable of withstanding high heat, cold, and prolonged desiccation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

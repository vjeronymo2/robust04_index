Kim Pyong-il  was appointed ambassador already in the middle of last year and  should have arrived in Helsinki by early March, but according to  the Protocol Section of the Finnish Foreign Ministry, the new  ambassador has not yet come. In a statement from the North  Korean Embassy, the envoy will be in charge of conducting  affairs. The previous ambassador left Helsinki in December. He  was expected to handle affairs for only six months. Illness was  given as the reason for his early departure. Kim Pyong-il has  previously served as ambassador in Sofia. Kim Pyong-il is not as  visible as his older brother Kim Chong-il, who is expected to  succeed his father as North Korea's leader.</p>

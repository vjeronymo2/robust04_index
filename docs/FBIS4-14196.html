			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lebanese Islamic and nationalist parties and  forces have held an expanded meeting at Hizballah's Political  Bureau premises to discuss developments in the Lebanese arena.  The delegates discussed the political situation and public  liberties resulting from the government's policy, which is aimed  at repressing the honest voices and forces confronting the  Zionist enemy and the U.S. schemes in the region.    Hizballah was represented at the meeting by the Political  Bureau head al-Hajj Husayn al-Khalil, bureau member Abu-Sa'id  al-Khansa, and deputies Muhammad Ra'd, Muhammad Funaysh, and  Muhammad Yaghi.    The other parties were represented by Zahi al-Khatib for the  Workers' League; Usamah Sa'd and Khalil al-Khalil for the  Nasirite Popular Organization; Tawfiq Muhanna for the Syrian  Social Nationalist Party--Higher Council; 'Ali al-Shaykh 'Ammar  for the Islamic Group; Sa'dallah Mazra'ani for the Lebanese  Communist Party; Mukhtar Haydar for the Communist Action  Organization; Hamad Haydar for the Popular Committees and  Associations Grouping; Munir al- Sayyad for the Nasirite  Organization; Husayn Hamdan for the Arab Socialist Action Party;  and Hasan Shalhah for the Union Party.    After the meeting, the delegates issued the following  statement:    Out of their concern for political freedom; in defense of  the  Resistance's nationalist media and the freedom of expression  through appropriate methods; in rejection of the government's  repressive policy toward public liberties--a policy demonstrated  in the suspension of some papers and television stations;  bearing in mind the perpetration of the 13 September massacre  against citizens who reject the Gaza-Jericho plan; recalling the  ban on broadcasting all audiovisual newscasts and political  programs; and out of their concern for the principle of freedom  in Lebanon, the Lebanese Islamic and nationalist forces and  parties held an expanded meeting, following which they issued  this statement:    First, the Islamic and nationalist forces and parties  strongly believe that the government's recent decision is a  clear threat against political life in Lebanon. The  government's decision circumvents the nationalist media, which  support the peace, unity, and coexistence march, and the  honorable Resistance, which seeks to liberate the usurped  territories. This decision also paves the way for the Western  media to infuse their sectarian and seditious poison and to  propagate the imperialist policy against the Arab and Islamic  nation and its central issues.    Second, as part of a destructive and grave social,  economic, and political crisis created by exhausting the citizen  with taxes and strangling the country with debts, the government  decided to silence nationalist media to prevent them from  exposing this policy, which seeks to hold the country's future  to ransom.    Third, the delegates believe that the government's decision  is meant to reward the radios that spread sedition. Instead of  closing the radios that violated the covenant of honor, the  government equated them with the national media. This reveals  the government's deceptive policy, lack of concern for the  country's interests, and failure to curb the sedition that  almost destroyed peace, stability, and national unity.    Fourth, The responsibility for the chaos that overwhelmed  the  media in the past should be shouldered by the government, which  deliberately failed to issue a clear media law that would  consolidate national unity and step up resistance of the Zionist  enemy occupying our land.    Fifth, the delegates urge the honorable Chamber of Deputies  to shoulder its historic responsibility under the current  delicate circumstances to safeguard the freedom of expression  stipulated in the National Accord. The delegates call on the  Chamber, in its capacity as the legislative authority that must  reflect the people's will and interests, to play its role in  confronting the government's policy, which is strangling  liberties.    Sixth, the media, whether audio, visual, or written, have  one  mission. So we urge the free Lebanese press to unify ranks in  defense of information and political liberties in Lebanon and to  undermine the government's acts of discrimination and division.    After the meeting, the delegates decided to form committees  that will be entrusted with contacting press, trade union,  parliamentary, and political functionaries to follow up on the  move rejecting the government's unfair course.</p>

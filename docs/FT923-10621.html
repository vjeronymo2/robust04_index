			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chrysler shares rise as profits return SHARES in Chrysler, the US car manufacturer, rose sharply yesterday morning when the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results and a return to profitability. General Motors and Ford also saw their stock rise as Chrysler, the smallest of the three and the first to announce second-quarter figures, made optimistic noises about the industry's outlook. The US sector has spent much of the past two years covered in red ink, due to the recession which slashed demand for cars at a time when growing Japanese manufacturing in the US greatly increased supplies of vehicles. The result was a price war. However, 1992 has produced a slow recovery in demand. Chrysler reported net earnings of Dollars 178m, or 54 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 212m, or 95 cents, in the same period of last year. Wall Street expectations had been pitched at around 21 cents a share. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 9.31bn, up 19.2 per cent from the Dollars 7.81bn of last year. Chrysler shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 21 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most actively traded issue. The company, which has been financially stretched for the past few years, is in the middle of a series of crucial launches of new models. The most important is the LH series of mid-sized saloons, due to be rolled out during the autumn, which has won enthusiastic reviews from the motoring press. Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman, attributed the good second-quarter figures to particularly strong sales of mini-vans, where Chrysler is the market leader, as well as trucks and jeeps. These are all relatively high margin products. There was also a better ratio between retail sales and purchases by fleet customers, where margins are generally extremely thin. Mr Iacocca said the economy seemed to be improving and the car market was getting stronger, despite mixed economic indicators. The chairman, celebrated for his salesman's patter, said: 'I couldn't be more pleased with the direction the company is taking.' For the six months the group reported net earnings of Dollars 165m, or 46 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 17.5bn, compared with losses of Dollars 810m, or Dollars 3.61 a share, on sales of Dollars 13.66bn in 1991.</p>

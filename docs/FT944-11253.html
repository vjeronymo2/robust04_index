			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilts market will start the week with just a trace of nerves, in case the chancellor and the governor did, after all, agree to increase base rates at their monthly monetary meeting last week. If, as most believe, they decided to leave rates unchanged, there should be scope for a rally in the short end of the market this week. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, thinks the longer end of the market will struggle to make progress unless German bunds perform well. Ten-year gilts yield 120 basis points more than 10-year bunds, at the lower end of the recent spread range. However, Mr Shepherdson points out that gilts have been remarkably resilient in the face of weakness in the US market, suggesting Europe, not the US, is now the dominant influence on the UK bond market. Mr Simon Briscoe, bond analyst at SG Warburg Securities, thinks the ultra-long end of the market may be set to weaken. At the moment, there is an inverted yield curve at the long end, with long gilt yields being driven down by the absence of supply. If, as Mr Briscoe suspects, the chancellor announces a partial gilt repo facility in the Budget on November 29, that will make it easier for investors to switch from ultra-longs into medium-term gilts, where yields are higher.</p>

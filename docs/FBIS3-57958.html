[On 26th May 1993 two Turkish women and three children died when  their house was set on fire.] They would be tried for five  counts of murder and 14 counts of attempted murder. The young  men are suspected of having set fire to a house occupied by  Turks accepting that the inhabitants might die as a consequence.    According to WAZ, the Federal Prosecutor's Office will hold  the trial at Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court. Recently there  had been doubts about whether the four detained suspects were  guilty. However, following further checks, the Federal Court of  Justice had upheld the detention order.    A spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office would not  confirm or deny the information. "No comment" was the reply to  an enquiry in Karlsruhe. Generally officials would comment only  after the suspects had been informed of the charges.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Letter: Political stance seen as 'breaking rule' and a disservice - but supported by example (4) Sir, Your Leader today is challenging and well-argued; the cases you make for and against both leading parties not unconvincing. However, it is for the very reasons you expostulate so cogently that your conclusion is so utterly flawed and your recommendation bad. In the most unlikely event that the result you recommend should be achieved which, at the time of writing (during the morning of election day) I am convinced it will not, I believe that you will have done an enormous disservice to what I see as your 'natural' constituency, the vast majority of whom, I am sure, would be very considerably disadvantaged - as, much more importantly, would be the nation as a whole. A return to a Socialist government full of its traditional doctrinaire principles, however well disguised, would undo so many of the great achievements of the past 13 years. John Fingleton, 19 York House, Upper Montagu Street, London W1H 1FR</p>

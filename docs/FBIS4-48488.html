			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] N'Dalatando is facing a critical situation. The  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] is bent on  decimating the residents of N'Dalatando, using its air force and  long-range artillery pieces.    About 28 air raids were carried out on 18 May. The MPLA used  TC- 7's, MiG-23's, and Su's. More than 70 bombs with substances  banned internationally were being dropped on the city and  outlaying areas daily. [passage omitted]    A terrible MPLA military offensive is under way in Cuanza  Sul. The four-pronged offensive was launched from Waku-Kungo and  Gabela and is designed to capture the District of Ebo. The  offensive, which began on 16 May 1994, has been characterized by  massive air force attacks and artillery shelling. Violent  clashes have been taking place with the UNITA [National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola] armed forces defending the  people from the MPLA adventure. People's Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] units have been left to their own  devices. A number of FAPLA members have surrendered to UNITA.  Cadet Officer Daniel Caieba, a native of (Cassongue),  surrendered to UNITA on 17 May. [passage omitted]    The communist regime of Jose Eduardo dos Santos is bent on  resuming war in the city of Bie. Lethal equipment for MPLA  troops was unloaded in Bie at approximately 0625 on 18 May.  Flying from Luanda, a IL-776 military aircraft dropped eight  parachutes, but all of them fell in the sector of the city  controlled by UNITA. Five parachutes had grenades, large  quantities of AK-47's, AGS 17 ammunition belts, and AK-47  ammunition boxes. The other three parachutes had Racal-30  communications radios. [passage omitted]</p>

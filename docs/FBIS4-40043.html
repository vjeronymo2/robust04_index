			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Minsk BTK Television Network in  Belarusian at 1700 GMT on 9 June carries a 40-minute program in  the "Rostrum of the Candidate for the Presidency of the Republic  of Belarus" series, which is devoted to presenting the platform  of Vasil Novikaw, the Belarusian Communist Party's candidate for  president. The program is moderated by Ala Ustsina, and a chief  legal adviser and a member of the Central Electoral Commission  are also in attendance. The program consists of a live segment  with Novikaw, and a recorded video portraying Novikaw as family  and public man. Questions, both live and recorded, are posed to  Novikaw by unidentified journalists. Novikaw speaks in Russian  throughout the program.    Touching upon political issues, Novikaw states that all the  misfortunes of the people began with the "Moscow events of 1991"  and the agreement in the Belavezha forest, where the "great  three ruined the great country -- the Soviet Union." The  Communist Party of Belarus, which put forward his candidacy,  speaks for the "building of authentic socialism -- a society of  social justice," Novikaw says. He voices assurances that "the  mistakes of the past will not be repeated by Communists in the  future."    Asked about differences between the Communists and other  political forces in Belarus, Novikaw says that these differences  can be seen as "ways and methods for obtaining a common goal --  the welfare of Belarus." Novikaw assures that the Communists do  not want to "expropriate" private property after coming into  power "again," but they will give priority to the state form of  ownership in those branches of the national economy, which are  "vitally important" to the maintenance of society as a whole.  He adds that in other areas of economic activity -- for  example, in trade and services -- private forms of property and  business will be admissible.    Discussing the problem of responsibility for the current  economic situation in Belarus, Novikaw states that, beginning  1991, the power in Belarus was in the hands of "non-Communists,"  who dominated both the government and the Supreme Soviet.  According to Novikaw, Communists -- that is, members of the  current Communist Party of Belarus -- comprise only 20 percent  of the current Supreme Soviet. The government and the Supreme  Soviet, he affirms, are dominated by members of the "party of  power." He argues that the Communists are capable of managing  the economy efficiently. Novikaw cites China as an example to  support this claim.    Asked about possibly abandoning his candidacy in favor of  Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich, Novikaw answers in the  negative and adds that he has been obliged by his party to "go  to the end" of his presidential campaign.    At the end of the program, Novikaw promises that in a few  days he will publish his propositions, with regard to reforms in  the Armed Forces, in local newspapers.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Arts: Popular revivals in London - Opera When money is short, it is a prudent opera company that strives to get maximum mileage out of productions which it knows work well. Two revivals of trusted stagings, one at each of the London opera-houses, returned at the weekend and it is good to report that neither gives the impression merely of a tired warhorse being trotted out for another run. The Royal Opera's Il barbiere di Siviglia has arguably improved on each occasion that it has been seen and this revival brings together some of the best individual performances encountered so far: a cast confident of its star appeal, balancing brash, youthful vigour with wily experience. The main newcomer is Thomas Hampson in the title-role. This is his debut with the Royal Opera, not before time, and an occasion which he enjoys to the full, singing out proudly with his easy, impressive, ample baritone and generally making sure that his role is the focus of attention. He bestrides the stage with an overpowering all-American confidence, which is not necessarily right for Rossini's lowly barber who lives by his wits alone, but the flair is irresistible. Alongside him are two American colleagues happily remembered from previous revivals, Jennifer Larmore as an attractive, vocally sure Rosina and Bruce Ford, a sensitive Count Almaviva with not quite enough personality. Simone Alaimo creeps on as a spooky Don Basilio, the sepulchral presence cleverly underplayed, the voice a real Italian Rossini bass. Not to be outdone, Gabriel Bacquier's Doctor Bartolo proved a master at deploying the killing comic touch at the most lethal moment and is still a singer of some force, even though he will be 70 next year. Can the reference books really be right? All were kept firmly together by Evelino Pido, who trussed up the score rather fearsomely, allowing few musical freedoms but kept the pace bright and swift. He also encouraged his singers to bring along a selection of their own vocal ornaments, which is all to the good. No lack of sparkle there, or in any other department. The conducting of Mark Elder was the feature that gave the strongest profile to English National Opera's revival of Rigoletto on Thursday. Even when the production was new (how long ago that seems now]) he did not bring it the urgency, the powerful feeling of the music driving the drama forwards, that made this performance so convincing. Among the principals, the only newcomer here was Rosa Mannion, bravely singing Gilda over, and at times audibly through, a heavy cold. Even in these circumstances, however, the beauty of her singing shone forth and she made the character tellingly progress, from the lightly floating virginal purity of the early scenes to the tragic victim she becomes after the abduction. Arthur Davies remains a dashing, youthful Duke, singing with winning freedom, except when he is ambushed by vocal doubts in his Act 2 aria. Jonathan Summers is again the powerful, unsubtle Rigoletto, but one who commands the stage. According to the advertisements in the press, this now renowned mafioso Rigoletto, like so many prima donnas who announce their retirement only to re-appear, is again on the point of disappearing for good. If there really is anybody who has not yet seen it, this is the last chance - and probably as good a one as any. Il Barbiere di Siviglia at Covent Garden until March 5 (Box Office 071-240 1066). Rigoletto at the London Coliseum until March 12 sponsored by National Power (Box Office 071-836-3161)</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Petro-Canada acts to halt losses PETRO-CANADA, the partly privatised Canadian oil company, plans to stem losses in its downstream business by selling or closing one-third of its service stations and withdrawing almost a third of its refining capacity. The restructuring will be provided for in a CDollars 369m (USDollars 318.1m) after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 1991. Mr Wilbert Hopper, chairman of the Calgary-based company, said yesterday: 'We are not counting on a major recovery in demand for refined petroleum products and we expect continued intense competition for market share.' Petro-Canada's main competitors are Imperial Oil, a subsidiary of Exxon, and Shell Canada, controlled by Royal Dutch Shell. The domestic industry's sales of refined petroleum products slipped by 7 per cent last year, following a 2.7 per cent fall in 1990. Over the next 6-18 months, Petro-Canada will cut 80,000 barrels a day in refining capacity, mainly at plants in British Columbia and Ontario. It is also seeking a joint-venture partner or buyer for a refinery in Montreal. The company also plans to close or sell one-third of its 3,200 retail and 340 wholesale outlets. It has already sold a number of exploration properties and reduced capital spending in line with a 50 per cent shortfall in expected cash flows last year. The refining and marketing business lost CDollars 106m in the first nine months of last year. The company said the division will post a small operating loss, before the special charge, in the fourth quarter. Petro-Canada was created as Canada's national energy company during the mid-1970s energy crisis to give Ottawa a window on the oil industry. It grew mainly by buying assets from foreign-controlled oil companies, including BP and Belgium's Petrofina.</p>

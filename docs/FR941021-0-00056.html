			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Information Submitted With the Archaeological Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that a new &sect;250.26(c) be added to require that the reports submitted to the Regional Director include all the data, artifacts, records, and remains obtained during the investigations conducted pursuant to 256.26 (a) and (b), pertaining to reporting requirements for the protection of possible or discovered archaeological resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The marine remote sensing survey data collected to evaluate archaeological resources is maintained by the lessee or right-of-way holder; however, the data must be made available to MMS upon request. The MMS maintains copies of the archaeological reports prepared from the remote sensing survey data. Because the archaeological surveys conducted prior to OCS activities are reconnaissance surveys, evidence of potential resources is used to avoid lessee activity that could harm or disturb artifacts or remains. Thus, artifacts or remains are rarely recovered or disturbed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Archaeological Surveys and Grandfathered Leases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that MMS should continue its practice of requiring no archaeological surveys for grandfathered leases. (The commenter's view is that a grandfathered lease is any lease issued by MMS prior to December 1973, the date the first lease with an archaeological resource stipulation was issued). The commenter also indicated that existing survey data on older leases should continue to be acceptable to MMS for exploration and most development activities for as long as the lease remains in force. The commenter believes that although the aforementioned practices are not specifically addressed or confirmed in the proposed regulations, it is implicit in the provisions thereof that MMS does not intend for the proposed changes to the regulations to change these existing procedures. It is the commenter's position that to do otherwise would directly impair existing lease contract rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MMS does not agree that any lease issued prior to the inclusion of an archaeological resource lease stipulation in December 1973 is grandfathered and exempt from the requirement to protect and preserve resources under either the existing or proposed regulations. The archaeological stipulations included in OCS leases in December 1973 were designed to ensure that lessees and other interested parties were aware of the need to protect and preserve archaeological resources. The absence of an archaeological stipulation in an OCS lease issued prior to December 1973 does not free the lessee of its obligation to protect and preserve resources. In accordance to &sect;250.33(b)(15) or &sect;250.34(b)(8)(v)(A), if the Regional Director notifies the lessee that an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, prior to commencing any operations, the lessee is required to prepare a report as specified by the Regional Director to determine the potential existence of any archaeological resource that may be affected by operations. Thus, the regulations are applicable to any new exploration or development operations except preliminary activities (250.31). If there are no new activities, production operations will continue with no changes in the status quo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Chance Find Clause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that treatment of unanticipated discoveries of archaeological resources during operations be made consistent with DOI procedures by requiring a halt to operations until the Regional Director has told the lessee how to protect the resource. Other commenters suggested that this clause, commonly called the ``chance finds clause,'' be changed to reflect the fact that not all discoveries made during operations will require protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

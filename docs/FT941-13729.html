			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: London The main event of the week is likely to be the first auction of the year - Wednesday's offer of Treasury 6 1/4 per cent 2010 stock. The size of the issue - Pounds 2.75bn compared with a recent range of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.75bn - and the fact that the second part payment is not due until March 'suggests this year's funding programme is virtually complete', according to Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe). Mr Peter Fellner, gilts strategist at NatWest Markets, argues that the smaller size of the auction indicates the Bank of England may prefer to continue with regular monthly auctions rather than have larger, less regular offers. Last week's retail prices figures, which showed inflation slightly below expectations, create a favourable background for the issue. Long gilt yields fell by around 25 basis points on the week. There is little economic news to influence the market this week, with only today's CBI Industrial Trends survey and Friday's non-European Union trade data. The next major event will be the Bank of England's inflation report on February 8. In the interim, gilts may well be caught in the crossfire between US Treasuries (where the next interest rate move is still expected to be up) and German government bonds (where the next interest rate move is expected to be down).</p>

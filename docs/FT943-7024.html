			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Out of the laboratory into the boardroom - Alan Cane on a company which is making a profit from the manufacture of DNA Making the complex biochemical that carries the genetic code is a profitable if prosaic business these days. Oswel, a commercial company based at, but separate from, Edinburgh University, has the process of manufacturing strands of DNA, the material of heredity, down to a fine art. Customers are typically forensic science departments, teaching hospitals or biological laboratories. Orders are keyed into the company's computer network and, at the press of a button, one of Oswel's seven DNA synthesisers springs into life, conjuring up exactly what the customer ordered. The invisible strands of DNA in phials of water are packed in padded envelopes and sent out by ordinary mail. What are the strands of genetic material used for? Biologists use them for experiments on the mechanism of inheritance; forensic scientists use them to identify tissues found at the scene of crimes. A method called the polymerase chain reaction uses Oswel's strands to turn tiny amounts of DNA into quantities large enough to analyse with ease. The synthesis machines, costing Pounds 40,000 a time, run all day and sometimes through the night. Professor Tom Brown, co-owner of Oswel with his wife Dorcas, emphasises the chemical rather than biological nature of the synthetic process. Oswel is, he says, a supplier of high quality, specialist chemicals, which happen to be fragments of the stuff of life. Oswel (Oligonucleotide Service, Wellcome Trust), was established in 1986 with a Pounds 96,000 grant from the Wellcome Trust and Pounds 2,000 from the university. Prof Brown, with a broad background in the chemistry of the genetic code, was appointed director; he now holds a personal chair in chemistry at Edinburgh. The aim was to offer a service to the university's world-renowned biological sciences departments, providing oligonucleotides - gene fragments. Word of the quality of Oswel's products got around, however, and soon the unit was receiving orders from outside. It was also intended to be self-financing. It advertises its services in scientific journals such as Nature and by direct mail and, since Prof Brown knows who is doing what in gene research, he is able to approach potential customers directly. By 1992, it was clear that the unit would develop more effectively free from university bureaucracy, and Prof Brown and his wife bought the unit from the university. The deal, one of the first management buy-outs from any UK university, was arranged with the aid of UnivEd Technologies, the university's commercial arm. It cost Pounds 500,000, representing about Pounds 100,000 worth of equipment and Pounds 400,000 of goodwill, and in a gesture which Prof Brown describes as 'enlightened', the university agreed the Browns could pay for the company out of profits. Oswel has annual revenues of about Pounds 1m, representing some 20,000 orders, and is sufficiently profitable for Prof Brown to predict that they will have paid off the debt within three years. Oswel reckons it is the largest DNA synthesis unit in the UK. DNA machines can be bought off the shelf, but it requires skill and experience to run them efficiently. Many organisations these days prefer to order their fragments from commercial 'gene factories' such as Oswel. The chief competition is large US companies such as Genosys. Oswel has the advantage of a local presence and a reputation for quality products  - a reputation it guards jealously. The DNA strands are monitored and analysed continuously during manufacturing, and a sample of each is stored in the laboratory's deep freeze in case of complaints. The chief threat to the business would be price-cutting by the US houses; at Pounds 70 to Pounds 80 a sample, Oswel charges premium prices. Prof Brown argues, however, that quality is his customer's foremost consideration. Furthermore, a company which cut its prices would find it difficult to invest enough to sustain research and development. Oswel grew 35 per cent last year, and Prof Brown believes it should be able to sustain growth of 20 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. It has signed a distribution deal with the UK arm of the Applied Biosciences division of Perkin Elmer, the US company which supplies it with equipment and chemicals. The next step is to move beyond the synthesis of DNA to DNA sequencing - determining the order of the chemical groups in DNA strands. Once the leading edge of gene research, this is increasingly yielding to automation. Prof Brown looks set to reap the reward for the hard work he and his wife have put in over the past few years. The university, meanwhile, has seen its Pounds 2,000 investment turn into Pounds 500,000 in a decade and will continue to receive royalties on Oswel products.

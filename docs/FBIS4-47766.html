			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>   [Text] The election was budgeted at R [rand] 1.25bn  [billion] in the 1994/95 fiscal year -- almost half the expected  budget for housing. But the final bill could be much higher as  unexpected spending on security, extra voting days and delays in  counting votes add to the cost.    The unforeseen R300m [million] bill to bring police  allowances in line with the National Peacekeeping Force alone  could take the overall costs to more than R1.5bn. A State  Expenditure Department spokesman said at the weekend the  election had been budgeted to cost R1.25bn in 1994/95 and was  included in the spending totals released in March this year. He  could not give a breakdown of what was included in the budgeted  figure, but said it was possible the additional costs due to  extra polling days could be accommodated within this amount.  But extra spending on security would probably have to come from  the police and defence budgets, not from the election budget.    He could not comment on whether the R300m cost of the pay  rise to 80,000 police officers, announced by the TEC  [Transitional Executive Committe] last month, could be  accommodated within the existing police budget. The TEC trebled  the election allowance paid to police officers to avert a  strike. The daily payment was raised to bring it in line with  National Peacekeeping Force members' allowances. It was also  annnounced that SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers  deployed to support the SAP [South African Police] during the  election would receive a boost in daily allowances from R15,50  to R61,50, but the total additional cost was not disclosed.    Economists said the extra security spending, when added to  the election's budgeted cost, could take the overall bill to  more than R1.5bn. The cost could be put into perspective by  comparing the figure to the housing budget of about R1.6bn in  the 1993/94 year. The 1994/95 housing budget is expected to be  about R2.6bn.    According to the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission]  preliminary budget estimates, the election would cost nearly  R700m. (The figure did not include security costs.) The IEC  said last week a spending update would be given once the  election results had been announced.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Court rejects criminal injuries plea The High Court yesterday rejected an application by 11 unions to declare unlawful the government's plan to reform the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, replacing individual assessments with a fixed tariff from April 1. Two judges rejected the union claims that Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had acted 'in a constitutionally outrageous way' by introducing a different tariff scheme. The challenge was brought by the Trades Union Congress and unions representing nurses, firefighters, train drivers, teachers, local authority workers and bank staff concerned that the new scheme would leave members worse off when they are seriously injured at work by criminal assault. They had argued that Mr Howard abused his powers when he blocked the old, more generous scheme from being given statutory effect under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act, even though it had received parliamentary approval. Lord Justice Staughton, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, ruled that the home secretary had acted within his powers and had not been legally obliged to do what the unions wished. The judge said: 'Once one reaches the conclusion that the home secretary was not obliged to bring the statutory provisions into force, I cannot see there is anything irrational or improper in his deciding not to do so, or in bringing in another scheme under common law.' The court gave the unions leave to appeal. Mr Andrew Dismore, the unions' solicitor, said they were 'actively considering' whether to appeal - parliament had yet to have the opportunity to 'properly scrutinise the new arrangements'. The Home Office said last night that 60 per cent of those affected would receive the same or more compensation than under the old scheme. There was no statutory requirement for parliamentary approval in changing the compensation terms. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'Innocent victims of crime are the latest unfortunate people targeted to endure the heartlessness of this government's obsessive cost-cutting.' The court's judgment meant in effect that 'workers who suffer injury as a result of criminal activities can no longer expect to receive recompense for loss of earnings - even if they are away from work for prolonged periods due to their injury'.</p>

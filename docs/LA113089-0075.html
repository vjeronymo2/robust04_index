			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> NEW DATA ON THE ELDERLY  </P> <P> A $35,000 study has found fewer than the expected number of elderly residents  in Santa Monica who are frail, isolated or at risk.  </P> <P> The study, by Facts Consolidated in Los Angeles, concluded that at any given  time only 56 elderly residents of the city could be classified as being in a  life-threatening situation.  </P> <P> "What we thought was a great problem isn't as great a problem as we thought,"  said Leonard Gross, chairman of the city's Commission on Older Americans. "By  and large, we found that the elderly in Santa Monica are very happy."  </P> <P> Gross said the city provides adequate services for the elderly, but many people  are unaware of them.  </P> <P> He said the commission will take several months to analyze the data before  proposing programs to the City Council.  </P> <P> "We have data on the elderly that we have never had before," Gross said. "I  think we got a hell of a value for our $35,000."  </P> <P> Among the new information is that the largest concentration of people over 60  years old is north of Montana Avenue, one-third of all households have elderly  residents and 20% of the elderly population is over 80 years old.  </P></p>

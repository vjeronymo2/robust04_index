			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 6 April carries within  its regular 8-minute newscast several reports on the combat  situation in the republic.    According to Gorazde correspondent Enes Murtovic, "the  beginning of the ninth day of the latest and the fiercest  offensive on Gorazde does not hold out hope that the  Serbo-Montenegrins will easily give up their aim, which is to  capture Gorazde. By capturing the town Slobodan Milosevic and  Radovan Karadzic would round off the borders of the phantom  Srpska republic, whose borders are marked with blood and [word  indistinct] of innocent people from this region. Last night the  aggressor fiercely attacked Borova and (?Gosun) with all  available means from the direction of Ustipraca. Dobrijevici  and Razalice were attacked from Mesici. After fierce fighting  and after inflicting heavy losses on the aggressor, the  defenders of Gorazde repelled several infantry attacks by the  Chetniks between Ustipraca and Mesici."    Murtovic also reports that "this morning the Chetniks have  continued their fierce attacks in the Gorazde area. All the  front lines of the Gorazde defenders between Foca, Cajnice,  Ustipraca, and Rogatica are being targeted. The Gorazde city  center was spared destructive shells this morning, probably  because General Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces], is expected to arrive here."    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "since last  night, Karadzic's terrorists have continued their artillery  attacks in the Bihac region. The target of their artillery and  tanks deployed in Grabez are Bihac and [words indistinct]  surrounding area. Civilians and civilian houses, as well as  vital communications, are again being targeted."    The correspondent also says that "on the front lines facing  the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous  region, small arms provocations and the shelling of the Cajnici  area and Krivaja in the Cazin commune have continued."    According to a correspondent from the free territory of  Brcko, "the Serbian aggressor has continued shelling the defense  lines and regrouping his forces. Last night, the Chetniks  attacked the central part of the Brcko defense lines with 60-mm  and 82-mm mortars and portable rocket launchers."</p>

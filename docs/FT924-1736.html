			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Letter: Strength not only issue Sir, The recent Standard &amp; Poor's report on the financial strength of some UK life offices continues the debate on this difficult and complex topic. Lots of commentators, including many from the actuarial profession, have counselled caution when using such surveys. One particular point seems to have been missed by the compilers of such surveys. High levels of free assets are equated with strength, which is judged to be good by policy-holders. In my view this is not necessarily the case. It may be that high levels of free assets are the result of under-declaration of past policy-holders' bonuses and of penal surrender values. In this situation high levels of free assets may have been bad for the policy-holders. The point is that financial strength is not the only issue. P A Leandro, Barnett Waddingham &amp; Company, consulting actuaries, 11 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QB</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher prices help Gengold advance Gengold, the gold division of South African mining house Gencor, shrugged off the labour unrest that had dented its previous quarter's figures and reported a sharp 42.8 per cent rise in after-tax profit for the three months to September, up to R126.8m (Dollars 36m) from a disappointing R88.8m. The company's mines benefited from a 4 per cent rise in the average gold price received and improved overall production. These were more than sufficient to offset a slight decline in yield. Overall gold production rose 3.2 per cent to 15,731kg, up from 15,242kg, while the average gold price received rose to R44,614 a kg from R42,744 a kg. Total tonnage milled was 2.7m tonnes, up from 2.6m tonnes. Mr Tom Dale, deputy managing director of Gencor's gold division, said the company had benefited from the end of election-related unrest in the June quarter. However, he said working costs were up due to increased mining activity and a higher wage bill. Of the group's bigger mines, Beatrix performed best, increasing after-tax income to R31.3m from R20.7m in spite of a slight drop in yield to 6.1 grammes/tonne from 6.2 grammes/tonne. Kinross also showed substantial improvement, raising after-tax profits to R31.1m from R21.5m. Winkelhaak improved its after-tax figures to R21.5m from R13.6m, while Buffelsfontein's improvement was less dramatic, lifting profits to R16.3m from R14.5m. Gold mines in the Anglovaal group increased attributable profit slightly for the September quarter, raising attributable profit to R46.2m, from R45.3m in the previous three months. As usual, the bulk of the profit came from heavyweight producer Hartebeesfontein, which, in spite of lower yields, achieved managed to raise after-tax to R42.1m from R40.4m.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN MARCOS WANTS TO OPERATE OWN TRASH PLANT  </P> <P> San Marcos city officials, saying they are frustrated that a trash-to-energy  plant has not yet been approved by the county for construction in their city,  are investigating the possibility of developing their own landfill on which to  build their own trash plant.  </P> <P> Mayor Lee Thibadeau proposes that the city operate its own trash-processing  plan for its own residents -- and let the county look elsewhere to build a  regional recycling and trash-burning plant.  </P> <P> "We're fed up. We've cooperated (with the county), and we've waited and we've  worked with them, and still there is a lack of negotiations" between the county  and the would-be trash plant builder, Thibadeau said.  </P> <P> "We've been taking care of the entire region's trash problems, and now it's  time we protect the San Marcos voters, the guys who are paying my wages," he  said.  </P> <P> By a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, the San Marcos City Council approved several  Thibadeau proposals which, the mayor said, could force the county to abandon  its own landfill and pave the way for San Marcos to enter the trash business.  The city staff was instructed to report back its initial findings and reaction  to the mayor's proposal at a City Council meeting Wednesday night.  </P> <P> County officials say they don't believe Thibadeau's proposal holds much merit,  either for his own city or for the county as a whole. And the company that  Thibadeau would have build a trash plant for the city's own use says it is  still committed to working with the county for a regional trash plant.  </P> <P> But Thibadeau said he has done enough initial investigation to give him the  confidence that his idea is worth pursuing. The only council member to object  was Pia Harris, who has steadfastly opposed a trash-burning power plant in her  city.  </P> <P> Among the mayor's requests were that:  </P> <P> * The city's attorney investigate whether the county has violated the city's  special-use permit, which governs the landfill site, and consider a number of  remedies -- including revoking the permit allowing the landfill in the first  place.  </P> <P> Thibadeau said he believes the county has allowed the land filling to occur to  a height higher than the city allowed and has expanded the boundaries of the  landfill to exceed the original boundaries.  </P> <P> * The city consider condemning the landfill itself, in order to allow the city  to take over its operations.  </P> <P> * The city negotiate with neighboring landowners to buy land adjoining the  existing landfill for the city to develop as its own burial ground for trash.  </P> <P> * The city begin negotiations with Thermo Electron Corp., which hopes to build  and operate a $250-million, trash-to-energy plant at the San Marcos landfill on  behalf of the county, to build a smaller plant for the exclusive use of San  Marcos and any other cities that might contract directly with San Marcos.  </P> <P> "I have verified to the extent I've needed to in the past few months that the  county of San Diego is in direct violation of certain provisions of the  special-use permit they're operating under," Thibadeau said. "They have  exceeded the height limitation of the fill-in area, and the boundaries have  exceeded what was originally drawn up. Furthermore, I suspect they might be  infringing on an archeological site."  </P> <P> Thibadeau contends that the county has knowingly exceeded the limits and did so  because, if the landfill were maintained within the established limits, it  already would be full, forcing the county to send trash to more distant  landfills.  </P> <P> He said he doesn't hold much hope that the city could condemn the landfill and  bring it under city ownership because the same criteria the city would use --  issues of public safety and welfare -- could be argued by the county in  retaining ownership.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special-Use Permit  </P> <P> There is more likelihood, Thibadeau said, that the county will be found in  violation of the city's special-use permit to operate the trash plant.  </P> <P> Still, he acknowledges, if the city were to attempt to revoke the permit, the  county would probably respond with legal action that would at least allow it to  operate the landfill until the matter is resolved in court.  </P> <P> Despite the hurdles, legally and logistically, of turning the county out of San  Marcos, Thibadeau said the time has come to pursue it as an option.  </P> <P> "In 1989, the county will bring over 1.3 million tons of trash into San Marcos.  Almost 50% of that comes from Carlsbad, Escondido and Encinitas -- the very  cities that are suing us for attempting to solve the county's long-range  solid-waste problems by building the trash plant," Thibadeau said.  </P> <P> "But our city only produces 43,000 tons of trash a year. Every 12 days we allow  the county to continue operating the landfill, they are costing us a year of  space that would otherwise be available to us."  </P> <P> The landfill is expected to reach capacity in 1991, and county officials say  they would need to expand the landfill in order to serve the proposed trash  plant, which would recycle some of North County's trash, burn much of it and  bury the rest -- including the resulting ash.  </P> <P> San Marcos officials -- supported by a public, citywide vote -- already have  approved the construction of the plant, which would generate millions of  dollars more for the city. But the plant would operate under contract with the  county, and it is that contract that must still be negotiated between the Board  of Supervisors and Thermo Electron.  </P> <P> </P> <P> April Beginning  </P> <P> The negotiations are expected to begin in April, both parties say.  </P> <P> Barry Welch, the project manager for Thermo Electron, said he doesn't want to  speculate on the possibility that his company could build a smaller version of  the plant for San Marcos' exclusive use.  </P> <P> "Our position is that we are presently on track and absolutely committed to the  negotiations with the county on our service agreement, period. We have not had  discussions with the city on their proposal," Welch said.  </P> <P> "It would be speculation to say whether their proposal makes sense," he said.  "For the time being, we'll buckle down and get our negotiations done with the  county. It would certainly be better for everybody involved if we were to run  down the road we've been running down and come to the finish line with a plant  that would serve everybody.  </P> <P> "I understand the feelings of impatience by a city that has supported this  project all along and which sees a landfill filling up while time marches on,"  Welch said.  </P> <P> Roger Walsh, the county's deputy director of public works, said Thibadeau's  contention that the county has overstepped its bounds at the landfill was news  to him.  </P> <P> "We have not knowingly or unknowingly operated outside the conditions of the  use permit," he said. "We will review the suggestion that we have. We have a  fairly good aerial mapping system, and we'll review it. In the event we are (in  violation), we'll meet with the city and try to resolve any difficulties we  have."  </P> <P> Walsh said he will meet with the staff of county counsel today to discuss  whether San Marcos has any legal grounds to revoke the county's permit to  operate the landfill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Support Notion  </P> <P> But philosophically, Walsh said he cannot support San Marcos' notion to go out  on its own in the trash business.  </P> <P> "The county has the responsibility for solid-waste management planning. We  operate the landfills which serve all the cities except San Diego, and all the  unincorporated area, and we will continue to serve them," Walsh said. "We feel  we already have a binding contract with Thermo Electron to build and operate  the facility, and all we are negotiating at this time is a major modification  of it."  </P> <P> Rick Anthony, a solid-waste program manager for the county, said he doesn't  think San Marcos is willing or capable of backing the trash plant on its own.  </P> <P> "Are they willing to put up their general fund to back the plant's operation?  Are they ready to take responsibility for a landfill, and deal with all the  state regulations on garbage?" said Anthony.  </P> <P> "The county is willing to do those things because the county is the lead agency  for solid-waste disposal for the entire county, and we share that obligation  with everybody in the county," he said.  </P> <P> County supervisors in January authorized its staff to open negotiations with  Thermo Electron and set a 60-day deadline to complete the talks. But those  talks have not yet begun, Walsh said, because the county has had to hire  consultants to advise it on the negotiations.  </P> <P> The trash plant also is targeted in a number of still-unresolved lawsuits by  opponents on a variety of environmental and procedural grounds.  </P></p>

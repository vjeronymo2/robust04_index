			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Promise of the '80s turns sour: Calls for more protection for holidaymakers - No redundancy plans / The background to this week's collapse of the Mowat holiday group FOR a thrusting 1980s company, there could not have been two more promising businesses than property and leisure. The seemingly unstoppable rise of the former made consumers feel wealthy enough to lavish increasing amounts of disposable income on the latter. For the Mowat Group, the attempt to marry property and leisure ended yesterday morning when receivers Touche Ross arrived at the company's Hertfordshire headquarters to take control of the business. Mr Brian Dunlop, Mowat's chairman, insists that there was nothing wrong with the company's leisure businesses, which included 11 holiday camps as well as cruises on the Norfolk Broads. The 13 banks that decided to call in the receivers on Tuesday night agree. Mr Ian Birch, regional director of Lloyds Bank Commercial Services, which led the negotiations, says Mowat's demise stemmed from the downturn in the property market. Mr Dunlop announced last April that the group wanted to dispose of its property interests to concentrate on the more promising leisure sector. Mowat's property arm had built homes, mostly in Staffordshire and Cheshire, as well as commercial and industrial facilities. By that stage, however, the company was already in serious trouble. In the 15 months to the end of September 1991, Mowat recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.97m. Its share price, which regularly topped 50p in the late 1980s, traded at less than 4p for much of the summer. When the shares were suspended at Mowat's request last Tuesday, they stood at 2 1/2 p. Mr Dunlop put the group's total debt at Pounds 54m. Receivership was all the more bitter for Mr Dunlop because he had rescued the company from near-collapse before. Originally a tanning company, Mowat moved into property, making it one of the stock market stars of the 1970s. By 1979, however, profits had collapsed, and in 1984 the company's stock exchange listing was cancelled. A year later, dissident shareholders led by Mr Dunlop ousted the board. The company was floated on the Unlisted Securities Market on Christmas Eve, 1987. Mr Dunlop insisted that this week's receivership could have been avoided. His bankers make clear that their patience had run out. Ten of the banks had their loans to the company secured by property business assets. Mr Dunlop says that accounted for Pounds 30m of the debt. The 10 banks had agreed in principle to attempt to dispose of the properties concerned. Three banks - Lloyds, the Cooperative Bank and Banque Indosuez - had lent the company money to meet its working capital requirements, and they were less happy. Mowat and the banks reached an agreement that it would raise Pounds 6.5m in new investment by August 27 to fund its remaining leisure business. Mr Birch says that by that deadline the company had received firm pledges for only Pounds 1.9m. The two sides agreed to extend the deadline until September 7, by which point Mr Birch says the company told the banks it had a sum approaching Pounds 2.5m. Mr Birch says: 'The other problem was that the professional fees incurred in this equity issue would have added Pounds 300,000. There was also a fresh forecast at that time that there would be a need for new working capital of Pounds 2.5m before the pre-1993 season. We were not prepared to take that risk.' Touche Ross says it has no immediate plans to make any of Mowat's 740 employees redundant. The immediate task is to secure the holidays of the more than 60,000 people who hold Mowat bookings for the rest of this year. Few of those holidays are thought to be protected in any way. Neither Mowat nor its holiday subsidiaries - Holimarine, Pennant Parks and Pennant Boats - were members of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) - only customers who booked their holidays through Abta travel agents will benefit from the organisation's protection scheme. Mr Nigel Atkinson, one of the receivers, says he will try to find one or more buyers for Mowat's holidays camps, which compete with resorts such as Butlin's. There is already a buyer for the Norfolk Broads cruise operation - last July, Mowat said it was selling the business to Broads Tours, a private company, for Pounds 1.9m in cash and Pounds 2m in property.</p>

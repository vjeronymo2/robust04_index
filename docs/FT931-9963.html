			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Repo is disappointing SHORT-DATED Euromark futures fell back yesterday after the Bundesbank reduced the lowest accepted rate in its weekly securities repurchase tender by only 7 basis points, writes James Blitz. Hopes of a substantial cut in the rate at which the Bundesbank offers funds to commercial banks had been dashed at the weekend after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's president, indicated that last week's reduction in Germany's officially posted interest rates would not mean a lowering in the cost of money market funds. However, there was still some disappointment when the lowest accepted repo rate came in at 8.50 per cent, from last week's 8.57 per cent. The March Euromark contract declined by 4 basis points from its previous close, finishing at 91.97. At this level it prices three-month money next month at 8.03 per cent. Call money was virtually unaltered yesterday at 8.60 per cent. The duller tone continued to take its toll on French franc markets. The cost of three-month cash hovered around 12 per cent, while the March French franc contract closed 30 basis points down on the day at 88.57. At this level it assumes that three-month money will come down only 50 basis points between now and the French elections. There was little activity in sterling markets. The March futures contract rose 6 basis points to close at 94.16, while three-month money was unchanged at 6 3/16 per cent. One dealer suggested yesterday that the March contract was a very good buy from here. He listed several events which could raise expectations of a cut in UK base rates in the next two months. These include two Bundesbank meetings, and a further one on the day after the March contract expires; a G7 finance ministers' meeting in London on February 27, which may discuss the high level of European interest rates; and the UK Budget on March 16. Convergence of the March contract with the current level of three-month money could, of course, bring the March future down to around 93.75. Devel-oping problems over the Maastricht treaty could also undermine the pound on the foreign exchanges. However, if sterling stabilises at its current level, there may be reasons to buy the contract now.</p>

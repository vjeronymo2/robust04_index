			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Impacts attributable to listing also include those resulting from the responsibility of all Federal agencies under section 7 to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species. An action could be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species through the destruction or adverse modification of its habitat, whether or not that habitat has been designated as critical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Significance of Designating Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The designation of critical habitat does not, in itself, restrict state or private activities within the area. A critical habitat designation contributes to conservation of the species primarily by identifying critically important areas and describing the features within the areas that are essential to the species, thus alerting public and private entities to the importance of the area. Under the ESA, the only direct impact of a critical habitat designation is through the provisions of section 7. Section 7 applies only to actions with Federal involvement and does not affect state or private activities unless there is Federal involvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the section 7 provisions, a designation of critical habitat would require Federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy or adversely modify the designated critical habitat. Activities that adversely modify critical habitat are defined as those actions that ``appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery'' of the species (50 CFR 402.02). However, if no critical habitat has been designated, Federal agencies still must ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species. Activities that jeopardize a species are defined as those actions that ``reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery'' of the species (50 CFR 402.02). Using these definitions, activities that destroy or adversely modify critical habitat also are likely to jeopardize the species. Therefore, the protection provided by a critical habitat designation usually only duplicates the protection provided under the section 7 jeopardy provision. Critical habitat may provide additional benefits to a species where areas outside of the species' current range have been designated. In these cases, it is expected that Federal agencies would consult on actions occurring in these areas for which they would otherwise not need to consult. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to the Federal agencies as to when consultation under section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals of a listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present). The critical habitat designation, describing the essential features of the habitat, also assists in determining which activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 (i.e., activities that may affect essential features of the designated area). For example, disposal of waste material in water adjacent to a critical habitat area may affect an essential feature of the designated habitat (water quality) and would be subject to the provisions of section 7 of the ESA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A critical habitat designation also assists Federal agencies in planning future actions, since the designation establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations. This is particularly true in cases where there are alternative areas that would provide for the conservation of the species. With a designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between projects and endangered or threatened species can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another indirect benefit of designating critical habitat is that it helps focus Federal, state and private conservation and management efforts in those areas. Recovery efforts may address special considerations needed in critical habitat areas, including conservation regulations to restrict private as well as Federal activities. The economic and other impacts of these actions would be considered at the time of proposal, and, therefore, are not considered in the critical habitat designation process. Other Federal, state and local laws or regulations, such as zoning or wetlands protection, may also provide special protection for critical habitat areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Process for Designating Critical Habitat <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Developing a proposal for critical habitat designation involves three main considerations. First, the biological needs of the species are evaluated and essential habitat areas and features are identified. If there are alternative areas that would provide for the conservation of the species, these alternatives are also identified. Second, the need for special management considerations or protection of the area(s) or features is evaluated. Finally, the probable economic and other impacts of designating these essential areas as ``critical habitat'' are evaluated. After considering the requirements of the species, the need for special management, and the impacts of the designation, the proposed critical habitat is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for comment. The final critical habitat designation, considering comments on the proposal and impacts assessment, should be published within 1 year of the proposal. Section 4 (a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, NMFS designate critical habitat concurrently with a determination that a species is endangered or threatened. Final critical habitat designations may be revised, using the same process, as new data become available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

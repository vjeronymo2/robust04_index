			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Argentina widens trade gap estimate ARGENTINA has again raised its official estimate for the 1992 trade deficit, adding to concern about economic reforms. The deficit is now put at up to Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.64bn), against Dollars 1.5bn before, according to planning secretary Juan Llach. At the same time, unemployment and under-employment in October rose to 7 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively, against 6 and 7.9 per cent a year earlier, the Indec statistics agency said. Independent researchers at the UADE business school reported that workers' purchasing power fell 8 per cent in December. Mr Pedro Lacoste, an economic consultant, blames rapid economic change for the apparent contradiction of a rising trade deficit and increasing unemployment. Unreliable statistics worsen the confusion, he says. He believes the employment data reflect a heavy shakeout in industry, as companies struggle to boost productivity, and he expects inflation and the trade deficit to fall sharply this year. However, Mr Jose Luis Machinea, chief economist at the Union Industrial Argentina, an employers' grouping, says the trade figures reflect low productivity. 'Productivity growth has to be based on investments, but this takes time. It will take four to five years to close our 15-20 per cent productivity gap.' Mr Machinea says the doubt is over how the ensuing trade deficit will be financed and whether industry will invest sufficiently. He warns that imports are replacing domestic production, while investment is insufficient and is directed at service sectors, which do not generate hard currency. The government, though, insists all is well. The Planning Secretariat says the trade deficit may persist this year, but will then fall sharply. Officials add that capital goods are a large component of imports.</p>

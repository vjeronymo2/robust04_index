			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Through a brick wall: The increase in skilled craftswomen Ms Cassandra Benjamin's firm handshake says more than any national vocation qualification about her abilities as a bricklayer. 'Generally I can lift more bricks than men. A lot of them can't hack it anyway,' she says with a smile. She has earned the right to be confident the hard way, proving herself in what remains a male-dominated occupation in the UK. Ms Benjamin, who trains women bricklayers, is a role model for her colleagues. They say she was once asked by a building supplier if she was able to lift the 14lb sledge-hammer he sold her. She ignored the comment, returning to her workplace, and demolished a brick wall 20ft high in the next two hours. According to many women who work in construction, the industry remains a bastion of male prejudice, where traditional attitudes towards the workplace roles of men and women are stubbornly preserved. Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of the Construction Industry Training Board, the statutory body that provides craft training for the UK industry, says such attitudes must change if the industry is to escape a skills shortage as the UK emerges from recession. He forecasts that 10 per cent of jobs in the construction industry will need to be filled by women within the next five years, because there will be too few skilled men. Women currently comprise fewer than 1 per cent of the 800,000 manual workers in the UK industry, and few of them are in skilled craft jobs. Sir Clifford urges greater government support for unemployed women and single mothers to undergo skills training. Women who receive craft training, he argues, prove more assiduous in achieving the qualifications and are less likely to drop out than men. He highlights the work of Women's Education in Building (Web), a north London-based charity committed to improving women's craft skills. In 10 years, the centre has trained nearly 800 women in construction trades, including carpentry, plastering, plumbing and bricklaying. Part of the course involves developing the ability to handle harassment and insensitivity from some male colleagues. The need to do so is made clear to trainees by Ms Takumba Ria Lawal, Web's training manager and a colleague of Ms Benjamin. Her first job as a qualified carpenter was fitting out some London penthouse flats. In that and subsequent jobs, she recalls, she had to earn the respect of her male workmates. 'The first thing I would be told was: 'Don't think I'm being disrespectful, love, but if the quality of work goes down, you'll be the first to go'.' Ms Caroline Hughes, a plumbing trainee at Web, is learning the roofing technique of lead bossing - shaping it with tools: 'I'm the sort of woman who had to get men in to mend the washing machine, but now I can fix things myself.' She worked in a hairdressing salon after leaving school at 16. 'Things like woodwork and metalwork at school were for the boys. We had to learn cookery and needle work. We never had any career advice. The hairdressing was no kind of job, but this is stimulating and challenging.' Now 34, she feels she is pursuing a worthwhile career for the first time. The public, voluntary and self-employed sectors remain the largest employers of craftswomen, says Ms Louisa Blackwell, a former quantity surveyor, now doing research at City University, London. Women who have joined private companies often find the atmosphere difficult, she says. 'I would defy any woman who has worked in the construction industry to say she has not experienced sexual harassment, be it offensive language, pornography or implications that she cannot do the work. 'Women find there are insufficient support frameworks in small firms, whereas the public sector tends to have unions, personnel or equal opportunity officers that they can turn to for help.' Cuts in staff employed directly by local authorities, one of the biggest areas of work for craftswomen, have forced many women to become self-employed, she says, but this is having a positive spin-off. 'They are finding that it is possible to market yourself as a woman. A lot of women householders, particularly older people, feel more comfortable engaging a tradeswoman.' Ms Allison Ogden, Web director, believes that centres like hers, which provide help with childcare, are offering women opportunities they would previously have been unable to find. Nearly half the women attracted to its courses have been lone mothers who want to earn traditional 'men's wages'. Some 44 similar training centres have been established in the UK, registered with the Women's Training Network in Sheffield. The network supervises grants from the European Social Fund, which provides 45 per cent of the centre's funds. The rest comes from local government, but training organisers such as the the Construction Industry Training Board and Web believe there should be greater support from central government. Ms Ogden says: 'If the government is serious about its commitment to going back to basics, it should do more to provide childcare for women who want to train for traditional trades. Surely this type of training should be made universally available by a government that is so anxious about single mothers?' The answer will depend partly on demand and partly on the willingness of the industry to accommodate craftswomen.</p>

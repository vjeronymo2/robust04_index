			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Advertising The marketing strategies being pursued by branded goods companies may not be a mortal blow for hard-pressed advertising agencies. Mr Charles Scott, chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, acknowledged last week that discounting of branded goods would suck money out of advertising budgets in the short term. But pioneers of everyday low pricing such as Procter &amp; Gamble have pledged that advertising support for their brands will not be reduced overall. The remaining price differential of branded goods over generic products would otherwise be impossible to defend. Yet the outlook for advertising agencies is far from cloudless. While advertising expenditure should grow as the industrial economies turn, the stratospheric rate of growth seen in the 1980s - with advertising growing steadily as a proportion of gross domestic product - is improbable. The wild card is the question of brand valuations in company accounts. A recent study commissioned by the UK Accounting Standards Board supported balance sheet valuation of acquired brands, subject to certain financial tests. If that approach is carried through into an accounting standard, consumer goods companies will have a financial incentive to maintain advertising investment in their brands. Agencies would doubtless applaud such an approach. Still, having written off Pounds 600m of goodwill to reflect a permanent diminution in value of acquired agency brands, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi will also appreciate the pitfalls.</p>

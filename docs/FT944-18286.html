			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Logistical snags are tying up aluminium stocks, says report Logistical snags are tying up aluminium warehouse stocks and contributing to a supply tightness that could boost ingot prices above Dollars 1 a pound (Dollars 2,204 a tonne) by mid-1995, according to industry analyst Stewart Spector, reports Reuters from New York. In the latest issue of the Spector Report, he also said the shortage could prompt Western producers to restart idled capacity by mid-1995 to keep prices from rising too quickly. 'While a large statistical ingot surplus does exist, it's not all available for immediate delivery to markets where demand is rising rapidly. . . It is possible, in our opinion, that by the end of 1995 Western smelters could be operating at nearly 100 per cent capacity.' Spector said that London Metal Exchange warehouses in Rotterdam, with 1.1m tonnes of aluminium, are the principal and most convenient location for shipping ingot to the world market. Total LME warehouse stocks now stand at 2.31m tonnes, down 13 per cent from the mid-June record. The report suggested that logistical problems at Rotterdam could limit weekly aluminium shipments to about 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes in the next several months, short of the optimum 60,000 tonnes. 'At that rate, it could take well into 1995 to empty Rotterdam's warehouses,' Spector said. The result, he said, was likely to be a further jump in aluminium prices to between 80 and 85 US cents a pound by the end of 1994 and to Dollars 1.20 to Dollars 1.30 by the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 1995. The current price is 72 cents a pound. Spector also estimated that western aluminium shipments this year would rise 10 per cent, while production would slip 4.6 per cent to 14.4m tonnes. Stocks were projected to fall by 855,000 tonnes. For 1995, Spector forecast that shipments would rise 6.5 per cent, with production likely to grow 3.6 per cent to 14.9m tonnes. Meanwhile, a worldwide shortage of alumina (aluminium oxide) was likely to keep Russian primary aluminium production at or below current levels for the next few years, the report said, while the state of disrepair at Russian smelters would also weigh on output levels. 'The CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) ingot that started flowing into the West in 1990 and trashed ingot prices could soon fade away as an industry concern,' it suggested. 'In 1995, the Western aluminium industry may finally get its share of the peace dividend.' Spector predicted that, if western primary producers returned to full capacity in the middle of next year and if Chinese and eastern European alumina imports remained at current levels, the market might see an annual alumina shortfall of 2m tonnes in 1996 and 1997. That could result in a cut in Russian alumina imports and reduced production, he said. He forecast Russian production at 2.66m tonnes this year, off 5.6 per cent from 1993, with a further decline to 2.58m tonnes possible next year.</p>

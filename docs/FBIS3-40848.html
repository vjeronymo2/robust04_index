The direct involvement of some  MLAs (Member of Legislative Assembly) and ministers in the  ongoing Kuki-Naga clashes and the government's failure in  tackling the deteriorating law and order situation, among other  problems, led to the imposition of President's rule in Manipur  yesterday, according to two outgoing cabinet ministers.    Requesting anonymity, the ex-ministers said that no one in  the ministry thought seriously on how to tackle the insurgency  that claimed over 450 lives in the last two years in the state.    But the outgoing deputy chief minister, Mr Rishang Keishing,  said the imposition of President's rule would help the state  government deal more effectively with the problems. There would  now be no obstacle from any quarter, added Mr Keishing, a senior  Congress leader.    However, Mr Keishing's view was not shared by the Manipur  People's Party (MPP), a coalition partner in the Congress-led  ministry. Disapproving the imposition of President's rule, Mr  Kumarjit Singh, senior MPP leader and former deputy chairman of  the state planning board, said that all problems could have been  solved through discussion and political dialogue.    He held the popular ministry responsible for not taking  steps  to initiate a "meeting ground" of all ethnic groups. He said all  tribal communities, including the Kukis and the Nagas, could  have sorted out their problems and differences at such a forum.  President's rule would not solve the problem, he added.    Meanwhile, intelligence sources pointed out that the Centre  was disappointed at the utter failure of the state government to  check the rising insurgency and the worsening of Kuki-Naga  clashes in the five hill districts of the state.    The internal crisis in the Congress and the MPP, the two  major partners in the five-party coalition, also resulted in  difference of opinion among the senior cabinet minister, the  sources said. The Centre was aware of this, they added.    Another factor hastening the Centre's decision was the  banned  National Socialist Council of Nagaland's warning to the Naga  ministers and MLAs to resign by December 31. The Centre,  however, did not succumb to the NSCN (National Socialist Council  of Nagaland) pressure and imposed President's rule, a senior  Congress member said.    The Centre was also aware of the case of missing uniforms  worth over Rs 67 lakhs belonging to the Manipur Rifles and the  involvement of the Manipur Rifles personnel in smuggling  activities, the sources added. These cases were likely to be  investigated by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), they  added.    The insurgency had intensified recently with the worst-ever  ambush on security personnel in June last year in which 24 army  personnel were gunned down by Naga insurgents in the Tengnoupal  area in Chandel district in Manipur.    Official sources said the security forces could not  effectively operate in the trouble-torn areas because of  "political interference."</p>

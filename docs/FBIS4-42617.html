			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl are currently traveling to Ruegen Island  in the Baltic Sea, where they will continue their talks.  Gonzalez and Kohl have just given a news conference. Pedro  Fernandez Cespedes reports from Schwerin:    [Cespedes] Speaking at a news conference a few minutes ago,  Felipe Gonzalez and Helmut Kohl expressed their agreement on the  European matters which they will take to the EU [European Union]  Council meeting, to be chaired by the Greek presidency, to be  held in Corfu. It appears that there is agreement on the name  of the person to succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the  Commission, although they did not reveal the name. They want to  continue consulting with their EU colleagues.    Agreement between the two leaders was also highlighted by  the  Spanish prime minister, who said he feels closer to the German  chancellor on matters relating to Europe than he does to the  Spanish Popular Party. He also agrees that what is important is  not the timetable for a single European currency, but economic  stability and the stability of financial markets. [passage  omitted]</p>

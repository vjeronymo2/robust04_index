			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE AND SEX  </P> <P> Howard Rosenberg's Feb. 13 article, " 'Nightingales' a Hospital Case," struck  me as hilarious -- prim and proper nursing supervisors and recruiters griping  about the "Nightingales" TV series giving a falsely sexy picture of nurses.  </P> <P> From indirect but close experience, I can say the truth is more outrageous than  anything on "Nightingales."  </P> <P> THEODORE O.

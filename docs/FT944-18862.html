			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gestetner loses Pounds 6.1m on interest rate swaps Shares in Gestetner, the office equipment company, fell 23p to 123p yesterday, after it announced it had made a Pounds 6.1m loss on interest rate swaps, following the upswing in US and UK interests rates this year. Mr Stephen King, finance director, said the board had been aware of a small potential liability when it announced interim results in July, but only recently discovered the full extent of its exposure. The positions have now been closed. Gestetner is re-evaluating its treasury operations and imp-roving controls and reporting procedures, while Price Waterhouse is undertaking a full investigation of the incident. No board authorisation was required for the highly geared transaction which involved a floating rate to fixed interest rate swap on Pounds 20m and Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m), and senior management appears to have been slow to react. One analyst was shocked the new management had ext-ended Gestetner's reputation for being accident prone. Forecasts for full year profits have been reduced to about Pounds 15m. Mr King said that trading continued to be in line with expectations, adding: 'We believe we are heading in the right direction, and this is just a one-off aberration'. The group has other treasury swap positions, but not of the same geared nature. In 1993, the company made Pounds 4.2m of profits from closing interest rate swaps. Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, took a 15 per cent stake in May 1993, and encouraged a number of management changes, and a cost cutting programme which resulted in Pounds 48m of restructuring costs. It recently lapsed its option to increase the holding to 25 per cent. The management was seen to have put the core office and photographic equipment distribution business back on a recovery track. Inchcape's decision not to exercise its option was based on concern over jeopardising its relationship with Ricoh, the Japanese photocopying company. Inchcape paid about 129p a share. The company yesterday reiterated its stance that it was happy with the investment.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Crimean Tatars try to rebuild life at home: The returning community, writes Chrystia Freeland, is shoved to the sidelines by the Slavic giants LESS THAN a mile away from the magnificent, turreted palace of the Khan of Crimea, in the sandy fields of Bakchesaray, his descendants live in fly-infested, tar-paper squatters shacks. The Khan's Palace, wreathed in Arabic script, was the centre of a Moslem society which prospered on the peninsula for five centuries. That society was shattered in 1783 when Catherine II annexed Crimea, in a move which underscored the decline of the Khanate's protector, the Ottoman empire, and the rise of its historic enemy, Imperial Russia. Two hundred years later, the lush Crimean peninsula is again the pivot for a larger struggle, this time between the shrinking Russian empire and the nascent Ukrainian nation. As the two Slav giants fight it out, the Crimean Tatars, whose 250,000-strong community was deported en masse by Stalin in 1944, are trying to rebuild their society. 'As soon as we were born, we began to dream about returning to our native land,' explains 38-year-old Seitumer Bekirov, one of the nearly 200,000 Crimean tatars who have made the difficult journey from central Asia and Kazakhstan to their homeland over the past five years. Mr Bekirov was born in Uzbekistan in 1944; his family tried to return to Crimea in 1970 but was forced out. Undaunted, they spent the next two decades in Kherson, a Ukrainian city chosen for its proximity to Crimea. In 1990, Mr Bekirov was finally permitted to return to his homeland, in which he had never lived. He spent six months in a primitive, dirt-floored hut built in a vacant field without water or electricity before he and 600 other protesters forced the Crimean government to formally turn the land over to the Tatars. Although the Ukrainian government has earmarked Rbs3.2bn to subsidise the resettlement, Crimean Tatars find their efforts blocked at every turn by the communist-dominated local government. Tatars have no right to reclaim the homes from which they were deported, they have been granted parched fields on which to build new houses only by squatting on them for months, and, despite a Ukrainian law returning religious buildings to their original use, the Tatars were able to reclaim one of the three remaining Crimean mosques only by physically occupying it. To add insult to injury, even the gorgeous Khan's Palace is in jeopardy: the Crimean government is trying to sell it to private shopkeepers. Blue eyes dancing in his tanned face, Mr Bekirov, who moved to Crimea with his wife, two children, parents and in-laws in tow, shrugs off the difficulties. 'For us, it is worth it,' he says. Outnumbered by Russians by nearly ten to one, the Tatars oppose a renewal of an independent Crimea as enjoyed under the Khanate. Mr Mustafa Jemilev, the diminutive, 49-year-old chairman of the Mejlis, the Crimean Tartars' elected council, says: 'The greatest danger is that we will be left one-on-one with these Russian chauvinists.' Nursing a suspicion of Russia bred by Tatar history and reinforced by the 15 years he spent in Soviet prisons for championing the Tatar cause, Mr Jemilev is equally opposed to unification with a Russia, where, he says, 'there is very little sober thinking, only imperialist thinking.' The Tatars' only option, it is argued, is to insist that Crimea remain part of Ukraine. Mr Jemilev says that the Tatars' unique claim to the peninsula should be acknowledged by granting Crimea national-territorial status with a bicameral parliament in which the Tatars would control one house. If Tatar demands are not met, Mr Jemilev warns, his people could turn to more drastic tactics. Their leadership is considering declaring the Crimean Tatars 'a people fighting for national liberation,' a status which, in the view of the Mejlis, would render all Crimean laws invalid and give the Tatars the right to resort to force. Mr Jemilev says: 'Crimea is not just some pretty place for us. For us, it is everything.'</p>

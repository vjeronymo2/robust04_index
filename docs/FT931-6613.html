			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Security forces accused TWO US human rights groups yesterday charged Indian security forces, fighting against insurgents in the mountain state of Kashmir, with stepping up a 'campaign of terror against civilians,' writes Stefan Wagstyl. The report, from Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, comes at a time of interational concern about the ferocity of the struggle between the Indian security forces and the militant groups. In the most serious incident, 65 civilians were killed in the city of Sopore in January when security forces staged an attack, after a militant assault in which two soldiers died. The human rights report documents alleged cases of torture, detention without trial and assaults by members of the security forces on civilians.

Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State and top  U.S.  representative to contacts with North Korea, flew into Seoul on  Sunday and met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and other  South Korean working-level officials. Hubbard accompanied  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on a leg of his Asian trip and  flew in separately to Seoul to consult on the nuclear issue,  Ministry officials said. He leaves for Washington on Monday  afternoon.    Pyongyang-IAEA negotiations on resuming inspections are  dragging on beyond expectations and the two sides are likely to  meet again sometime soon.    If these talks go well and Pyongyang reopens inter-Korean  dialogue, the United States is expected to hold high-level talks  with North Korea for comprehensive discussions, including  relations improvement.</p>

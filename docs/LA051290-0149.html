			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELUS LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ANOTHER ONE-RUN LOSS ENDS SERVITE'S PLAYOFF HOPES  </P> <P> Mike McNary can count on one hand the reasons Servite High School's baseball  team will miss the playoffs for the first time in his five years as coach.  </P> <P> In fact, it only takes four fingers -- one for each one-run defeat the Friars  suffered in their last four Angelus League games.  </P> <P> The latest came Friday against visiting Bishop Amat, 5-4, in a game to decide  the league's No. 3 entry into the Southern Section 5-A playoffs.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat is 14-8, 6-6 in league play. Servite finished 16-10, 5-7.  </P> <P> Servite, which was ranked as high as third in the Orange County poll, ended its  season on a five-game losing streak, including a nonleague loss to St. John  Bosco.  </P> <P> "It's going to take a little while before we figure out what happened," McNary  said. "It was sort of like getting hit by a sledgehammer."  </P> <P> When McNary took over the Servite program in 1986, the Friars hadn't made the  playoffs in seven years. But McNary guided Servite to a league championship in  his first year and added another title in 1988.  </P> <P> Servite was on its way to another playoff appearance this season until early  last week, when the Friars lost an extra-inning game against St. Paul. Since  then, McNary couldn't find a way to stop the team's skid.  </P> <P> "There's really no explanation for it," he said. "Our pitchers were giving up  one or two walks a game all year. Then in the last five games, they've been  walking six or seven. And the clutch hits just haven't been coming."  </P> <P> Friday, Servite stranded seven runners in scoring position.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Servite workhorse Cliff Mierendorf (5-4) wobbled through his  roughest start of the season. He staked Bishop Amat to a 5-0 lead, giving up a  two-run homer to Eric White in the first inning and a two-run single to White  in the third.  </P> <P> The Friars rallied to pull within a run by the sixth behind the hitting of Whit  Haydon, Neal Yamamoto and Blaine Patriquin, who each had two hits.  </P> <P> George Garcia (4-1) earned the win in relief of White, who was ejected along  with Servite shortstop Eddie Crippen after a bench-clearing brawl in the  fourth.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating, but the effort was always there," McNary said. "I never had  to sit the kids down and chew them out for not trying. Now we'll just try to  put the pieces back together."  </P></p>

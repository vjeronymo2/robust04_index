			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG GAMES;  </P> <P> CULVER CITY AT CENTENNIAL  </P> <P> Culver tailback John Haqq rushed for 266 yards and three touchdowns last week,  his second straight 200-yard game, and the Centaurs (3-0) trounced Salesian,  39-7. Haqq's touchdowns included runs of 74 and 65 yards.  </P> <P> Haqq's game-breaking runs are a big reason why Culver's fortunes are on the  rise, but quarterback Troy Dunlap took some heat off Haqq with three touchdown  passes,including 32- and 27-yarders to Greg Hooks.  </P> <P> Haqq and Dunlap are also getting plenty of opportunities because Culver's  veteran defense has been stopping opponents. Centaur defenders have one shutout  and have surrendered just a touchdown apiece in two other games.  </P> <P> The Centaurs will open Ocean League play at 7:30 tonight at Centennial (0-3).  </P> <P> Granada Hills at Hamilton  </P> <P> Granada Hills had better hope that Hamilton's Jay Fields still has a sore knee.  There's no telling what running back-kicker Fields may do if he is sound when  Hamilton plays host to the Highlanders at 3 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> Hamilton opened the season with a 42-6 rout of Hollywood, and Fields rushed for  178 yards, scored four touchdowns, including a 43-yarder, and kicked four extra  points.  </P> <P> Granada Hills (2-0) will be a much stiffer test for the Yankees than Hollywood.  The Highlanders have beaten two tough teams, Westchester, 17-14, in their  opener and Franklin, 19-7, last week.  </P> <P> Against Franklin, Highlander running back Brett Washington carried 18 times for  158 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Santa Monica at Torrance  </P> <P> Santa Monica (2-0) has been winning without the best efforts of star running  back Mark Harper, who has been hobbled by an ankle injury. Harper reinjured his  ankle in last week's 24-8 victory over Palisades and is doubtful for the  Vikings' Bay League opener at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Torrance (2-1).  </P> <P> Because Harper has seen limited action, Santa Monica has been passing more  often than usual. Junior quarterback Bob Aylsworth threw two touchdown passes  to Robert Reese against Palisades and has tossed four scoring passes in two  games.  </P> <P> Fairfax at Hollywood  </P> <P> Hollywood ought to consider scheduling its non-league games with teams outside  the neighborhood. Last week the Sheiks were pummeled by Hamilton, 42-6, and  this week they will play host to defending Metro League champion Fairfax at 3  p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> Fairfax is smarting from its season-opening, 20-16, loss to El Camino Real. The  Lions got out to a 16-6 lead against the Conquistadors but could not hold it.  </P> <P> Fairfax running back Mario Mattison made an auspicious debut, rushing for 207  yards on 27 carries and scoring three touchdowns and two 2-point conversions.  </P> <P> Other games today: Venice at Monroe, 3 p.m.; Crenshaw at Granada Hills Kennedy,  7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Other Friday games: Eagle Rock at University, 3 p.m.; Dorsey at San Diego Point  Loma, 3 p.m.; Westchester at El Camino Real, 3 p.m.; Rolling Hills at Beverly  Hills, 3 p.m.; Brentwood at Webb, 3:30 p.m.; Artesia at St. Bernard, 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Saturday games: Daniel Murphy vs. Cathedral at Hollywood High, 1:45 p.m.; St.  Monica at El Segundo, 7:30 p.m. RAY RIPTON  </P></p>

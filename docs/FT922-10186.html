			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: Co-op Bank policy not prescriptive Sir, The Co-operative Bank's ethical policy is not prescriptive. We are offering customers two new rights: the right to know how their money is being used, and the right to express a view on how that money should be invested. All free societies offer individuals the right to choose their own ethics within the law. The Co-operative Bank is describing its ethics utilising customer funds. Frances Walker, consultant to the Co-operative Bank, 2 Ridgmount Street, London WC1E 7AA</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts fall as hopes fade for further reduction in UK interest rates BOND prices fell across Europe yesterday, on fears that the Bundesbank is increasingly unlikely to cut interest rates this year, perpetuating volatility in the foreign exchange markets, as other European currencies in the exchange rate mechanism come under pressure. But gilts were not helped by the floating pound yesterday. Prices dropped as much as  3/4 point, as signs of a potential economic recovery prompted concern that the UK government may not feel the need to cut interest rates any further. The M0 money supply figure for November showed a 3 per cent year-on-year growth. Because there is a strong correlation between M0 (the narrowest definition of money supply) and retail sales, 'the government will view that as a sign that retail sales are starting to pick up,' said Mr John Kendall, an economist at Baring Brothers. The gilt market's main fear is that the scope for further rate cuts may have narrowed, while inflation is more likely to rise. Although the market took fright, it may be too early to read much into the figures. The key will be how much sales rise over the Christmas period, Mr Kendall said. Meanwhile, traders remain nervous ahead of Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 10-year gilts. In when-issued trading, the new partly-paid 10-year issue was quoted yesterday at 21 17/32 , down from 24 when it was announced a week ago. The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 98 1/32 down from 98. THE German market had to absorb more bad economic news yesterday, when engineering orders fell 17 per cent month-on-month in October, led by a 20 per cent decline in foreign orders, reflecting the impact of the strong mark. German bond prices held up better than most, however, ending about  1/4 point down. However, money market rates rose sharply, when call money jumped up to 9 per cent from 8.7 per cent. RISING rates in the German money market fed through into the French market, where three-month rates rose to 10.2 per cent. Bond prices fell  3/8 point, on fears that the franc is set to come under renewed pressure. Sentiment in the Italian bond market is not set to favour an auction of Italian government bonds today. US Treasury prices recovered from early weakness to stand mixed-to-firmer in late trading yesterday despite the release of another strong economic report. In late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/16 at 100 13/32 , yielding 7.585 per cent. The short end of the market was little moved, with the two-year note steady at 99 11/32 , yielding 4.774 per cent. Early hopes that prices would trade firmer in the wake of last week's heavy selling were dashed mid-morning when the Chicago purchasing managers reported that their index of local manufacturing activity had risen from 49.72 in October to 54.22 in November. The Chicago figures were seen as a precursor to a strong report from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which publishes its index of nationwide business activity today. Although the Chicago report initially left Treasuries slightly lower, bargain-buying by retail investors helped securities at both ends of the maturity range recover their early losses.</p>

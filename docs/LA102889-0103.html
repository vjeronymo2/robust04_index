The left-wing Al Hamishmar daily said Mohammed ibn Ahmen  Halebi, 32, of the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp agreed to work for the  Shin Bet in 1985 after serving five years of an 11-year sentence on charges  including drug dealing and prostitution. Almost two weeks ago, authorities  accused him of strangling five women and two men in what police said was a  criminal dispute. Despite a manhunt, Halebi has eluded capture.  </P></p>

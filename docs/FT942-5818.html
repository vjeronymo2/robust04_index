			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gaviria accepts as 'fair' EU banana import plan Mr Cesar Gaviria, the president of Colombia, has said that the European Union's banana import regime is fair to both Latin American and Caribbean exporters, and that this was the reason for his government's acceptance of it despite continuing criticism from some Latin American producers. 'Colombia considered the Lome Convention convenient and good, and understood why Caribbean countries had special access to the European market,' Mr Gaviria told a radio station in Barbados. 'We wanted an agreement with the European Union in relation to bananas. That's why we accepted the EU proposal.' Latin American producers had attacked the EU's import regime which allows duty free access for fruit from traditional suppliers in the Caribbean and other countries in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, while imposing duties on the quota granted Latin exporters. The EU has proposed increasing Latin American imports from 2m tonnes per year to 2.1m tonnes this year, and to 2.2m tonnes next year.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Venables denies Spurs' share deal allegations MR MARK Stephens, a solicitor acting for Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham Hotspur's dismissed chief executive, yesterday fiercely denied allegations made about his client's financial dealings with the football club. Mr Venables, who was dismissed by Mr Alan Sugar, Tottenham's chairman, during the summer, was accused in a special BBC television Panorama programme on Thursday evening of unlawfully raising Pounds 1m for the share deal he did with Mr Sugar when they took over the club. The programme also alleged that an unwarranted Pounds 200,000 fee arising from the sale of Paul Gascoigne, the England footballer, to Lazio, the Italian football club, was given to an associate of Mr Venables. Mr Stephens said the allegations were 'flagrantly untrue, partial and partisan', and he added that his client was considering 'a whole range of options' in response. He claimed the allegations were based on stolen draft documents and working papers 'misappropriated from his (Mr Venables') accountant' which Mr Venables never saw and gave only a 'partial picture'.</p>

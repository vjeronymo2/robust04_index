			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Cooper Clarke back in the black In the eight months to December 31 - its new financial year-end - Cooper Clarke Group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 126,000 on sales of Pounds 13.2m. For the previous full year there were losses of Pounds 274,000 from sales of Pounds 20.8m. Interest payable came to Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 299,000). Earnings per share were 0.8p (losses 2.01p). There is no dividend. The group, which supplies building materials, suffered from the recession particularly in the construction industry. Assets disposals, together with the rights issue, helped cut gearing to 20 per cent. The bad debt charge was held at 1.4 per cent of turnover even with the large single debt from Turriff Construction of Pounds 120,000. Mr Nicholas Jeffrey, chairman, is to leave the board after the annual meeting.</p>

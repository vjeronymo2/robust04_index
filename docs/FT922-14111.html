			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Thai army commander becomes prime minister THAILAND'S army commander, General Suchinda Kraprayoon, who did not stand in last month's general election, was appointed prime minister yesterday as opposition parties and civil rights activists continued their campaign for an elected premier. He pledged to continue with the liberal economic policies of his predecessor, Mr Anand Panyarachun, and to emphasise the role of the private sector. Gen Suchinda, who was de facto leader of last year's coup d'etat, had picked Mr Anand. The constitution allows a non-elected prime minister, but Gen Suchinda will have to resign from military service. Business leaders were generally muted in their reaction to his appointment. They said they were more interested in who would be finance minister and what policies would be adopted. The new premier has yet to appoint his cabinet. Some expressed relief that a two-week impasse over the premiership had ended. Initially the five parties that now back Gen Suchinda had proposed Mr Narong Wongwan, the leader of the largest party. But his candidacy aroused strong opposition because he had been refused entry to the US for alleged associations with drug trafficking. Four opposition parties yesterday reaffirmed their objection to a non-elected premier and vowed they would oppose his appointment.</p>

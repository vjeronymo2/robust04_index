			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu (2799 2182 2976) and </F> XINHUA reporter Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948)]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,  Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, and  other leading comrades of the party Central Committee planted  trees, including the Huashan pine, lacebark pine, and weeping  willows, at the Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park in Beijing's suburbs  this morning. Thus, new trees were planted in this park, which,  known as the garden of 10,000 gardens, has witnessed many  vicissitudes of life.    The first Sunday of April is a voluntary tree-planting day  for all people in the capital. At 1000 in the morning, Jiang  Zemin and other leading comrades of the party Central Committee  arrived at a hill beside the scenic Haiyuekaijin area in the  Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park in the company of Chen Xitong, secretary  of the Beijing municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, Beijing  mayor; and Xu Youfang, minister of forestry. They then planted  the Chinese pine, poplar, and willow trees symbolizing the hope  of the future.    Planting trees with the leading comrades today were 50 Young  Pioneers, who welcomed Jiang Zemin and the other comrades by  saying in unison in their children's voice: "Little pine trees,  grow up quickly with green needles and new branches; you are  nurtured with sunshine and dew, grow up quickly, grow up  quickly...."    General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Chen Xitong  planted a Huashan pine together. Chen Xitong told Jiang Zemin:  "The trees planted by party Central Committee leading comrades  last year are growing luxuriantly." Jiang Zemin smiled and  said: "In planting trees, we are promoting a spirit. The  post-planting management depends completely on park workers, and  we are very grateful to them." Then, Jiang Zemin asked: "How  many trees do we plan to plant today?" Chen Xitong answered:  "Eighty trees, pines and willows."    After planting a tree, Jiang Zemin gladly gave these  reporters an interview. Jiang Zemin said: Planting trees is an  important task that can bring benefits to people of this and  coming generations. We should step up our efforts to publicize  the importance of tree planting and to enhance all citizens'  awareness in this regard. He then said: Through years of  effort, the percentage of forest covering our country has  increased to 13 percent. We have made tremendous achievements  in this respect. Compared with advanced countries, however, we  still lag far behind. So we should persist in planting trees.    While planting trees, Premier Li Peng talked about its  significance. He said: Thanks to more than 10 years of effort,  people in various parts of the country have now attached great  importance to tree planting, and people have enthusiastically  taken part in such activities. As a result, we have scored  gratifying achievements. However, we should also note that  cases of felling trees or even destroying forests have occurred  in some localities. We should step up education in this regard  and manage forests according to law. The tree-planting momentum  is pretty strong in some places, but the survival rate is not  high. This calls for protecting trees and planting more trees  to increase the survival rate. In some localities, a  responsibility system is instituted under which barren hills are  contracted out for tree planting. This practice is worth  popularizing.    While planting trees with a spade, Li Peng inquired about  Beijing Municipality's conditions. He asked Beijing Mayor Li  Qiyan: "What are the price parities between the three different  kinds of stocks issued by Beijing?" Li Qiyan answered: "They  are as low as 1:3 and as high as 1:8." Then Li Peng said:  "People should know that buying stocks involves risks."    Chairman Qiao Shi of the National People's Congress  Standing Committee planted three Huashan pine trees in a row,  without wiping the sweat from his forehead. When he planted a  lacebark pine, two Young Pioneers brought a bucket of water for  the pine. He said "we should plant trees conscientiously."  Discussing environmental protection with comrades from Beijing,  Li Ruihuan said: "Tremendous changes have taken place in  Beijing these years. But there is still much to be done, and it  is all the more necessary to step up work in environmental  protection." Comrades from Beijing believed that environmental  damage is mainly caused by people. Li Ruihuan said: "The  quality of people is crucial. When people's quality is  improved, many things can be done easily."    After planting trees, Jiang Zemin and other comrades wrote  some words of encouragement for children on their notebooks.  Jiang Zemin wrote: "Plant trees and educate people" and  "Yuanmingyuan Park has witnessed many vicissitudes of life." Li  Peng wrote: "Study hard and be a good successor." Li Ruihuan  wrote: "Study well" and "Make progress every day." Li Huaqing  wrote: "Try to be an outstanding student" and "Study well to be  a successor."    Following this, Jiang Zemin and other comrades toured the  Yuanmingyuan Memorial Hall. Jiang Zemin said: Planting trees  at Yuanmingyuan Park today is of great significance. China had  been bullied and humiliated by big powers for some 100 years in  modern times. Since the founding of New China, the Chinese  people have stood up. Yuanmingyuan is called a ruins park, with  a view to letting people see the bitter history of how this  bright pearl of the Eastern culture was ruined by foreign  robbers. This will educate people in patriotism. Now we are  planting trees here and renovating the park because we want  people across the country and foreign friends to see the  development and changes of our country.    Other leading comrades who participated in today's tree  planting included Ding Guangen, Tian Jiyun, Li Lanqing, Li  Tieying, Yang Baibing, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, Wang Hanbin, Ren  Jianxin, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Luo Gan. Early this  morning, more than 180 ministers, vice ministers, and other  leading comrades from departments directly under the party  Central Committee and the State Council and from the three  general departments of the People's Liberation Army and the  Beijing Military Region joined servicemen and people of the  capital in voluntary tree-planting activities.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Timex union issues warning THE NATIONAL leaders of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union yesterday warned extremists not to interfere in the dispute at the Timex factory in Dundee, following violence outside the circuit-board plant that led to 16 arrests on Monday. 'Our message to outsiders is keep out and mind your own business,' said Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary. 'They are exacerbating the dispute and making it more difficult to resolve the problem and save the jobs of our members.' None of the demonstrators who were arrested on Monday belongs to the union or works at Timex, the US-owned multinational. Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU's president, added: 'An extreme reaction by an employer has attracted extremists who are not part of our union. We want to find a negotiated settlement and we reject the development that has take place. Our members have obeyed the law.' The strike - now in its fifth week - was sparked by the dismissal of all the Timex manual workers by the company after a number of them, who had been in dispute for 21 days over proposals for cuts in benefits, a pay freeze and job cuts, had agreed to go back to work under protest. A substitute workforce is being hired. Mr John Major, the prime minister, also condemned the demonstrators. He said during question time that 'rent-a-picket' was back, and this was 'not in the interest of workers at Timex'. He said strikers 'had always faced the risk of being sacked without the right to claim unfair dismissal'. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

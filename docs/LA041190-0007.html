			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT ON MERGER PLAN STIRS CONCERN IN SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> SMOG: THE JOINING OF EDISON AND SAN DIEGO GAS &amp; ELECTRIC COULD INCREASE  POLLUTION IN L.A. AND HAVE AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON ITS SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR'S  SKIES, THE STUDY CONCLUDES.  </P> <P> City administrators and air quality officials here expressed concern Tuesday  about a state report saying that if San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. merges  with Southern California Edison Corp., Los Angeles' pollution could have an  immediate effect on San Diego's skies.  </P> <P> The draft environmental impact report, released by the state Public Utilities  Commission on Monday, found that the merger would significantly increase Los  Angeles' smog. The increase in pollution, however, could be offset in part by  using San Diego-area power plants when smog alerts forced a slowdown at plants  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, bridled at the  implied linking of San Diego's and Los Angeles' fate. The use of San Diego as a  backstop, he said, would place the city where it doesn't want to be -- squarely  in the shadow of its larger and more polluted northern neighbor.  </P> <P> "This has long been a fight for local control over our utility's future. But  this takes it a step further and links us environmentally to what's happening  in L.A.," Downey said. "Basically, San Diego would become a suburb of Los  Angeles and would be subjected to the whims of (Edison's) bureaucrats sitting  up in Rosemead. It's saying, 'If L.A. has a smoggy day, so will San Diego.' "  </P> <P> Downey was among several politicians and air quality advocates in San Diego and  Los Angeles who expressed renewed opposition Tuesday to the proposed  $2.5-billion merger, which would create the nation's largest utility company  with 4.8 million customers.  </P> <P> Some agencies, including the South Coast Air Quality Management District,  reserved comment until they could fully examine the 900-page report. But others  said the report's highlights alone supported their worst fears.  </P> <P> Bob Goggin, a spokesman for the San Diego County air pollution control  district, agreed with Downey. He said that permits issued to San Diego plants  in the 1970s would allow them to burn dirtier fuels -- oil instead of natural  gas. In addition, Goggin said, San Diego plants operate at only 38% of the  capacity they are allowed. If a merger took place, Goggin said, Edison could  legally stoke up San Diego's plants to full capacity on smoggy Los Angeles  days.  </P> <P> "If that were to take place," Goggin said, "it would require tighter  restriction on other industry. It lays it on everybody else."  </P> <P> Edison officials deny that this could happen, arguing that it is in their own  economic interest to boost operations at Los Angeles plants, not at the older,  less efficient San Diego plants.  </P> <P> "Oil is more costly than gas, so we wouldn't use oil instead of gas if gas were  available," said Lewis M. Phelps, a vice president at Edison, who said San  Diego plants "would never have to run more than they do now." He repeated his  claim that the merger would be "environmentally positive."  </P> <P> Tom Soto, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based Coalition for Clean Air,  disagreed. He said a merger would be "a disaster" for Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "It's very inconsistent with local policy and it's certainly inconsistent with  the goals of the 20-year plan," Soto said, referring to the far-reaching clean  air plan that aims to bring the four-county Los Angeles Basin into compliance  with federal standards by 2007.  </P></p>

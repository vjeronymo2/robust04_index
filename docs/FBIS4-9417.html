			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Warsaw, 23 Apr--Opening the convention of the  Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland [SdRP] in Warsaw on  Saturday, party leader Aleksander Kwasniewski outlined its most  important tasks: the stabilization of the state, economic  development and integration with European structures on a  partnership basis, decentralization, and self-government reform.    He said: We should understand Polish democracy as a  democracy of compromise and not of conflict, as many of the  president's advisers put it. The SdRP can be one of the authors  of the new constitution. We must fight for economic  development. It is inadmissable for left-wing governments to be  associated with inflation and to lead to economic chaos.    Kwasniewski acknowledged that a positive aspect of the  government coalition's activity had been the breaking of the  stereotype that the coalition's creation would mean a departure  from reforms and that it would continue Poland's international  isolation. The government has been successful, according to the  SdRP leader's assessment, in building a market economy, where  economic actions are not isolated from social processes.    In the campaign before the local self-government elections  and the struggle for authorship of the reforms, Kwasniewski  expects the SdRP to be attacked by both the right wing and the  central-liberal groupings, as well as by the media, whose  attention is focused on the weaknesses and setbacks of his  party.

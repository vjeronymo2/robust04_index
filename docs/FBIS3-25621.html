			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] A rebel group attacked Arlit early this morning,  precisely at 0420. The attackers, whose number could not be  determined, killed two soldiers and took six four-wheel drive  vehicles belonging to the Akokan Mining Company. During the hot  pursuit launched shortly after the attack, the defense and  security forces recovered two vehicles. We got this report a  while ago from our permanent correspondent in Agadez, Mousselai  Nazadane.    This is the first rebel attack since the last technical  meeting held in Ouagadougou. Following that meeting, the  coordination of the four Tuareg rebel movements published its  political agenda in the form of a document entitled, "Outline of  the Resistance Program." In a nutshell, the rebels are claiming  their right to autonomous administration of the territory they  claim a right to, and guarantees that their community will be  represented in the government, the National Assembly, and the  Armed Forces. These are the fundamental demands of the rebels  as published by the NIGER NEWS AGENCY. [passage omitted]</p>

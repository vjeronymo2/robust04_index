			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DELTA LOSES APPEAL IN BATTLE WITH FLIGHT ATTENDANTS UNION  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling that airlines say could make it  more difficult for them to merge.  </P> <P> The court, without comment, refused to shield Delta Air Lines from binding  arbitration that could lead to a monetary damages award for a flight attendants  union.  </P> <P> The case stems from Delta's acquisition of Western Airlines in 1986.  </P> <P> Western agreed in 1984 that, should it merge, the Assn. of Flight Attendants  would continue to represent Western employees in any newly formed company.  </P> <P> Delta's flight attendants were not unionized, and Delta did not honor Western's  union contract. The union sought arbitration to retain its status as bargaining  agent or to win a damage award.  </P> <P> A federal judge threw out the union's complaint. But the U.S. Circuit Court of  Appeals here reinstated it last July.  </P> <P> Airline industry groups said the appeals court decision "creates uncertainty  and unpredictability" for the future of mergers.  </P></p>

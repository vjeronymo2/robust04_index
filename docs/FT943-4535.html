'We've had three years of tough grind,' said Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive, 'and our market shrank by 25 per cent. Now we are seeing the investment we've made paying off.' The UK performance of both divisions - distribution and rentals - was singled out, though progress had also been made in France. Group turnover grew to Pounds 74.1m, against Pounds 71.2m which included Pounds 5.05m from discontinued activities. Earnings per share topped 9p for the first time since the first half of 1990, advancing 41 per cent to 9.7p (6.9p), However the interim dividend is held at 4.5p. The shares closed up 5p at 365p. The group was ungeared at the period-end and had enjoyed good cashflow. Mr Ffoulkes-Jones said there was 'not a lot available in our specific area' on the acquisitions front, but Brammer was looking in Germany, Spain and the Benelux countries. In the distribution division, operating profits grew 27 per cent to Pounds 5.25m on turnover up 11 per cent at Pounds 60.2m. Within that profits at BSL, the power transmission distribution business, rose 28 per cent. Sales at reorganised Roulement Service increased 18 per cent in the French market, which grew by only 5 per cent. On the rental side profits more than doubled to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 837,000).</p>

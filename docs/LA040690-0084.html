			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> RIO SCHOOLS SECURE NEW WATER SUPPLY  </P> <P> The Rio Elementary School District Board has declared an emergency and moved to  secure a permanent supply of drinkable water after a well supplying one school  was found to contain alarming levels of nitrates.  </P> <P> The district last week shut off drinking fountains at Rio Del Valle Junior High  School and brought in bottled drinking water.  </P> <P> Board members Wednesday decided to tap into a United Water District mainline at  an estimated cost of $20,000.  </P> <P> "We know that high nitrate is damageable to children younger than 6 months, but  we have nothing indicating damage to children 6 months and older," Rio School  District Supt. John McGarry said.  </P> <P> Nitrate levels in water samples were 95 milligrams in a first round of tests  and 122 when a second round of tests was done last month. Nitrate levels should  not exceed 45 milligrams per liter, according to state standards, McGarry said.  </P> <P> McGarry said the cost for bottled water has been more than $30 a day.  </P> <P> "We trust the state when they say 45 milligrams is the maximum," McGarry said.  "It is time to take precautions and not put our children at risk."  </P> <P> Construction of the water hookup will begin on April 9 and is expected to be  completed by the beginning of May.

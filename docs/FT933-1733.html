			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Telecom stake sold for NZDollars 592m FOUR leading New Zealand businessmen - Sir Michael Fay, Mr David Richwhite, Mr Alan Gibbs and Mr Trevor Farmer - yesterday sold 155m shares in Telecom Corporation for NZDollars 592m (USDollars 213.4m). They had been granted options to buy a 10 per cent stake in the company by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech when the two US telephone companies acquired Telecom in 1989 for NZDollars 4.25bn. Yesterday the four men, acting through their private investment companies, exercised the options, paying the US companies NZDollars 1.82 a share. The shares were immediately sold for NZDollars 3.82. Sir Michael and Mr Richwhite's private company, Midavia Holdings, sold 87.5m shares. Freightways' subsidiary, Rontas, controlled by Mr Gibbs and Mr Farmer, sold 67.5m shares. This reduced Bell Atlantic and Ameritech's shareholdings to under 49.9 per cent, the level they had agreed when they bought the company from the the New Zealand government.</p>

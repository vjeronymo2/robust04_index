			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> East German leader Erich Honecker said President Bush's proposal for a  reduction in conventional arms in Europe is a welcome step that is in tune with  Warsaw Pact desires for speedy negotiations, according to an interview with the  Washington Post. However, Honecker rejected Bush's call for the Berlin Wall to  be torn down, although he said his government wants "to humanize the border  regime" as part of generally improving relations with Western Europe and the  United States. The paper quoted Honecker as confirming that East German border  guards have been ordered not to use deadly force to stop civilians who attempt  to flee into West Germany unless the guards are threatened by the attempt.  </P></p>

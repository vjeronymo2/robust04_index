			<p>Peru's   Antidrug Effort   <F P=102> PY1406191894 Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 7  Jun 94 Free Zone Section p 1 </F>  <F P=103> PY1406191894 </F> <F P=104>  Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] While thousands of people were arriving in Florida  [department] to participate in the San Cono pilgrimage, an  enormous truck carrying a bulky cargo arrived at the Florida  Free Zone [near the town of Piedra Alta]. It was carrying the  first prefabricated Russian helicopter to arrive here. The  helicopter will be meticulously assembled in the customs area.    The Ka-32 helicopter, which was used by the Soviet Army  during the invasion of Afghanistan, is now being offered to  several governments because of its excellent maneuverability and  efficiency.    Imaribo S.A., headed by George Bitar and Alex  Grebenchtchykov, has negotiated the sale of several of these  helicopters to South American countries.    To improve the operation, the enterprise is installed within  the Florida Free Zone, where the helicopters will be fully  assembled by seven Russian engineers who will reside in the city  of Piedra Alta.    Luis Calachi is in charge of the free zone. He told EL  OBSERVADOR that each helicopters costs $2.5 million and that  Imaribo S.A. intends to build an assembly plant in the free zone  to assemble the helicopters that are sold in this region of  America.    The container in which these helicopters are shipped is the  size of six 20-foot containers. The first arrived on 3 June and  was escorted by Transport and Public Works Ministry officials.    The Ka-32 marked a new stage in the development and  manufacturing of helicopters in Russia. This version is used to  transport cargo in its hold and its outside winch can be used in  the construction, mounting, and stringing of electricity power  lines. This helicopter is also useful for ocean oil rigs,  salvage operations, and to transport sick people.    The helicopter that arrived on 3 June has already been sold  to Peru. This unit may be used in the fight against drug  trafficking or against the Shining Path organization. The  Uruguayan Army supplied a crane to help unload the container.    This type of helicopter can be assembled in three days.  Other containers are due to arrive in Florida because sales  have been made to other countries in the region.</p>

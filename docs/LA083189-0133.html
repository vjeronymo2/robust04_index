			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL ON AESTHETICS OF COVERING RESERVOIRS PASSES SENATE PANEL  </P> <P> A Senate committee on Wednesday approved legislation requiring water officials  to take into consideration secondary benefits -- such as recreation, scenery  and aesthetics -- when considering whether to cover storage reservoirs.  </P> <P> The legislation, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los  Angeles), was prompted by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's  proposal to cover several reservoirs. The department's aim was to prevent water  evaporation and to meet new federal and state water quality standards.  </P> <P> Roos wants to build a home on a hillside lot he owns that has a commanding view  of Silverlake Reservoir -- one of those that could be covered. But the  assemblyman told the committee he does not have a conflict of interest,  according to a legislative counsel's opinion saying he would not benefit any  more materially than any of his neighbors under his bill.  </P> <P> A 7-4 vote sent the measure from the Appropriations Committee to the Senate  floor after it was amended to exempt cities and water districts in all counties  except Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego. The measure already has passed the  Assembly.  </P> <P> The bill was supported by Ray Howell of the Committee to Preserve Lake  Silverlake, who argued that it was "premature" for the reservoir to be covered.  </P> <P> Opposition came from Jerry Jordan of the California Municipal Utilities Assn.,  who said "there may be no economic alternative other than covering reservoirs"  to meet new state and federal water quality standards expected later in the  year.  </P></p>

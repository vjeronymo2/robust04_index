			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Ministers' decision to widen ERM bands provides lift EUROPE'S government bond markets roared ahead yesterday as the decision by European Community finance ministers at the weekend to widen the currency fluctuation bands of the European exchange rate mechanism was seen as paving the way for interest rate cuts across the continent. Market participants are hoping to see interest rates slashed as governments attempt to inject new life into the recession-hit economies of Europe, although yesterday saw no sudden moves to ease. 'I expect the central banks will wait for some of the foreign exchange dust to settle before cutting rates,' said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg Securities. Among the higher-yielding bond markets, Italy showed very strong gains, with the Liffe futures contract jumping nearly two points during the day - from Friday's close of 106.12 to a high of 107.90 yesterday - on expectations of an easing. The market took heart from remarks by Mr Antonio Fazio, the central bank governor, that the EC currency accord had removed an obstacle to lower rates. Spanish government bonds shot higher and gained over a point on the day. Dealers said the market would be paying close attention to today's repo tender to see whether the Bank of Spain cuts its 11 per cent key money rate. FRENCH government bond prices ended the day sharply higher even though the Banque de France left its key interest rates alone, giving market participants the clear impression that the central bank will not rush to cut interest rates. 'It's more likely that the central bank will wait for the markets to calm down and stabilise before it cuts interest rates,' said one dealer. The French franc held up fairly well in the foreign exchange markets and as bond prices rallied the yield on the 10-year OAT fell below the equivalent yield on German government debt. GERMAN government bonds gained a quarter-point yesterday, underperforming other European bond markets but still benefiting from the market's safe-haven status. Mr Schlesinger's remarks yesterday that the Bundesbank would allow call money rates to fall below the discount rate were seen as indicating that the repo rate will shift lower. Dealers reported good buying of medium-dated and 10-year bunds as the Bundesbank's refusal to cave in and cut interest rates - even at a time of crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism - served to lift confidence in the central bank's long-term commitment to defeating inflation. Details of a new 10-year bund issue are expected today. UK government bonds ended little changed as investors switched their attention to continental Europe. The index-linked sector made the strongest gains on hopes of a fall in real yields across Europe. US TREASURY prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday as the bond market kept a close eye on passage of President Bill Clinton's budget package. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 107 3/8 , yielding 6.554 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.184 per cent. The day's main economic news - a slight increase in the National Association of Purchasing Management's July index of economic activity - was in line with expectations, and had little impact on market sentiment. Attention was otherwise firmly fixed on Congress, where Mr Clinton was making last-minute efforts to ensure his budget was passed by lawmakers this week. Treasury investors are keen to see the budget passed. This is primarily because they view it as the first serious attempt by a US government to tackle the large federal budget deficit. Any sign that Mr Clinton's budget might fall at the final hurdle, therefore, could unsettle bond prices. JAPANESE government bonds surged ahead as the strength of the yen against the dollar and other currencies continued to fuel hopes of a cut in the official discount rate. The yen touched a new high on Friday of 104.25 to the dollar, and traded at around 104.75 to the dollar yesterday. The September futures contract, which opened at 110.98, reached a high of 111.42 before ending Tokyo trading at 111.30. In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 issue ended the day at 4.155 per cent, having traded in a range of 4.135 and 4.175 per cent.</p>

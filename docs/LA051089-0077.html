			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TICKET WRITERS WARY OF ASBESTOS IN BUILDING  </P> <P> Concerns over asbestos in the Hollywood headquarters of Los Angeles' parking  enforcement division resulted in a brief work stoppage Tuesday morning as  officers and management debated whether to take roll call indoors or outdoors.  </P> <P> After a two-hour standstill, supervisors agreed to take roll call outdoors and  sent the 6:30 a.m. shift of 17 parking officers on their morning rounds of  ticket writing. Pay was not docked, said Kaye Beechum, the city's parking  enforcement manager.  </P> <P> Supervisors and city occupational safety officials maintain that the building  at 6601 W. Santa Monica Boulevard is safe to occupy despite the discovery of  asbestos hazards in the basement and a ground-floor room of the building last  September.  </P> <P> "Officers just got fed up," said one parking enforcement officer who declined  to give his name. "We're willing to work. We just don't want to go inside the  building."  </P> <P> City supervisors in the Hollywood headquarters had tried to persuade the  morning officers to come indoors since the dispute over roll call arose last  Thursday. Management resorted to direct orders Tuesday "because the building is  safe," Beechum said.  </P> <P> Supervisors intend to take roll call inside the building today, Beechum said.  Management is hopeful that another round of tests for asbestos fiber in the air  will persuade officers that the hazard, if any, is limited to the basement and  ground-floor room. Those rooms are now off-limits, posted with signs that read  "Danger" and note the risk of cancer and lung disease from asbestos fibers.  </P> <P> "When people see a sign like this, they tend to get nervous," said Kenneth P.  Sobel, chief of the city's occupational safety office.  </P> <P> Sobel and an inspector installed two air sampling pumps in the building Tuesday  morning to repeat earlier tests that he said had found no asbestos fibers in  the building's air, including the rooms posted as off-limits. Those rooms were  declared off-limits to avoid the possibility of a disturbance that might cause  asbestos dust, Sobel said.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Defence minister sees scope to cut more More cuts can be made in spending on the armed forces without reducing Britain's overall defence capability, Viscount Cranborne, junior defence minister, told the Lords last night, Ivor Owen writes. He said work on the latest defence costs study had been in progress for three months, and it was hoped to make the outcome known by July. Lord Cranborne rejected demands by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers, supported by Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the Defence Staff from the cross-benches, for a full defence review. The minister insisted that such a review would be 'irrelevant' at a time when events were moving so swiftly. He reaffirmed that the defence of British territory, including the Falkland Islands, was the first priority of the government's defence policy. Lord Bramall warned that studies made with the objective of securing financial savings and very little else were no way to get 'the right answer'.</p>

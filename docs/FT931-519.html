			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Lift-truck sales show 25% boost SALES OF lift trucks and other warehouse equipment have risen by 25 per cent year-on-year in the last four months, raising hopes that the three-year recession in the UK materials handling industry is over. The British Industrial Truck Association said that some 5,000 units were sold in the four months from November to February. Warehousing equipment sales have been particularly strong in the food industry because of the trend towards third-party distribution. But even the counterbalanced trucks used widely in manufacturing industry saw sales rise by 15 per cent to 20 per cent. Mr Graham Lovatt, vice-president for marketing at Hyster Europe and a senior official in the truck association, said yesterday that the sector's UK sales rose 1 per cent to 2 per cent last year to 15,000 units, compared with an overall fall of 10 per cent for Europe. Even so, the UK market is still a long way short of its 1988 peak of 25,000 units. Mr Tony de Mesquita, the association's president and director for external affairs at Lansing-Linde, said there was a 'massive' oversupply of equipment, and margins were negligible because of price discounting. The lift-truck industry is cautious about predicting an end of the recession because of recent 'false dawns' but the upturn over the four months to February does appear to mirror a rise in confidence generally among the industry's customers. Mr Mesquita said domestic conditions, notably the UK's low inflation rate and interest rates, looked reasonable for recovery but export opportunities were being severely affected by the downturn in the rest of Europe, which would get worse before it got better. In the first two months of this year, UK sales of counterbalanced trucks rose 22 per cent whereas, Mr Lovatt said, sales in Germany and France fell by 30 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. Although the present recession has not been as severe as that suffered by the industry a decade ago, when sales dropped by nearly 50 per cent, it has lasted longer. The UK now accounts for just 10 per cent of the European market, compared with 15 per cent at the 1988 peak.</p>

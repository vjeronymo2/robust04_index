The AD SR, headed by former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko,  former aide of Premier Vladimir Meciar and currently his radical  opponent, called on the opposition to make another attempt to  pass the constitutional law on early elections.    Two recent attempts failed as it was not able to obtain the  90 votes necessary for this.    "The political crisis in Slovakia is intensifying, while the  latest steps by the governing forces are jeopardising the  long-term economic and political interests of the country," says  the appeal by the leadership of the AD SR which has eight  deputies in the 150-member Slovak Parliament.    The AD SR considers the referendum on the the loss of  mandates of the deputies who left their parties during the  electoral term to be unconstitutional.    The AD SR call assured that if the current government is  dismissed, it would support a broad coalition government which  would lead Slovakia to the early elections which should be held,  according to the AD SR, in autumn.</p>

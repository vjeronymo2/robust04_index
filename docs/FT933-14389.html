			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (5): Take an international spin - Roads, air services and Birmingham's infrastructure have improved BIRMINGHAM promotes itself as a 'truly international city' at the heart of a economically reviving West Midlands region. What exactly does this mean? Mr Bob Moore is a former banker who is now the chief executive of Birmingham 2000, a pressure group representing 250 companies in Birmingham. It wants to develop Birmingham as a business centre on a European and world-wide basis. Mr Moore says: 'The West Midlands is attempting to revive economically by attracting new investment in industry. If we are to further this, we have to make Birmingham a city to which foreign businessmen want to come and work. We must have the full range of professional services and cultural attractions, so that potential investors do not feel they have to operate out of London. That is what we mean by creating an international city.' The West Midlands has been successful in attracting nearly 900 foreign companies in the past decade to places such as Telford, Redditch, Coventry and Birmingham. The attraction has been partly the perception of a skilled workforce, partly the assistance on offer; but mostly, the good location. The West Midlands is at the heart of Britain's motorway network. The opening of the final stretch of the M40 motorway from Oxford to Birmingham in jan 1991 eased the pressure on the M1. The 27-mile northern relief road will be a privately-run toll road) will provide motorists with an alternative to the heavily congested Midlands section of the M6, from junction 4 at Coleshill to junction 11 at Laney Green. The motorway infrastructure has also meant the development of a distribution/warehouse nexus in the so-called 'golden triangle' of the M6, M1 and M42/A42. From this area, 75 per cent of the UK population can be served within a 4 hour drive time, according to Chesterton. the estate agent. This makes it ideal as a national distribution centre; the warehouses of Toys R Us, Asda, Toyota and Jacobs are in the area. The city of Birmingham has improved its internal infrastructure. Mr Alan Wenban-Smith, assistant director of planning at the city council, says: 'It was obvious to us in the 1970s that the city centre was letting us down.' An inner-ring road had acted as a straitjacket around a tiny city centre. The city council has managed to bring break open the straitjacket by lowering the road and building a pedestrian bridge linking the civic centre of the city with Centenary Square and the International Convention Centre. Elsewhere, around the inner ring road, pedestrian crossings have slowed the traffic down. You can now walk from Centenary square through the civic quarter, past the library and museum, as far as the newly pedestrian precinct of New Street, passing a number of bistros and wine bars on the way. The effect of breaking open the road has created a bigger city centre which includes the Jewellery quarter, the Gunsmiths' quarter, and the Chinese quarter and Markets area. Some of the factories in these areas have been turned into offices for the hundreds of bank workers, accountants and lawyers who have moved to the city during the past decade. But the centrepiece of Birmingham's refurbishment so far has been the International Convention Centre (ICC) and the related National Indoor Arena behind it. The ICC grew out of the National Exhibition Centre (NEC), close to the airport on the outskirts of Birmingham. The NEC is owned and financed by the city council. In 1991-92 116 exhibitions were held there, and the NEC Arena staged over 100 concerts. The NEC is managed, on behalf of the city council, through an agency agreement to which the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce is a party. It has been consistently profitable and in the 1992-93 financial year made a contribution to Birmingham city council's fund of Pounds 11.64m after all its operating and financial charges. This profitability enabled the the management company to raise loans to finance the ICC and the indoor arena. The ICC cost Pounds 180m to build, with some Pounds 50m coming from the European Regional Development Fund. The ICC has held 600 conferences and conventions in its eleven halls since it opened two years ago. It is the home of a 2,200-seat concert hall, where the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra gives some 60 concerts a year. It does not make an operating profit (it lost several million pounds in 1991-92). But it has become the showpiece for the city's cultural and business life and it has stimulated the building of several first class hotels, notably the Hyatt. The spend in these hotels was put at Pounds 16m in 1991-92. Birmingham still has a bad traffic problem. City planners have decided that there is not enough road capacity for all the traffic seeking to use it. The cost of congestion to the West Midlands economy has been put at Pounds 500m a year. A metro or tram system is thought to be the solution. Metro Midland Line 1 will run from Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton. The capital cost will be Pounds 100m, some of it coming from the government, some from the EC. Part would come from the private sector. A second line from the city centre out to the airport is costed at Pounds 250m, and plans for a third line are well advanced. It was hoped that work could start in 1994, but Birmingham will have to wait. The starting date is now likely to be 1996. Birmingham's international airport has not matched Manchester airport's growth - partly because Birmingham is that much closer to London, but also because civil aviation policy specified the growth of Manchester as England's largest airport. But Birmingham airport has expanded rapidly. It now handles nearly 4m passengers and serves 37 destinations in the UK, Europe and the US. Mr Bob Taylor, managing director of Birmingham International Airport says: 'Business travellers found it easy to go the London airports if they wanted to fly to the US. I feel a landmark was reached in March when BA started its daily flight from Birmingham to New York. 'We are not trying to keep up with Manchester, but I feel more and more business people will want to use Birmingham as a starting point.'</p>

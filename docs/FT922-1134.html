			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Refreshing parts of Europe that are out of reach: Dutch brewery chief campaigns for a federal 'Eurotopia' divided into 75 states MR Freddie Heineken, the eponymous chairman of the Dutch brewery group, has come up with a plan to refresh parts of Europe many politicians can't reach, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. He is trying to persuade Europe to convert itself into a federation of 75 states, each with a population of no more than 10m people. 'Eurotopia', as Mr Heineken calls his plan, would be modelled loosely on the US and involve the break-up of most big countries into more manageable parts. France would be split up into seven states, including a state of 'Ile-de-France' for the Paris region. The British Isles would be dissolved into 10 states. The new state of 'Mercia', with Birmingham as its capital, would take its name from an early medieval kingdom. Greater London would form the nucleus of the state of 'Essex'. More controversially, the UK province of Northern Ireland would join the Irish Republic. Mr Heineken, the flamboyant industrialist for whom a ransom of Pounds 7.2m was paid after he was kidnapped in 1983, has a flair for marketing and advertising. He concedes that his ideas, contained in a 17-page report published yesterday, are bound to be met with amazement. But the time has come to rethink Europe. 'The present set-up of nations is in many ways just as arbitrary as my ideas may seem,' he writes. 'Not only in Yugoslavia do we see movements for independence, but also in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Catalonian regions, the Basque country, Middle Europe and so on.' The Heineken group, which Mr Heineken ran until he retired to the supervisory board in 1989, is used to thinking of Europe in terms other than that of the nation state. The company has traditionally differentiated between the beer-drinking culture of the north and the wine-drinking belt of the Mediterranean south, where it invested heavily in the 1980s. The only areas to emerge whole from Mr Heineken's reshaping of Europe are Portugal and the Nordic countries. Even the Netherlands, with its population of 15m, would be split in two. The 75 states in 'Eurotopia' should form a federation with common foreign, defence and monetary policies, Mr Heineken says. Tiny Monaco and Liechtenstein would 'be non-voting member-states of the new Europe, not unlike the District of Columbia in the United States.' He acknowledges that details - such as the future of royalty - need to be worked out: 'There is even scope to reassign some royal families presently without a formal role to be heads of newly formed regions,' he says, citing the states of 'Hannover,' 'Burgundy' and Navarre-Aragon</p>

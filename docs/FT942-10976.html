			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The Long View: The neutral zone Now the squeeze is on in earnest. Gilt-edged yields rose to 8 1/4 per cent at one stage this week. This, if you believe in the government's central inflation target of 2 1/2 per cent or less (apparently few do), implies a real long-term interest rate of almost 6 per cent. UK equities yield only around 3.7 per cent, and are wilting under the competition. Domestically the local government elections have not helped, by providing a reminder of John Major's frailty. With another month of Tory tensions to come, ahead of the elections for the European Parliament, the political background is not going to get any easier. Michael Portillo's sneers at the single European currency have served to emphasise just why sterling tends to move with the dollar rather than the D-Mark and the other continental currencies. In the midst of a developing dollar crisis, sterling may be a sideshow, but one where casual passers-by are tempted to knock off a coconut or two. New readers start here. Last year the Bank of England eagerly sold Pounds 14bn worth of gilts to foreigners as yields tumbled from 9 to 6 1/2 per cent. Most of those foreigners were feeding off a bond market bubble created by the US Federal Reserve which was pumping unlimited quantities of dollars at 3 per cent into the global financial system. Now the Fed is cranking up interest rates and the bubble has burst. All bond markets around the world are in disarray but gilts have suffered worse than any other major national market: yields on 10-year German bunds, for instance, have only risen by 90 basis points (hundredths of a per cent) since the beginning of the year against 210 basis points on 10-year gilts (and 130 basis points on US Treasuries). An important reason is that after years of relatively high inflation and much better equity returns there are few substantial domestic buyers of sterling bonds: private individuals by and large do not buy them, and nor do pension funds, which bought only Pounds 2.7bn out of Pounds 50bn issued in 1993. Memo to Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England: Urgent discussions should be held with the Department of Social Security, now finalising a White Paper embracing many of the recommendations of last year's Goode Committee Report on pension law reform. This could be a heaven-sent opportunity to impose a really tough minimum solvency standard on pension funds, forcing them to buy more gilts. Another reason for the colly-wobbles in the gilt market is that there are ominous signs of the onset of an old-fashioned sterling crisis; already sterling has softened by 3 per cent so far this year, in terms of its trade-weighted index. The UK is cyclically out of step with its main trading partners in continental Europe, leading to strength in imports but weakness in exports, and the monthly visible trade gap appears to be running at more than Pounds 1bn. Meanwhile three-month sterling interest rates offer no premium over continental rates at about 5 1/4 per cent, and although there is still a margin over three-month dollar rates of just under 4 1/2 per cent, this may not last for long. The dollar, after all, has its own big problems. Another rescue effort was mounted by the mainr central banks this week as the beleaguered US currency threatened to crash down through the 100 yen level. Whereas Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, appears to have had in mind a leisurely timetable for raising short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point at a time, the recent pressure on the dollar must have added some urgency to the promised transition from monetary permissiveness to what Greenspan has unspecifically referred to as a 'neutral' stance. What does neutrality mean here? Many economists believe that a 5 per cent Federal funds rate would be a reasonable target (the current 3 3/4 per cent rate is expected to rise at least to 4 per cent around the time of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting on May 17). But according to David Shaw, investment strategist at Legal &amp; General, an analysis of the last five US business cycles extending back to 1960 shows that a neutral ratio for the growth rate of nominal GDP to the three-month dollar interest rate has been 1.15. Given that nominal GDP is likely to grow by about 7 per cent over the next year, a three-month interest rate of 6 per cent is indicated by mid-1995 (equivalent to a Fed funds rate of perhaps 5 1/2 per cent). Moreover, later in the economic cycle the Fed is likely to tighten its policy further. Japan and Germany will be able to brush aside these coming rises in US interest rates. Their recent common problem has been the excessive strength of their currencies against the dollar. But the UK, unable to survive within the European exchange rate mechanism, could be in a quite different position. Traditionally, sterling drifts somewhere in between the dollar and the D-Mark, and the present cyclical position of the UK economy suggests that the dollar will have a stronger pull in the near term. Only a sharp and unexpected improvement in the UK's balance of payments would avoid the need for some tough decisions on interest rates later this year. Running deficits can be fun when they are easy to finance, but foreign creditors tend to have their own agenda. While chancellor Kenneth Clarke was trying to loosen monetary policy in February the turmoil in the gilt-edged market was imposing a new squeeze which resulted, for instance, in a jump in fixed mortgage rates. John Major may want to reflect on the paradox that although Japanese governments and prime ministers come and go the yen goes on strengthening regardless. On the basis of the markets' reaction to the election results yesterday, Major's fall would certainly not be viewed with any great alarm.</p>

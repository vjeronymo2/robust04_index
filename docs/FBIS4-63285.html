			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Thirty minutes ago we telephoned Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov and asked him to comment on the situation.    [Begin Meshkov recording] The situation in Crimea is calm.  The attempts to influence our peace from outside are continuing  with increasing intensity. The aim of these operations  sanctioned by the present Kiev administration is to wreck the  elections for Ukrainian president by provoking a conflict  between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, and [word  indistinct] the elimination of statehood and the executive  authority structures in the hope that we will lose our nerve as  a result of these provocations. We will respond, as Leonid  Makarovich [Kravchuk] himself said, in a fitting way to your  stupidity. [end recording]</p>

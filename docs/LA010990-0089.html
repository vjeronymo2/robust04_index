			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADICAL CHANGES EXPECTED IN EAST BLOC TRADING GROUP;  </P> <P> TRADING: MEMBER NATIONS OF COMECON ARE DEMANDING AN END TO OUTDATED AND  INEFFICIENT AGREEMENTS.  </P> <P> Member nations of the Soviet-led trading group Comecon begin a crucial two-day  meeting here today that is expected to radically alter both the form and role  of the organization, which has come to symbolize the economic failures of  Communist central planning.  </P> <P> New, reform-minded governments in several East European countries have demanded  an end to the fossilized trading arrangements and other restrictions that have  dominated Comecon and strangled growth virtually since its inception 40 years  ago.  </P> <P> If the group does decide to liberalize, it would almost certainly free its  members to increase trade with the West.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia's new finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, last week even suggested  that the organization be scrapped completely. However, he later backed away  from the comment, and on the eve of the Sofia meeting none of Comecon's nine  other members have openly supported outright abolition.  </P> <P> In many ways, the current meeting is intended to bring economic realities in  the region more in line with political change that has transformed the nations  of Eastern Europe from a group of obedient Communist satellites of the Soviet  Union to independent, almost democratic countries with free-market aspirations.  </P> <P> Senior Soviet officials have also indicated the need to reform Comecon, which  is formally named the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or CMEA.  </P> <P> In addition to the Soviet Union and the six East European countries of Poland,  Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria, Comecon also  includes Mongolia, Cuba and Vietnam, although the three non-European members  play only a minor role.  </P> <P> "It has become old and should be replaced by a new structure," Sergel Ouganov,  a member of the Soviet advance delegation to the meeting, told reporters here  last week.  </P> <P> Officials in Hungary and Poland, in addition to those in the Soviet Union, have  talked of scrapping the basic underpinnings of Comecon, including such features  as integrated five-year economic plans with in-built specialization (where one  country produces the lion's share of a product for the entire bloc); barter  arrangements; unrealistic, arbitrary pricing, and the use of the so-called  convertible ruble as a common unit of account -- a unit that neither exists as  a currency nor is convertible.  </P> <P> Increasingly powerful reformist sentiments in Eastern Europe see such a system  as obsolete, frequently counterproductive and occasionally nonsensical.  </P> <P> These reformists, including the new crop of free-market government ministers in  key countries, also view Comecon as one of the single-biggest barriers to  launching the process of boosting trade with the West.  </P> <P> Reformists are expected to push to replace the present system with more  conventional bilateral trade agreements, which would diminish the role of  government agencies and permit incentives to produce world-class goods.  </P> <P> East Europeans quickly learned that the Soviets would take almost anything,  while their Comecon partners had no other choice but to take what was offered.  </P> <P> In such a climate, cheap oil and other basic materials merely bred inefficient  fuel use and production methods. Power plants in Czechoslovakia, for example,  require roughly three times the fuel to produce a unit of energy as their most  efficient Western counterparts.  </P> <P> Such a malaise quickly left these countries incapable of competing in the West.  </P> <P> "We're like a handicapped class in a school of healthy students," commented  Andrezej Wroblewski, a Polish political analyst. "Sure, we are hard-pressed to  come up with anything (of) high value-added to export. If not (for) the  exchange among us handicapped ones, how would we exist? We barter junk for  junk."  </P> <P> This week's meeting was initially scheduled for last June but has been  repeatedly postponed, apparently because members were unable to bridge the gap  between reformist governments and the remaining hard-line Communist regimes.  With the fall of Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu last month, the group's last major  hard-liner disappeared.  </P> <P> As recently as last spring, for instance, a Czechoslovak trading official spoke  unrealistically of Comecon as "a Socialist market that does not contain  unemployment and bankruptcies."  </P> <P> Now, however, Klaus, the new Czechoslovak finance minister, is an advocate of  the policies of American economist Milton Friedman, the arch proponent of  free-market forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMECON AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Charter: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is the controlling body for  trade among Soviet-allied countries.  </P> <P> Members: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania,  Soviet Union. Yugoslavia has partial member status; Albania has been inactive  since 1961. Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam are not shown.  </P> <P> Founded: Charter adopted in January, 1949.  </P> <P> Purposes: Economic development; scientific, technical and economic cooperation;  joint trade negotiations with non-members.  </P> <P> Policy-making bodies: Council comprises heads of governments; executive  committee of country representatives.  </P> <P> Developments: Members, meeting in Bulgaria beginning today, will address the  political and economic reforms that have swept Eastern Europe, prompting calls  from Czechoslovakia and Poland for a major overhaul. The alliance, they say, is  outdated and should be replaced with something less rigid.  </P></p>

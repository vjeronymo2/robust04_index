			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine set for lengthy absence MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is unlikely to resume ministerial responsibilities until late summer, Michael Cassell writes. Mr Heseltine, who suffered a mild heart attack on Monday, is recovering in hospital in Venice, where doctors yesterday were satisfied with his progress. He is expected to remain there for a few days before being given medical permission to be flown home. In spite of Mr Heseltine's central role in Mr John Major's government it is expected that he will not return to Westminster before the summer recess in late July. He would then be able to extend his period of recuperation well into the holidays, with the possibility that he could re-emerge on the political scene at the Tory party conference in early October.</p>

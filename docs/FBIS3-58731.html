Larijani said this in talks with representatives of the  German Government and parliament in Bonn. He is heading a small  delegation of parliamentarians on a two-day visit to Bonn.  Larijani is regarded as a close confidant of Iranian President  'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. In their talks with him,  Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and Foreign Ministry State  Secretary Dieter Kastrup directly raised the issue of the  existing plea for pardon and asked for support.    According to information available to DPA, the German  Government now assumes that Szimkus, who is accused of spying  for Iraq, will be pardoned in the spring. "Despite the  difficulties, we are quite certain of this," a high-ranking  government official told DPA. Under no circumstances is the  Szimkus case "a matter for negotiation" in connection with the  Mykonos trial in Berlin. [passage omitted]    The three members of the Iranian parliamentary delegation  did  not raise the issue of the Mykonos trial in their talks, which  included a meeting late this afternoon with Bernd Schmidtbauer,  state minister at the chancellor's office. This was confirmed  by Christoph Matschke, chairman of the German-Iranian group of  parliamentarians, which invited Larijani and his delegation to  Germany. [passage omitted]</p>

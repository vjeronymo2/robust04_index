			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by </F> correspondent Grzegorz Miecugow; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] According to President Lech Walesa, if  the political situation in Central and Eastern Europe becomes  more complicated, our joining NATO may happen sooner. Tomorrow,  [12 January] President Walesa is going to Prague, where he will  take part in the Visegrad group summit.    [Miecugow] Tomorrow you will meet President Clinton. What do  you want to tell the president?    [Walesa] Of course, what I have already said but in a  different way. [Before], I spoke to the nation but not in a  diplomatic language. I was counting on social pressure. One  talks slightly differently to diplomats, but we talk about the  same things. That is, in my opinion, I think that the leap  should have been greater, that one should have moved further. I  think that this has been a mistake. However, as I have said,  one can reach the same aim at a different pace.    Nevertheless, these talks will be difficult because I expect  that this concept [Partnership for Peace], which in a way has  been imposed on us, will be defended.    [Miecugow] Do you still believe that Poland is one of the  Central European states first in line to join NATO?    [Walesa] As a practitioner, I think that these priorities  are  relative. If the situation becomes difficult and dangerous,  Poland will certainly be the first. If the situation is  different, if great compromises happen, if there is some sort of  pulling out [jakies takie wydzieranie], the others and the more  minor will have a greater chance to be withdrawn, or  incorporated [in NATO]. This is a game involving interests and  how large the country is. Poland, however, is a medium size  country. Other countries, and especially Russia, focus  particular attention on us.</p>

Soon  after the talks, the Ukrainian official flew out to Kiev to  continue work as usual.    No word was given of the details of the meeting. However, a  senior Russian diplomat linked Zvyahilskyy's surprise visit to a  recent stay in Moscow by pro-Moscow Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov. Meshkov had held negotiations with top government and  parliamentary officials in the Russian capital inviting leading  economist Yevgeniy Saburov to head the Crimean cabinet of  ministers.    The two sides may have also discussed the Rbl[Rubles] 1  Tn[trillion] debt Kiev has run for gas imports from Russia by  the end of January, the diplomat said. Although Russia's chief  gas exporter, Gazprom, threatened to cut off gas supply to  Ukraine, it has so far suspended the measure. The diplomat  believes the two prime ministers may have reached agreement by  telephone on how to settle the debt and discussed the details on  Friday.</p>

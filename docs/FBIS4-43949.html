			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kaa Eneberg: "Opposition Greater Than Expected"] </F>   [Text] The Social Democratic movement will recommend its  voters to vote yes to the EU [European Union] in the referendum  on 13 November. This was the expected result when the Social  Democratic "Europe congress" yesterday voted by a two-thirds  majority on the position the party will adopt.    The whole congress, a continuation of the spring's  unfinished  32d party congress in Goteborg, was a two-day arrangement that  was lacking in drama.    Both sides were energetically addressed as good party  comrades and the "winning duo," [party leader] Ingvar Carlsson  and [party secretary] Mona Sahlin, were careful to declare that  the congress had not created either winners or losers.    Even in the toughest battles -- between no-sympathizer Soren  Wibe and yes-supporters Goran Farm and "finance minister" Goran  Persson over economic policy, for example -- warm smiles were  exchanged when there were handovers on the speaker's rostrum,  Mona Sahlin noted with satisfaction. She called for continued  "sensitive" and objective EU debate in the election campaign,  which should however, be directed chiefly toward toppling the  Bildt government.    Ingvar Carlsson pointed out that the EU "is neither a Social  Democratic nor a nonsocialist project."    "We want Social Democrats to view membership as an  opportunity," Ingvar Carlsson declared. He and several  yes-sympathizers in the debate described how Social Democratic  ideas will win a sympathetic hearing and greater currency in the  EU as a result of Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria joining.    This was contradicted by the no-side. For example, Sten  Johansson declared that the Social Democratic side in the EU  will increase by a mere 0.5 percent in the event of enlargement.  No one questioned this claim. However, afterward Mona Sahlin  said that she predicts that the nonsocialist domination in the  EU will decrease.    "This fall we are hoping to win the election here at home  and  several countries are waiting for elections which could go in  the same direction," she said.    In the vote 103 delegates voted against the yes-line, while  the party leadership won the support of 232 votes for the  yes-line. Last week the party executive backed the yes-line by  33 votes to zero -- something that caused some surprise among  grass roots. According to the opinion polls, including one in  Sunday's DAGENS NYHETER, around half of Social Democratic  sympathizers are undecided about or are opposed to the EU.    At a press conference Ingvar Carlsson said that he does not  believe in opinion polls. He mentioned the landslide victory  for the yes-side in Austria as an example of how they can be  proved wrong.    "If I were to believe them I should take a vacation up to  the  election on 18 September," he said at the press conference  alluding to all the polls recently which have pointed to a  majority of their own for the Social Democrats in the fall  election.    The congress decision was welcomed as a clear message to be  pushed in the election campaign. Without naming names Ingvar  Carlsson attacked opposition politicians who had been hoping  that the Social Democrats would be deeply divided on the EU  issue.    Ingvar Carlsson believes on the contrary that the congress  decision has shown a fairly united and strong party that is  giving its backing to Social Democratic ideas.    The criticism that the congress delegates were not elected  simply for their positions on the EU issue was described as a  strength. The delegates were chosen for the regular party  congress and have a responsibility therefore for the whole of  the party's program and not simply the view taken of the EU.    Prime Minister Carl Bildt welcomed the Social Democratic EU  decision.    "I warmly welcome the Social Democratic party congress's  decision to say a clear and unambiguous yes to the agreement  that has been negotiated and to Swedish membership of the  European Union," the prime minister said in a statement  immediately after the Social Democratic congress decision,  according to TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 26, BNS -- History should be left to  historians, and more attention should be paid to regional  cooperation and human rights, Polish President Lech Walesa said  addressing the Lithuanian parliament Tuesday [26 April].    Walesa and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas made  speeches in the parliament after they signed an agreement on  friendship and cooperation.    Walesa said Lithuania and Poland have a common history,  which  must be studied well in order to avoid mistakes in the future.    The Polish president said the two countries must not  passively observe the changes in Europe and around the world,  but should actively participate in the stabilization process  that goes on in Eastern and Central Europe.    Walesa said relations within the Visegrad group (Slovakia,  Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic) and cooperation between  the three Baltic states serve as examples for developing  stronger regional cooperation.    He said Poland, as a Visegrad country and Lithuania's  neighbor, seeks to develop cooperation in the entire region,  including Germany, Russia and Scandinavian countries.    Walesa noted that membership in the European Union is a  common goal of both Lithuania and Poland. He said "Poland is a  natural ally of the Baltic states" on the road to a unified  Europe.    "An expanded NATO bloc should be a guarantee of stability in  this part of Europe," the Polish president said, and added that  Poland and Lithuania are concerned about the extreme  militarization of the Kaliningrad region.    Walesa called the signed Lithuanian-Polish accord an  achievement of democracy, and noted that democracy means equal  rights to all, including national minorities. He expressed hope  that the Lithuanian parliament will manage to guarantee equal  rights to Lithuania's Poles. In Walesa's words, Poland is  pleased with the activities of its Lithuanian minority,  especially the self- government and agricultural achievements in  the predominantly Lithuanian-populated Punsk region.    In conclusion, Walesa said he is certain that an agreement  between the Polish Eagle and the Lithuanian Vytis (the state  emblems) will become "a foundation of a home for Poles and  Lithuanians."    Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who spoke after  Walesa, proposed to hold a summit of Visegrad and Baltic leaders.    Brazauskas said Poland and Lithuania, which are the biggest  Visegrad and Baltic states, could stimulate a dialog between the  two regions on all levels. A free trade agreement between the  Baltics and Visegrad countries would be a step in this  direction, he said. "I think Vilnius and Warsaw could join  efforts to arrange a meeting between Visegrad and Baltic leaders  this or early next year."    During a summit in March, the presidents of Estonia, Latvia  and Lithuania said their countries will seek to expand  cooperation on the North-Baltic-Visegrad axis.    Discussing pan-European political processes, Brazauskas  pointed out certain aspects of relations with Russia. He said  Poland and Lithuania, which have borders with the Kaliningrad  region, are especially interested in a successful development of  democratic reforms both in the region and in Russia in general.  "The Russian Federation could essentially contribute to security  and stability in the area by gradually transforming the region  from a military stronghold into a zone of active international  business."    Brazauskas expressed regret that a free trade agreement  between Lithuania and Russia is blocked and that "a  commercial-economic agreement does not come into force because  of Russia's positions. Such a policy is neither positive nor  having prospects, and it does not stimulate stability in Europe."    Commenting on the Lithuanian-Polish friendship and  cooperation agreement, Brazauskas said "Lithuania achieved its  most important goals but did not violate any of its essential  and vital interests. A clever compromise was reached."    Brazauskas noted, however, that "Lithuania does not give up  its principled position that Vilnius and the Vilnius region were  a part of Poland before the war only by fact, but not lawfully."</p>

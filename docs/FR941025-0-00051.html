			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, one comment suggested that &sect;65.14(g) of the proposed regulations recognized the potential for such delays in that it requires the community and the Federal sponsor to update the restoration plan and identify any ``*&blank;*&blank;* problems that will delay the project completion from the restoration plan previously submitted *&blank;*&blank;*''. The provisions in &sect;64.14(g) provide for relatively minor modifications to the scheduled restoration plan, including modifying the time frames negotiated under an existing restoration plan. However, it does not imply that the maximum restoration period provided for in the regulations can be exceeded as a result of any modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is our position that the regulations should not include ``hold harmless'' provisions or provisions to extend, for any reason, the AR Zone designation beyond the maximum ten-year restoration period specified in the regulations. Central to this position is FEMA's belief that the flood control restoration zone is not a long-term or permanent flood insurance zone designation. A provision to extend the AR Zone designation or the inclusion of a ``hold harmless'' provision would, in FEMA's opinion, be contrary to the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Delineation of ``Dual'' Zones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments expressed the concern that the ``dual'' zone provision contained in the proposed regulations is confusing and should be eliminated if it does not benefit property owners. This provision is specifically intended to benefit current and future owners of structures located in areas that, because of flooding from other sources that the flood protection system does not contain, will continue to be subject to flooding after the flood protection system is completely restored. The provision is retained in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations on AR Zone Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were raised concerning the requirement in &sect;64.14(b) of the proposed rule, which states that ``a community may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once for the purposes of restoring a given flood protection system''. The requirement does not limit a community's future eligibility for the AR Zone designation in the event that a fully restored, certified and accredited flood protection system were to be decertified again. The provision prevents a community from seeking a second flood control restoration zone designation if the initial designation has been removed due to noncompliance with the restoration schedule or due to a finding that satisfactory progress is not being made to complete the restoration. FEMA believes that it is unnecessary to alter the regulations to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application and Submittal Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were made pertaining to the application and submittal requirements contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;65.14(e) of the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that the regulations be revised to state that the local project sponsor, not the community applicant be responsible for submitting the documentation requirements at &sect;65.14(e) (1), (3), (5), (6), and (7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that it is appropriate that the community be responsible for submitting documentation referenced above. In doing so, the community does not assume financial or administrative responsibility for restoration of the flood protection system. For certain submittal requirements, such as the restoration plan referenced at &sect;65.14(e)(7), the community would be expected to work with the local and federal project sponsors to complete this requirement. Other requirements, such as a statement required of the community to accompany the Federal agency certification required at &sect;65.14(e)(3), would be to assure FEMA that the community is aware of the certification being made by the Federal agency, but it does not imply any specific technical input or expertise on the part of the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment suggested that the documentation required in &sect;65.14(e) include a statement that the flood protection system under restoration will not increase flood hazards in surrounding areas. Such a provision relates directly to the design requirements for constructing a restoration project that is not within the scope of the statute or these regulations. It is appropriate that concerns about induced flooding be addressed by the local and Federal sponsors of the restoration project. Therefore, such a provision has not been included in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

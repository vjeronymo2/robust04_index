			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Israel to keep afloat arms manufacturer THE ISRAELI government yesterday agreed to bail out the financially stricken Israel Military Industries in an attempt to keep afloat one of the mainstays of the country's big state-owned defence industry, which has been hard hit by falling world demand for military products. The cabinet voted to back a recovery plan for IMI  - best known as the maker of the Uzi sub-machine gun  - which includes an injection of Shk750m (Dollars 289m) in government funds and a 2,500 cut in the present 7,500-strong workforce. Previously, the government had pumped Shk250m into IMI to staunch losses which approached Dollars 250m last year on sales which fell 20 per cent to Dollars 520m. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, told ministers who protested at the scale of lay-offs redundancies that the only alternative he would consider was to liquidate the company. The crisis in the defence industry is a serious economic and political problem for the Labour-led government. As well as sucking in government money, the decline in military sales, a mainstay of Israel's exports, has held back growth at a time when the government is having to cope with the burden of mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. There is already record unemployment of more than 11 per cent of the workforce. Aside from IMI, the government is also being asked by Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest company, for more than Dollars 150m in emergency aid to help it cope with falling sales. It plans to cut its workforce of 17,000 by at least 1,500. Raphael, a developer of weapons systems run by the defence ministry, is also mired in losses.</p>

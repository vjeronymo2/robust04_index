			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Text] The prime minister today refused to extend Britain's  commitment of troops to help with humanitarian aid in Bosnia  until their security could be guaranteed.    Mr. Major was pressed by Labour Leader John Smith in the  Commons over speculation that British troops may be pulled out  at the end of the winter.    Mr. Smith urged Mr. Major, who was reporting on the outcome  of the NATO summit, to put an end to such suggestions.    To some Tory jeers, Mr. Smith said: "Don't we need a  commitment to increase ground forces as requested by the UN to  make a greater effort to bring some peace to Bosnia?"    But Mr. Major replied: "We have committed ourselves to  assist  with humanitarian aid. I have to say that is not a commitment I  am at this stage prepared to extend until I am certain of the  security of the British troops working for the UN there.  Despite remarkable work they have done for humanitarian  reasons, our first concern must be the security of UN troops and  in particular those of our own country."    Mr. Major hailed the summit as having reaffirmed America's  commitment to Europe and shown the allies "standing closely  together in maintaining their collective security."    Insisting that the priority was to ensure there were no new  dividing lines in Europe, he said the summit had launched a  vital new initiative towards the East, opening the way for new  relationships and new NATO members.    "I believe that the summit has successfully equipped the  alliance to meet new challenges."    He said of the threat to use air strikes to relieve  peacekeepers in Srebrenica and reopen Tuzla airport: "We would  prefer not to have to use force. But those who are impeding  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] at Srebrenica and Tuzla must  realise that force is available if necessary to support UNPROFOR  and its ability to protect relief efforts."    Mr. Smith said he broadly welcomed the summit declaration  but  asked if the threat of air strikes now was any different or  stronger than the apparent commitment made last August, which  had not resulted in any effective action.    "Repeated declarations which are not followed through, risk  undermining the credibility of both NATO and the whole UN  operation and only strengthen the hands of those who have become  adept at defying the wishes of the international community," he  warned.    Mr. Smith called for effective action in Tuzla and  Srebrenica  and to lift the siege of Sarajevo.    He said it was "wholly intolerable that a defenceless  population in Sarajevo should be shelled so relentlessly and  pitilessly."    Mr. Major said practical decisions on air strikes were best  made not by politicians but by commanders near at hand.    "It is predominantly on their advice that I think it would  be  right for NATO leaders to act. There are reservations expressed  from troop commanders from time to time and I think we would be  very unwise to sweep those to one side."    Agreement in principle for military strikes was certainly  there in these two specific cases, he said. But "casual edicts"  should not be issued from afar.    Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith (Conservative Wealden) asked for  an assurance that contingency plans were in place to prevent  British and other UN troops being "sucked in" to the conflict if  air strikes were authorised.    Mr. Major said he could not go into details, "but the  security of our troops in such a circumstance would be given the  very highest priority of all."    Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr. Major had  been  warned many times that the "bottom-line credibility" of the UN  operation in Bosnia was at risk and the opening of Tuzla airport  was central to that credibility.    "As President Clinton said, `If we cannot show the  determination to deliver our promises, then don't make  promises.'"    Mr. Major retorted: "We have been very careful about the  promises we could make -- unlike you, whose shifting and  manoeuvring throughout this whole operation have included  everything from all-out war to apparently pulling out  immediately. Your opinions seem to have been moving on an  escalator at rapid speed."    Peter Viggers (Conservative Gosport) said the delivery of  humanitarian aid depended on cooperation of Serb, Croat and  Muslim control posts.    He asked: "How can we be sure that this local cooperation  will continue if we should have previously taken military action  against one of the sides?"    Mr. Major replied: "You point precisely to one of the  primary  factors that needs to be taken into account before determining  whether any military action of any sort needs to be taken."    He added: "It is very easy to say that it is an easy  decision  and that all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and  all is well. I have to say to those who readily advocate that  course, without careful thought, thought that it may well not be  a wise policy. It may be a necessary policy at some stage --  but it is a policy that should be entered into with very  considerable caution."    Tory Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South) said it was  essential the Serbs understood NATO "meant business" so that the  conflict did not grow.    Mr. Major agreed but said the conflict was no longer a  clear-cut case of one aggressor and one victim.    The war was now a "horrible dispute in which each of the  participants have committed actions which they should be  thoroughly ashamed of."    Labour's Bob Cryer (Bradford South) demanded: "What's the  point of spending time and a great deal of money looking around  for something for NATO to do, simply in order to keep the  organisation in existence when it really has no function left?"    To Tory protests, Mr. Cryer added: "NATO is redundant and we  would be a lot better off without it."    Mr. Major told him: "NATO has been the guardian of our  security for over 40 years. It would be folly beyond belief not  to make sure that NATO is securely in place for the next 40  years."    Tory Cyril Townsend (Bexleyheath) urged Mr. Major to say  that  the "special relationship" with the United States remained  cordial.    Mr. Major stressed that he would have much to discuss with  Mr. Clinton when they meet in Washington at the end of February.    They would discuss Russia, free trade, GATT, the Middle East  peace process, Lockerbie, sanctions on Iraq -- "all matters on  which the UK and the U.S. are in complete agreement and upon  which the two governments have worked together."    He added: "The fact of the matter is the relationship  between  the UK and the U.S. is in very good repair."</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Salomon to settle Salomon Brothers yesterday said it was paying Dollars 66m to settle class action suits by a number of bond investors, signalling an attempt finally to put the 1991 Treasury bond auction scandal behind it. The settlement, which needs court approval, involves investors who claim they lost money as a result of Salomon's rigging of US government bond auctions. The firm has already paid Dollars 190m to Federal government agencies and set up a Dollars 100m fund to meet civil claims. Salomon said it expected more than half the Dollars 66m to be reimbursed to it out of the claims fund. It settled other class actions last year for Dollars 55m plus costs.</p>

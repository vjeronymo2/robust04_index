			<p>BFN     [Text] The document of principles of the multilateral arms  control committee will be discussed in a working meeting of the  committee members in a special session in Vienna. This has been  decided at the conclusion of this round of talks, held in Qatar.  Qol Yisra'el correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that another  working team of the multilateral committee will convene in  France in the near future to discuss other issues which have not  been finalized.    David 'Ivri, director general of the Defense Ministry,  described the Qatar meeting as successful. He noted that among  other things, it was decided to hold a naval search and rescue  maneuver. David 'Ivri noted that the Saudis and several other  parties tried to delay the rate of progress, because they  believe the talks are proceeding too fast.</p>

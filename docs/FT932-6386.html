			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Hammerson plans to raise Pounds 199m in rights issue: Property group promises to overhaul its portfolio and reform voting structure HAMMERSON, the UK's fifth largest property group, yesterday announced a Pounds 199m rights issue to ease the pressure on its balance sheet. It joins a number of investment companies that have taken advantage of the revival in property share values to cut gearing and raise funds for acquisitions. The announcement was accompanied by the promise of 'cultural change' within the company, following the appointment of new senior management last month. Mr Ron Spinney, the new chief executive, said the company would carry out a comprehensive strategic review of the portfolio's balance, its geographic spread and management structure. There would be significant savings on administrative costs over the next 18 months, he said. The company unveiled proposals to reform its 'anachronistic' voting structure, by which ordinary share owners receive six times as many votes as owners of 'A' shares with the same nominal value. It plans to create a single class of ordinary share capital on terms that reflect the market price of the two classes of share prior to the rights issue and the terms of the issue. The reduction in gearing will allow 'increased flexibility' in disposals, the company said. It also gives it scope to spend about Pounds 60m in enlarging and upgrading existing retail properties. Mr Spinney said he believed that the UK property market, which accounts for 41 per cent of the group's holdings, was beginning to come out of recession. He thought that continental Europe and Canada would show improvement by the first quarter of next year, while Australia would not improve until the end of 1994. The rights issue, which came as no surprise to the stock market, caused the 'A' shares to rise by 4p to 344p and the ordinary shares to fall from 380p to 373p. The issue, involving a 14 per cent dilution of net asset values, was made on a 7-for-15 basis at a price of 285p for each ordinary share and 255p for each 'A' share. The rights issue reduces the company's pro forma gearing to 69 per cent at the end of 1992 from 114 per cent. The sharp rise in gearing last year prompted Hammerson to agree revised financial covenants in respect of its borrowing facilities. Standard Life, which owns 23.6 per cent of Hammerson, said it would take up its full entitlement under the rights issue. The remainder has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Technology: The human factor - Simulators are being used for training, design and crisis management Aircraft simulators are normally used to train pilots and refresh the skills of experienced flyers, but the newest equipment used by Lufthansa, the German airline, goes a significant step further. As well as putting trainees through their paces, its simulator is used for research into how pilots behave in aircraft and into the best ways of designing modern cockpits. The DM40m (Pounds 15m) simulator is shared by Lufthansa and Berlin University's Institute of Aerospace, where it is located. Its operating company, the Centre for Flight Simulation (ZFB) is owned by Lufthansa, Deutsche Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz), CAE (the Canadian company which developed the software) and the state-owned German Aerospace Research Institute. Gerhard Huttig, head of ZFB, says today's pilots have to be equally at home in the worlds of information processing and flying. 'Our central research theme is the human factor and how people work with complex modern equipment.' The simulator is based on the latest long-range European Airbus A340. Run by a powerful IBM computer, it is programmed with details of some 50 airports to give pilots as realistic an impression of take-off and landing as possible. Lufthansa is the main user of the simulator, the first of its type, although the National Aeronatics and Space Administration now has a similar one in California based on a Boeing 747 cockpit. For research purposes, ZFB switches to a separate IBM to run the programs for investigating the ergonomic and health aspects of flying. Cameras and medical equipment are used to monitor brain, heart and other reactions. Colour recognition and how this is affected by ageing, is also studied. With a large amount of complex digital information, it is important to know which colours are most effective. The simulator is also available to equipment manufacturers for cockpit design. Huttig says French companies like Thomson and Aerospatiale have expressed an interest in using it.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or carcasses on public land, not being used as bait under an agency authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that it will not attract wolves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in paragraph (i)(7),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking is to be reported within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform with such provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may receive written authorization from the Service to take animals under special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the designated experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release to a remote area, or placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will be a last resort and is only authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear endangerment to human life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental population area, pursuant to terms of the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing for such purposes by the Service when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf from the wild within the experimental population area, if such action is for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Scientific purposes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal, State, and tribal land management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area, land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary restrictions on human access, when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area, may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply to public lands or other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. When six or more breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of national parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population recovery levels for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal agencies would identify, recommend, and implement corrective management actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use restrictions to promote growth of the wolf population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in paragraph (i) of this section or in violation of applicable State or tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense defined in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Yellowstone Management Area is shown on the following map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area will be that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 15; that portion of Montana that is east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern Montana border; and all of Wyoming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d176 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER22NO94.001 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

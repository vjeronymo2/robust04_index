			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 22 (CNA) -- Taiwan will open its  financial-services market wider to foreign investors in order to  facilitate its entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, or GATT, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying said Friday  [22 April].    "We plan to ease restrictions on foreign investment in local  financial-service industries, including banking, insurance and  investment trust," Li explained.    Taiwan already allows the establishment of fully  foreign-owned securities brokerage houses, but still bans  foreign investment in its banking industry. Meanwhile, foreign  investment in local insurance firms cannot exceed 49 percent,  and foreign capital in investment trust companies cannot exceed  40 percent.    Li said the ceilings for foreign investment in insurance and  trust companies will be raised to more than 50 percent in the  future.    The Ministry of Finance is preparing a position paper  detailing Taiwan's stance on financial liberalization in line  with the General Agreement on Trade and Services, which is  associated with GATT, Li said. Such a paper is a prerequisite  for Taiwan's GATT accession.    As Taiwan hopes to join GATT by the end of this year, Li  said, "We'll draft short- and mid-term timetables for financial  liberalization to win foreign support for our GATT bid."    Li said that since many GATT members still limit foreign  investment in their banking industry to less than 50 percent,  Taiwan may follow suit.    As the General Agreement on Trade and Services stipulates  that foreign investors in financial and other service industries  must be given "national treatment," Li said Taiwan will allow  the introduction of more financial products into the local  market and give foreign investors a freer hand in operations.    At present, Taiwan only permits American insurance firms to  open branches here. After Taiwan joins GATT, Li said, insurers  from other countries will also be allowed to enter the Taiwan  market.    Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade  regulatory body as a separate customs territory in 1990 and was  granted observer status in 1992. It expects to become a full  member before GATT is superseded by the World Trade Organization  next January.</p>

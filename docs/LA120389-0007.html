			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I am appalled at the slap in the face KNBC-TV is giving loyal fans of "Showtime  at the Apollo." I'm referring to the programming blunder of pushing it back an  hour locally to air the crass, boring and unfunny antics of  pseudo-comedian/weatherman Fritz Coleman. Particularly galling is Coleman's  landing of the coveted time slot after "Saturday Night Live," a perfect spot  for "Showtime at the Apollo."  </P> <P> Denice Fractious, Los Angeles  </P></p>

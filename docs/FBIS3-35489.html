Are they boastful because they fought for the liberation of  Palestine, the Golan, or southern Lebanon? Or, are they  boastful because they joined forces with the Zionists, the  Americans, and other enemies of Arabism for the sake of a single  Arab nation?    One of the theorists of Hafiz al-Asad's policy, a freak  called Zuhayr Diyab, spoke boastfully to the Zionist paper  HA'ARETZ, thus openly declaring the traitorous normalization  between the al-Asad regime and the Zionist enemy. What did he  say? Let us read parts of what this member of Hafiz al-Asad's  party has said.    He said: The Syrian decision to join the peace process was  not made when President al-Asad accepted the Bush initiative,  but some 20 years earlier, after the 1973 war when Syria's  inclination toward recognizing the Jewish state and abandoning  the policy of eliminating Israel began to crystallize.    Why, then, did they get angry when Iraq called the 1973 war,  the war of reactivation [tahrik]?    This typical slanderer, who represents Hafiz al-Asad's  authority, said: The majority of Syrians -- intellectuals,  militarymen, businessmen, and politicians -- accept the reality  of Israeli existence. This proves the matter depended not only  on a decision by al-Asad, but was also a development that began  some 20 years ago.    Thus, the chain of Arab recognitions is crowned by a  boastful  remark that Hafiz al-Asad was the first to recognize the  aggression and injustice embodied by the Zionist enemy. This is  not the main point. The main point is that every Arab ruler or  government official who today rushes to Tel Aviv to kiss the  ground under the Zionists' feet claims he is doing so because it  is a public desire and that he is only carrying out the people's  wish. This was done by Anwar al-Sadat when he embarked on his  treason in Camp David. But time proved our people in Egypt  opposed that blatant treason.    The Gaza-Jericho agreement, signed on behalf of the  Palestinian people in the occupied homeland, is also being  staggered by the overwhelming pressure of public opposition and  the continuation of the brave intifada.    As for the claim by this trivial opportunist that our Syrian  people accept the Zionist entity, it will, sooner of later, be  faced by the masses of our people in Syria. But the main  question is: If the traitors and weaklings now lining up  outside Tel Aviv are honest when they say they represent the  wishes of the masses in their countries, why then do they not  hold free and honest referendums so people can express their  opinion on a question that affects their security, present, and  future, as well as the future of the Arab nation? Or does the  ruler who carries out the orders of his overlords believe he can  think on behalf of the people, and that he is in a position to  determine their destiny, even if he has to place all the people  in his big prison?    What appears in the HA'ARETZ interview about normalization  with the active member of al-Asad's apparatus and party sheds  light on all the stands and policies al-Asad has adopted since  1973, including the entry of his forces into Lebanon in 1976,  his support for the Iranian war against Iraq, his attempts to  split up the Palestinian organizations and Lebanese forces, his  open alliance with the Zionists and the other agents in Hafr  al-Batin, his feverish rush to Madrid, and then Washington, in  order to liquidate the Palestine question, and his conspiracies  against the historic leadership of the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party party since 1966 and up to this moment.</p>

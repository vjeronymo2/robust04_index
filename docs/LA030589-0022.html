			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK  </P> <P> THE LILAC TIME"The Lilac Time." Mercury ** 1/2  </P> <P> One-time British New Romantic pop-fop star Stephen Duffy's transformation, in  these folkier days, into contemplative idyllist may strike some (at least the  few in the United States who have heard of him) as a bit calculated. But this  album is so fresh and understatedly from-the-heart that if it is a calculation,  it's a good one all around. As on the Waterboys' "Fisherman's Blues," the  balance between the contemplation (primarily on the state of the English  mind-set and the state of love) and the idyllic sound (lotsa airy acoustic  guitars and lilting hooks, but not at the expense of drive) is the key: Call it  strum and Drang. Maybe the sound's not entirely new, but it's truly romantic.  STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] At a second signing ceremony in the Kremlin on  Thursday, 141 senior Russian business executives put their  signatures to the Civic Accord, a civil peace pact between  Russia's reformists and hardliners.    Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, addressing the ceremony,  said many people in Russia were today pinning their hopes on the  accord. "We have all witnessed the completion of an important  stage of a nationwide endeavor to achieve social conciliation on  the most burning and acute problems," he said.    "The Civic Accord meets the main task, a search for  civilized  methods, a comparison of various views and principles and  conflicting ideas of how we should further develop the society  and economy of Russia," all of which should be done without  "political confrontation," Chernomyrdin continued.    He paid special attention to section two of the document,  proposing ways to overcome the current social and economic  crisis. Beside setting general goals, the section declares  economic stabilization to be the shared responsibility of the  legislative and executive branches of authority, the  industrialists, business and trade unions, the prime minister  said.    He pointed out the fact that the signatories of the accord  included prominent bankers. Stabilization would largely depend  on their ability to satisfy the economy's "investment hunger,"  he said.    Chernomyrdin said it was particularly important to provide  normal market conditions for agriculture. But those problems  should be tackled jointly with those who actually work in the  fields and are building new economic relations in agriculture,  he said.    "The government will keep its promise to the rural  population: it will support their work within reasonable and  possible limits," the premier said.    He said the government had also pledged to make it easier  for  farmers to exercise their property rights, to provide normal  conditions for competition, and to draw up a taxation system  that would stimulate production.    The country is still deep in crisis, "but we can already  feel  solid ground under our feet. Now we must move on. For that the  country needs the perseverance and conscientious work of every  member of society. We can't afford to have a flabby state," the  prime minister said.    The Civic Accord had brought national conciliation nearer,  he  said. What is important now is to create an effective mechanism  to make it work, for instance permanent high-level consultations  between various governmental bodies and political and public  organizations, Chernomyrdin said.    He called the Civic Accord a good remedy for the "civil war  syndrome," in economics as well as in politics.</p>

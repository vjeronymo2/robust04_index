			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Swiss likely to shun peacekeeping in poll The Swiss, who pride themselves on being the world's great peacemakers, may be about to prohibit their soldiers from participating in United Nations peacekeeping activities. Polls indicate a close overall result in Sunday's referendum on whether to allow the Swiss Army to contribute troops to the UN's blue helmet corps in the world's trouble spots. That means the requirement for majorities to be achieved in over half the country's 23 cantons will almost certainly not be satisfied. Other decisions by the Swiss in recent years to eschew international involvement have so far produced no noticeable negative consequences for the country. But signs exist that a No vote in this case would poison ties with neighbouring countries. Last week, Mr Matthias Wissmann, German transport minister, said the vote had no direct relation to European transport talks jolted by a Swiss referendum decision in February to prohibit all lorry transit traffic from the Alps from 2004. The connection was 'more atmospheric,' Mr Wissmann said. With a 'yes' vote, Switzerland would signal it sought not only advantages from international relations but also to carry the burdens. That message has been submerged in a campaign where opponents are appealing to arrogance and narrow-mindedness. Supplying blue helmet troops would compromise the country's treasured neutrality, said Mr Christoph Blocher, the charismatic right-wing politician-industrialist who has successfully led campaigns in recent years to keep Switzerland out of the UN and the European Economic Area. The fact that Sweden, Finland, Austria and other neutral countries can reconcile their status with supplying blue helmets is brushed aside. 'Switzerland is the only long-standing armed neutral,' Mr Blocher replies. He and other opponents charge that Swiss blue helmets would be controlled by the UN Security Council, and thus would be creatures of the policies of the big powers that control the council. The Swiss government insists it would retain the power to decide on participation of Swiss troops in any given situation. Opponents point to the failure of the blue helmets to prevent the slaughter in Yugoslavia, claiming they are a waste of money and an unnecessary risk to soldiers' lives. Their advertising posters feature an illustration of eroding Swiss soldiers' gravestones in some distant desert. They say Switzerland already fulfils its international responsibilities by contributing to many UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations. The government, with wide support in parliament and business circles, agrees Switzerland can be proud of its humanitarian efforts, but it must also share the responsibility for the increasing need for international peacekeepers. It says participation in the corps would be voluntary, They would not be sent to active combat zones.</p>

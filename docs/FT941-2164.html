			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: New Jersey bank buys Baltimore Bancorp First Fidelity Bancorporation, the New Jersey-based bank, is to acquire Baltimore Bancorp for Dollars 346m in a Dollars 20.75 per share cash deal, agencies report from New York. The price represents about twice Baltimore Bancorp's expected book value at closing, Fidelity noted. Baltimore Bancorp, with Dollars 2.2bn in assets, is the parent company of the Bank of Baltimore which has Dollars 2bn in deposits, Dollars 1.4bn in loans and 42 branch offices. First Fidelity said the acquisition was expected to close by the end of 1994, starting to add to its earnings in the first quarter of 1995. It said there will be no up-front charges. Mr Tony Terracciano, First Fidelity chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition positions his bank in a growing and geographically contiguous market. He added that the Baltimore bank's distribution system provided an opportunity to develop new business and revenue for middle market, small company and private banking businesses. First Fidelity said it needed no external financing to close the transaction, which has been approved by the boards of both Baltimore Bancorp and First Fidelity.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Recent developments in the Panhellenic  Socialist Movement (PASOK) in light of its recent congress and  the elections of executive bureau members have been discussed in  the Greek press.  <H5>  Executive Bureau Elections Favor Tsokhatzopoulos </H5>   According to Stavros Liyeros, writing in the 22 May Athens  daily I KATHIMERINI, the election of the PASOK executive bureau  members indicates that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's power  over the party is "fully established." The election also  confirmed the role of Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, PASOK secretary  general, as "interpreter of Papandreou's will." According to  Liyeros, a new balance of power is shaping within the party,  with a "dividing line" between those allied with Papandreou and  others who function as the "opposition." The former, led by  Tsokhatzopoulos, include those PASOK factions nicknamed the  "Italian group," the "Yennimatas group," the "Arsenis group," as  well as top officials such as Chamber of Deputies President  Apostolos Kaklamanis, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis,  and PASOK official Stefanos Tzoumakas. On the opposition side  stand the "Simitis group," the faction under the influence of  PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou, and Alternate Minister of  Foreign Affairs Thodhoros Pangalos, who is following an  "autonomous" course. These developments are important because  of the ongoing struggle to succeed Papandreou, who, it is now  apparent, will run for the presidency in 1995, Liyeros wrote.  According to Liyeros, Tsokhatzopoulos is thought to hold most  of the trump cards in a succession race because of his power  over the party apparatus. However, many party officials,  including some Papandreou allies, do not consider him fit for  the prime ministership, even if they accept him as party leader,  Liyeros noted. Tsokhatzopoulos aides are spreading the rumor  that, if Papandreou decides to run for the presidency, he will  support his "trusted lieutenant" to succeed him, since this  would allow the prime minister to maintain his influence over  the party. However, other party sources cited by Liyeros  believe that papandreou will favor a transitional,  consensus-based leadership. According to Liyeros, many younger  party officials, joined by would-be "heirs-apparent" aware they  have no chance of being chosen, are positioning themselves for  such a solution.    Tsokhatzopoulos' biggest problem, Liyeros continued, will be  dealing with Pangalos, who will intensify his "guerrilla"  warfare within the party, having already stated he "will not  spare his criticism" if the new executive bureau, of which he is  not a member, proves "inefficient." Tsokhatzopoulos will have to  confront pangalos without the support of the Papandreou-allied  groups, Liyeros noted, since these are worried about the  secretary general's increasing power and would not oppose a  Pangalos attempt to "whittle it down."  <H5>  Laliotis Support of Tsokhatzopoulos Discussed </H5>   In a reference to the so-called troika of PASOK's early  days--composed of the late Yiorgos Yennimatas, Akis  Tsokhatzopoulos, and Kostas Laliotis--I.K. Pretenderis, writing  in the 22 May Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, cited a number  of political observers as convinced that Tsokhatzopoulos would  not have realized his goals at the party's third congress  without enlisting Laliotis' support. A number of PASOK  officials believe that, in return for his support in the  Papandreou succession race, Tsokhatzopoulos promised Laliotis  the post of secretary general. However, Pretenderis questioned  Laliotis' motives for clashing with the "modernizing tendency"  with which he has recently identified himself in the party and  cited some observers as attributing it to his deteriorating  relationship with "modernizer" Vaso Papandreou, whom he did not  support in the race for the executive bureau. Another  explanation, according to Pretenderis, is Laliotis' estimation  that Papandreou will be succeeded by "short-time" leaders, of  whom Tsokhatzopoulos is but the first. A third explanation  rests on the argument for a "legitimate succession," which would  designate Tsokhatzopoulos as the immediate successor followed by  the third member of the "historical leadership," Laliotis  himself.</p>

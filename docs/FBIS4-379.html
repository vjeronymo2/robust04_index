			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 10 (AFP) -- Rwandan army forces and  rebels clashed Sunday on the outskirts of Kigali, the Red Cross  said from the Rwandan capital.    The two sides fought with mortars, grenades and automatic  weapons, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.    The report appeared to contradict a Belgian UN commander's  assertion that the two sides, which have engaged in an orgy of  violence since the death of the Rwandan president in a plane  crash last Wednesday, had agreed to a ceasefire Sunday and were  generally respecting it.    Western countries scrambled Sunday to evacuate their  nationals from the tiny central African country.</p>

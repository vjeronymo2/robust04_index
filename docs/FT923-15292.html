			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading SIZEABLE selling by a number of the larger securities houses led to heavy falls in stock index futures yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo. Favourable results from GEC and Granada brought a strong opening for the September contract on the FT-SE of 2,555, and that momentum soon carried the contract to 2,561. This proved to be the high of the day, before a sell programme in the underlying cash market by County NatWest  - also done in the futures - sent the contract into retreat. The downward direction continued in the afternoon, with Salomon Bros and James Capel reported to have been among the big sellers of the session. Not even the firm opening on Wall street could curtail the falls in the contract, and September eventually closed at 2,510, down 35 from Tuesday's session and around 13 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover, at 9,666 lots, was an improvement on recent levels. Dealers reported a volatile day in the traded options market, which led to increased volume. Total turnover reached 45,144 lots, with the FT-SE option particularly busy at 20,183 contracts. Lonrho was the most actively traded stock option, with a total of 1,706 lots dealt by the close of business.</p>

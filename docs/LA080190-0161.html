			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HISTORIC FEET AND A LOT OF SOLE  </P> <P> It was over beers with a friend after the late show at the State Theater in  Waseca, Minn., that David Kunst hatched his audacious plan to walk around the  world.  </P> <P> His marriage on the rocks, bored with his job as a Waseca County surveyor and  looking for adventure, Kunst, 30, enlisted his 22-year-old brother, John, to  join him on the adventure of a lifetime.  </P> <P> On June 20, 1970, several thousand well-wishers gathered in front of the State  Theater, where David moonlighted as a projectionist, to see the brothers off.  And then, with a mule dubbed Willie Make It carrying their supplies and the  high school band playing "King of the Road," the two brothers simply walked out  of town.  </P> <P> Four years, three months and 16 days later, David Kunst walked back into town  and into the "Guinness Book of World Records" as the first person verified to  have walked around the world.  </P> <P> Along the way, the Kunst brothers met with Princess Grace in Monaco's royal  palace, had breakfast with Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl in his home in  northern Italy and became the first people in 200 years to bring a mule into  Venice.  </P> <P> They also endured subzero temperatures in eastern Turkey, 128-degree  temperatures in the Desert of Death in Afghanistan, blistered feet and  dysentery -- and they depended on the kindness of strangers, who frequently  gave them free lodging and food (most memorably sheep's eyeball soup in  Afghanistan).  </P> <P> Then tragedy struck.  </P> <P> While camping on an isolated mountain pass in Afghanistan one night two years  into their walk, the brothers were attacked by bandits. John Kunst was killed  instantly, a bullet piercing his heart. David Kunst was wounded in the chest  and left for dead.  </P> <P> After recuperating for four months back in Minnesota, Kunst returned to the  exact spot where his brother had been murdered. With his other brother, Pete,  accompanying him for a year, Kunst continued the walk that ended in Waseca on  Oct. 5, 1974.  </P> <P> In the process, David Kunst walked 14,500 miles, crossed four continents and 13  countries and wore out 21 pairs of shoes. He also generated worldwide media  coverage and, in 1979, co-authored a book, "The Man Who Walked Around the  World."  </P> <P> Twenty years after taking the first of an estimated 20 million steps, Kunst,  now a Newport Beach resident, is still getting a lot of mileage out of the  global adventure that also landed him in "Ripley's Believe It or Not!"  </P> <P> Indeed, a feat as dramatic as circumnavigating the earth on foot is not  something you just walk away from.  </P> <P> For the past 12 years, Kunst has been telling his globe-trotting tale at  schools, women's clubs, PTA meetings and retirement and church groups  throughout Southern California. And, more often than not, a reporter from the  local newspaper will turn up to write yet another story about Kunst's dramatic  adventure -- after Kunst has called to inform the paper of his upcoming  speaking engagement.  </P> <P> If there's one thing Kunst learned while circumnavigating the world, it's how  to generate publicity.  </P> <P> During an interview in his Newport Beach townhouse shortly after the 20th  anniversary of the start of his walk, Kunst flipped through a stack of  newspaper clippings chronicling recent appearances in Glendale, Escondido,  Poway, Ridgecrest and Burbank.  </P> <P> The seemingly endless interest in his walk -- even two decades later -- is no  surprise to Kunst, whom the press dubbed the "Earthwalker."  </P> <P> As he says, the story of his walk is filled with "adventure, intrigue, romance  and tragedy -- just about everything. Also, I think it's my excitement. Twenty  years later, I still get excited when I start talking about it."  </P> <P> Turning to his parents, Al and Augusta Kunst, who were visiting from Clear  Lake, Iowa, he said, "You've heard my programs. Do I get excited about it?"  </P> <P> "You'd think he finished yesterday," his mother said with a laugh.  </P> <P> To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the start of Kunst's walk, the 1990  edition of the "Guinness Book of Records" in England featured a color spread on  Kunst in the section on "Endurance and Endeavour." Kunst also has received  congratulatory letters from Sen. Pete Wilson, First Lady Barbara Bush and a  deputy assistant to President Bush.  </P> <P> So how did the Earthwalker himself celebrate the 20th anniversary of his  record-setting walk?  </P> <P> "I went sailing," he said.  </P> <P> These days, Kunst does more talking than walking.  </P> <P> Now 50 and about 20 pounds heavier than when he was a "lean, mean walking  machine" treading 40 miles a day, Kunst limits his walking to 30-minute strolls  around Balboa Island in the evenings with his wife, Jenni Samuel, an Irvine  elementary schoolteacher.  </P> <P> Samuel is the "romance" part of Kunst's around-the-world walk: They met at a  party in Australia during the walk. And after Kunst's mule died of a heart  attack, Samuel hitched her car to the 200-year-old wooden Turkish wagon Kunst  had acquired to carry his supplies. Driving in low gear alongside Kunst, she  accompanied him for 1,000 miles of his walk across Australia. When his walk  ended in 1974, Kunst returned to Australia and later married his "Australian  schoolteacher."  </P> <P> Actually, Kunst celebrated the walk's anniversary by serving as honorary  chairman of the Newport Beach Public Library's 70th Anniversary Celebration  Walk two weeks earlier. He figured that was close enough in time to commemorate  his own walk.  </P> <P> "Plus," he said with a laugh, "I figured I could do that walk: It's 2.2 miles."  </P> <P> Despite his globe-trotting reputation, Kunst seems to have settled into  somewhat of the same kind of middle-class rut he abandoned back in Waseca 20  years ago.  </P> <P> Since moving to Orange County in 1978, Kunst has managed a small apartment  complex and delivers a newspaper from 3 to 6 every morning in Newport Beach,  where, after flying from Australia in 1974, he struck out at water's edge and  began the last leg of his walk.  </P> <P> The early work schedule, he said, "leaves the days open to do my loves, my  programs."  </P> <P> Walking around the world is a story he never tires of telling.  </P> <P> Indeed, it's hard to believe that the loquacious Kunst is the same man who  froze up the first time he was interviewed on television. As one reporter  wrote, Kunst speaks in capitals, the words just tumbling out.  </P> <P> Once he begins talking about the walk, it's hard to stop him. He has no sooner  begun recounting the crush of people that would swarm around his wagon while  walking through India than he's reminded of the time that he and brother Pete  were granted special permission to walk through the Khyber Pass between  Afghanistan and Pakistan, thus becoming "the first non-Asians to officially  walk through the Khyber Pass since Alexander the Great."  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth," he said, "I always thought we should have gotten into  the record book for having done that."  </P> <P> The high point of the walk for Kunst was when he and John met Princess Grace.  The princess kept their gift of one of Willie Make It II's shoes on her desk  and later wrote a letter expressing her amazement that Kunst continued the walk  after his brother was killed. "He showed," she wrote, "enormous courage and  tenacity."  </P> <P> John's death was unquestionably the low point of the walk and gave rise to the  one time that the extensive press coverage backfired.  </P> <P> During the walk, the two brothers had been urging people to donate to UNICEF,  the international children's charity. But an Afghan newspaper incorrectly  reported that they were carrying the donations with them. Kunst later learned  that the bandits who attacked them had been following them for three days.  </P> <P> Kunst, however, has no regrets.  </P> <P> "I never think that way, and John wouldn't either," he said. "The way we looked  at life was that if you're going to die -- I mean, he would rather have died  doing that than in an accident out on the freeway someplace. He told me more  than once -- and I said the same thing to him: We loved walking around the  world; it was a great adventure, and if we died walking around the world, tell  mom and dad we died happy."  </P></p>

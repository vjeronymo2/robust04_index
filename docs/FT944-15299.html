			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: Resurrections - Theatre Pre-publicity for Resurrections has marketed its author 'Biyi Bandele-Thomas astutely, as a man who gave up the lucrative job of running an illegal gambling operation in Nigeria at the age of 16 to go to university and become a writer. It was an art-conquered-all story tailor-made for the broadsheets, the perfect hype. However, cynicism of this kind is dashed on encountering his work. Bandele-Thomas is an astounding story teller, in both senses of the phrase. He is a teller of astounding stories. The world of Resurrections is an an exaggerated vision of contemporary Nigeria, in which a drug baron (who clothes himself in euphemism, insisting that he is an enterprising businessman who has spotted a gap in the market for 'commodities') can use both senior contacts in the corrupt military government and simple bribery to sue for his acquittal on a capital charge. Negotiations between his counsel and the judge are conducted in a haze of poetic circumlocution, where the very writing desk is alive, resting on the head of mute menial. One of the characters describes the story he himself inhabits as 'Kafka on speed', which isn't too far from the truth. Here, too, the dead routinely return to the living to offer advice, smooth their journey into the next world or even to re-write history. These ghosts carry no air of the extraordinary about them, but are simply an integral part of the fabric of things. Bandele-Thomas has fashioned a potent West African counterpart to the creations of the Latin-American realists. He is also an astounding teller of stories. The impulse to weave tales seems stronger than the desire to ensure that their fabric is smooth: he possesses a marvellous ear for individual phrases, and an enviably fertile imagination through which his narratives twine, but as the play progresses from one episode to the next there is often a palpable clunk as his dramatic locomotive crosses the points. So compulsive is this urge that on the conclusion of the main story he cannot resist the temptation to keep the tale going; he tacks on an even more fantastic coda in which his characters return in different guises. Yet the mark of a true storyteller is that the listeners want above all to know what happens next, or how it happens. In Yvonne Brewster's direction it happens with startling visual opulence. The judge's throne is periodically flown up to hover above the rest of the action; chilling, vulture-headed, stilt-walking figures stalk the proceedings when the smell of death hangs in the air; more ridiculously, a ghost arrives on the stage on a bicycle. Ben Thomas as Bubba BB has all the implausible dignity of a Charlton Heston; his underling Santana - the storyteller within the play - is, in Colin McFarlane's performance, a beguiling mixture of inarticulate deference toward BB and confident fabulation toward the audience. A less fantastic show would be stolen by Don Warrington's Judge Bassy, the worm who finally turns. Bandele-Thomas's Two Horsemen transfers from the Gate to the Bush next month, and his Bad Boys is to be screened by the BBC; stories keep spilling from him, and judging by Resurrections, outpourings from his well-spring are both flavoursome and refreshing. At the Cochrane Theatre until November 29 (071 242 7040)</p>

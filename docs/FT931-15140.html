			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Mayflower Dollars 7.5m US buy MAYFLOWER Corporation, the specialist motor engineering group, is to expand its US operations through the purchase of an Ohio stamping facility for Dollars 7.5m (Pounds 4.9m) cash. It will use the facilities to produce steel and aluminium panels for truck and niche car markets. Mayflower already owns Motor Panels, the Coventry-headquartered concern which claims to be the world's largest independent designer of truck cabs and car and truck bodies. Motor Panels supplies bodies for Jaguar, Rolls-Royce and Rover among others, as well as truck cabs for Leyland DAF and Iveco Ford. Its Ohio and North Caroliner-based subsidiary supplies cabs for Mack, Freightliner, Western Star and Autocar trucks.

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Unwrapping an east European strategy - German deals have given Mercer a foothold in the paper industry When the Treuhand privatisation agency recently sold an eastern German printing plant to Mercer International, a Vancouver-based public company, it completed the privatisation of the region's pulp and paper mills. But for Mercer, the acquisition of Zellstoff und Papierfabrik Rosenthal, in the eastern state of Thuringia, could mark the beginning of the transformation of a company which until a year ago had neither a foothold in Europe nor an interest in the paper industry. 'In some ways, the transformation of our company is linked to the transformation of the east German economy,' said Mr Jimmy Lee, Mercer chairman. Mercer, founded in 1985, had specialised in US real estate and financial services and had an interest in Nalcap, whose principal asset was its royalty interest in the Wabush Lake iron ore mine in Newfoundland. By 1993 Mercer had revenues of USDollars 112m. But Mr Lee was impatient. 'Our whole philosophy is to look for undervalued situations. We look for messy problems. I saw what was happening in eastern Germany.' Mercer's first acquisition from the Treuhand was Specialreinigung Meissen, a small industrial cleaning company in the eastern state of Saxony. It paid Dollars 500,000 for the plant. 'This was a kind of test case for us. We knew there would be plenty of contracts in this line of business in east Germany,' said Mr Lee. Mercer was committed to guaranteeing 40 jobs and investing DM300,000 (Dollars 191,000). 'All the capital investments have now been carried out,' said Mr Lee, a 37-year-old who has maintained close contacts with his business connections in South Korea, where he was born. According to Mr Stephen Weinress, of Friend, Weinress and Frankson, a California-based investment banker, Specialreinigung is expected to generate annual revenues of between Dollars 15m and Dollars 20m. Soon after the acquisition - and advised by, among others, Shin-Ho, one of South Korea's largest paper groups which last year had a turnover of nearly Dollars 1bn - Mercer started looking at the paper industry in east Germany. But by 1992, there was overcapacity both in Europe and North America and prices started to fall sharply. This make life difficult for the Treuhand; it had been negotiating with a French company to sell off Dresden Papier, eastern Germany's largest paper mills which before unification had a workforce of 30,800 and 126 plants. By early 1993, the deal with the French had collapsed. The Treuhand was desperate to find a buyer. Dresden Papier approached Mercer. 'We were sure the paper industry would turn eventually. And in any case, because of Germany's strict environmental laws which require companies to recycle at least 50 per cent of their waste products, we believed we would have a wide market. We also had the advantage that the Treuhand was seeking a quick deal.' When the Treuhand took over Dresden Papier, based in Saxony, centre of the German printing and publishing world before the second world war, the company was in poor shape. The Russian market, which accounted for most of Dresden Papier's greaseproof paper sales, had collapsed and losses exceeded DM60m. To prepare it for privatisation, the Treuhand invested DM100m - primarily in new equipment, including de-inking facilities. The Treuhand drew up a generous contract with Mercer. The agency agreed to pick up DM45m estimated losses for 1993, provide an additional DM30m for losses during 1994 and 1995 and cover redundancy costs. It also agreed to contribute to 90 per cent of the DM10m environmental liabilities while Mercer received investment grants worth 32 per cent of the total DM75m which Mercer had committed to invest. 'We paid DM1m for Dresden Papier, and injected DM20m as a sign of good faith. We also agreed to guarantee 490 jobs,' said Mr Lee. A year after the deal was completed, Mercer acquired the Rosenthal plant in Thuringia, with similar favourable terms. The question is what kind of strategy does Mercer want to pursue in Germany. Ms Frances Campion, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Asset Management in London, believes Mercer's move to Europe represents 'an interesting investment. It will give them exposure not only in east Germany, but in the European paper industry.' Mr Weinress, who has followed Mercer closely, says the company 'wants to be a leader in the European recycled speciality paper market, but it still lacks credibility in the US. . . it should move out of Vancouver if it wants to be taken seriously by investors and the US market.' With Shin-Ho as a partner, Mercer believes it can use the Rosenthal plant, one of the most modern pulp enterprises in eastern Germany, to recycle 80 per cent of its raw material consisting of waste, something of which Germany's environmental lobby would approve. It will be able also to integrate its three acquisitions and capture not only the local market but expand into western Germany. 'We are now one of the principal users of waste in Dresden. Dresden Papier is running at full capacity - 235,000 tonnes. We expect a turnover of Dollars 95m this year, there's no reason why we cannot keep costs down.' Already, 90 per cent of Dresden Papier's products, which include high-grade, recycled writing and printing papers, are sold to the west German market. Its wallpaper sales account for 18 per cent of the total German market. In addition, now that Russian capital, which flowed out of Russia during the early 1990s, is slowly returning to the country, Dresden Papier is again selling greaseproof paper to the Russians. But consistent with his philosophy, Mr Lee is not prepared to sit back. Eastern Europe beckons. 'Our staff at Dresden Papier have an excellent knowledge of printing operations as well as contacts in eastern Europe. The east Europeans used to be trained in Saxony. We have big advantages. We are interested in looking at Hungary and the Czech Republic. And Saxony is so close to these countries,' said Mr Lee. Mr Weinress believes that Mercer's presence in Germany will give it a better focus as well as give it foothold in the middle of Europe. 'But if Mercer wants to get that respectability it lacks, it should think about getting listed on the New York Stock Exchange,' he adds.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SURFERS' BUSINESS AIMS FOR PROFITS, CLEAN WATER;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: TWO MIDDLE-AGED SURFERS HAVE FOUNDED A COMPANY TO SELL  SURF-ORIENTED PRODUCTS AND SAVE THE WAVES AND BEACHES THEY USED TO PLAY ON.  </P> <P> For graying surfers Glenn Hening and John Van Hamersveld, the endless summer  has given way to the winter of discontent.  </P> <P> Their home waves off Malibu beach are almost as crowded as the freeways, and  the perils of riding them now include not just the dreaded wipeout, but the  risk of infection from polluted water.  </P> <P> But instead of simply bemoaning what has happened to the waves, Hening and Van  Hamersveld are doing something about it. They have formed an information and  licensing company, Geo Surf, which they hope will provide common ground for  surfers, environmentalists, makers of wet suits, developers and everyone else  with an interest in the state of the waves and beaches. A portion of any money  the company makes, the men say, will be used for projects to enhance coastal  health.  </P> <P> Cowabunga! Corporate surfer activists? Yes, indeed, say Hening and Van  Hamersveld, who believe surfers are in a unique position to appreciate that the  waves and beaches constitute an endangered natural resource. They see their  company as evidence that surfing is growing up, looking beyond the perfect wave  for practical solutions to the pollution, overdevelopment and other complex  problems that threaten the pastime they love.  </P> <P> "Because we're surfers, people aren't going to expect this from us," said  Hening, 38, a former competitive surfer who wrote computer code for the Jet  Propulsion Laboratory and now does curriculum development for the Oxnard Union  High School District.  </P> <P> As founder of the Surfrider Foundation in 1984, Hening was one of the first to  realize that the world's estimated 3 to 4 million surfers constitute more than  a market for boards and sunscreen.  </P> <P> Personally, Hening said, he wanted to be proud, instead of embarrassed, to say  that he was a surfer. Other surfers, too, he felt, needed an outlet for their  mature, even educated concerns about the environment in which they play. Today  the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation has 5,000 members and a full-time staff. The  Huntington Beach-based foundation takes legal and other action to protect surf  spots, water quality and coastal access.  </P> <P> Hening has experienced surfing as an obsession -- in the 1970s, he lived on a  beach in El Salvador, making and selling peanut butter to support his  wave-riding habit. Van Hamersveld, too, invested large chunks of his youth in  obsessively riding the waves off Palos Verdes Cove with board maker Phil Becker  and others who would become surfing legends.  </P> <P> A graphic designer, Van Hamersveld, 48, created one of the genuine icons of the  surfing craze in 1964 -- the Day-Glo poster for Bruce Brown's movie "The  Endless Summer" that is now in the permanent design collection of the Museum of  Modern Art. Perhaps best known as the designer of album covers for the Beatles  ("Magical Mystery Tour"), the Rolling Stones and other rockers, he also created  trademarks for the beach-influenced sportswear lines, GOTCHA and Jimmy'Z.  </P> <P> A major difference between Geo Surf and the Surfrider Foundation, the men say,  is that the new venture is a business.  </P> <P> "We're taking a corporate approach," said Hening.  </P> <P> The first venture of the new company, still in the process of being  incorporated, will involve packaging and disseminating information, according  to its founders. Its first "product" will be a Geo Surf symposium, to be held  in July on the campus of Pepperdine University.  </P> <P> The symposium is designed to bring together all the major groups with a  personal or commercial interest in the surf, Hening said. The conference, which  its creators hope will become an annual event, will allow participants to  "share and acquire new knowledge concerning the issues, the science and the  magic of waves and beaches," according to a conference brochure.  </P> <P> Hening said he hopes that the conference will allow for "the mature exchange of  ideas" among all the groups that need the beaches.  </P> <P> "We're not saying the lion will lie down with the lamb, but we're very  interested in seeing professional surfers in the same room as real estate  developers," he said.  </P> <P> Geo Surf is not categorically anti-development, according to Hening. He sees  the company's willingness to give a hearing to all groups with an interest in  the surf, including businesses, as evidence of its maturity and of his own. (He  used to be appalled, he recalled, at any attempt to commercialize surfing,  which he saw as essentially a spiritual activity.)  </P> <P> Van Hamersveld has designed a red-and-blue logo for Geo Surf, which the men are  registering as a trademark.  </P> <P> Eventually, they plan to license the name and logo. Van Hamersveld said his  experiences with "The Endless Summer," GOTCHA and Jimmy'Z have persuaded him of  the commercial power of surf-related licensing. The Geo Surf imprint, for  example, might appear on a TV project, a film or on more conventional products,  such as sunscreen, he said.  </P> <P> There are other possibilities: Geo Surf might serve as a consultant to  companies that want to tap into the surfer market. It may also market a  computerized surf information service.  </P> <P> The founders say that at least half of the profits from such ventures will be  plowed back into pro-surfing projects, such as building artificial reefs or  blocking development that would harm existing surf spots. Van Hamersveld said  he especially likes the idea of raising money for good works through the sale  of products that are beneficial and allow "consumers to support environmental  causes in a direct way."  </P> <P> One immediate goal of Geo Surf is a selfish one: to save the men's own surf  spot, off Malibu's Surfrider Beach. Over the years, both men continued to be  passionate surfers, despite occasionally being treated like old coots as they  queue up to surf traffic-jammed Third Point.  </P> <P> But two years ago, Van Hamersveld had to give up the sport because he began to  have skin eruptions after surfing, caused, his physician advised him, by  viruses in the water. Although he continues to surf, Hening, too, is appalled  by the water quality off Surfrider, especially since it became his 4-year-old  daughter's surf spot.  </P> <P> Surfrider is especially unsavory whenever water from Malibu Lagoon, polluted by  sewage and bird droppings, is flushed into the sea by acts of man or nature.  This occurs after high tides, heavy rains or the intervention of a Department  of Parks and Recreation bulldozer, which regularly cuts a channel between the  lagoon and the ocean to keep Malibu Colony septic tanks from backing up.  </P> <P> "Malibu: The Microcosm for the Future of Surfing" is prominently featured on  the program of the upcoming Geo Surf convention. As a first small step toward  improving Surfrider, the men believe the surf-using public should be informed  of lagoon bacteria counts and bulldozer arrival times. "We've got a real  personal stake in this," Hening said. But beyond that, he believes Malibu could  serve as an attention-getting case study of how a troubled beach can be turned  around.  </P> <P> "This is a very good place to set an example," he said.  </P></p>

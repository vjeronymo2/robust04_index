			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / City disappointed at Pounds 3.2bn budget deficit The government's budget deficit deepened unexpectedly to Pounds 3.21bn in August from Pounds 1.1bn in July, well above City forecasts of Pounds 2.1bn. But the public sector borrowing requirement for the first five months of the financial year was Pounds 15.5bn, down from Pounds 18.1bn in the same period last year, indicating that the Treasury is still on course to reach its forecast of Pounds 36.1bn for the PSBR in 1994-95. Part of the reason for this month's figure was high central government outlays and smaller repayments by local authorities and public corporations. Analysts were disappointed by the August figure - but remained optimistic about long-term PSBR prospects, predicting a deficit of between Pounds 30bn and Pounds 34bn. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'This month's deficit will restrain wildly optimistic forecasts. But it is better to look at a run of months because you will realise that tax receipts in general are rising more strongly than public expenditure, so an undershoot on the government's forecast is still on the cards.' Receipts from taxes, excise duties and other income totalled Pounds 17.19bn for August, up from Pounds 15.56bn in the same month last year, but down from Pounds 19.3bn in July. In the five months to August cash income was Pounds 87.1bn, a rise of 5.5 per cent from Pounds 82.5bn in the same period in 1993-94. Cash outlays for August were Pounds 20.97bn, up from Pounds 20.39bn in August last year and Pounds 20.79bn in July. In the five months to August cash outlays were Pounds 104.1bn, up 2.5 per cent from Pounds 101.5bn in the equivalent period last year. Net departmental outlays in the five months were Pounds 98.3bn, similar to the same period in 1993-94. The auction of privatised companies' debt brought in Pounds 1.3bn in August. If these privatisation proceeds are excluded, the August deficit was Pounds 4.49bn and the running figure for the year is Pounds 17.7bn, compared with Pounds 21.6bn in the same period last year. Central government borrowing on its own account was Pounds 3.8bn in August and Pounds 17bn for the financial year to date, against Pounds 19bn in the same five months last year. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the figure rose to Pounds 5.1bn in August, Pounds 19.3bn for the year.</p>

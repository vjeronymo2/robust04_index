			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Treasury forecast 'complacent': Ernst &amp; Young Item Club less optimistic on prospects for inflation and growth The Treasury's upbeat forecast for the economy, published last week, is today described as 'complacent' by a research group, the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club. The Item Club, the only private-sector forecaster which uses the Treasury's economic model, predicts that next year inflation will be higher, and growth lower, than the Treasury expects. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, said last week that Britain faced 'quite the best combination of circumstances, pointing to sustained growth and low inflation' that he could remember for a 'a very, very long time'. Item's central forecast is that growth in gross domestic product will fall to just under 2.5 per cent next year, from 2.8 per cent this year. The Treasury's forecast for both years is 2.75 per cent. The club says underlying inflation will rise to 3.4 per cent next year from 2.6 per cent this year. The Treasury's forecast for annual inflation in the fourth quarter next year is just 2.75 per cent. The club's summer report says: 'The key risk facing growth prospects in the UK is a loss of confidence in the private sector. The threat is not so much the large tax increases but the impact of the steepest three-month rise in bond yields since earlier this century.' The rise in bond yields signals 'a substantial deterioration in inflation expectations' according to the report. 'If the financial markets are right about inflation, as a result of a commodity price shock or a smaller amount of slack in the economy than thought, then the economy could be in a problem in the pre-election years of 1996-97.' The club believes there is still enough slack in the labour market to keep inflation within the government's target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. Nevertheless, the Bank of England will have to respond to signs of accelerating inflation by increasing base rates from the current 5.25 per cent to 6.5 per cent. The Treasury expects consumer spending to grow 3 per cent next year, but the club says higher bond yields and tax increases will restrict next year's consumer spending growth to 1.6 per cent. Slower growth will result in slower tax revenue growth and make it difficult for Mr Clarke to achieve his public sector borrowing requirement targets and tax cuts, it says. The Scottish economy is forecast to lag behind that of the rest of the UK this year, Scotland's principal economic research body says, James Buxton writes. The Fraser of Allander Institute predicts economic growth in Scotland of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent this year, compared with 3 per cent for the UK as a whole. It says that although the short-term outlook for the Scottish economy is generally favourable it will lag behind the rest of the UK because its manufacturing industry is more dependent on exports. Scotland, which receives proportionately more from government spending than England, will suffer disproportionately from spending cuts, as well as from tax increases, with value added tax on fuel having more effect in Scotland because of the colder climate. The institute expects manufacturing output to grow by 3 per cent, with continued strong growth in the electronics and electrical engineering sectors. Economic Commentary June 1994.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report: "Case of the State Committee for </F> the State of Emergency: What Orders Did Mikhail Gorbachev  Give?"]    [Text] The Russian Federation Supreme Court Military  Collegium has been hearing Marshal Dmitriy Yazov, former USSR  defense minister, practically all this week. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  has already stressed, the examination of one of the State  Committee for the State of Emergency's key figures gives rise to  many questions, and not only from state prosecution  representatives.    Yazov stated the precise number of troops brought into the  capital and also told of the subunits which were to have  reinforced this grouping. In his opinion, halting the process  of the USSR's disintegration was entirely practicable in these  conditions. Just one small thing was lacking -- plans to  introduce a state of emergency had to be supported by Mikhail  Gorbachev.    During the examination it also emerged that troops had been  brought into Moscow even earlier and what is more, Yazov  stressed, often on Gorbachev's oral instructions. This took  place three or four times in 1990-1991, as a rule prior to the  opening of the next Supreme Soviet session and on holidays. The  president's edict on joint patrolling by Ministry of Internal  Affairs and Defense Ministry forces served as the basis for this.    There is another aspect of the examination which is of no  mean importance. Yazov stressed that many leaders of former  Union republics -- Georgia, Lithuania, and Ukraine -- had  reacted to the State Committee for the State of Emergency  members' plans "with understanding." True, it is difficult to  judge how deep and sincere this "understanding" was. Most  likely the "let's wait and see" principle was operating here.    However much the Military Collegium tries to avoid the  trial's political slant, it nonetheless emerges from time to  time. Thus, during a recess between sessions (on Thursday) [27  January] defendant Anatoliy Lukyanov went up to Roman Barsegyan,  state prosecution representative, and asked him: "Why are you  participating in this sordid affair and what will happen to you  after the trial?" Barsegyan regarded this as a blatant attempt  to put pressure on a prosecutor's office representative, which  is what he told the court members after the recess. The  Military Collegium called on all participants in the trial to  "observe propriety."    On Friday the examination of Yazov went on behind closed  doors, so the press was not allowed into the courtroom. It has  been ascertained that former USSR KGB Chairman Vladimir  Kryuchkov also answered questions from the court, state  prosecution, attorneys, and defendants yesterday.    The next session in the case of the State Committee for the  State of Emergency will take place next Tuesday [1 February].</p>

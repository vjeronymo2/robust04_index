			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Robeco assets rise 20% to Fl 56bn ROBECO Group, the big Dutch-based fund manager, said its assets under management rose by a strong 20 per cent to Fl 55.7bn (Dollars 29.3bn) in the first half of 1993, helped by large gains on investments as well as a substantial inflow of new funds. Robeco, the group's flagship equity fund achieved a 15.6 per cent return on investment, including dividend reinvestment. The strongest performance was turned in by Robeco's regional investment vehicle, RG Pacific Fund, which produced a result of 27.6 per cent. Its Europe fund saw an 11.9 per cent advance, while its America fund saw a rise of 8 per cent. Overall, eight of the group's 12 bourse-listed investment funds achieved half-year results of more than 10 per cent. Rotterdam-based Robeco said that although first-half investment results had exceeded historical full-year averages, it expects a further increase in results for the rest of 1993. This development will be spurred by additional decreases in short-term interest rates in Europe, bolstering stock and bond prices and prompting investors to move out of deposits into other investment vehicles. It attributed the first-half results to the buoyancy of world financial markets caused by lower interest rates, as well as to favourable currency movements. In the first-half, Robeco's client base rose by 50,000 to 530,000.</p>

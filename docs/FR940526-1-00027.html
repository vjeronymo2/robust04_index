Once issued, the final regulations amending part 76 would require a State to submit its State plan and other related documents under a given program by a date certain or face deferral of the date on which the State may begin to obligate funds under the program. The Secretary also defers until the final regulations become effective the decision not to grant pre-award costs before the date a State may begin to obligate funds. The Secretary takes these actions to assist States in the transition to full implementation of the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Peter Wathen-Dunn, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., room 4091, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;2243. Telephone: (202) 401&hyph;3690. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On December 16, 1993 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 65856) that proposed to amend 34 CFR 76.703 to delay the date a State may begin to obligate funds under a State administered program if certain circumstances existed involving late submission of a State plan. The Secretary also stated his intention not to authorize pre-award costs to any State that was late in submitting its State plan. The proposed amendment and the decision about pre-award costs were made necessary by the passage of the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA). The effect of the CMIA and the proposed rule are described in the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received 60 comments in response to the NPRM from State educational agencies, State fiscal offices, a trust territory, the Treasury Department, and three national organizations. Most States asked the Department to defer the proposed rule so that it would not apply to funds made available for obligation this calendar year. The commenters also asked that the Secretary not apply the decision not to grant pre-award costs this year if a State is late in submitting its State plan. In addition to asking for the deferrals, the commenters raised many questions that must be answered before the rule can be issued and become effective. The Secretary has decided to issue the final rule this summer and defer its application to the submission of state plans made in the spring and summer of 1995. The Secretary also has decided to defer the decision not to grant pre-award costs. These decisions are intended to give States additional time to adjust their State plan development processes to the timelines envisioned for the submission of state plans in 1995. This deferral will also give the Department the time needed to fully answer all of the questions raised by the commenters and to make any changes to the proposed rule that may be appropriate in the light of the comments. However, for this transitional year, the Secretary encourages States to submit plans on a timely basis, as proposed in the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary plans to publish a final rulemaking document this summer that will apply to State plan submissions made in the spring or summer of 1995. That final rulemaking document will amend 34 CFR 76.703 and implement the decision not to grant pre-award costs to a State that is late in submitting a State plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number does not apply) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 19, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard Riley, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of Education. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12788 Filed 5&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TEACHERS RESUME PICKETING, HALF OF PUPILS OUT; STRIKE ENTERS 2ND WEEK  </P> <P> Striking teachers returned to the picket lines and more than half the students  in the Los Angeles Unified School District continued to stay out of classes  today as the district's teacher walkout entered its second week.  </P> <P> Los Angeles school board members began closed-door meetings this morning and  striking teachers staged a massive rally at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, but  no new talks between the two sides are planned.  </P> <P> Negotiations between the district and representatives of United Teachers-Los  Angeles broke off Sunday with union leaders charging the school board with bad  faith bargaining. The district has offered teachers a 21.5% pay hike over three  years with the possibility of an additional 2.5% increase for the next school  year. The teachers are asking for a guaranteed 26% pay increase over three  years as well as a stronger voice in how schools are run.  </P></p>

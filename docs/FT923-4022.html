			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Letter: Education: mixed messages and incompatible grades Sir, Last week the Engineering Council told us that it wanted to add technology to the list of A-levels ('Engineers warn on A-level courses', September 1). This week, the British Institute of Management tells us that it wants to replace all A-levels ('Patten steps up GCSE attack', September 7). The post-16 further education sector is totally flexible and willing to be demand-led, but it would be helpful if the consumers could get together and articulate for us a consistent and coherent message. Is it not now time for a national forum to identify this demand with the Department of Education and the Department of Employment acting as facilitators rather than gate-keepers.

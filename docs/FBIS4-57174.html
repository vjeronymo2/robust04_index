			<p>BFN     [Text] The enormous potential in using the crude oil  extracted in Varadero in waterproofing road surfaces and  maintaining road infrastructure has been analyzed and discussed  at a national workshop held in Matanzas.    Specialists and professionals from all over Cuba gathered in  Matanzas and met in two committees: one on waterproofing; one on  road maintenance. This gathering was chaired by engineers Jesus  Perez Othon and Ramon Rodriguez, respectively first vice  minister of Basic Industry and first vice minister of  Construction.    Perez Othon discussed the current situation of Cuban heavy  crude and the possibilities for making deliveries to  construction enterprises. Rodriguez, for his part, talked about  the need to generalize experiences with using Cuban crude  because the results are very good if these experiences are  properly applied, if the proper technical controls are observed.    The results in waterproofing road surfaces in Matanzas have  been very good. Matanzas has been applying what is known as  Varadero Asphalt for over 15 years now, and these experiences  are already being successfully implemented in other provinces,  like Havana City Province.    The road infrastructure must be repaired and given  maintenance immediately, and Cuban crude is being used on  stretches of the central highway, such as the stretch of road  linking Camaguey and Ciego de Avila. This product is also being  used to repair the Via Blanca, and it will be used to (?tackle  the potholes) in the cities.    Upon closing this event, engineer Jorge Revuelta, vice  minister of Construction, said all the nation's provinces will  have to work hard at using Cuban crude, and that the technicians  of the different provinces will seek better variants so as to  become more efficient and improve quality.</p>

Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, Aleksander Hall  said that the decision of the majority of communes to delay the  date of taking control over primary schools was the result of  centralist policy of the government coalition. According to  Hall, the left-wing groupings halted the process of  decentralisation and weakened the prestige of local authorities.  Hall announced that the PK would take steps to create  anti-socialist coalitions during the forthcoming local  government elections.    Pawel Zalewski strongly criticised the draft budget for 1994  for what he termed as excessive fiscalism and the upholding of  ineffective system of social security and insurances as well as  the failure to reform the public sector.    According to Zalewski, the draft budget for 1994  demonstrates  that the "coalition has no will nor concept of reforming the  insurance system and the public sector, while its shortsighted  policy is designed to help the coalition to remain in power."</p>

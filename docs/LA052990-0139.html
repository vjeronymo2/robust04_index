			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TONY AWARDS WILL BE TONED DOWN, TUNED UP  </P> <P> There will be some changes made when they give out the Tony Awards this year if  Joseph Cates has his way -- he wants to take out the glitzy variety numbers and  all those boring thank-you speeches.  </P> <P> Cates, who has a couple of Emmys on his shelf for past musical programs, is  likely to prevail since he's the executive producer of "The 44th Annual Tony  Awards" special to air on CBS Sunday.  </P> <P> Cates -- brother of Gil Cates, who did last year's Academy Awards show, father  of actress Phoebe Cates and therefore father-in-law of Kevin Kline, has never  done a Tony show before.  </P> <P> "The first thing I did was to screen the last six of them," he said in an  interview.  </P> <P> He said the heart of the program are the scenes from eight Broadway shows, four  musicals and four straight plays.  </P> <P> "They are a cut above what television accomplishes, since they have been  rehearsed for seven weeks out of town and in regional theater and then are  performed on Broadway. A very high degree of performance is achieved.  </P> <P> "So I eliminated the TV variety numbers. Variety hasn't worked on television  for a long time. There will be no opening number, no middle number, no salute  or closing number. I also eliminated the awkward exchanges between the  presenters and the winners."  </P> <P> He said he tried to group things differently -- for instance putting together  the three big awards for director, actor and actress in a play.  </P> <P> Five times during the evening the stage will go dark except for a single  spotlight that will play on a single actor.  </P> <P> "That's the essence of theater -- the single actor who commands you with his  personality, charisma and talent."  </P> <P> The single spot will shine on Morgan Freeman performing "All the world's a  stage" from "As You Like It," Kevin Kline instructing the players from  "Hamlet," Geraldine Fitzgerald doing a scene from "The Royal Family," Len  Cariou as James Tyrone in "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and Philip Bosco  reciting "Our revels now are ended" from "The Tempest."  </P> <P> He also has tried to bring in big stars from film and television who still  return to the theater -- Kathleen Turner as host, along with Matthew Broderick,  Jessica Tandy, Christopher Reeve, Michael Crawford, Bernadette Peters, James  Earl Jones, Sandy Duncan, Linda Lavin, Tyne Daily, Lily Tomlin, Timothy Hutton  and Dixie Carter.  </P></p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Conservative MPs turn fury on Bundesbank TORY Euro-sceptics reacted with fury to the publication of the Bundesbank note about who was to blame for sterling's difficulties on 'Black Wednesday', queueing up to make their views known. Perhaps more surprisingly - but also more significantly - their response offered immediate support for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Earlier in the week some of the same MPs had condemned him for his perceived apology to the Germans over press coverage of Bundesbank behaviour as the pound was suspended from the European exchange rate mechanism. Indeed, it was the sort of rhetoric adopted by the Euro-sceptics after Black Wednesday and Mr Lamont's apparent apology that may have contributed to the Bundesbank's decision to make available as it did the information about its own actions as sterling fell out of the ERM. Even after a senior minister had urged an end to the slanging match with Germany, leading Euro-sceptics continued to speak out. Mr Kenneth Baker, a former cabinet minister, described the release of the paper as a 'disgraceful episode', and insisted that Mr Lamont should not resign. 'If Norman Lamont were to go as a result of that, in effect the chairman of the Bundesbank would virtually be appointing the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. I don't think that is accept-able,' Mr Baker said on BBC radio. Sir Teddy Taylor MP, secretary of the dissident Tory Euro Reform Group, called the row an 'undeniable insult' to Britain. 'Within days of the chancellor apologising to them for their distress at the criticisms of the Bundesbank, they are rubbing our noses in it,' he said. Another Tory MP, Mr Stephen Milligan, accused the Bundesbank of pointlessly trying to stir up the row, albeit in more measured tones than some of his colleagues. 'The problem, it seems to me, is that both sides are looking for a villain to explain what happened to sterling on Black Wednesday. 'It wasn't the Germans, it wasn't the British Government, it was a combination of events, notably the imminence of a French referendum,' Mr Milligan said. The leadership of the opposition Labour party, meeting in Blackpool for their annual conference, entered the row on the Bundesbank's side, claiming it as evidence that the government had been 'economical with the truth'. Labour Euro-sceptics seemed less enthusiastic than their Tory counterparts to enter the row on either side.</p>

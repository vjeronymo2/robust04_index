			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican President  Joaquin Balaguer today expressed his opposition to a military  intervention in Haiti to oust the military government that  overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991.  Nevertheless, he warned that the Dominican Government is  prepared to protect the joint border.    Balaguer said he is confident that due to the Latin American  government's rejection of an invasion, the international  community will not reach the extreme of invading Haiti.    He said dialogue between the two sides in conflict in Haiti  could contribute to the return of democracy in that country and  he explained that Dominican authorities are ready to defend and  protect the 386-km border shared with Haiti on the island of  Hispaniola, in case of a military invasion.    Balaguer has repeatedly opposed the embargo imposed on Haiti  by the international community. Nevertheless, since the end of  May there has been strict compliance with the sanctions, to the  point of preventing Haitians from obtaining food and medicine in  the Dominican Republic. The Dominican president has ordered  approximately 15,000 soldiers to guard the border with Haiti to  prevent the violation of the international embargo against that  country. Border surveillance intensified after Balaguer held  several meetings with UN and U.S. officials in Santo Domingo.  The heavy border surveillance, which prevents Haitians and  Dominicans from trading on the border, has caused at least three  Haitian deaths in the past 15 days during attacks on Dominican  soldiers who prevent Haitians from crossing the border.</p>

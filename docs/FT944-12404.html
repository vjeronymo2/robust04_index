			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: UBS 'unlikely' to match last year's record income Union Bank of Switzerland, which is in the midst of a proxy battle with its largest shareholder over its business strategy, has said its 1994 net income will be lower than the record SFr2.27bn (Dollars 1.8bn) it made last year. 'Last year's excellent result is unlikely to be reached,' UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, said in a statement on third-quarter trading. Earlier, it had left open the possibility of matching the 1993 result. The bank blamed unfavourable market conditions for a decline in third-quarter profits. No figures were given, but it said both net interest income and trading income were down, although the trading result was 'substantially higher' than in the previous quarter. Fee and commission income were said to be 'excellent', marking the only contrast with the third-quarter report of Credit Suisse which said last week its commissions business suffered a 'slight downturn'. UBS said commissions from its corporate finance business were unsatisfactory. Expenses were down noticeably. As in the case of Credit Suisse, bad loan provisions were reduced but remained at a high level.</p>

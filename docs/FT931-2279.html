			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions - The Budget and You THE COMBINATION of a strong market and anticipation of the Budget did little to entice directors into making investments and selling remained the most noticeable feature of the week. Five of the board at Wyevale Garden Centres, including Christopher Powell, the non-executive chairman, Brian Evans, the chief executive and Stephen Murfin, the finance director sold a total of 612,000 shares at 173p. At the same time last year, Peter Williamson, the deputy chairman, sold 500,000 shares at 171p. Since then the shares have underperformed by more than 15 per cent relative to the market. Each director still retains a sizeable number of shares. Linx Printing Technologies came to the market in mid-October last year and is involved in the manufacture and sale of continuous ink jet printers used in the identification and coding of products. W Harris, the chairman, sold 300,000 shares at 183p. The purchase by Paul Roy at Smith New Court, the financial services group, follows a period of strong outperformance. His purchase was made at 164p and the shares are currently trading at 176p. Six of the board of Harry Ramsden's, the fish and chip shop chain, purchased a total of 41,212 'B' shares at 100p each.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                 Sector      Shares      Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barclays                Bank        10,000         40             1 Berry, Birch &amp;Noble     InsB        24,000         24             2 Courtaulds Textiles     Text         3,000         18             1 Davenport Vernon        Motr        16,500         23             1 Domino Printing Sci     Elns         2,500         15             1 Feedback                Elns       161,600         45             1 Gold Greenl Nil Pd      Med        517,526        207             3 Hambros                 Merc        13,360         42             1 Kingfisher Nl Pd Rt     Stor       102,682         97             1 Kleinwort Benson        Merc         5,000         19             1 Ladbroke Group          H&amp;L         50,000        104             1 Linx Printing Techn     Elns       300,000        549             1 Macro 4                 Elns         3,400         22             1 Malaya Group            Motr        60,000         16             1 Marks &amp; Spencer         Stor        10,699         37             1 Neotronics Techn        Elcs        10,000         18             1 Northern Foods          FdMa        10,600         30             1 Northumbrian Water      Watr        11,000         67             1 Radius                  Elns        70,150         46             1 Standard Chartered      Bank        74,324        522             1* Tomkinsons              Text         5,700         17             1 TR Tech Zr Div Pref     InTr        13,080         27             1 Vaux Group              Brew        25,780         58             1* Wyevale Garden Cntr     Stor       612,000      1,059             5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BICC ADR                Elcs        20,000   Dlrs 109             1 BTR                     OthI         3,000         18             1 Goodhead Group          Med        150,000         30             1 Hambro Countrywide      Prop        40,000         20             1 Primadona               InTr        20,000         34             1 Ramsden's (Harry) B     H&amp;L         40,212         40             6 Smith New Court         OthF        25,000         41             1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

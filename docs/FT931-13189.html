			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: OMV to reduce dividend OMV, the Austrian oil refining and chemicals group warns that it will show a loss for last year of about Sch300m (Dollars 26.3m) rather than break-even as the company had anticipated in November. The company said it would cut its dividend for the full year, proposing a pay-out of 15 per cent of its share capital, compared with a dividend of Sch20 per share in 1991. OMV has introduced further cost-cutting measures on top of the 900 job cuts made last year. The company said it would cut investment to Sch4bn from Sch6bn in 1992 as well as continuing to cut staffing levels. It made a loss of Sch383m in the first nine months of last year, but expected an improvement in the fourth quarter.</p>

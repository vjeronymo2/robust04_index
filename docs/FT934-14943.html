			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Sizewell C go-ahead sought amid safety fears NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned utility, is expected to provoke controversy today by submitting a planning application to build the country's biggest nuclear station at Sizewell in Suffolk. It is to brush aside Whitehall concerns that submitting an application for the Pounds 3.5bn twin reactor will complicate the controversy surrounding the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Sellafield whose future is under government review. Separately, a report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate leaked to the BBC yesterday raises questions about the safety software at Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised water reactor on which Sizewell C is modelled. The report says that while the software is of high quality it cannot be confident that Nuclear Electric's target failure rate, of one in every 10,000 times it is used, can be achieved. Nuclear Electric said its non-computerised back-up to the software provided standards as good as the primary systems at other nuclear power stations. It believed it could meet its targets. Sizewell C would be the biggest civil engineering project in the country, providing more than 15,000 jobs during the 10 years of its construction and commissioning, according to the company. The submission for the reactor will anger environmentalists, who believe that Nuclear Electric should hold back until the end of the government's nuclear review. This is due to start later this year and will examine whether further nuclear stations are necessary. The proposed plant would have a capacity of 2,600MW more than twice the capacity of Sizewell B, which is nearing completion on an adjacent site. Confirming Nuclear Electric's submission plans, Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said last night that the planning, building and commissioning process would take some years. 'The earliest we can commission the station is 2001,' he said. 'We do not want to pre-empt the nuclear review nor will we be able to do so. But we believe strongly that a replacement is needed for the Magnox nuclear stations.' An application by Nuclear Electric's predecessor, the CEGB, to build Sizewell B resulted in a three-year public inquiry in the 1980s. Nuclear Electric hopes to avoid a similar delay on Sizewell C by arguing that the safety implications have already examined in the B inquiry and another at Hinkley Point, Somerset. The economics of the project are likely to be examined in the nuclear review. The company says any inquiry into Sizewell C should therefore be restricted to general planning issues such as site access. Environmentalists are certain to press for a more wide-ranging review. Nuclear Electric generates about 23 per cent of England and Wales's annual electricity requirements and Mr Hawley said it would not expect to go much beyond 30 per cent. In the long run it hopes to operate six pressurised water reactor plants. The company is applying for planning consent to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989.</p>

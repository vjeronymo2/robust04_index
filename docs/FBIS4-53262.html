			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Hui-yong] </F>   [Text] Substitute fuel [taeyong yollyo] is being produced  on a large scale and is being utilized at the Obong cooperative  farm in Pongsan county.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: "An  important task in consolidating and developing the results of  the technical revolution in the rural areas is to complete land  readjustment and solve the problem of fuel necessary in  mechanizing the rural economy."    Previously, this farm has been using substitute fuel for  trucks. The functionaries and technicians here who keep in mind  the party's intention to use more substitute fuel, used  substitute fuel for tractors as well and are enhancing the rate  of operation. Therefore, fuel for trucks and tractors in this  farm are all produced and supplied by substitute fuel, thus  enhancing the rate of operation.    Experience from this cooperative farm shows that any kind of  work can be done by tractors that use the substitute fuel, which  will enhance the capability of the work. By operating the  tractors with substitute fuel at this cooperative farm, large  amounts of materials were transported every year. Every work  team and subwork team are using tractors that use substitute  fuel for harvesting and plowing. This cooperative farm is  planning to use substitute fuel in plowing all the fields and  harrowing this year, and is vigorously pushing ahead with this  project. These days, the fighters for rural mechanization are  producing more substitute fuel, are enhancing the rate of  operation of the tractors, and are carrying out quality field  plowing.    In the past, functionaries and technicians here used  substitute fuel to operate water meter and threshing machines.  They also used it in irrigating dry fields and in threshing.    By making effective use of this experience, functionaries  here have set the goal this year to use substitute fuel in  irrigating dry fields, threshing rice and corn, and are  prudently organizing the work to fulfill such a goal.</p>

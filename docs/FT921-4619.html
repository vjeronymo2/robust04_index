			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Ulster leaders likely to set talks agenda ULSTER'S POLITICAL leaders are expected to concentrate on setting an agenda for post general election talks when they meet in Belfast today. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the Unionist leaders, Dr John Alderdice, the Alliance party leader, and Mr John Hume, of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, will examine ways of picking up the threads of the inter-party talks which were shelved last July. The first stage of these talks is concerned with finding an acceptable formula for governing Northern Ireland. It is understood the four leaders are determined not to conduct negotiations through the media and will be keeping their discussions private. The British and Irish governments are optimistic that the talks, chaired by Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make progress. There is speculation that today's session will be adjourned tonight and recommence after the general election. Once the election is over a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference is expected to announce a formal suspension of its meetings to facilitate the talks. Mr Brooke has said that what had been agreed between the governments was 'admirably flexible'. Later, the second round of the talks will concentrate on relationships between Belfast and Dublin, before moving on to discuss links between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

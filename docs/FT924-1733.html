			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Letter: UK's old enthusiasm for training needs to be rekindled Sir, Peter McGregor's letter about training (December 12) makes an important point. Training in industry after the second world war was carried out in many companies with enthusiasm and vigour. There were training-within-industry programmes sponsored by government; part-time release for young people to have one day's study a week; well-established apprenticeship schemes on a new 'sandwich course' basis; together with the benefits from 'productivity reports' on US practice in operator training, supervisor training and management development. By the 1950s these were a minimum for most industrial companies, where so many ex-service personnel had themselves seen the effectiveness of military training. This was certainly the case at Ford. Some of that work will have been sustained and improved upon. But it is tragically true that for 20 years or so when we in British management were distracted by industrial relations problems and by transient educational fashions those earlier standards were often allowed to lapse. Fortunately there is a new management awareness of the need to re-establish training as a priority, and this government has done much to that end. But we lack a clear national pattern, and that old enthusiasm has yet to be rekindled. Oscar De Ville, Bexton Cottage, 18 Pound Lane, Sonning on Thames, Berks RG4 0XE</p>

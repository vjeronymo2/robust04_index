			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister, foreign </F> minister, and head of Shinseito, by an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The coalition parties are  evenly divided for and against on the issue of a cabinet  reshuffle.    [Hata] Once someone talks about it, everyone talks about it,  and then you have disagreements.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Why have a reshuffle now?    [Hata] It is true a reshuffle is being discussed. If things  are left as they are at the moment we will be criticized.  People will complain that we are in disarray.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have said your basic position is  that a cabinet should not be reshuffled on a regular basis.    [Hata] Yes, but the coalition government is still in its  early stages, and its composite parties sometimes find  themselves in peculiar circumstances. Besides, the parties did  not come to power because they won the election, so the  situation we have now is somewhat unusual.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people have said you might  become the new chief cabinet secretary.    [Hata] I have not heard of it.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you still believe a party leader  should not be chief cabinet secretary?    [Hata] This is not an issue because of Masayoshi Takemura,  but about the post of chief cabinet secretary. We should not  have believed that anyone within the coalition could be chief  cabinet secretary. We must think about personnel matters more  carefully.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] If there is to be a cabinet  reshuffle, do you think we will have a clearer picture of future  political reorganization than we have now?    [Hata] If you are asking me whether there is common  agreement among the parties of political realignment, I must say  that is not the case. There are questions to be answered.  Should all the parties be dissolved and merged into one, new  group? Or should they become two groups? If they are divided  into groups, will they function well? I personally prefer the  idea of two major forces.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You mean the coalition forces should  become one force?    [Hata] Yes. They have gone through many difficulties to  come this far. It is important to hold on to this framework,  even though there will be difficulties in organizing them into a  single party.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does this concept find common ground  with Prime Minister Hosokawa's concept of a "single floor group."    [Hata] His concept is one of the choices. After all, can we  face the election divided? It would be very tough. The next  general election will be held under the single-seat district  system. We will have difficulties even with our forces combined.  Dividing them will have an adverse impact on the election as  far as proportional representation is concerned as well. If  both groups are interested only in assuming leadership after the  election, they will never be able to compromise in an election  campaign.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] We understand there is an idea that  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] merges with the Japan New Party  first of all.    [Hata] That is one choice.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] One of the reasons for discord within  the coalition is said to be the discontent about the wish of  Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party] to lead the  coalition.    [Hata] I do not know why people want to talk about that so  much. In order to handle so many difficult issues in such a  short time, strong leadership was necessary. It was impossible  to take time and take it easy. I have never seen any reactions  myself, though I can understand the positions of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger  Party].    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Don't you think the basic issue of  the structure of the future political system is being confused  with the strategic issue of how to fight the next general  election?    [Hata] The issue concerns one party remaining in power too  long. The basic point remains that we must find a way to make a  change of government possible. I do not see much contradiction  between the two issues.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] So the fight in the future will  continue to be one between reformists and nonreformists?    [Hata] No, that will no longer be possible. Even among  those called conservatives, there are people who are changing  their thinking. There are now people who are moving toward the  creation of a new system, in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  as well as the coalition parties.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, said he could work with Shinseito.    [Hata] I do not want to say anything which might cause  ripples. Until now it has been debatable whether they were  really at the same venue when it came to discussing this issue.  But I think we can now openly talk about reform issues, even  with the LDP. That is important.</p>

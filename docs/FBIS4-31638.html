			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Lilov, leader of the BSP </F> Strategic Research Center, by Todor Tokin; place and date not  given: "Tribal Political Animosity Could Produce Grave  Consequences for Country"]    [Text] [Tokin] Mr. Lilov, how do you assess the 41st  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Congress?    [Lilov] This is a successful congress. The party's  political line is being clarified. I mean the main aspects of  this line -- elections, working out a practical policy, adopting  a long-range program, and continuing the renewal of the party.  I think that those steps are in the correct direction and that  this predetermined the congress' success.    [Tokin] The congress decided that the program prepared by  your Strategic Research Center will serve as the basis of the  party program. However, its adoption was postponed by three  months. How do you assess this move?    [Lilov] The most important things for me are that first, the  draft of the strategic center was adopted as the basis of the  party program, and second, that it was decided to incorporate in  our draft the most valuable elements of the precongressional  discussion and the other drafts published and discussed by the  party. The final form of the adoption is not fatal. However, a  negative effect will emerge if again requests and intentions are  voiced, which could prevent the adoption of the program either  directly or by infringing upon its basic ideas. I would not  like to think that the next three months will be utilized for  wasting time or directing the program's elaborations in an  incorrect direction.    [Tokin] How do you assess the election platform proposed by  Zhan Videnov, BSP chairman?    [Lilov] I assess very highly the idea of the party chairman,  but the program itself is rather raw. In addition, I think that  we need a program of a different type. At the congress I said  that the election platform should not specify what the BSP  proposes for the 21st century, but should say plainly to the  Bulgarian voters what the party is proposing for the 1994-98  period, which is relevant to those elections. The BSP must  propose a new, very clear, specific, pragmatic, and programmatic  policy in all areas.    [Tokin] Do you think that your line was defeated at the  congress, as the rumors in the corridors point out?    [Lilov] (Laughing) Yes, the corridors produced this thesis  about a defeat or a victory.... I do not think that this is so.  However, even if this is so, no one knows what he won, whom did  he defeat, and whether he lost something by being defeated.    [Tokin] Do you see yourself as DUMA chief editor? There was  such a proposal.    [Lilov] Oh please! This is an inappropriate proposal.    [Tokin] Do you not think that the BSP missed the best moment  for the elections?    [Lilov] This is a serious question. The strong policy and  the strong party that implements this policy could be identified  through many signs. One of them is the selection of the right  moment for its actions. Our party must select that moment for  the elections, which will be the most suitable one for the  country and for the policy that our party proposes. Therefore I  think that we discovered the concept "elections" only after an  excessively long and unjustified searching. We are late,  because most of the political factors in Bulgaria already  invoked this concept. However, I do not think that the BSP  missed this train. If the party proposes a good tactical policy  it has a chance. Elections in the fall could be successful for  the BSP if the party produces a good policy.    [Tokin] However, Professor Kyuranov said that if the BSP  selects the road of toppling Prof. Berov's cabinet, the Union of  Democratic Forces [SDS] could easily form a new government and  restore the old parliamentary majority, through which it could  rule until the end of 1995.    [Lilov] The people in Bulgaria must get used to the rules of  democracy. This factor that according to the laws and the rules  of democracy has the right and ability to form a government, can  indeed do so. Prof. Kyuranov cannot guarantee the BSP or the  leftist forces that if we constantly postpone the elections and  support a government which is losing credit, then what he fears  will not materialize. The issue is to conduct democratic and  free elections and form a high-quality parliament and strong  government in accordance with the wishes of the voters. We do  not need behind-the-scenes combinations and should not fear  elections.    [Tokin] Why do you not mention specific political factors  in your idea regarding a leftist-centrist agreement, which is  incorporated in the center's program?    [Lilov] It is the specific political market that will  propose specific political factors. This will happen when the  political scene becomes clear and one can see what election  platforms and forces emerge. If a postelection leftist-centrist  coalition is concerned, then one must see the situation in the  parliament after the elections. I have absolutely no dramatic  concern that the BSP could remain alone without partners. If it  succeeds to receive a solid majority in the parliament the  chances and possibilities of forming a leftist-centrist  coalition in the parliament will grow. This is a very clear and  promising idea. If this chance is missed, I think that we will  commit a grave error, which will not be applauded in any way by  history or the present and future generations.    [Tokin] You said that you relinquish all party posts. Does  this mean that you also relinquish the leadership of the  Strategic Research Center?    [Lilov] This is absolutely sincere. If I wanted the  leadership post I could have it without any difficulties. As  far as the strategic center is concerned -- this is not a party  post. There are no political appointments in science.    [Tokin] Your colleagues reproach you for not mentioning Zhan  Videnov when you speak about the party's new face. According to  you, who are the capable persons in the BSP?    [Lilov] Those are concocted accusations. Infighting is one  of our party's bad traditions.    I see Zhan Videnov's face among the new faces of our party,  but I want to stress that the party's elite does not consist  only of the posts in its leadership. We have certain  differences with the party leader regarding certain issues, but  I do not wish to dramatize them. I think that the party leader  must be independent. If Zhan Videnov obtains this independence  I will be the happiest member of the party.    Yanaki Stoilov is one of the most gifted persons in the  party. Aleksandur Marinov, Nikolay Kamov, and many other young  people are the hope of our party. I am glad that at such a  difficult moment the party can show so many new and promising  faces.    [Tokin] What are the main differences between the BSP and  the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party [BSDP]?    [Lilov] We have no profound programmatic differences. While  some of the BSDP leaders do not like this, it nevertheless is a  positive factor in relations between the two parties and a  wonderful prerequisite of developing cooperation. The  differences are the result of the still existing historical  heritage and the failure to develop a sufficiently active and  constructive dialogue.    [Tokin] What party will the BSP present at the elections?  Whose party will it be?    [Lilov] The BSP will present in the elections a party that  very seriously wants to eliminate the tribal political animosity  which exists in Bulgaria, and which could have grave  consequences for our country. The BSP must place national  consensus and interests above everything else. Afterward, the  BSP must propose another alternative for the reforms in the  country. It should do so not in order to stop the reforms, but  in order to give them a new impulse and provide them with a new  leftist-centrist philosophy and program. Finally, the BSP must  express and protect the interests of that majority of the  population which is subjected to mass impoverishment, while  keeping in mind its role in our society.    [Tokin] Do you think that the leftist wave that began in  Lithuania and continued through Poland and Hungary, will reach  Bulgaria tomorrow?    [Lilov] There is no other way. We are in the way of this  wave.</p>

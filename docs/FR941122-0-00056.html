			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a wolf population is discovered in the Park's recovery area, after the effective date of the experimental population rule but before release, reintroduction under the rule would not occur in that area and any such wolves would be managed as a natural recovering population. Boundaries of the proposed experimental population area would be changed, as needed, to encourage recovery of the naturally occurring, breeding wolf population. No experimental population area will contain a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that have successfully raised young, prior to the establishment of the experimental area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management of the nonessential experimental wolf population would allow reintroduced wolves to be killed or moved by Service authorized Federal, State, and tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation on big game populations. Under special conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private funding sources would be encouraged. When six or more wolf packs are documented in the experimental population area outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges, there would be no land-use restrictions, including areas around den sites or other critical areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate. Projected recruitment would off-set the anticipated 10 percent mortality resulting from management control actions. An additional 10 percent loss could occur from other mortality sources. Once reintroduced wolves reach the goal of six wolf packs, the reproductive output of the packs would provide a population increase at or near 22 percent per year. Closely regulated public control (taking of depredating wolves) would effectively focus on only individual problem wolves. Agency control actions would more likely target groups of wolves containing problem individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service, and States or tribes as authorized, could move wolves that are negatively impacting ungulate populations. Such wolves would be moved to other places within the experimental population area. Two examples when this would occur are (1) when wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability because of unusual habitat or weather conditions (e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) and (2) when wolves cause prey to move onto private property and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal management plans which are to be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such control actions are conducted. Wolves will not be deliberately killed solely to address ungulate-wolf conflicts. Control actions by the States or tribes likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the experimental rule as determined by the Service would have to be specifically incorporated into an amendment of this experimental rule and subject to national public comment and review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management of wolves in the experimental population would not cause major changes to existing private or public land-use restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after six breeding pairs of wolves are established in this experimental area. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in the experimental area, land-use restrictions could be used, as needed, to control intrusive human disturbance on public lands. Their implementation would be at the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies. Before five or fewer breeding wolf pairs are established, temporary restrictions on human access near active wolf den sites may be required between April 1 and June 30. Any restrictions on private land would only occur with complete landowner cooperation and concurrence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

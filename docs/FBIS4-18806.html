			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Zubeyir Aydar, DEP [Democracy Party]  parliamentarian from Siirt, said that despite insufficient  information in the United States on human rights and the Kurdish  problem in Turkey, a new approach has now emerged.    Aydar indicated that the officials whom they met during  their  time in the United States said that the Kurdish problem cannot  be solved by military methods and that they favor a political  solution.    During their contacts in the United States, DEP Siirt  parliamentarian Zubeyir Aydar, DEP Adiyaman parliamentarian  Mahmut Kilinc, and former Diyarbakir Mayor Mehdi Zana met David  M. Winn, chief of the State Department's Southern Europe Desk;  his future replacement John Hamilton; Nancy H. Ely Raphel [name  as published], chief of the State Department's Human Rights  Desk; Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Relations  Committee; Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee; Steny Hamilton Hoyer, a congressman and  chairman of the CSCE Helsinki Human Rights Commission; Senator  Dennis DeConcini; Congressman Bill Bray; and representatives of  the American Democracy Fund, various democratic organizations,  and the press.    Aydar said that during their contacts they were asked  questions on human rights in Turkey, the Kurdish problem,  attacks on parties, the lifting of parliamentarians' immunity,  and the situation in prisons and that views were exchanged.  <H5>  A New Approach in the State Department and Senate </H5>   In referring to their talks with the State Department and  Senate circles, Aydar said that, despite the fact that these  circles have insufficient information on human rights and the  Kurdish problem in Turkey, they have adopted a new approach.  Aydar said that before the U.S. officials supported Turkey  under any conditions but that they are now looking at Turkish  policy with a critical eye and are particularly sensitive to the  Kurdish problem. He said: "They said that the Kurdish problem  cannot be solved militarily and that it must have a political  solution. We felt that in the future they will give more  emphasis to the Kurdish problem in their relations with Turkey.  Their general approach on the Kurdish problem is that it should  have a political solution within the borders of Turkey."    Indicating that the main theme of their contacts was to  contribute to the democratization of Turkey and a democratic  solution to the Kurdish problem, Aydar said: "While we were  there the pro-state press here reported that `they remained in  the open, no one was interested in them or talked to them.'  These were unfounded and concocted reports serving the  psychological warfare. There was no truth to them. Our contacts  were conducted in an extremely warm atmosphere and their results  will be clearly seen in the future."</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: A lesson in diversification survival - Ian Rodger gets to the root of Motor Columbus's financial troubles If the idea of aggressive diversification still had any credibility, Motor Columbus, the Swiss electrical power production and engineering group, has put an end to it. The group, one of the world's best known engineers of hydroelectric projects, has just survived by a whisker a disastrous diversification binge that began in the mid-1980s. At the end of 1992, when a reckoning was finally made, the group's trading profits barely covered its SFr262m (Dollars 176.4m) interest charges. It had to write off SFr257m on misadventures, and was left with shareholders' funds of a mere SFr2m. The dividend was passed. Today, under new management, Motor Columbus is firmly on the recovery trail, after several disposals and with a new concentration on core electricity-related businesses. Its bearer shares were one of the top performers in a perky Swiss stock market last year, trebling to a recent SFr1,570. The group's diversification programme began in the mid-1980s, when profits from electricity generation were being squeezed and the Swiss government suddenly scrapped a nuclear power plant project. Motor Columbus, which had a big engineering team working on the project, took a write-off of more than SFr200m, and began to diversify into high-technology services. The first initiatives were in cable television. The group acquired rights to build systems in parts of France, Germany and Switzerland. The Swiss and German systems worked out fairly well, but the typical Swiss penchant for building everything with a copper bottom went awry in France. Motor installed an ultra-modern system in Alsace with fibre optic cables and interactive capability, and then discovered that the subscribers were unwilling to pay a big premium for it. The result: SFr100m of the group's SFr150m investment there was written off. A second thrust was into the data communications sector, with a big investment in WorldCom, a US private line-leasing business that did well until American Telegraph &amp; Telephone started cutting prices. Motor was lucky though, being able to sell WorldCom to IDB Communications, a US telecoms group, in return for a 40 per cent share stake in IDB. Most of that stake was sold in November at a net profit of SFr200m. It was less lucky in its third area of diversification, service and manufacturing businesses. These varied from water purification equipment to proteins for pharmaceuticals, electronics for textile machinery and powder coatings. Most have been sold or closed. The one large remaining non-core business is Studer Revox, which makes specialised audio studio equipment and upmarket consumer electronics. Last year, losses and write-offs at Studer reached SFr100m. The two businesses have been revived under new management, and are being readied for sale. At their peak in 1991, the diversifications generated a little over a quarter of the group's SFr1.9bn turnover, but only 6 per cent of its SFr283m trading profit. In 1991, with the recession deepening, directors saw disaster looming. Mr Ernst Thomke, a highly-regarded former executive at the SMH watchmaking group, was brought in to perform surgery. It did not take long to set a new course. Ironically, in the middle of the diversification binge, the group's principal electricity-generating subsidiary, Atel, had found an exciting new source of growth in electricity trading. With a large pool of hydro power generation and a high-tension transmission network criss-crossing Switzerland, Atel was in an excellent position to deal in electric power with neighbouring Italy, France and Germany. The competitive advantage of hydro power is its flexibility. It can be turned up or down as needed within seconds, without adding any significant marginal cost. Electricity dealing in central Europe is conducted daily by telephone, and Atel is an important player. Last year, more than half of its SFr1.4bn turnover came from trading, and Motor is vigorously expanding the network's capacity and coverage. Analysts are reckoning on a sharp turnround at Motor in 1993, from 1992's SFr225m net loss to a profit of about SFr70m. For their part, the directors have recently demonstrated optimism that the group can trade out of its crisis by cancelling 94,000 shares held in treasury against bonds that were never converted. This turnround has restarted speculation about Motor's ownership. Union Bank of Switzerland holds a 40 per cent block of shares, bought in the mid-1970s. Swiss analysts have speculated about a merger between Motor and Electrowatt, a similar company and part of the CS Holding financial services group built around Credit Suisse. Whatever happens, Motor could soon be back in a dilemma similar to the one it faced in the 1980s: what to do with a brisk surplus cash-flow. One thing is sure, diversification is out of the question.</p>

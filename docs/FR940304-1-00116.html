			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two product classes were considered for electric ovens: Standard ovens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with or without catalytic linings and self-cleaning ovens. Oven types that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were listed as classes in the September 1990 advance notice (forced convection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cooking, forced convection for cleaning, halogen lamp, and steam cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with and without pressure) were considered as design options. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that no utility issues exist warranting additional classes beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard and self-cleaning ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with electric ovens, two product classes were considered for gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens: Standard ovens and self-cleaning ovens. Oven types that were listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes in the September 1990 advance notice (radiant burner and convection)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were considered as design options. In addition, the Department does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that significant utility issues exist in the ability of the appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to operate during electric outages, which would require that classes be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established into those with and without electrical cords. Designs which use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity are evaluated on their economic advantages and disadvantages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for microwave oven classes, both Whirlpool Corporation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers recommended that the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit its analysis to microwave ovens with and without browning elements, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes which accounted for 96.8 percent of domestic shipments in 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 9; Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No, 61A at 30).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department rejected the proposals to limit the analysis to two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product classes: conventional microwave ovens with and without browning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements. The Department combined these ovens into one class. Since the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure does not measure the energy use of the browning element, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to separate these two kinds of ovens into classes; therefore, only one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class of microwave ovens was analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . There were numerous comments on the design options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. Natural Resources Defense Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that DOE study (for ranges/ovens) reduction in thermal mass,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalytic burners, reflective surfaces, the biradiant concept, and improved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnetrons for microwave ovens. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27&hyph;28). Aloha Systems, Inc. said that induction cooking is the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient method. (Aloha Systems, Inc., No. 2 at 1,2). American Council for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an Energy Efficient Economy proposed that DOE evaluate the infrared jet gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burner for conventional ovens, and for microwave ovens, advanced transformer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winding and core materials, and the high-efficiency electronic controller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (which turns power on and off). (American Council for an Energy Efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economy, No. 6 at 4). The Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that DOE study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved controls that allow the resistance element to ``coast'' the food to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion. A reference to European tests was given, stating that this design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires a thermostat and temperature control knob and saves 20 percent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more of the energy. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 5). The Oklahoma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Gas Co. suggested that thermostatically controlled gas burners be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced by various-sized (Btu/h input and dimensions) and manually controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface burners to accommodate different-size cookware. (Oklahoma Natural Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Co., No. 57 at 6). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on each design option for ranges/ovens and microwave ovens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 30&hyph;62). Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation supported the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on ranges/ovens and microwave ovens. (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 16, 19).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Man held over Polly Peck shooting One man was being held in an Istanbul prison yesterday and an arrest warrant had been issued for two others in connection with the shooting last month of a UK accountant working for Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the court-appointed administrators of Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate. Mr Islam Elma was being held at Bayrampasa prison under a court order pending trial related to the shooting of Mr David Adams, who received five gunshot wounds to the leg. Mr Elma, 21, reportedly told police he had mistaken Mr Adams for Mr Chris Howells, the accountant directly involved in trying to recover the local PPI assets. Last night lawyers working for the administrators had still to be provided with copies of the court proceedings. But local newspapers reported that Mr Elma and two others had been offered TL250m (Pounds 5,000) and shares in Vestel Electronik, PPI's listed Istanbul consumer electronics subsidiary, to shoot the Coopers accountant. The attack follows a pattern of intimidation of officials connected to the administration. Mr Asil Nadir, the former PPI chairman, has attempted to block court moves by the administrators to gain access to the remaining Turkish and Cypriot assets. According to PPI's 1989 accounts the local companies - Near and Middle East companies - generated two-thirds of the Pounds 160m reported group profit. Two months ago Mr Howells was left with head injuries after being mugged outside his Istanbul apartment. Last year a lawyer working for the administrators in Cyprus and the former banker of Mr Nadir found dead chickens nailed to the gateposts of their homes. Mr Elma is said to have confessed to the attack after being apprehended in the act of another shooting, according to the newspaper reports. His mother had threatened to jump off the Bosporus bridge to protest his innocence. Mr Elma is understood to have been recruited by Mr Erkan Kenanoglu, an Iskenderum based businessman, who was also wanted for questioning.</p>

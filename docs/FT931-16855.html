			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / How the new Bosnia would look Under the proposals tabled in Geneva at the weekend by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, Bosnia-Hercegovina would become a decentralised state of 10 largely autonomous provinces. It is proposed that the three main ethnic groups in Bosnia-Hercegovina - Moslems, Serbs and Croats - should each be allocated three provinces in which they will have a large majority. Sarajevo province would remain a mixed community and Sarajevo should become a demilitarised 'open city'. Under the proposals, the provinces marked with the numbers 1, 5 and 9 would have a predominantly Moslem population; 2, 4 and 6 would be peopled largely by Serbs, with a Moslem minority in 4; and 3, 8 and 10 would have a majority of Croats, with a strong minority of Moslems, particularly in 10.</p>

Although the framework talks failed to  agree on the substance of the objective criteria, there had been  some agreements reached in procedural matters. Japan has to  underscore its efforts toward opening its market if only to  dissuade the United States from imposing unilateral sanctions.  Furthermore, the government also intends to expand its action  program on government procurement, and study measures to ease  regulations in the insurance sector to compile new market  liberalization measures in time for the meeting of leaders of  the advanced countries (Naples Summit) in July.    Responsible government officials from concerned ministries  and agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  Ministry of International Trade and Industry will meet on 15  February to discuss how to deal with the framework talks. Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and concerned cabinet ministers will  also meet as early as this week to start formulating concrete  measures to open the market.    The objective criteria were supposed to be set to gauge the  extent of foreign participation in the market. Even the recent  bilateral summit meeting was not able to narrow the gap between  the United States, which wanted the introduction of targets for  the future, and Japan, which opposed such targets. This led to  a breakdown in the framework talks. However, basic agreements  had been reached in areas other than the objective criteria.  Japan will implement these agreements on its own initiative.    One of these is the promotion of the improvement and  extension of procedures for government procurement, one of the  priority sectors in the framework talks. Early this month, the  cabinet decided upon an action program on government  procurement, which provided for the creation of a new organ to  handle complaints, among other things. It was also agreed at the  framework talks that the floor prices of telecommunications and  medical equipment subject to competitive bidding be set at  100,000 SDRs (IMF special drawing rights; around 15 million yen).    In insurance, another priority sector, concrete measures  will  be drawn up for matters agreed upon between Japan and the United  States. The Finance Ministry is aiming at a reform of the  insurance industry in fiscal 1996, which includes the  introduction of an insurance brokerage system, and a public  hearing system where foreign insurance companies will be allowed  to express their opinions on the insurance market.    Regarding how to deal with the framework talks from now on,  Prime Minister Hosokawa has said: "The ball has been thrown to  us. We have to come up with ideas." Apparently, the government  has decided to take the initiative in implementing market  liberalization measures. After the framework talks broke down,  the United States hinted at imposing sanctions and taking other  unilateral actions. It is believed that the government's  decision is partly meant to ward off such retaliation.</p>

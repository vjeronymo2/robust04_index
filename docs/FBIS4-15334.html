			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Azerbaijan Reacts Positively to New </F> Mediation Initiative"]    [Text] Azerbaijan has reacted positively to a new  mediation initiative of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and  the Republic of Belarus in settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict, and hopes that this will make it possible to stop the  bloodshed. The press secretary of the president of the republic,  Tofik Abbasov, told this to an AZER-TADZH correspondent. He  emphasized that Azerbaijan's position remains constructive and  is fully based on commonly accepted norms of international law  in keeping with the resolution of the UN Security Council on a  cease-fire, the withdrawal of all Armenian armed formations from  occupied territories, and the conduct of peace negotiations. The  principle of inviolability of borders and territorial integrity  of states is a political reality, on which the entire system of  modern international relations is built, and no one will be able  to ignore this reality through use of violent means.</p>

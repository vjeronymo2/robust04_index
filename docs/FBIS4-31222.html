			<p>BFN     [Ttext] Brcko, June 5 (TANJUG) -- Moslem and Croat forces  are continuing attacks on Serb positions and settlements in  northern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina despite U.N. efforts to  reach a comprehensive ceasefire at the Geneva talks. Bosnian  Serb sources announced on Sunday that local Bosnian Croat troops  and units of the regular Croatian army from the Orasje region  (northern Bosnia) on Saturday evening used tanks, 60mm mortars,  anti-aircraft guns and infantry weapons to attack Serb positions  eight km south and southwest of Orasje. The attacks failed to  cause any damage and the Bosnian Serb army held their fire. The  Moslems continued offensive actions in the region of Srbobra  (former Donji Vakuf), and Mt. Vlasic (central Bosnia) where they  are also regrouping and massing reinforcements. In the Vlasic  front, the Moslems used 128mm light rocket launchers and heavy  mortars.</p>

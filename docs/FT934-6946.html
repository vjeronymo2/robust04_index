			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Bargain prices for KIO Madrid office blocks Two unfinished office blocks were sold by the Kuwait Investment Office yesterday for a fraction of their market value to creditor institutions and to the parent company of one of the KIO's earliest domestic partners. Called the Gateway to Europe because the towers lean towards each other, the prestigious property at the northern end of Madrid was purchased by Caja de Madrid, the city's savings bank, representing a syndicate of 24 financial houses, and by FCC, a construction group. The buyers paid Pta16.6bn (Pounds 81.4m) at an auction held by receivers acting for Prima Inmobiliaria, the property unit of the KIO's Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras. Two earlier auctions for the property held by the receivers had attracted no bidders when they had set reserve prices of of Pta85.9bn and Pta63bn. Under domestic receivership rules, the third auction set no price and the only buyers were Caja de Madrid and FCC which each acquired one of the blocks. An estimated further Pta7bn will be required to complete the towers. Prima Inmobiliaria, whose subsidiary Urbanor owned the site of the twin towers and was developing the office blocks, went into receivership a week after Grupo Torras declared itself bankrupt with debts of Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in December last year. The crash of the KIO's Spanish holding remains highly controversial owing to protracted disputes between its past and former management, and is the object of complex court litigation.</p>

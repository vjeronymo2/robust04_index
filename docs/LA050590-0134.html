			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S SON TO TESTIFY ABOUT THRIFT FAILURE;  </P> <P> S&amp;LS: LOANS TO NEIL BUSH'S BUSINESS PARTNERS WHILE HE WAS ON THE BOARD OF A  COLORADO THRIFT WERE ALLEGEDLY A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  </P> <P> Neil Bush, the president's son, said Friday that he has agreed to testify  before the House Banking Committee about the failure of a Colorado thrift on  whose board he served.  </P> <P> The panel, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), is looking into the  December, 1988, collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of  Denver.  </P> <P> The connections among Silverado and other failed S&amp;Ls are being examined,  including Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and the  junk bond operation of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier Michael  Milken.  </P> <P> The committee has scheduled two hearings. Thrift regulators are expected to  testify May 22; Bush and other Silverado board members are to appear May 23.  </P> <P> "I have agreed to participate and will continue to cooperate with Congress, the  Office of Thrift Supervision and any other agencies involved," Bush said in a  statement released through his attorney's office.  </P> <P> The thrift office has alleged that loans by Silverado to Bush's business  partners, developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, were a conflict of interest  for Bush.  </P> <P> Neil Bush was on the S&amp;L's board from October, 1985, until August, 1988.  </P> <P> In January, regulators began disciplinary procedures against Bush that could  result in a lifetime ban from the thrift industry. Bush has denied any  wrongdoing.  </P></p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Work to start on Swiss group's Tatarstan oil venture A PRIVATELY-owned Swiss company is about to start development of an oil project that could eventually raise output by more than 20 per cent in Russia's second largest producing region. The autonomous republic of Tatarstan's 1992 production of about 650,000 barrels a day place it behind only Siberia in Russia's oil league, and it has vast unexploited reserves. The republic's authorities have so far authorised four joint ventures for oil exploration and development. One involves Total, the big French oil company, but the other three are with relatively small companies such as the Swiss-based Panoco, which derives its income principally from oil operations in Nigeria. Panoco announced last week that the 'Blue Kama' joint venture, in which it and Tatneft, the Tatarstan oil and gas authority, each have a 50 per cent stake, is about to start development of eight oil fields in a 31,750-hectare (78,460-acre) area. The area's proven reserves have been upgraded from 1.69bn to 2.61bn barrrels since the joint venture accord was signed in 1991. The first output, from 35 wells, is expected to come on stream in April and a longer-term plan involves drilling about 2,770 wells over 14 years, raising total output to 150,000 barrels a day from the present 2,000 barrels. Panoco says the project will involve a total investment of up to Dollars 1.2bn, most of which will come from operating profits after the first three years. Initially, Panoco plans to raise about Dollars 80m, half of which is to finance a new 93 km (58 mile) pipeline to link the new field to the oil treatment facilities at Almetyevsk. From Almetyevsk oil flows through the existing network to other parts of Russia and, via the Druzhba pipeline, to eastern Europe. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement Blue Kama will export all its oil output until the initial investment is recouped. Subsequently, both partners are free to decide where to sell their half-share. The joint venturers are also studying the feasibility of building an oil refinery close to the Blue Kama area. Tatarstan currently has no refining capacity of its own and meets its own domestic needs by importing refined products from neighbouring republics.</p>

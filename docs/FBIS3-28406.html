Ambassador Yu Chong-ha, appearing on KBS-1 Television's News  Forum this morning, said that because international society has  made all efforts to get North Korea to accept nuclear  inspections, China will not oppose international society's  measures against North Korea if North Korea rejects nuclear  inspection to the end.    Ambassador Yu added that even though North Korea has delayed  talks to maximize efficiency in negotiations, China views that  North Korea will, eventually, accept the international society's  demand for nuclear inspections.    Ambassador Yu said that even when North Korea's nuclear  issue  is referred to the UN Security Council, immediate sanctions  against North Korea will not imposed. He added that because the  UN Security Council chairman's statement must first be announced  and it must be followed with the adoption of a UN resolution, it  will take about a month for sanctions to be imposed on North  Korea.</p>

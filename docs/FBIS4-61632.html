			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Oleg Deyneko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- Actual budgetary revenue in the  first quarter of 1994 was lower than the sum envisaged by the  draft budget, a BUSINESS-TASS correspondent was told in the  Russian Economics Ministry. As is known, Russia's budget for  1994 has not yet been given final approval by the State Duma.    The total sum of arrears for the first quarter is R [rubles]  5.2 trillion, including R3.4 trillion owed to the federal  budget, or 15 percent of anticipated revenue.    The trend has increased for priority to be given to payments  to territorial budgets, to the detriment of the federal budget.  Thus, according to the Economics Ministry's figures, on 1  January federal budget nonpayments constituted 58.1 percent of  the total sum of nonpayments, but by 1 April this figure had  risen to 64.7 percent.    Budgetary revenue in the first quarter of 1994 amounted to  R17.4 trillion (not taking account of external economic  activity), R6.9 trillion of which went into the federal budget.    Out of the total sum, the most significant revenue was from  profits tax -- R7 trillion, or 40.2 percent; from VAT -- R4.8  trillion, or 27.6 percent; and from income tax from private  individuals -- R2.4 trillion, or 13.8 percent.</p>

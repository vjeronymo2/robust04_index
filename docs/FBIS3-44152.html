In the southern suburbs of the Congolese capital, the security  situation in strongholds of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas  has been on the slide in recent days even though the Army has  moved in to try to seal them off, and the American decision has  been taken after consultations with the State Department. From  Brazzaville, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report:    Around 25 dependents of embassy staff are to be evacuated to  the United States. Yesterday, the ambassador left his residence  and moved in with one of his staff for the time being. The  trouble took place on Friday [21 January] evening when, during a  period of four hours, soldiers took up positions on the terrace  of a villa next door to the ambassador's residence. Their fire  was directed at the opposition stronghold of Bacongo, but  several shots went wide and there are signs of some 50 bullets  having hit the walls of the ambassador's residence, damaged  windows, and broken the windscreen of the ambassador's car.    It is now a week since the suburbs of Bacongo and  Makelekele,  which are under the control of opposition militias, were  blockaded by government-supporting security forces. Although  the interior minister has given assurances that the barricades  are nothing more than routine checkpoints, the people of these  areas do not dare walk around nor attempt to leave the areas.  Buses and taxis are not serving the two suburbs. The Congolese  Red Cross says that thanks to the blockade, it has not been able  to carry out humanitarian work in Bacongo and Makelekele. But a  member of the opposition in Bacongo told journalists by phone  that people in the area were receiving food supplies thanks to  transporters bringing supplies from villages in the surrounding  region, which is the home area of opposition leader Bernard  Kolelas.    With both Bacongo and Makelekele being on the edge of  Brazzaville, the security forces have been able to seal the  suburbs off completely. But the resupply of the two suburbs is  also guaranteed by traders on the River Congo between  Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Meanwhile, violence continues to  afflict other parts of Brazzaville, with acts of pillage and  theft taking place every day. A group of people last night broke  into the house of a West African trader and snatched 5 million  CFA francs, as well as other goods.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that Turkey,  which is absolutely right about the Cyprus issue, is sometimes  accused of being wrong and unfair about the issue as a result of  propaganda and the effect of certain forces behind closed doors.  The president stressed that it is not the Turkish side that has  been creating difficulties for the past 20 years and preventing  the achievement of a solution.    Demirel received Hakki Atun, prime minister of the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], today. Demirel said that  the Cyprus question is the national cause of every single one of  the 60 million citizens of Turkey. He pointed out that there  has not been any bloodshed on the island during the past 20  years, and that this is thanks to Turkey, not the United  Nations. It is Turkey and its kinsmen in Cyprus that have  suffered from the lack of solution, he said, adding that the  Turkish Cypriots have been isolated and that their only window  and door to the world is Turkey.    The president explained that the ethnic purge in Yugoslavia  was seen in Cyprus years ago. Turkey is carrying out a just  defense by protecting and saving the Turkish Cypriot community  on the island, he stated, adding: Eventually, everyone will  recognize the right to life of the Turkish Cypriot community.    [Begin Demirel recording] However, that will not be enough.  It will be necessary to guarantee that right to life. It will  be necessary to prevent a return to the old days. The times  before 1974 when bloody incidents used to take place are a thing  of the past now. When it talks of a political solution, Turkey  wants to guarantee its kinsmen's security and the fact that  there will not be a return to the old days. After that, it  naturally seeks political equality. Turkey is so right, and our  kinsmen in Cyprus and the TRNC are so right, that it is  ridiculous to try to portray their stand as being wrong or  unfair. [end recording]    President Demirel stressed that it is not Turkey and the  Turkish Cypriots that have been creating difficulties for the  solution of the Cyprus problem. The TRNC wants a reasonable,  just, and viable solution more than anybody else, he said.    Demirel pointed out that it is of great importance that the  Turkish Cypriot side become economically self-sufficient. The  necessary potential for that exists, he said, and Turkey has  always supported it.    The president stressed that Turkey is making great efforts  to  resolve the problem politically.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARCOS SKYSCRAPER ON WALL STREET AUCTIONED FOR A PALTRY $77 MILLION;  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: NEW YORK CITY BUILDING SECRETLY BOUGHT BY FERDINAND AND IMELDA  MARCOS SOLD FOR JUST ABOVE THE MINIMUM ASKING PRICE.  </P> <P> A 66-story Manhattan skyscraper owned by the ousted late Philippines President  Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, was sold at auction in Federal Court  here today for $77,000,100 -- a price that just barely covered its mortgage and  expenses.  </P> <P> The price for 40 Wall Street was only $100 over the minimum price set by  mortgage holder Citibank to get its investment and expenses back.  </P> <P> The special court-appointed master overseeing the sale, Stephen Estroff, called  the low price a tragedy, saying it did not look as if the Philippine  government, which claims the property was secretly bought by the Marcoses, will  realize any money from the sale.  </P> <P> The price was sharply lower for the building than the $108.6 million it fetched  when first auctioned off last July.  </P> <P> But the original buyers, real estate developers Ralph and Joseph Bernstein, who  had a business connection with the Marcoses, could not find the financing to  complete the deal and now stand to lose a $1.5-million deposit.  </P> <P> The building is one of four properties secretly owned by the Marcoses in  Manhattan that a Federal Court here has ordered sold off.  </P> <P> The Marcoses were charged with looting the Philippine treasury of more than  $100 million and then defrauding U.S. banks of $168 million to buy the  buildings.  </P> <P> Marcos died in September after being ruled too ill to stand trial but his wife  faces trial for fraud and conspiracy next March.  </P> <P> The building at 40 Wall Street was bought by a group headed by developer Burton  Resnick.  </P> <P> The sale was ordered by Federal Judge Pierre Laval and the money is to go into  an escrow fund until the dispute between the Philippine government and the  Marcoses over the buildings is settled.  </P> <P> Another building owned by the Marcoses, a 10-floor shopping mall called Herald  Center, was auctioned off last week for $25 million, its minimum price.  </P> <P> Robert Abrahams, the attorney for Citibank, said the low price for 40 Wall  Street reflected a soft market for Manhattan real estate. Asked if he was  surprised, he said, "Nothing surprises me any more in this case."  </P> <P> There are still two more buildings owned by the Marcoses to be sold but no date  has been set for their auction.  </P></p>

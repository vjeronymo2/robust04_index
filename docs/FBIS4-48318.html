			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 15 SAPA -- Northern Cape Premier  Manne Dipico on Monday announced a 10-member Executive Council  that includes five representatives of the African National  Congress, four from the National Party [NP] and one from the  Freedom Front [FF]. The ANC narrowly gained the majority in the  province, the country's biggest and poorest, in elections last  month.    Mr Dipico said he was appointing the front's Prof Jozef  Henning to an unspecified Executive Council post even though the  FF did not win enough votes to claim a seat. Similarly, the ANC  proposed the Democratic Party's Ethne Papenfus as speaker.    Mr Dipico said he had been guided in his Executive Council  appointments by the objective of "nation building". He said he  had looked at the expertise available to accomplish the  province's developmental needs.    Executive Council members, their party and the portfolios  are:    Goolam Akharwaray, ANC, economic affairs, trade and  industry    Tina Joemat, ANC, education and culture    Dr Modise Matlaopane, ANC, health and welfare    Ouneas Dikgetsi, ANC, local government, housing and land  reform    Peter Gelderbloem, ANC, police services    Jacobus Marais, NP, agriculture    Jan Brazelle, NP, finance    Peggy Hollander, NP, public works    Charl van Wyk, NP, transport    Jozef Henning, FF, unspecified.

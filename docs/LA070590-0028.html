			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE GRAFFITI MESSAGE  </P> <P> How ridiculous can politicians get? The City Council -- at the instigation of  Joel Wachs -- proposes to collect an initial fee (euphemism for tax) of 50  cents per month to clean up graffiti.  </P> <P> Of course this will be added to DWP bills along with a number of other non-DWP  charges, hopefully to escape the attention of taxpayers.  </P> <P> This is clearly sending the wrong message to the vandals.  </P> <P> We are saying: "It's all right to create graffiti and we are willing to pay  additional tax to clean up after you." The City Council is confident the tax  will go unnoticed.  </P> <P> Is that the message we should be sending?  </P> <P> Why not attack the problem at its source? Have a special police group organized  to deal with it.  </P> <P> Have the vandals, as they are caught, clean not only their own mess but also  some of the residual mess.  </P> <P> Their residence until the job is completed: Jail.  </P> <P> A tax -- hopefully not disguised as a DWP fee -- would be appropriate for such  an effort.  </P> <P> CHARLES T. and MARILYNN DIERKER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

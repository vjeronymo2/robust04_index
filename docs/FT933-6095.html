			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / People: Collinson to regenerate Plymouth The Plymouth Urban Development Corporation in Devon, set up by the government five months ago to regenerate unwanted Ministry of Defence sites including the Royal William naval yard, will begin to pick up steam tomorrow with the arrival of a chief executive, John Collinson. The corporation, the 12th UDC in England, came into being on April 1 with a projected budget of Pounds 45m over its intended five-year lifespan. Collinson, recruited after the advertised post attracted over 200 applications, has been working out his notice as property director of the Black Country Development Corporation, where he has been for five years. Collinson, who is 43, spent five years before that with Salford city council, but in his new post he will be returning to his home county. He was born in Exeter. His first priority in Plymouth will be the UDC's business plan which is due to go to the Department of Environment within a month of his arrival. The next priority, he says, is 'hands on deck' in terms of staff. One necessary appointment, that of finance and administration director, is expected to be made shortly. Already on deck is Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Gerken as chairman and board members include the leaders of Plymouth city council and Devon county council. The UDC covers 165 acres and it is envisaged that there will be mixed development including offices, shops, restaurants and housing.</p>

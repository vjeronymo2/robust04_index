			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'THE EQUALIZER' INFRINGEMENT SUIT REVIVED;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS FEDERAL JUDGE'S DISMISSAL OF CASE  CONTENDING SCREENWRITER'S CONCEPT WAS STOLEN.  </P> <P> A federal appeals court has revived a suit claiming "The Equalizer," whose  pursuit of justice for the underdog had a four-year run on CBS, was stolen from  a Los Angeles screenwriter.  </P> <P> The 3-0 ruling Tuesday by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a  federal judge's decision dismissing the copyright-infringement suit by veteran  writer-producer Lou Shaw against the network and others who he said pirated his  work.  </P> <P> Shaw submitted a pilot television script called "The Equalizer" to Richard  Lindheim, then an NBC television executive, on an option basis in 1978. NBC  rejected it.  </P> <P> Four years later, Lindheim, who had moved to Universal Television, and Michael  Sloan wrote a script also called "The Equalizer," a name Lindheim admitted he  had copied from Shaw. The series, about a wealthy lone crime-fighter seeking to  right wrongs of the downtrodden, ran on CBS from 1985 to 1989.  </P> <P> Shaw's suit was thrown out by U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, who  said the two scripts had similarities in theme, plot, characters and dialogue  but did not have the same "total concept and feel." But the appeals court said  such a subjective decision should be made by a jury.  </P> <P> "A subjective assessment of the 'concept and feel' of two works of literature  (is) a task no more suitable for a judge than for a jury," said the opinion by  Judge Arthur A. Alarcon.  </P> <P> " . . . Because each of us differs, to some degree, in our capability to  reason, imagine and react emotionally, subjective comparisons of literary works  that are objectively similar in their expression of ideas must be left to the  trier of fact," the jury.  </P> <P> Once a judge has decided that objective factors in two literary works, such as  theme and plot, are arguably similar, the case must be submitted to the jury,  Alarcon said.  </P> <P> By contrast, he said, in non-literary cases where the varieties of possible  expression are more limited, a judge may be able to decide subjectively that  one toy or video game has a different "concept and feel" from another and  dismiss a suit without trial.  </P> <P> The court also upheld Stotler's conclusion that objective characteristics of  the two "Equalizer" characters and script could be found to have substantial  similarities, despite some differences in detail.  </P> <P> Shaw's lawyer, Richard Aldrich, called the ruling a legal breakthrough.  </P> <P> Louis Petrich, a lawyer for the CBS and the studios and writers accused in the  suit, did not return a telephone call.  </P></p>

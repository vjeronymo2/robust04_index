			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of jungle-based armed organizations have  been returning to the legal fold along with their arms and  ammunitions at various garrisons. This is because they have  realized their wrongdoings and have gained correct views. They  have also accepted and have faith in the genuine goodwill and  activities of the State Law and Order Restoration Council.    Mulaki alias Pwint Lin, 35, the son of U Ba Sin of Katokan  Village, Tenasserim Township and the platoon leader of the  Muslim armed organization in the jungle, returned to the legal  fold at Tenasserim garrison on 13 March 1994. He brought in one  AK-47 assault rifle, one magazine, and 20 rounds of ammunition.</p>

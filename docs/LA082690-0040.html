			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: OBTAIN WRITTEN MARKETING PLAN TO ENSURE PROMISED SALES  CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> QUESTION: Several months ago when we put our home on the market for sale, we  followed your advice and interviewed three agents before listing our home for  sale with the best one. She came highly recommended, even by one of the other  agents we interviewed. Her references were impeccable.  </P> <P> However, we neglected to insist on a written marketing plan for our house. Due  to the slowdown in home sales in our city, her brokerage is cutting back on its  advertising and promotion. As a result, our home was barely advertised.  </P> <P> When it became apparent that we had chosen the wrong agent, after 60 days of  virtually no promotion and much hostility from the agent, we canceled the  listing.  </P> <P> Then we listed our home with one of the other agents we interviewed. He gave us  a written marketing plan and showed us examples of how his firm sells houses  even in a slow market. As a result, after about three weeks he brought us a  purchase offer that we accepted.  </P> <P> Why don't you include on your listing checklist a requirement the agent provide  the home seller with a written marketing plan for the home?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Thank you for that valuable suggestion. The best realty agents specify  in writing how they plan to sell the home. As you probably know, advertising,  signs and open houses often are not enough.  </P> <P> I recently heard of a major brokerage chain in Miami that recommends its home  sellers obtain a professional appraisal of the house before a listing will be  accepted.  </P> <P> If a truly objective appraisal is made, this sounds like a good idea, providing  the appraiser does not "low ball" the valuation to get the house listed for  sale at a low price, which is easy to sell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Costly Mistake in Buying a Vacant Lot  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I bought a vacant lot in a very desirable neighborhood. It was  being sold by an estate. We presumed we would be able to build a house on it,  since it is a single-family neighborhood. However, when we contacted an  architect about designing a house, she said the lot is below the minimum size  for a house.  </P> <P> We applied for a zoning variance, but were turned down. Our lawyer says we can  appeal to the courts, but that can be very expensive. We were thinking of suing  the estate for not telling us the lot is unbuildable. But our lawyer refuses to  take the case. He says the estate cannot be held liable for non-disclosure of  the lot's small size. Do you think we should appeal?  </P> <P> A: Your situation is a classic example of why buyers of vacant land should  first check to learn what can be built on the property. Apparently there was a  very good reason why that lot remained vacant in an otherwise built up  neighborhood.  </P> <P> However, I wouldn't give up. If your lot has no practical use, and the city  refuses to grant a zoning variance, you may have a damage claim against the  city. I suggest you find a lawyer who is experienced in zoning matters. The  local Board of Realtors can give you the name of their lawyer who probably will  either be interested in taking your case or can recommend another lawyer who  specializes in zoning litigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> When Not to Use a Wraparound Mortgage  </P> <P> Q: You said it is better for a home seller to carry back a wraparound mortgage  instead of a second mortgage. But when I showed your article to our real estate  agent she said that only applies if the existing first mortgage does not have a  due-on-sale clause. Since we expect our buyer to get a new first mortgage,  wouldn't we also be better off with a wraparound rather than a second mortgage?  </P> <P> A: Not necessarily. The best time for the seller to carry back a wraparound  instead of a second mortgage occurs when there is an existing low-interest rate  first mortgage without a due on sale clause.  </P> <P> For example, suppose your home sells for $200,000 and it has an existing  $100,000 VA mortgage at 8% interest that is assumable. If the buyer makes a  $40,000 cash down payment, that leaves a $60,000 finance gap. You can fill it  by carrying back a $60,000 second mortgage at perhaps 10% interest. But you  would be better off, and the sale would be more attractive, to the buyer if you  instead carry back a $160,000 wraparound mortgage at perhaps 9.5% interest. You  then earn 9.5% interest on $60,000 plus the 1.5% interest rate differential on  $100,000.  </P> <P> Another advantage is the buyer makes one payment to you and then you use part  of that money to keep up payments on the old first mortgage.  </P> <P> However, if the buyer will be getting a new first mortgage, it doesn't really  matter if you carry back a second or a wraparound mortgage. But do not carry  back a wraparound loan if the first loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage. The  reason is you could become the "stuckee" if its interest rate is adjustable,  but your wraparound loan has a fixed interest rate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Home Seller Deduct a Loss?  </P> <P> Q: We bought our home about five years ago. Since then the state has upgraded a  nearby road into a very noisy freeway. To make matters worse, they built an  off-ramp exit that pours traffic down the street in front of our house. It is  so bad it often takes me 10 minutes to find a break in the traffic, so I can  back out of my driveway.  </P> <P> As a result, houses on our street have lost considerable market value. The  homeowners are suing the state and the city, but I doubt we will ever collect  for the lost value of our properties. Due to a job transfer I have to sell. My  employer hired a relocation company that had our house appraised, but the value  came out about $14,000 less than we paid for it. We have decided to accept  their offer. Can we deduct our loss on our income tax returns?  </P> <P> A: No. Losses on the sale of your personal residence are not tax-deductible.  However, you could have turned this situation into a tax-deductible loss if you  had converted the house into rental property before selling. Losses on the sale  of investment or business property are tax deductible. It's too late now for  you, but perhaps other readers can benefit from your mistake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Get Right Form for Power of Attorney  </P> <P> Q: I am a title officer with a major title insurance company. It would be a big  help if you would clarify for your many readers the difference between a  general and a limited power of attorney form. We have many people who bring us  a limited power of attorney form, usually prepared by an attorney, but we need  a general power of attorney where a person is representing an absent seller  such as a spouse.  </P> <P> Often there is not enough time to get a general power of attorney form signed  and notarized before the scheduled closing date. Any seller or buyer who plans  to use a power of attorney should consult the title insurance company well in  advance to be sure they have the correct form.  </P> <P> A: A power of attorney form can be very valuable when a buyer or seller is  unable to be present for the sale of a property. With a power of attorney  someone else, such as a spouse, can sign the papers for the absent person.  </P> <P> A limited power of attorney form appoints an attorney in fact just for a  limited purpose, such as to sign papers necessary for the sale of a house. But  most title insurance companies now insist on a general power of attorney form,  so there is no question that the attorney has power to sign whatever forms are  required for the sale or purchase. By consulting the title insurer well in  advance of the closing, the right power of attorney form can be prepared and  signed, so there are no last-minute problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rent Run-Down House With an Option to Buy  </P> <P> Q: We bought our home almost three years ago. It was a fixer-upper then and it  still is. Our plan was to fix it up, but then my husband lost his job and we  had some illness. Now we have to sell as we can't afford the mortgage payment.  A fine realtor has been trying to sell it for the last four months but, buyers  are turned off by the need for renovation, which we can't afford to do. Any  ideas?  </P> <P> A: Rent with an option to buy. Your house should appeal to bargain hunters who  lack much cash for a down payment. You will be amazed at how lease-option  tenants start fixing up a run-down house because they know someday they will  exercise the purchase option and own it.  </P> <P> There are so many lease-option advantages for both owner and tenant I can't  list them all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Is Refinancing Better Than a Credit Line?  </P> <P> Q: I have about $100,000 equity in my home, and I would like to use part of it  to get started investing in houses, probably fixer-upper houses. Do you think I  should refinance my first mortgage even though it has an 8.75% fixed-interest  rate or should I take an equity credit line which would be at 10% as I write  this?  </P> <P> A: Unless your first mortgage is very small, I would leave it undisturbed and  go for the home-equity credit line. The best feature of credit lines is they  don't cost anything until you use them.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J.

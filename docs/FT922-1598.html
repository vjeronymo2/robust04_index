			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Multi-storey offices in central London TROLLOPE &amp; COLLS CONS TRUCTION, a member of the Trafalgar House Group, has been awarded a Pounds 9m contract to demolish and rebuild multi-storey offices in central London for LE Lundbergforetagan - the Swedish property and investment group. Demolition is already in progress at Alexandra House, 29-33 Kingsway, London WC2 where the company is taking down most of the existing building while retaining the original facade. Reconstruction work is due to begin in July and at the end of the 69-week programme the new building will have an in situ steel frame with concrete floors, and insulated slating on a pitched roof. The site leaves little room for manoeuvre with constant traffic at the front and only a small working area at the back. When complete the offices will provide 58,000 sq ft net of office space spread over nine floors plus basement, with a central atrium, wall climbing lifts and high quality finishes.</p>

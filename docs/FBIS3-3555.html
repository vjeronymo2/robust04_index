The province will invest 14.5 billion yuan in 24 projects,  including nine communications and transportation projects, four  industrial energy projects and two telecommunications projects.    Last year, Hunan Province, a traditional agricultural  province, decided to focus on investing in infrastructural  projects so as to enhance its weak industrial basis.    In the middle of the year, a deficiency of funds became a  big  problem to the province. The provincial government adopted  effective measures to ensure the construction of these capital  projects.    By the end of 1993, the province had invested 5.76 billion  yuan in infrastructural projects, 240 million yuan more than  anticipated, and the province had completed six projects  including Dayong Airport and a bridge in Xiangtan city.    This year, Hunan Province will adopt a series of  fund-collection policies including issuing bonds and selling  stocks, using foreign investment to provide funds for the  construction of the capital projects.</p>

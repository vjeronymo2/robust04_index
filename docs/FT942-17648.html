			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / NUT attacks unions in tests row The largest teachers' union yesterday strongly attacked the two other classroom unions in the row over ending the boycott of national curriculum tests. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said at the union's annual conference in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, that its executive was unanimous that its boycott of tests should continue for a second year and predicted that no delegates would oppose it. In doing so he delivered a sharp rebuff to the government's hopes of setting its national curriculum policy back on course. Mr McAvoy attacked the ATL and NASUWT unions, both of which have advised their members to stop the boycott. Baroness Blatch, the education minister, will address both their conferences later next week. He said: 'Speakers will urge other teacher organisations to review their position on the boycott. There's a desire on the part of the other two organisations to snuggle up, if not to Baroness Blatch, then to the Conservative government.' The NUT, traditionally the most leftwing teachers' union, will consider motions to boycott the government's plans for school-based teacher training, and to consider strike action over pay, growing class sizes and redundancies. Mr McAvoy indicated that the union would oppose national tests for 11-year-olds which are due to be introduced next year, saying they would be used to select pupils for secondary schools. His views are unlikely to sway the other two unions, although the NUT takes heart from the policy of head teachers' organisations not to ask any other teachers to do work boycotted by the NUT. Strategists for the other unions fear that if the boycott continues the government could force them to do the tests next year, through the annual pay and conditions settlement. They believe this would not require new legislation. The NASUWT, which meets in Blackpool from Monday, will be visited by a government minister for the first time in eight years. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, its general secretary, predicted that Baroness Blatch would receive a courteous reception. Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, said his union would also favour abandoning the boycott. He acknowledged, however, that some delegates would oppose his decision not to hold a ballot on the issue. ATL members can still legally boycott the tests if they claim this creates too much workload. Last year's ballot in favour of a boycott still protects them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The construction of 120  kilometres long expressway from Pyongyang to Hyangsan where  scenic Mt. Myohyang is situated, is progressing fast.    The expressway will stretch straight from Pyongyang to Anju  (60 odd kilometres) and then run along the River Chongchon from  Anju to Hyangsan.    The 217 km-long River Chongchon empties into the West Sea  with its sources in Mt. Nangnim in the northwestern part of the  country.    The name of the river, with picturesque landscape along it,  was derived from its water as clear as the sky.    There are scenic spots on either side of the river such as  Mt. Myohyang, the Paeknyong cave known as an underground Mt.  Kumgang, the Yonphung reservoir of superb view and the Paeksang  pavillion in Anju and Mt. Yaksandongdae in Yongbyon which belong  to the eight scenic spots in northwestern area of Korea.    Mt. Myohyang is one of the five famous mountains of Korea.  Fascinating is the scenery of the mountain with azelea blooming  in spring, birds singing in thick verdure in summer and tree  leaves tinged with red in autumn.    The mountain has many peaks including the Piro, Hyangro and  Popwang peaks and tens of falls such as the Pison, Chonsin and  Unha falls, and mineral water springs.    In the mountain there are the international friendship  exhibition that preserves gifts sent to the great leader  President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  from heads of state and progressive people in different  countries and such historic sites and relics as Pohyon and  Sangwon temples.    Cities, villages, factories, enterprises and fertile fields  of cooperative farms on the banks of the river add to the beauty  of the landscape.    Anju is a young city rebuilt in the 1970s. Modern high-city  rise buildings of various styles are standing in rows. On the  banks of the river there are the gigantic Namhung youth chemical  complex, the Anju coal complex and the Anju silk mill.    The Yonphung reservoir, an artificial reservoir, gets water  from the River Chongchon. President Kim Il-song named it  Yonphung meaning that the people of the Yoltusamcholli plain who  had suffered from the shortage of water have become to harvest  bountiful crops every year, with no worry about water. On the  beach of the reservoir that looks like a sea in a mountain there  are holiday homes and summer camps.    The area of the River Chongchon is the country's major silk  production base. Yaksan silk of Yongbyon, velvet of Pakchon,  satin of Anju are popular at home and abroad.    Beside, there are historic sites and relics and monumental  edifices in the area such as the Paeksang pavillion of Anju, the  Cholong wall, the South Gate and the Yuksung pavilion of  Yongbyon and the Hyangsan barrage.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Not quite cricket - Theatre Sometimes a note of translation may be in order. The word 'yaar', as in Wicked Yaar, Garry Lyons's sprightly new play at the Cottesloe, is roughly the Punjabi equivalent of the English 'mate', as in 'matey' rather than 'mating'. It is thus a term of affection. 'Wicked' in modern English is a term of approbation. The play is about the difficulty of bringing English and Asians together. Wicked Yaar is a mix of Asian fairy tale, Yorkshire comedy and racial prejudice. There is also an injection of cricket, on the assumption that this is the game that brings all good people together. On the whole, the cricket comes out on top. Malik Mir, played by Ravik Aujla like an aspiring Pakistani all-rounder, wants to be the first Asian to be picked by his county. The trouble is that the local English youth are more interested in being bovver boys (and girls) for Leeds United. They declare the short cut to the cricket ground a no-go area for blacks and attempt to intimidate Malik. Then the spirits come to the rescue. Malik finds a medallion which, when rubbed, brings a genie to his side who sees off the thugs, helps the family finances by cheating the inland revenue through computer hacking, and improves the cricket. The reason why Malik scores a match-winning 20 off three balls in the final of the schools trophy is that he has hit the third for only two, but the invisible genie flings it on for six overthrows. Directed by John Turner, the cricket scenes are very engagingly done. Even here there is a twist in the plot. The captain of the rival team is a smart white girl who knows that, however good she is, she can never play for the county 'because it's a man's club'. Malik consoles her with the line that at least England win at the women's game. A decent Asian boy and a decent English girl unite in their dislike of bigotry: fairy tale stuff all round. There are other pleasures. The amiable genie, or ghul, takes to chewing gum as if it were nectar and regards the local ASDA supermarket as a veritable palace of delights. There is a lot of rap, especially in the cricket commentary, and some prolonged bhangra dancing. The design by Nigel Prabhavalkar is excellent. Whether it all hangs together is probably a subjective judgment. The piece runs out of ideas towards the end: it struck me as feeble to conclude that it was all a dream, and while there may be a case for reverse discrimination, the treatment of white working class youth in Wicked Yaar carries it beyond the plausible. Can it really be that all poor inner-city whites are so awful and all Asian immigrants so virtuous? Perhaps a little too much preaching. In repertory, Cottesloe Theatre, (071) 928 2252, then touring.</p>

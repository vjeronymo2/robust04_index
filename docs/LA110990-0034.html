			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER WINS $3-MILLION JUDGMENT FOR PROJECT COUNTY BACKED OUT OF  </P> <P> An Orange County development company has won a $3-million judgment against San  Diego County over a failed project to build 223 units of low- and  moderate-income housing in Spring Valley.  </P> <P> A jury made the award Wednesday, after a Superior Court trial over a lawsuit  filed by G &amp; S Properties Ltd.  </P> <P> II, a limited partnership.  </P> <P> G &amp; S and the county signed a contract in January, 1983, authorizing the  developer to build the housing project on 11 county-owned acres at the  intersection of Sweetwater Lane and Jamacha Road. The 55-year lease was  approved by the Board of Supervisors on a 3-2 vote despite heavy opposition  from neighbors.  </P> <P> But, in October of the same year, the county withdrew the lease because the  state, through its Rental Housing Construction Program, had decided not to  finance the project.  </P> <P> The developer claimed the state's funding was not a condition of the county  contract.  </P> <P> In 1985, the lawsuit went to court, but a judge ruled that state financing was  a condition of the lease. But, in 1987, the state Court of Appeal reversed the  ruling and sent the lawsuit back to Superior Court for another trial.  </P> <P> The outcome of that was Wednesday's $3-million judgment.  </P> <P> Richard (Duke) Pekin Jr., the San Diego attorney representing G &amp; S, said  in a prepared statement that, "while we are pleased with the verdict, in a case  like this everyone really loses -- from the taxpayers and the developer to the  223 families who would have benefited from this project."  </P> <P> Deputy County Counsel Mark Beesley, who handled the case, was not available for  comment.  </P> <P> Pekin said he expects the county to file an appeal.  </P> <P> The property remains undeveloped.  </P></p>

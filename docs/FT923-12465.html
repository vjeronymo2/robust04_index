			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: At a glance - With-profits bond withdrawn Equity &amp; Law has withdrawn its with-profits bond, which has attracted about Pounds 300m since February 1991. Norwich Union withdrew its bond at the beginning of the year, having taken Pounds 700m, citing capital strain, and other offices have since followed suit. Equity &amp; Law said it had already taken more than its target for the whole of this year, and was 'very keen to keep a balance between the types of business which we write'.</p>

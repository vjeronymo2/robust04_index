			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Green groups merge International business is hoping to bolster its influence on environmental policymaking with a merger between the two most active industrial lobbying groups - the Geneva-based Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) and the World Industry Council for the Environment (Wice) in Paris, reports Frances Williams. The new World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to be based in Geneva from January 1, aims to mobilise business behind 'sustainable development' and promote high company standards of environmental management. Rodney Chase, a managing director of British Petroleum and chairman-to-be of the WBCSD, says the new grouping will give industry a more effective voice on these issues in the future. 'Going green' could create more than 700,000 jobs in the UK over the next 10 to 15 years rather than destroying businesses and costing jobs as is generally believed, writes Deborah Hargreaves. According to a report published last week by pressure group Friends of the Earth, adoption of environmental protection measures could save the government Pounds 3bn a year in unemployment benefit. 'One of the main reasons why government and industry won't go forward with environmental protection policy is because they believe it will cost money and jobs. We want to tackle those misconceptions and show that sustainable development can bring real economic benefits,' says Charles Secrett, executive director of FoE. Secrett says the report's findings were based on experience in other countries with a realistic, pragmatic approach. For example, the report suggests that if Pounds 500m were channelled into rail investment instead of road building, the net creation in jobs would range from 3,000 to 8,150. This is based on research in Germany which shows that for every DM100m spent on public transport instead of roads 1 1/2 to two times more jobs are created.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: With ice We've seen skeletons advertising video tapes; now onto our screens may come a Stone Age corpse extolling ice-cold beer. Homo tyrolensis, a hunter who supposedly froze to death while trying to cross the Alps 5,000 years ago, is costing his guardians, the University of Innsbruck, a lot of money. So Johann Moser, the university's dean, is searching for corporate sponsors to cough up nearly Dollars 2m to pay for the experts and research facilities needed to find out all there is to know about life way back when. In return a sponsor would get promotional rights to one who is almost perfectly preserved. At the time of death our hero had collected some sloes in a bone beaker. Perhaps a gin manufacturer would care to fulfil his order.</p>

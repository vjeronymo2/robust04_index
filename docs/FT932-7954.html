			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Clinton wins 'fast-track' Gatt backing US SENATORS on the powerful finance committee yesterday voiced broad support for a swift extension of President Bill Clinton's 'fast-track' negotiating authority in order to finish Uruguay Round negotiations by December 15. Senator Patrick Moynihan, the committee chairman, promised to introduced the fast-track measure, unencumbered by conditions, on the Senate floor today. Fast-track is seen as a necessity for any US administration in trade negotiations, because it allows a final package to go through the Congress without amendment. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday told committee members that he expects the trade ministers of the US, EC, Canada and Japan to agree on the broad outline of a tariff reduction package by the time of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers meet in Tokyo on July. Although completion of the round by the target date will be 'a tall order', he said, the four ministers who met in Toronto last week made significant progress in producing a market access package, particularly in two areas important to the US - semiconductors and wood products. The Japanese are now 'engaged' in the process and aware that 'they will have to take a leadership role'. By the time the trade ministers meet in Tokyo there will have been 12 ministerial meetings on tariff reduction, Mr Kantor said. 'I remain hopeful that as the host country for the G7 economic summit meeting, Japan will demonstrate its commitment to the success of these negotiations.' He said he would meet the other trade ministers at least twice before the Tokyo meeting. Once the four ministers negotiate a tariff package, they will return to the bargaining table in Geneva to complete two big tasks, Mr Kantor said. The market access negotiations will be broadened to include goods and services with the 115 Gatt members participating in the Uruguay Round. The US will then seek to 'improve' the negotiating text produced by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt director-general. The areas necessary for change include: anti-dumping, subsidies, trade-related intellectual property rights, environment-related issues on technical barriers to trade and sanitary measures, subsidies, textiles and institutional issues, including the establishment of a multilateral trade organisation. Mr Kantor also said the Clinton administration would seek to use its generalised system of preferences, the tariff free programme, designed to help the developing countries gain markets in the US, as 'an important trade policy tool'. Besides conditioning benefits on a government's record on worker rights, it would also be used it as 'leverage to foster reforms in areas such as intellectual property'. The administration has asked for a short-term 15-month extension of the Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) GSP programme, which expires next July 4. It will also seek elimination of the statutory ban on GSP for the former Soviet Union, which prevents Russian and other republics from being considered for GSP benefits. 'This proposal would allow us to implement President Clinton's commitment to Russian Federation President Yeltsin,' Mr Kantor said. Mr Henry Parker III, of the coalition of US service industries, told the Senate committee that more work must be done to improve the services text. He said a final agreement should include strong annexes for financial services and telecommunications and substantial liberalisation across a wide range of countries and a mechanism to prevent free riders benefiting.</p>

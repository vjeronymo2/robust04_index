			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Tokyo stock market fall alarms politicians MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday met leaders of the securities industry in an attempt to bolster confidence as share prices slid to another five-year low. The unusual meeting was the latest sign of rising alarm among politicians over a persistent decline in the stock market. Mr Miyazawa warned that recovery of Japan's rapidly slowing economy could be jeopardised unless the market rallies. The meeting amounts to a recognition that neither the government's emergency economic package announced on Tuesday nor Wednesday's cut in the official discount rate have yet had their desired effect of restoring business confidence. Mr Miyazawa nonetheless had nothing to offer the markets beyond suggestions that the securities industry make greater efforts to restore investor confidence. The meeting is likely only to reinforce investor fears that the government is not prepared to take concrete measures to support the market. The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged to nearly 18,000 before partially recovering to close at 18,286.03, off 295.76 on the day. The market continued to slide in spite of Wednesday's three-quarter point cut in the official discount rate to 3.75 per cent and the package of emergency economic measures announced by the government on Tuesday. Pessimism spilled into other markets as well, with both the yen and government bonds falling sharply. Mr Miyazawa met Mr Shogo Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Elsewhere Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and other LDP leaders said the party was preparing legislation that would help boost the market by allowing companies to purchase their own shares. Meanwhile, a steep decline in car sales in March was reported yesterday by the Japan Automobile Dealers Association (Jada), adding to the accumulating evidence that Japan's economy is slowing sharply. March sales declined by 6.5 per cent compared to a year ago to 694,520 units, Jada said in a preliminary report. For the first three months of the year, sales were down by 4.3 per cent. The Jada report nonetheless contained a slice of good news for the industry. Sales of cars with engines larger than 2 litres, which are more expensive and profitable, rose by 40.8 per cent to 86,632 units in March. Small cars (excluding minicars) were hit hardest, with sales down 15 per cent to 404,954 units. Meanwhile, a report by the Economic Planning Agency issued yesterday showed that plant and equipment investment by Japanese companies would rise by an average of 4.6 per cent in the next three years, compared to an average rise of 10.6 per cent in the past three years. A main reason for the decline was the difficulty companies have raising funds on the depressed stock market, according to a survey of companies. The EPA report also said that investment in labour saving equipment and spending on research and development were affected by interest rate movements. Many analysts had assumed that these areas of investment were relatively unaffected by financial market trends.</p>

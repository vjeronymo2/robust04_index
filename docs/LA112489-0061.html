The discovery near the town of Ludlow, Mo., came  in the seventh week of an investigation into the disappearance of drifters  hired to work for Ray and Faye Copeland, a farm couple from nearby Mooresville.  Copeland is 75 and his wife is 68. Three of the bodies have been identified,  and the Copelands were charged with murder in those deaths. They are in jail on  $500,000 bail each, suspected of killing their employees after using them to  buy cattle fraudulently.  </P></p>

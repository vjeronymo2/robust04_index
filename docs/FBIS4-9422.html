			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bogdana Paun: "One More Ethnic Hungarian </F> Sentenced to Prison After the 1989 December Events To Be  Released"]    [Text] Yesterday in Alba Iulia another court session took  place in the litigation initiated after the presidential decree  pardoning eight ethnic Hungarians who were sentenced to long  prison terms for their involvement in the December 1989 events  [crimes against policemen] was overruled [by the local court of  justice] in three cases.    The court ruled that Mihaly Balint, of Cristuru Secuiesc,  should be released from jail. He is to leave prison within the  next three days, during which the formalities will be completed.  Otherwise he would have had to serve three more months of  imprisonment.    The other two detainees did not benefit from a similar court  ruling. Over the next few days they will appeal the ruling at  the Supreme Court of Justice. The argumentation of the  [negative] ruling says that one of them participated in an  attempt to break out of prison, while the other had committed a  crime that was too serious for him to be pardoned.    "This is an anomaly. First because in the prison logbook  there is no word about any attempted breakout, and second  because other persons who have meanwhile already been freed were  sentenced for the same things," Bela Marko, chairman of UDMR  [Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] told us.</p>

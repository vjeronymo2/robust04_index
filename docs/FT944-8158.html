He said at the weekend: 'I have been at the centre of the (peace) process from the very beginning. I can tell you there are no deadlines for the IRA, no secret deals.'

Mr Hume started bilateral talks with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fe'in, the IRA's political wing, in 1988. At the weekend he paid tribute to the part played in the peace process by Mr Albert Reynolds, former prime minister of the Irish Republic, but added: 'We in this party take it for granted that all major parties in the Dail (parliament) are totally committed to the peace process and we will work closely with whatever government emerges to continue the process.'

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ST. IVES DENIES TAKEOVER RUMORS AFTER STOCK SOARS  </P> <P> The stock of St. Ives Laboratories has been as hot as the devil lately.  </P> <P> Amid persistent Wall Street rumors that the Chatsworth manufacturer of  personal-care products might soon get a takeover bid, St. Ives' stock rose  sharply last week in very heavy trading, the latest gain in a steady surge that  began in January.  </P> <P> The stock closed Monday at $14.625 a share, down 37.5 cents, in national  over-the-counter trading after advancing $1.875 last week. Last Tuesday alone,  St. Ives' stock jumped nearly 3 points before settling back to close with a  75-cent gain, as about 14 times the company's normal trading volume changed  hands.  </P> <P> The volatility prompted St. Ives to set aside its policy of not commenting on  market rumors and announce last week that it was "not a party to any  discussions or negotiations with any potential suitors."  </P> <P> However, St. Ives also hinted that it was open to a deal by saying it  periodically "examines its strategic direction and is currently doing so."  </P> <P> St. Ives, with sales of $104 million last year, makes shampoos, skin lotions  and other personal-care items that it markets under the "Swiss Formula" logo.  The company went public in July, 1987, at $13 a share, then watched the stock  drop below $6 last year before ending the year at $8.875 a share.  </P> <P> The stock got a boost early this year after Stephen Redding, a vice president  of Nexxus Products Co., another personal-care products maker, disclosed that he  bought 5.3% of St. Ives' shares.  </P> <P> St. Ives' shares spurted further early this month after Minnetonka Corp., a  Minnesota-based cosmetics concern, put itself on the sales block. Traders  apparently speculated that a new round of takeover interest in  personal-products companies might be in the offing.  </P> <P> But St. Ives, in its announcement last week, dampened any speculation about a  possible bid by Redding or Nexxus -- to which St. Ives sells some products --  by saying Redding recently sold 40,000 of his shares, paring his St. Ives stake  to 4.9%. Redding had previously said he bought the stock as an investment.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, it's unlikely that a takeover proposal would materialize without  the blessing of St. Ives' management. Gary H. Worth, chairman, and Robert Van  Dine, vice chairman, together own a controlling 53.3% of the company's stock.  </P></p>

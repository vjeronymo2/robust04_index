			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MAY TOUGHEN TRAVEL ADVISORY, CUT GULF AREA STAFFS;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: IT MAY URGE MORE AMERICANS TO LEAVE SAUDI ARABIA, YEMEN AND JORDAN AS  U.N. DEADLINE APPROACHES.  </P> <P> U.S. officials are considering a stronger travel warning for Americans in Saudi  Arabia and contemplating a reduction in embassy staffs throughout the Middle  East in areas where there might be popular opposition to a military conflict  with Iraq.  </P> <P> The British Embassy already has reiterated an earlier travel advisory for  citizens in Saudi Arabia's oil-rich Eastern province, advising British  dependents to take holiday vacations in England and remain outside Saudi Arabia  "until the situation in the (Persian) Gulf becomes clearer."  </P> <P> Both moves come shortly after passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution  giving Iraq a Jan. 15, 1991, deadline for pulling out of Kuwait, a move that  officials here say has prompted a re-evaluation of whether the thousands of  foreign workers in Saudi Arabia can safely remain at their jobs.  </P> <P> "This is obviously a new development that could lead to something, so you have  to review your guidance," said one source familiar with the reviews. "How can  they make it a little bit stronger without causing unnecessary panic?"  </P> <P> Since mid-August, a U.S. travel advisory has advised families of American  workers in the Eastern province, the center of the U.S. military buildup and  the region closest to the Kuwait border, to leave the country. About 6,000 to  7,000 Americans have either left the province or failed to return from summer  vacations outside the kingdom, officials said.  </P> <P> Now, U.S. officials are looking at the possibility of extending the  recommendation for dependents to include non-essential employees in the Eastern  province, or perhaps to make such departures mandatory. Another proposal under  review would extend the travel advisory to all or part of the Central province,  which includes the capital of Riyadh.  </P> <P> U.S. officials are also looking at reducing embassy staffs in Saudi Arabia and  in countries elsewhere in the Middle East, such as Jordan and Yemen, where a  conflict with Iraq might spark popular unrest. Some non-essential embassy  personnel already have left the embassy in Yemen, and some embassy dependents  in Jordan have left the country.  </P> <P> Travel advisories recommending departures for dependents in Bahrain, the United  Arab Emirates and Qatar are also under review.  </P> <P> Embassy officials here refused to comment on the proposals. Spokesman John  Kincannon said the State Department has made no decision on tightening travel  restrictions or reducing embassy staffing levels. "We're sort of assessing  possibilities, discussing contingencies," he said.  </P> <P> Rumors of an impending upgrade in the travel advisory have already sent some  shock waves through the business community in Riyadh, where companies may face  large costs for sending dependents home.  </P> <P> "We don't mind evacuating them if it's really not safe here. What we want to  know is why they've told us all along it was safe to be here, and all of a  sudden now it's not safe?" one U.S. business manager asked.  </P> <P> In fact, most officials believe that Riyadh would likely not be severely  threatened even in the event of a war with Iraq. However, the northern portion  of the Central province, near the Iraqi border and the giant military base at  Hafar al Batin, likely would be threatened, sources said.  </P> <P> Saudi officials have also expressed concern over any travel advisories that  would prompt an exodus of foreign workers, who form the backbone of some of the  kingdom's most critical industries, including the oil industry.  </P> <P> "Saudi Arabia's not quite like other countries. We all know about the large  foreign presence here and the large number of basic services that are provided  by foreigners, and that includes the military," said one diplomat.  </P> <P> There are about 15,000 to 18,000 U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia, about 13,000 of  them in the Eastern province. About 23,000 British citizens are in the kingdom.  Embassy officials said about 3,000 to 4,000 Britons have left Saudi Arabia  since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> STOCKTON;  </P> <P> 3 KILLED IN BARROOM SHOOTING; 3 JAILED  </P> <P> A father and son and the woman they allegedly wanted to avenge have been booked  for investigation of murder after a barroom shooting that left three men dead.  </P> <P> Arrested were Herbert Jacobsen, 46, his son, Ronald Jacobsen, 20, and Vickie  Jane Bird, 33, all of Stockton. Bird, who had been in an argument with one of  the victims, allegedly urged the elder Jacobsen to avenge her, San Joaquin  County sheriff's deputies said. The shootings apparently stemmed from the  dispute between Bird and one of the victims, Francis Ollis, 26, of Stockton.  Two men, Victor Luft, 24, and Timothy Loveland, 26, both of Stockton, were shot  and killed when they went to Ollis' aid, investigators said.  </P></p>

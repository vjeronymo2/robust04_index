			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A meeting of workers of  the Nampo Smelting Complex was held on May 24 to support the  struggle of the South Korean workers for a wage hike.    Yi Kwang-tu, chairman of the complex committee of the  General  Federation of Trade Unions, and other speakers said the South  Korean workers eke out a scanty livelihood, not paid in time  even insignificant wages and paying tax with it, while commodity  prices soaring high.    It is only too natural that they have risen in struggle  against the anti-popular predatory policy and wage-curbing move  of the authorities, the speakers noted.    They charged that the South Korean ruling quarters, however,  ruthlessly cracked down on the workers at the point of the  bayonet by sending a large number of riot police to places of  their protest rallies, demonstrations and sit-in strikes.    Saying the reality clearly shows that, while the Kim  Yong-sam  puppet clique is left intact at the helm of power, the South  Korean workers cannot extricate themselves from the miserable  lot, and independence, democracy and reunification cannot be  expected, they expressed full support to the South Korean  workers in their struggle for the right to existence, democracy  and independent reunification.    They said the South Korean workers should not stop their  struggle till their demand has been met but strengthen  solidarity with the people of all other strata and take an  organized joint action by pooling efforts with them.</p>

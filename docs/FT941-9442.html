			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): New life for old form of financing - An unusual factoring technique has been revived Ever since Eddie George called on companies last month to find ways of financing growth other than by overdraft, the factoring industry has been on a roll. This flexible form of finance is growing rapidly, albeit from a low base, and appears to be shedding the poor image that has dogged it for years. The industry has even persuaded George to speak at its annual dinner this year, the first time a Bank of England governor has graced the event. But the traditional factoring and invoice discounting product may be about to receive a small shock. A start-up company backed by Mees Pierson, the Dutch merchant bank which helped put the Netherlands on the map as a trading nation, has re-introduced a form of debtor financing to the UK not seen since the mid-18th century. Foster Church was formed by Frank Horack, a former banker with Chase Manhattan, and has some of the characteristics of factoring. Specifically, debtor financing provides rapidly growing companies with a working capital facility that grows as sales grow. This is an important attraction of factoring - growing companies can find they are constantly bumping up against their overdraft ceilings. But there the similarity ends. Where a factor buys its clients' debts, Foster Church buys their goods and effectively becomes the seller to the customer. In return it gives the supplier up to 80 per cent of the value of the sale in cash on a non-recourse basis and advances credit to the customer. What is more, unlike in a factoring arrangement, Foster Church allows its clients to present as few or as many invoices as they like. A factoring company will generally only factor the entire debtor book, so that companies can find themselves paying for a service that they are not actually using. And it does not seek personal guarantees from directors of the companies it serves. While the cost of Foster Church's finance is similar to that of factors  - about 4 per cent over bank base rate - its commission is steep at 3 per cent per transaction. Horack says this is justified as companies pay only for services they use. But it also means its debtor financing service is unlikely to be attractive unless a company is both growing rapidly and enjoys healthy gross margins. There is one other novelty. Because it is focused on higher-risk small growing companies, Foster Church has the right to 'earn' options to buy an equity stake. As the client's use of the service increases, so does Foster Church's right to share options. No one seriously expects Foster Church's so-called Excel-erator to mount a single-handed challenge to traditional factoring. Debtor financing is unsuitable for many companies and some businessmen and women remain reluctant to give up equity, even if this financing method would speed up the pace of development. But the debtor financing method has proved effective for some companies which have found factoring too restrictive. 'The factoring package usually is an all or nothing situation - they take your entire debtor list. Foster Church is more flexible,' says Alan Houston, managing director of Heritage Food, which makes frozen desserts and has sales of Pounds 2m which are growing by about 25 per cent a year. He has also used Foster Church for acquisitions. 'You can accelerate cash flow at critical times. If you seek a bank facility on buying a business, the bank will look for six months' trading experience before lending.' Charles Stacey, managing director of British Astec, which sells therapeutic beds and chairs to the National Health Service among others, is another enthusiast. 'Because of the expansion rate we have been able to achieve we have had constant cash flow problems,' says Stacey. 'They can cure our cash flow very quickly.' Debtor financing will not work for every company but Eddie George would be proud. Foster Church: 021 236 1457</p>

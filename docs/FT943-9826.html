			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Freeing Latin American trade The agreement by the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay last week to put in place a customs union from the start of next year is a potentially encouraging development. It is vital, however, that this agreement prove outward-looking, not just towards the rest of Latin America, but towards the world. It is still too early to be sure it will pass that test. The decision to go ahead with the Mercosur customs union is yet another indication that the region's governments have buried historical rivalries and are trying to turn away from protectionist and statist economic policies. It also gives a symbolic boost to the cause of economic integration in the western hemisphere, however remote that goal remains. The Mercosur accord - which brings together 190m people in a market worth more than Dollars 600bn a year - should secure a relatively open Brazilian economy. For much of Latin America, that may be a more important objective than free trade with the US. Although Mercosur has failed to meet the ambitious goals of free movement of labour, capital and goods initially envisaged by the four governments, the treaty obligations of Mercosur will make it much more difficult for them to return to protectionism. The fact that a customs union - with a common external tariff regime - has been created should also prove positive. Behind a common tariff, there is no need to formulate complicated rules of origin for imports. These are an inevitable feature of the patchwork of free trade agreements being negotiated in the Americas and also a potentially significant obstacle to trade. Building block The agreement has also been framed to allow for future accession - initially on an associate basis - of other countries, such as Bolivia and Chile. It thus has the potential to become the building block, rather than a stumbling block, towards further economic integration. For all that, the devil of such agreements is in the details - aspects of which are still unclear - and the way governments choose to implement them. Unfortunately, the governments tend to see the creation of trading blocs as an answer to an imaginary dilemma, namely that their economies are trapped between the high technology exporters, on the one hand, and the ultra low-wage economies of Asia, on the other. The risk is that such a defensive view of trade opportunities will lead to the replication of mistaken import substitution policies at an international level. If barriers to imports are set too high, trade diversion will outweigh trade creation, economic efficiency will deteriorate and export performance falter. This, in turn, will vindicate initial defensiveness and reinforce protectionist sentiment. Obvious flaws From this perspective, Mercosur has obvious flaws. The agreement has forced Argentina, for example, to raise its current zero tariff on capital goods imports to between 14 and 16 per cent. An important sector of Argentine industry will be protected from Brazilian competition for a five-year period  -worrying because such 'temporary' protection often has a way of becoming permanent. Similarly, the car regime provides continued heavy protection for domestic automobile manufacturers. One worry then is that Mercosur might encourage its members to believe they have an alternative to seeking global competitiveness. Another is that it may make hemispheric integration not easier, but more difficult to achieve. One trade specialist, Ms Nora Lustig at the Brookings Institution in Washington, has suggested the establishment of a regional agency to ensure such accords remain open to third parties. She suggests such an agency should be a central topic at the forthcoming summit of the Americas which President Bill Clinton has called in Miami in December. The idea is right, but should be taken still further. The aim must not just be to ensure these accords do not raise obstacles to hemispheric economic integration. They must also be consistent with what Latin American countries have most shied away from during the past half century: integrating efficiently with the world economy. Here is an agenda item for the World Trade Organisation.</p>

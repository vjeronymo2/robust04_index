			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 15, BNS -- Assembly Party leader Tiit  Vahi yesterday spoke about Pro Patria as future coalition  partner of his party.    Vahi said in an interview to BNS that "with regard to the  taxation system, we are of the opinion that the taxation policy  of the future coalition between the Assembly Party and Pro  Patria will pay more attention to the interests of enterprises  than the present policy."    Vahi told BNS he attaches great importance to future  cooperation between the two parties.    The Assembly Party recently proposed coalition talks to Pro  Patria. The Pro Patria parliament faction plans to discuss the  offer on Tuesday [15 March].    "(Prime Minister) Mart Laar's unwillingness to collaborate  with the Assembly Party doesn't mean that the entire Pro Patria  declines to cooperate with the Assembly Party," Vahi said in a  comment on the statement Laar made on Saturday.    Laar, who is Pro Patria's chairman, told BNS on Saturday  that  the implementation of Assembly Party policies would send taxes  skyrocketing and put a stop to radical economic reform. It is  difficult for Pro Patria to find points of contact with "red  directors" and former collective farm managers, he claimed.    "Pro Patria takes no interest in collaboration with the  specialists of the Assembly Party administration who granted  multimillion-kroon interest-free risk credits and whose  thoughtless guarantees have caused the state damage to the tune  of over 100 million kroons," the premier said.    The editorial in today's issue of the Hommikuleht daily  regards Laar's statement as an attempt to foil the forthcoming  meeting with the Assembly Party leader.    A Hommikuleht commentator voiced the opinion that Laar  dreads  Vahi "like lightning," since the leader of the Assembly Party  has been making overtures to the Pro Patria wing that has  distanced itself from Laar: "The premier has reason to fear that  he may drop the reins of Pro Patria, which he holds not too  securely, anyway."    Vahi claimed that the Assembly Party program largely  coincides with that of Pro Patria. The party, however, strives  for a more decentralized taxation policy, elimination of  turnover tax levied on entrepreneurs who import goods, and  changing of the taxation system concerning taxes levied on  farmers, Vahi said commenting on the differences between the two  parties' programs.    "I think that, if we solve these questions, the actual tax  burden of enterprises will decrease," Vahi said. He maintained  that the taxation policy of the future Assembly Party-Pro Patria  coalition should be more enterprise-friendly.    The Assembly Party led by former Prime Minister Tiit Vahi is  at present in opposition. Opinion polls indicate, however, that  it holds the top position among Estonian political parties. The  party also won the elections to the Tallinn City Council last  autumn.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> After a good rain, colors, contrasts and contours seem to snap with clarity.  This is the vision that Astrid Preston brings to her paintings of tree-lined  roads, cityscapes, verdant woods and valleys. Whatever the subject or quality  of light, Preston gives her landscapes the almost too-sharp look of a  hallucination.  </P> <P> The daughter of architects, Preston began by making funny little houses from  clear geometric shapes in aluminum. The work was about shape, line and form as  well as symbolic meanings of shelter. Later she began painting familiar Santa  Monica streets that we could not imagine anyone strolling on, followed by  strangely beautiful houses painted at night that we could not imagine anyone  living in.  </P> <P> Current works continue to push the landscape genre a few more notches away from  strict realism. Large canvases are organized into broad sweeping roads that  recede quickly toward the background, pulling us toward an unknown destination.  Preston brings incandescent blue skies down to meet roads lined with dark  bushes and trees. Palms mix illogically with pines, night light mingles with  seering sun all in the same canvas. Many scenes are dotted with pockets of  unexplained light, as if some person hiding in the scene were shining a lamp  out toward the intruding viewer.  </P> <P> There are no overt references to geometry and architecture in these  increasingly mature works, but you still sense structure in tight composition  and graceful execution, and you still sense a Hopperesque comment on alienation  in the lush lime-green knolls that invite us in only to hold us at arm's  length.

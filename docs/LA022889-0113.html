			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATION LAPSE CLAIMED IN BODY CASE  </P> <P> County officials said the body of a man shot Jan. 29 by police remained  unclaimed at the morgue Monday because of an apparent lack of communication.  </P> <P> Lt. Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Sheriff-Coroner's Department, said that  the Gonzales family of Garden Grove was contacted Saturday and informed that  the body of Dennis Paul Gonzales could be claimed for burial or cremation. But  as of Monday evening, it had not been removed. The Gonzaleses could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Gonzales' mother, Dolores Gonzales, said last week that she and another son had  left numerous phone messages at the coroner's office, trying to find out why  the body was being kept there.  </P> <P> Senior Deputy Coroner Richard McAnally said Monday, "There was some kind of  miscommunication between the family and I don't know who."  </P> <P> Gonzales, 20, was shot to death when he allegedly threatened Garden Grove  police who responded to a disturbance call at the house of a friend of  Gonzales. The gun that Gonzales allegedly brandished turned out to be a toy,  authorities said. The case is under investigation by the district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Olson said a hold is placed on the bodies of shooting victims, and the families  are notified when the bodies may be released to a mortuary. Olson added that  the department would verify that all procedures were followed in this case.  </P></p>

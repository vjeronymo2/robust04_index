			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: A high-tech toyshop - Colin Amery enjoys the work of architect Nicholas Grimshaw through an exhibition of mock-ups and moving models This newspaper is printed in one of the best modern buildings in London. The Financial Times printing plant in East India Dock is easily the most stylish, light and elegant structure in its neighbourhood and the sight of the entire printing process through the great glass wall is a thrilling vision of powerful, moving machinery. The architects were Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, a firm which since the early 1980s has gone consistently from strength to strength as a leading and versatile practitioner of British High-Tech architecture. In London at the Royal Institute of British Architects there is a remarkable exhibition of the recent work of the Grimshaw practice entitled Structure Space and Skin (until May 29 at 66 Portland Place, London W1). Architectural exhibitions are difficult things to make appealing to the public, but this one is. Going into the great hall at the top of the stairs is like entering a wonderful high-tech toy shop. One of the things I have always liked about Grimshaw is his endless, almost child-like enthusiasm for things new. To see him at the Riba surrounded by the moving models and giant mock-ups of elements from his buildings was like meeting Dr Coppelius as he prepared to wind up his dolls. What is intriguing about British High-Tech architecture is its Britishness. Those architects who practise this glorification and exposure of the engineering and building process do not particularly like it being called a 'style'. Showing the world how a building is constructed, revealing a fascination with the joints, ducts and fixings, is somehow both child-like and unsophisticated while wanting to appear scientific and super technological. I sometimes wonder whether High-Tech architecture is actually any more sophisticated than Elizabethan half-timbering that showed the world the structural elements of a timber frame, pegs and all. In this exhibition the most recent Grimshaw projects and built work can be examined. Much of the early work of this practice demonstrated the appearance of a technology that functions ever smoothly, content with its own imagery. The later buildings - the Berlin Stock Exchange, the Western Morning News - and some of the projects in the accompanying book suggest a search for a visual language that means more than the exposure of building elements. It started at the British Government Pavilion at Seville when the wall of water cascading down the glass facade subsumed the pavilion into a mysterious block of moving liquid that was expressing coolness and a response to the climate of a Spanish summer. But why is the Western Morning News a ship marooned on dry land? Why is the Berlin Stock Exchange like an upturned boat? Why does the Channel tunnel terminal at Waterloo station show all its joints like a knobbly finger? The Western Morning News building I have only seen from the outside, moored on the edge of the city of Plymouth with a boardroom set on a 'bridge' exactly as though the whole thing were a liner or a battleship. The walls curve and present a concave surface as they rise up. The newspaper wanted the printing, editorial and office functions to be together in one building so, appropriately, when everyone is all 'aboard' there is a sense of belonging to a unified organisation. In the book published with the exhibition there are elaborate and beautiful drawings and models of all the elements that were specially made for the Western Morning News, which is another irony of High-Tech. It often looks as though it is made of simple factory-made parts and the success of the building depends upon the way these parts are assembled; in fact, the process is a complex, rather old-fashioned craft approach that is strictly bespoke and often expensive. Perhaps the most exciting and enjoyable model in the exhibition is the display about the Waterloo Channel tunnel link terminal, which should be seen with the video. The architect saw this project (which won in competition with 10 other firms) as 'an heroic railway station with the same function as a 21st-century airport'. It is a long, thin, curved addition to Waterloo station, with a spectacular roof. The shape is intriguing, a three-centred arch with one centre displaced to the side as a response to five tracks and three platforms. A great deal of the passenger movement will take place beneath the tracks, and so the light and graceful shape of the roof is vital if passengers are to have the 'sense of wonderment' that the architect desires. What the model at the Riba reveals is that this 'travel' architecture is a response to the complex plan of movement. The great roof is going to be one of the sights of London - and one that is only revealed once you are inside it. More spectacular still, but not as yet built, is the airport proposal that was shown at the Venice Biennale last year. It is a solution to the airport design problem that could, by its very simplicity, provide an uplifting architectural experience. The model itself has sculptural qualities that have evolved from the elegant structural proposals. I recommend this exhibition very warmly and wonder how many visitors will share my critical ambivalence about the architectural success of the High-Tech movement. It is like Star Wars - an explosion of ingenuity that can overkill the problem with its own apparent cleverness.

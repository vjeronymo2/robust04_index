			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Property: In search of a country living - Do you want a rural lifestyle? Gerald Cadogan looks at barns and farm buildings Farmer Richard Carlton looked at his barn. 'There was only a horse in here six months ago,' he said. Now at Lower Farm, in the village of Bucknell, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, half the barn holds the offices of NMA Marketing, a property marketing consultant company. The other - soundproofed - half is home to the newly-formed Glass Gramophone Company which remasters golden-oldie hits from scratchy 78rpm records to make compact discs. Across the yard, Carlton is converting another barn and he has one more to tackle. Carlton's barns are nothing special in themselves - many barns are listed buildings, but not Carlton's. They were too small to house modern farm machines and were not really needed for the farm: the barn with the horse had been built as a milking parlour in the 1920s - but Carlton does not keep cows. So he sought an alternative use for them. He obtained outline planning permission to convert one of the barns into a house but as it was the closest to his own farmhouse, he was not eager to sell it. Holiday lets were not as good an option in north-east Oxfordshire as they might have been in the Cotswolds to the west. Nevertheless, he may eventually convert other buildings for holiday use. His choice was to create industrial units for letting. Although deep in the countryside, Bucknell is just three miles from junction 10 on the M40 (where a service station opens shortly). And Cherwell district council liked the idea of units. It felt they would bring business to an area badly hit by the departure of the US Air Force from Upper Heyford, and would avoid adding to the stock of local rented dwellings. And, as the barns and farm are in the village area, they would not distort the traditional pattern of self-contained villages separated by fields that planners try to maintain. When the scheme started NMA arranged the let through James Offen, Carlton's agent, and had the office fitted to its own specifications. NMA moved in just before Christmas. The staff enjoy the new freedom of a roomy office with high ceilings and windows that look out over fields. Next door, Glass Gramophone asked for plenty of soundproofing in the walls of its recording studio. Nothing must disturb its work of cleaning the sound by removing the hiss, crackle and pop on discs by artists such as George Formby and Duke Ellington. Carlton is pleased with the result although he admits it is strange having neighbours on the farm for the first time in many years. Barns are, of course, commercial buildings. They were never intended to be homes and often do not convert well. For example, how do you put windows into long, blank walls designed to keep the elements away from the produce stored inside? How do you introduce an upper floor? Or cope with big barn doors, that open into what is, in effect, a great hall? In the 1980s, when buyers snapped up every manor, farmhouse and rectory in the country, barns were an easy substitute. Old and substantial, and as rooted in country life as seed-time and harvest, they offered instant heritage. But there have been plenty of bad conversions. Besides offices, barns make fine workshops, theatres, concert halls, dance halls (real barn dance nights are back), restaurants and tearooms. All these uses can keep the excitement of the building's space and height, which is difficult in a barn made into a three or four-bedroom and two-bathroom house. But one objection planners may have to commercial use is a lack sufficient parking space. Isolated barns are especially difficult. Some district councils will not allow conversions where the properties are in the middle of fields. So should they be left to become roofless ruins? Or be dismembered for their stone and slates? The unsentimental answer may be yes, either course may be appropriate. If a barn does not have a cottage attached, planners see no justification for a green-field single development breaking the habitation pattern. Costs are also a factor: an isolated barn might need a long, solid drive and utilities are expensive to install over long distances. Councils also fear the barn-house might be the thin end of the wedge: applications for a tennis court or a swimming pool may follow. Not all councils are so purist about isolated barns if new plans retain a building's character. English Heritage might become involved if the building is listed and in principle the organisation prefers commercial or community use to residential. Whatever the use, buyers should check with local councils on what is allowed, and whether residential planning permission could change to commercial or vice versa. Sellers will almost certainly have obtained outline permission before putting the barn on the market. Besides the units at Bucknell, three studio workshops in old farm buildings at Tresprison near Helston in Cornwall are available to rent from Philpott Homes. Yorkshire Water is selling several barns and old farm buildings (some isolated) in the glorious country of the Washburn valley near Harrogate, in Yorkshire, through joint agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe and Dacre Son &amp; Hartley. Prices start at Pounds 75,000. They need work but could be a good buy for tele-workers who require only a fax and a modem, and would like to arrange the conversion themselves. Lane Fox offers a listed barn for Pounds 42,500 in the village of Moreton Pinkney, built in the typical Northamptonshire style of alternating courses of light and dark stone. A timber tithe barn, at Etchinghill, near Folkestone, Kent, comes to auction on January 28 in Maidstone. Auctioneer Clive Emson expects it to sell for about Pounds 65,000-Pounds 75,000. At West Marden, in the South Downs, Sussex, on the border with Hampshire, a brick and flint barn is available for Pounds 78,000 from Jackson-Stops. Its strict planning permission runs out in December. Converted barns on offer include a timber barn at Pakenham, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk (Bedford, Pounds 175,000), and a group of farm buildings at Church Farm, near Castle Cary, Somerset (Jackson-Stops, Yeovil, from Pounds 140,000).

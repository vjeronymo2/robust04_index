			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO, OIL FIRMS JOIN FORCES TO CLEAN UP AIR;  </P> <P> INDUSTRY LEADERS HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENE TO IMPROVE FUEL, ENGINES  </P> <P> While state and federal officials move ahead with clean air proposals, leaders  of the Big Three domestic auto makers and several major oil companies have been  quietly meeting on their own to discuss forming a task force to research and  develop low-emission fuels and engines.  </P> <P> Top executives of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and  several oil companies last met on July 20 in Detroit to discuss setting up the  task force to look into ways to meet clean air requirements proposed by the  Bush Administration, said Arthur E. Wiese, a spokesman for the American  Petroleum Institute in Washington.  </P> <P> In the meantime, lower-level officials of both industries also have talked  about ways to meet clean air targets. Auto and oil companies favor meeting such  goals by reformulating gasoline and modifying existing auto systems rather than  by resorting to the use of alternative fuels, such as methanol, ethanol or  compressed natural gas. On Tuesday, Atlantic Richfield Co. announced the  introduction of reformulated gasoline for use in pre-1975 cars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Some Reason to Be Skeptical'  </P> <P> "Modifications to existing fuels and automobile engines simply make more sense  than betting on drastic life-style alterations and unknown technological  developments," said James S. Morrison, Arco executive vice president, in  testimony before the South Coast Air Quality Management District late last  year.  </P> <P> But air quality officials have said they doubt that any reformulated gasoline  could result in emissions reductions comparable to those possible under  methanol or other alternative fuels.  </P> <P> "Since there was not a lot of talk about reformulated gasoline as part of a  real effort to help us clean up the air until the alternate fuels program had a  lot of momentum, there's some reason to be skeptical about it," said Karl  Hellman, who heads the emissions control technology branch of the Environmental  Protection Agency's lab in Ann Arbor, Mich.  </P> <P> The joint industry task force would also look into methanol and other  alternative fuels, said Albert Greenstein, a spokesman for Arco.  </P> <P> The two industries have not reached agreement yet on the shape of the task  force and may have conflicting goals.  </P> <P> The Detroit meeting included Richard M. Morrow, chairman and chief executive of  Amoco Corp. and chairman of the API; Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman and chief  executive of Arco; Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive of Chevron  Corp.; Frank H. Richardson, president and chief executive of Shell Oil Co.;  James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive of Texaco Inc.; Roger B. Smith,  chairman and chief executive of General Motors; Harold Poling, vice chairman  and chief operating officer of Ford, and Gerald Greenwald, vice chairman of  Chrysler.  </P> <P> Since then, Unocal Corp. and other oil companies have become involved in the  group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resisted Methanol  </P> <P> Another meeting among the top executives may be in the works, said Mike Libbey,  a spokesman for Chevron.  </P> <P> Auto makers have argued that mandating alternative fuels would require major  redesign of existing vehicles and that production might not be feasible until  after 1995.  </P> <P> For their part, oil companies have resisted methanol as the alternative fuel of  choice. Besides requiring massive investments in new refineries and pipelines,  the use of methanol would raise serious questions about public safety and  health, the companies argue.  </P> <P> "If we can make big improvements in gasoline, the need to get quickly to  alternative fuels may not be as great since a lot of issues still have to be  resolved with them," Joseph M. Colucci, head of the fuels and lubricants  department at General Motors, said on Friday.  </P> <P> The joint meetings among top oil and auto executives have been precedent  setting, Wiese said. But agreement between the two groups may be hard in  coming.  </P> <P> When Morrison spoke to the AQMD in December, he predicted optimistically that a  coalition of energy companies would reach agreement with auto makers within 90  days on a project to develop cleaner automobile engine systems based on current  technologies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Want Improved Engines Too  </P> <P> Eight months later, "there is no agreement on table at this point; we're still  in the talking stages," said Donald R. Buist, director of automotive emissions  and fuel economy for Ford.  </P> <P> Emissions experts at the auto companies argue that the major improvements will  have to come from reformulated fuels, adding that auto makers have carried most  of the burden of recent smog mandates.  </P> <P> "There should be some greater interest on the part of the petroleum industry,"  said GM's Colucci. "If they can make gasoline into an alternative fuel, the  crude in the ground and the refineries that convert it into gasoline will still  have great utility."  </P> <P> Oil company officials argue that improvements must come in both engines and  fuels.  </P> <P> "It's always easier to ask the other industry to do the job," said Gordon E.  Allardyce, executive engineer in charge of certification and regulatory  programs with Chrysler. "But everyone recognizes that everyone has to do his  share," he said.  </P></p>

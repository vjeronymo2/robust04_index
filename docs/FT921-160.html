			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Yesterday's statement from Eurotunnel on the conclusions of the disputes panel was characteristically robust. But in marking the company's shares down 33p the market rightly concluded that the latest round in the battle with Transmanche Link (TML) had gone the contractors' way. The panel findings, to be sure, are not binding and Sir Alastair Morton can be relied upon to come up with good reasons why he should not triple the monthly fixed equipment payments as proposed. In forthcoming negotiations with TML, though, he will no doubt be conscious that the arbitrator in Brussels will at least take note of the panel's findings. A capital reconstruction is still not a certainty, but the odds have once again shortened.</p>

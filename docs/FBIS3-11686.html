			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Brazilian military commanders made it understood  to President Itamar Franco that they are willing to support him  in an hypothetical "self coup" given the serious institutional  crisis that exists between the government, the Federal Supreme  Court [STF], and Congress.    The newspaper O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO today reported that in  the face of the indignation caused by the salary privileges the  STF granted to itself and a similar attempt by members of  Congress, the eight military ministers suggested President  Franco carry out a coup.    During a meeting held five days ago with Franco in Planalto  Palace, the commanders found President Franco "receptive" to  their criticisms and demands to approve a salary equity law for  the three government branches.    Following the meeting, which was attended by some civilian  ministers, President Itamar Franco officially expressed his  discontent with the decision made by the STF and Congress, and  he then refused to grant them the wage increase, calculated to  be 10.9 percent and possibly amounting to more than $1.25  billion, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso said today.    When EFE asked a Government House spokesman about the "self  coup" idea, he answered: "No comment."    The military chiefs sent their message in different ways.  The  newspaper states that Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Cesar  Flores made the strongest proposals like closing down Congress,  the replacement of the STF justices, and earlier elections --  except for president.    As a result of this crisis, President Franco, a 63-year-old  civil engineer, has come out stronger in his position and,  according to O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO, he has become a chief of  state "under military tutelage with a discredited Congress and a  Judicial Branch that insists on not bending."    Franco said the STF decision "is outside the law," which  brought him applause from the Armed Forces, opposition leader  and presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula Da Silva, several  governors, and the public in general.    Franco, whose popularity has dropped constantly, was  supported by 85 percent of the people surveyed by the Instituto  Soma polling company.    "Franco has proceeded correctly. I do not know if he has  followed military instructions but the Judicial Branch has  committed a shameful action instead of creating justice," said  Da Silva, who is the favorite candidate for the 3 October  elections according to polls.    The STF justices and Judicial Branch employees today  received  their salaries without the 10.9-percent increase implemented to  compensate for an alleged salary loss as a result of the salary  conversion into the Real Value Unit (URV) based on the dollar  exchange rate and the plan implemented to curb inflation, which  amounts to 40 percent per month.    With the purpose of appeasing the spirits, the Senate has  rejected a decision by the Chamber of Deputies to follow the  STF's example and increase the salaries of members of Congress  and Legislative Branch employees by 23.5 percent.    The STF's discredit before the public and which Congress has  been suffering for several months has encouraged several  military chiefs to bring up the constitutional precept that  allows the president to declare a state of national defense and  they recalled the atmosphere preceding the 1964 military coup.    "The troops are not indifferent to the people's demands.  Thirty years ago we attended to a demand by the people for  ideological reasons, and now it may be for reasons of  `privileges' [the Judicial and Legislative Branches' salaries],"  said Federal Police chief and retired Army Colonel Wilson Romao.    Navy Minister Ivan Serpa criticized the justices and members  of Congress, but he also rejected any eventual coup attempt by  military units. "If I find someone defending that position I  will either arrest or discharge him," Serpa said.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Cutting the links could be a long job: Individual Australian states 'might retain the monarch if they wished' WANTED: an eminent Australian, aged 35-plus, with no political predilections and a clear diary after the year 2000. The committee advising Australia's federal government on how to go about replacing the British monarch with an Australian head of state yesterday concluded the change could be effected with little alteration to the country's constitution. The Queen and her governor-general - whose job is to represent the British monarch as head of state in Australia - could be replaced by an apolitical Australian figurehead. But the Republic Advisory Committee also acknowledged that it 'would be legally possible' for the constitution to permit individual Australian states to retain the British monarch as their head of government, should they wish. It suggested state powers be clarified in this regard, depending on whether or not such a possibility was thought desirable. Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the lawyer-cum-merchant banker who chaired the Republic Advisory Committee, later admitted cutting Australia's constitutional ties to Britain could be a long process, involving several referenda. 'Will we be a republic in 2001? That is going to require a lot of work,' he told the National Press Club in Canberra. 'It's not something that is going to fall into the republicans' lap like an overripe fruit.' The Turnbull committee was not asked to consider the merits of republicanism  -merely to look at the legal and constitutional implications of ousting the existing system. This dampened opposition to the report itself, although the government's critics fired a few salvoes regardless. 'The real question is not how we achieve change but whether such change is either warranted or desirable,' snapped Mr John Hewson, opposition leader. What the committee did consider, briefly, was whether a head of state was necessary - no minor question, since the annual cost is put at about ADollars 11m (Pounds 4.7m). It concluded that for 'symbolic' reasons, as well as for the convenience of having someone to perform ceremonial duties, strong advantages attached to retaining one. 'Parliament can provide for as lavish, or as spartan, a life-style for the (head of state) as it wishes,' added the report. From this premise, the committee went on to enumerate potential qualifications for the job, duties involved, and who should elect - and if necessary - dismiss the head of state. There were few firm conclusions, but a long list of the options available. The committee, however, spent some time debating what powers an Australian head of state should have if the Senate refused to support a government money bill. This happened in 1975, prompting the governor-general to exercise his powers to dismiss the prime minister, and an election was duly called. The possibility of a repeat scenario has been mooted recently, because the government's budget has been stalled in the Senate for almost two months, but few observers think this a likely outcome. Tempers flared in Canberra yesterday, where the government is still struggling to get its budget proposals, first unveiled in mid-August, through the Senate. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, cut question time short and left the chamber, after the opposition heckled Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister. The Turnbull committee decided there were several possibilities: to continue existing conventions; give the new 'head of state' formal powers of dismissal if the government breached the constitution (by spending money it was not authorised to raise); to provide in the constitution for an automatic dissolution of both houses of parliament in this situation, or remove the senate's power to reject or delay money bills. Tactfully, the committee gave no hint of its preferred answer. Union leaders in Canberra yesterday reached agreement with the government on an industrial relations reform package, which could significantly extend devolved wage-fixing, or 'enterprise bargaining'. The two sides seemed yesterday to have reached a compromise on the issue of non-union employees entering enterprise agreements.</p>

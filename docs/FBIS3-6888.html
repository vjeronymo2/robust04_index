The explosion occurred in Kanggye in  Chagang Province where military plants are concentrated. In  addition to the loss of life, the accident destroyed several  buildings in the city. The "Kanggye No. 26 General Plant" was  North Korea's largest underground facility built in mountain  tunnels with a total of 20,000 people employed there; missile  assembly sites and other functions were reportedly removed  following the accident.    SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained these comments from Ko Chong-song,  32, who lived in Kanggye and defected to the Republic of Korea  via China last June. During a three-year period beginning in  1984, Ko daily went to the plant as a boxer with membership in  the plant's "sports team." Moreover, his two brothers were  serving as the accounting department chief and an engineer; he  also had many friends working there. Therefore, he was familiar  with the internal affairs of the plant.    According to Ko, the first explosion occurred around 2130  [1230 GMT] on 30 November. His apartment was approximately 2  kilometers from the plant and was blocked by a hill, but he  reported that the terrible noise and vibrations emanating from  the explosion were like those of an earthquake. The night sky  turned red with fire, and explosions continued until 1030 [0130  GMT] the next morning. The blasts shattered the windows of his  apartment, and many houses in the city were destroyed or burned.    The accident occurred at an outdoor materials dump near no.  11 missile assembly site. Mishandling of explosives set off a  fire which touched off a series of blasts among missiles and  artillery ordinance. The official death toll was put at 127,  but it was rumored among citizens that the toll should be about  200, including civilian casualties.    Immediately after the incident, a "suicide squad" was  organized to seal off the entrance to the tunnel to prevent  explosions from spreading inside the underground complex; some  20 volunteers were killed during the attempt. Five were later  awarded the title "Heroes of the Republic."    Following the incident, many party and government leaders--  including then-Premier Yon Hyong-mok, Korean Workers' Party  [KWP] Secretary (in charge of military supplies) Kim Chang-ho,  and KWP Second Economic Commission Chairman Kim  Man-song--inspected the plant. Kanggye was sealed off for 20  days following the accident, and a strict news blackout was  imposed on the area.    In addition to missiles, the plant was producing various  munitions, including rocket bombs, depth charges, torpedoes, and  mines. Surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and air-to-surface  missiles were respectively codenamed "Hwasong [Mars] 1, 2, and  3"; they possessed a range of up to 200 kilometers. Ko noted  the plant is presently producing a new missile with a range of  over 550 kilometers.    All products of the plant were originally designed in the  former Soviet Union. They are exported mainly to Iran and other  Middle East countries. Plant personnel used to say: "The  Iran-Iraq War was a field experiment for our weapons."    The plant is built at the foot of a rocky mountain and is 2  kilometers in width. Production sections and assembly sites are  located inside the tunnels, and non-production sections such as  material dumps and management offices are located outside.    Chagang Province is a mountainous region in North Korea  adjoining the Chinese border. North Korea's military industries  are concentrated in the region, and civilian traffic is strictly  controlled. Under such circumstances, the accident has been  kept secret until now.</p>

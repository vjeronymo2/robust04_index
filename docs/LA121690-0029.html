			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAND LOVER  </P> <P> They've done it again. On a televised parade, a band is introduced, then cut  for commercials, chit-chat, small-talk or fill-in talk (by the announcers).  </P> <P> There are those of us who love the bands, majorettes and drill teams -- who  feel these units make a parade.  </P> <P> Come on -- don't discriminate against the marching band units. It's too late  now for this year's Hollywood Christmas Parade (Channel 5 Nov. 25) -- but let's  see more of those music makers in the Tournament of Roses Parade.  </P> <P> Gertrude Waggoner, Hawthorne  </P></p>

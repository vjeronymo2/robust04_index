			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Changchun City has  signed an agreement with South Korea's Hyondae Commercial  Company Limited to establish a joint venture with an annual  capacity of producing one million dashpots for automobiles and  motorcycles.    The project in this capital of northeast China's Jilin  Province, where the country's number one automobile plant is  located, marks a new wave of overseas investment in China's  automotive industry.    Just before this project, the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile  Corporation signed an agreement with Ford Motor Co. of the  United States to produce interior decoration parts for cars.    China is described as the world's largest potential auto  market, as some 270 million families are estimated to be  potential auto owners. Listed by China as one of the backbone  industries, auto production is expected to hit three million  vehicles a year by the end of the century, fueling demands for  auto parts.    As most of China's auto manufacturers started by assembling  foreign parts, domestic part makers have to greatly reduce costs  when China approaches its resumption of its status in GATT (the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). Joint production with  foreign auto makers is an option or even a way out for some  Chinese firms, experts say.    According to an official from the Ministry of  Machine-Building, most of the China's existing 116 auto makers  are Sino-foreign joint ventures. He added that China will  divert auto joint-ventures to auto parts production. He said  China plans to establish 200 enterprises to build another 200  auto parts production plants within the century, and so  Sino-foreign co-operation, he said, will be of vital importance.    in light of the growing Chinese market, Ford of the United  States set up a special department to deal with Chinese business  this year. General Motors started a joint venture to make auto  parts in Beijing this April and another two ventures are being  discussed with Chinese partners in Henan and Shenyang. Similar  Sino-foreign auto parts enterprises have also been established  by companies from France and other countries.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits at HK Telecom advance 15% at halfway Hongkong Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, yesterday met market expectations with a 15 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 4.19bn (USDollars 542m) for the six months to September 30. This compares with HKDollars 3.65bn at the halfway stage last year. Earnings were struck on an operating profit of HKDollars 4.75bn, up 14 per cent from HKDollars 4.17bn the previous year. Turnover rose 11 per cent to HKDollars 13.29bn, from HKDollars 11.94bn, with the biggest increases registered by equipment sales and rentals. International telephone services, which account for 62 per cent of turnover, improved 9 per cent to HKDollars 8.24bn The deceleration in international traffic growth was largely brought about by a slowdown in China traffic, which up until this year had been growing at a rate of more than 30 per cent annually. This has slowed to 21 per cent, which the company attributes to the macroeconomic control measures and low telephone line penetration, which now stands at one telephone for every 30 people. However, analysts questioned how much of a role the austerity measures, which were in place during the previous financial year, could have played in slowing telephone calls. China accounts for almost half of international traffic, and about one-third of international revenues. Earnings per share grew 15 per cent to 37.6 cents from 32.8 cents; the dividend rose to 26.9 cents from 23.4 cents. Hongkong Telecom also bore the brunt of reduced international call charges, which saw the price of calls on the most important routes to the US, Australia, Canada and the UK fall by 10 per cent. These reductions, twinned with an earlier round of cost-trimming, cost Hongkong Telecom about HKDollars 300m over the last six months, a figure which is expected to reach HKDollars 420m for the full year. Mr Linus Cheung, chief executive, said strong growth in mobile operations - in which Hongkong Telecom has a 34 per cent market share - and tight cost controls fuelled the growth in interim profits. This raises question marks over future growth, as earnings driven by cost control may prove more difficult to sustain. Analysts believe salaries, the second largest component of costs and up 8 per cent this interim, may be harder to contain once competition starts on domestic fixed lines next July. The biggest percentage saving was made on the management fees payable to Cable &amp; Wireless. These fell 38 per cent to HKDollars 108m following a revised basis for payment: Hongkong Telecom now pays according to work done on its behalf by Cable &amp; Wireless, rather than a revenue-related fee. Hongkong Telecom expects returns on its China joint ventures, unveiled last month, by late 1995 to early 1996. See Lex</p>

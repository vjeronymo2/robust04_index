			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian  president, has arrived in Belgrade on a very brief working  visit. After meeting Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, he  shared his impressions with Russian journalists and gave an  interview especially for "Vesti."    [Begin Churkin recording] I was sent to Belgrade and met  President Milosevic to explain to the Serbian side the content  of the document that was adopted on 13 May at the ministerial  meeting in Geneva, which opens up a real opportunity for the  completion of the political settlement of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in keeping with the interests of all sides,  including those of the Bosnian Serbs, and, apart from anything  else, which opens up real prospects for lifting the sanctions  against Yugoslavia.    One practical result of my meeting with President Milosevic  is that, as I was convinced, the Serbian side is ready to  immediately sign an agreement on the cessation of hostile acts  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The students demanded to be paid before the end Sunday  of the holy Muslim fast month of Ramadan. They burned tyres and  tree branches blocking access to the only bridge linking the  banks of the Niger River which divides the capital, Niamey.    Police cleared several barricades making traffic possible at  parts of the city. Three demonstrators were wounded, the  executive secretary of the Union of Niger Students at Niamey  University, an affiliate of the Niger Students Union [USN],  Ousmane Abdrahmane, said. Soon after 7 P.M. (1800 GMT) police  restricted students to their campus.    Violent clashes between students and police which took place  over two days on 6 January led to the closing of the university.  In that incident the government put the number of people  wounded at 39. The demonstrators were also protesting against  the non-payment of their grant.    [Dakar PANA in French at 1032 GMT on 11 March, in a  Niamey-datelined item, adds: "A Niamey University student died  early this morning from wounds received yesterday during clashes  between antiriot police and activists of the radical USN."]</p>

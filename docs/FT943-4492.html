			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / People: Allan leaves BET for Ocean John Allan, BET's group marketing director who has been on the board for the past seven years, has been appointed chief executive of Ocean Group, the freight, environmental and marine services company. Allan, 46, whose appointment is seen as a significant coup for Ocean, will take up his new post at the end of this month. His move ends the uncertainty over the succession to Nicholas Barber, chief executive for eight years, who left Ocean last month. Allan has wide experience of the international industrial service sector through more than 20 years at four blue-chip companies. He also has specific knowledge of some of Ocean's business areas; for example, at BET he has been chairman of Biffa, the waste management company and has built a solid track record for achieving profitable growth across a range of businesses and markets. Ian Laurie, Ocean's finance director, acknowledged yesterday that although Ocean has successfully cut costs, its financial performance remained inadequate: 'We need to focus on growth,' he said. After graduating in mathematics from Edinburgh University in 1970, Allan began his career as a marketing trainee with Lever Brothers, becoming brand manager for Lux soap and subsequently Comfort fabric conditioner. He left Lever Brothers to join Bristol-Myers' consumer products division and in 1977 joined Fine Fare where he was promoted to marketing and buying director in 1983. In 1985 Allan joined BET and became one of three directors on the main board with specific responsibilities as sector director of business services (Europe) and as group marketing director. Allan is also a non-executive director of Connell, a member of the CBI market strategy group and a council member of the Institute of Directors. He is also a former chairman of the Marketing Society of Great Britain.</p>

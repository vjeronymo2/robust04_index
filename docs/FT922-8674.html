			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Oslo says it is too early to reprivatise banks NORWAY feels it is too early to reprivatise Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, two of the country's three biggest banks, taken over by the state last year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The finance ministry said that although it was the government's aim to put the banks back into the private sector, it was too early to fix a strategy for privatisation. 'Privatisation will take place when the value of the banks can be fixed with greater certainty than there is today,' the ministry said. Last week, the top three banks presented their results for the first three months of 1992 which showed reduced credit losses, slightly improved earnings and lower operating costs.</p>

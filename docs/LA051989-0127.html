			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> VALENZUELA IS DESERVING OF HAPPY ENDING TO HIS STORY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Dodgers like to live out those Hollywood endings:  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson limping around the bases after winning Game 1 of the 1988 World  Series with one swing in a life-imitates-art impersonation of Robert  Redford-Roy Hobbs.  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser kneeling in prayer on the mound after winning the final game of  that Series, surely a scene Jimmy Stewart played out for June Allyson and the  cameras somewhere, somehow.  </P> <P> If only the Dodgers could evoke a Capra-esque ending now. For if ever there was  a player in need of a happy ending, it's Fernando Valenzuela.  </P> <P> Not just because, as a premier pitcher, Valenzuela is struggling. Other  star-caliber starters, such as Jack Morris and Frank Viola, have struggled,  too. But Fernando, in the eyes of his peers, his public, is special.  </P> <P> He genuinely is the game's last great dream-weaver, having come along just in  time to put some magic back in the game when it needed it most. Fernando  injected strike-torn 1981 with youthful exuberance, a genuine innocence, not to  mention an assortment of pitches that translated into a slew of victories. A  19-year-old fresh out of Mexico, he spoke no English but did not have to; what  he had to offer transcended language barriers, team loyalties.  </P> <P> Now, less than 10 years later, it's not baseball, but Fernando who is tormented  by realities.  </P> <P> He is not old, but his arm may have aged beyond its 28 years. Some say that  1,948 innings, built on a steady diet of arm-killing screwballs, made it that  way. Some wonder if the arm is too far gone to ever bounce back.  </P> <P> When Valenzuela took the mound against the Mets Wednesday, he not only was  winless this season, but had not won since June 14.  </P> <P> After six starts, Valenzuela's record was 0-3, his ERA 4.91. His prospects  seemed as much in doubt as they did in July, when Fernando was disabled for the  first time ever, because of a sore left shoulder.  </P> <P> Lots of culprits, including too many screwballs and not enough caution, were  blamed. But, to his credit and undoubtedly to the Dodgers' relief, Fernando  never partook in the finger-pointing. Instead, he has channeled what could have  been negative energy into his comeback. Extensive rehabilitation to regain arm  strength still goes on. And a new motion to eliminate harmful pitching patterns  was incorporated.  </P> <P> The pain is gone now. But the old Fernando, he's still not back.  </P> <P> The fastball of respectable velocity has slipped drastically from its 87-89 mph  range. He is more often clocked at about 77. In one start, Valenzuela  reportedly did not throw faster than 75 mph. In his start prior to Wednesday's  game, he was KO'd by the Cardinals in the second inning, having allowed five  hits and five earned runs.  </P> <P> But what people forget, Los Angeles pitching coach Ron Perranoski said, is that  Valenzuela shut out the Cardinals for seven innings in his previous start.  </P> <P> "You will see improvement, but there will be peaks and valleys," Perranoski  said. "You have to remember, he didn't throw a ball in competition from July  through August. He spent all winter in physical therapy. He's had to build  something up that was damaged.  </P> <P> "But there's no pain. That's an important, great sign. It's just a matter of  getting his strength back. And you get stronger by throwing the baseball.  </P> <P> "And all we ask of him is that he keep us in the ballgames."  </P> <P> Conversely, Valenzuela could make some demands of his own, and be justified in  doing so. Little demands, such as some runs, some laughers. In his six starts  prior to Wednesday, the Dodgers scored a total of 11 runs on his behalf. Seven  runs were in one game -- the only game he started that the Dodgers won. Twice  the Dodgers were shut out and twice more they were limited to one run.  </P> <P> That pattern is probably the only thing that is at all familiar to the  struggling pitcher, who had the best ERA (3.16) of all active pitchers in the  1980s coming into this season. Yet he had managed to win only 118 of his 256  career starts through last season.  </P> <P> Wednesday, it was more of the same. When the Dodgers scored a run against the  Mets' Ron Darling in the third inning, it was their first in three Valenzuela  starts. When they scored a third run, it was the second-highest total put  together for him this season. But when Valenzuela departed after six innings,  he had to settle for a moral victory. He'd allowed the Mets only five hits and  six walks, but three earned runs. Yet the Dodgers gave him only three runs in  support. So that winless streak slipped up another notch to 16 consecutive  starts.  </P> <P> After Wednesday night's performance, he sounded encouraged.  </P> <P> "I walked three or four on close pitches. But no matter how many walks, I threw  the ball pretty good. I was surprised it (his control) was all right,"  Valenzuela said, referring to not having pitched since May 4 because of  rainouts. "Twelve days, it's really a little too long, especially because I  need to throw more."  </P> <P> Valenzuela, a proud man who never demanded much, has not sought sympathy, at  any point. All he wants is time.  </P> <P> "The arm doesn't come back fast, so people start to worry," he told reporters  Monday. "For me, it's just 'keep working.' I know my arm doesn't feel pain.  You'll see in a couple months."  </P> <P> Does he have a couple of months? All you have to do is listen to the Dodgers,  watch them circle the wagons, mount their vehement defense to see that he does  have time.  </P> <P> "No doubt we're all pulling for him," Perranoski said, "because everybody  respects Fernando as a young man, as a pitcher and for the way he's handled his  success."  </P> <P> The Dodgers are not alone.  </P> <P> The Mets' Sid Fernandez, a former teammate, watches and hopes on behalf of a  pitcher who gave the game a lot of hope not so long ago.  </P> <P> "When you dominate for so many years, people expect a lot," Fernandez said.  "They want him to be a Superman. He is ... but he can't win 24 games every  year."  </P></p>

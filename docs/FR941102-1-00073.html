			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NAJ witness continued by explaining that the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the value of whey protein in the protein price so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the protein in the milk would be accounted for. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained by the proponent witness, the .735 factor was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by dividing 25 percent, which is the protein left in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whey after making cheese, by 34 percent, which is the percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein in whey protein concentrate. The resulting value, .735,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is multiplied by the monthly average 34 percent whey protein concentrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price to yield the whey contribution to the protein price. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> witness stated that the whey protein concentrate price was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected because it is a better indicator of the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein contained in whey than is dry whey or animal feed whey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An economist supporting the NAJ proposal testified that even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though the butterfat price is determined at its marginal value,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is, the value of butterfat in butter, the protein price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be determined by the value of protein in the most common  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of protein in the five markets included in this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness pointed out that the most common use of protein is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacture of cheese, with 85.9 percent of the milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketed in 1992 in Wisconsin being used in the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese. The witness testified that the appropriate cheese price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be used in computing the protein price was the block price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it is a ``conservative estimate of the price actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received for block cheddar cheese''. The witness went on to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explain that the reported block price is closer to what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing plants receive for barrel cheese than is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported barrel price because when the customary premiums are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to the reported barrel cheese price the result is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately equal to the block price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The academic NAJ witness reiterated the NAJ position that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of whey protein should be included in the protein price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the total value of the protein in producer milk would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thus be reflected in the protein price, giving producers an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive to produce more protein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained that the CMPC proposal would use the monthly average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Green Bay Cheese Exchange barrel price (barrel price) instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the block price, and would not include the value of whey protein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness for CMPC testified that the barrel price better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents the value of cheese than the block price because there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a greater volume of trading in barrel cheese than in block  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cheese. The resulting protein price would be lower than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein price computed under the NAJ proposal. A witness for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMPC explained that their proposed protein price was based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding that Federal order prices are minimum prices, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the CMPC proposal, using the barrel cheese price and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including a value for whey protein, would result in a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price for protein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

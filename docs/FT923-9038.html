			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Management: Treading warily over the snails - A business lunch in the French capital is a serious affair. William Dawkins has a word of advice on the etiquette of where you should go and what to say Lunch is an important part of doing business in Paris. But it has to be exploited with discretion. Correct business etiquette is crucial in France because social formalities are still more rigid there than in the Anglo-Saxon world, despite the liberalism which has swept French management in recent years. So rule one is not to insult your guest by trying to use the lunch bluntly to further a contract or achieve some other kind of direct business gain, warns Marie-Helene Descamps. As attachee de presse for former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, she is an unassailable authority on do's and don'ts of the lunch table. 'There are two kinds of business lunch. The first is to build up relations, without expecting anything in return, so that things are easier when you eventually do contract some business. The second is to discuss a deal already in the making or celebrate a deal afterwards. If you want to conclude a deal, that must be done in the office,' she explains. Never bore your guest by talking about business right at the start of the meal, she warns. This might be OK in London or New York, but it will only irritate most French businessmen. A private FT straw poll of public relations advisers and English executives in Paris produces the unanimous advice that a successful business luncher must be well stocked with non-business anecdotes and subjects of conversation, which must last him for at least the hors-d'oeuvres, main course and cheese. When preparing your opening gambits, bear in mind that Parisian business lunches cannot be hurried. Two to three hours is the average time. If you are really pressed, it is quite acceptable to refuse cheese, but you have to be sure of your host or guest if you want to turn down dessert. Recent political events are a surefire conversation starter, since most French people love politics. But avoid politics when lunching with senior executives in France's large state sector. They will probably follow the government line on everything - especially when in public - so it is better to talk about wine or food in their case. 'When the cheese is out of the way, then you can start to talk business. This is the good moment because the wine will have put everyone at their ease and the dessert is on the way. Do not wait until the coffee, because your guest might be in a hurry to leave by then,' says a corporate public relations adviser. The idea is encapsulated in the colloquial French expression for a judiciously chosen moment: 'entre la poire et le fromage'. This is a bit confusing because cheese actually comes before dessert in France, but still, the principle is clear. In addition, Descamps advises that it can be a good thing for a male host to be accompanied by an intelligent and presentable female public relations adviser. This is not an absolute rule, but it is common practice, as shown by the large number of young women in the Parisian PR industry. 'A woman can be useful because she can get away with putting things in a more direct manner than a man,' says Descamps. Where to eat, of course, depends on who you are entertaining. The key rule is that style matters more than money. If your guest is French, he will be agreeably flattered if you take him somewhere considered branche or 'in'. Try Fouquets (pronounced as in English) or Chez Edgard. These are both well-known watering holes for politicians and the better sort of media folk, which might suggest to your guest you are well-connected. A non-French executive foreigner will obviously recognise none of the famous French faces round these tables, so do not bother. He or she would feel more flattered at one of the big names of the Parisian restaurant business, like Lucas Carton, Taillevent or the Tour d'Argent. Many Parisian business folk think places like this are a touch ostentatious, though they would be too polite or too pleased with the sublime food they serve to say so. An alternative for foreign guests is one of those glittery places frequented by film stars and models, who they will admire even though they do not know their names, around the Avenue Montaigne. In this class, Plaza Athenee or the Bar des Theatres - open from 6am to 2am - are recommended. If you are already friendly with your French business contact, you might do well to take him slightly off the beaten track, a sign that you think he matters enough to justify a spot of personal effort. In the summer, you might try one of the very few good restaurants with quiet terraces or gardens, such as Recamier, Ledoyen or Laurent. Equally, you could produce a gem of a bistro that you might have discovered yourself, the sort of place noted in the back of many globe-trotting executives' diaries, ideally with a limited but superb menu and an authentic atmosphere. Descamps's personal favourite in this class is La Marlotte. Mine is Cafe La Jatte, where a life-size dinosaur skeleton hovers over hot house plants and an excitingly eclectic menu - but it is slightly out of town. Back in the city centre, branche Parisians like smart Italian food, stylishly available at Stresa. Details of most of these restaurants are in the Michelin guide to France, except for Bar des Theatres, Cafe La Jatte, and Chez Edgar which can be found in the Paris yellow pages. A word of warning: some are closed in August, when many Parisians take a month off and when business on and off the table grinds to a halt.</p>

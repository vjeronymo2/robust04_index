			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (8): Sales remain grounded - Aero engine makers are in a grim mood, Paul Betts finds EVEN by its own cut-throat standards, the aero-engine industry has been going through a particularly rough patch during the last year. The decline of military sales in the post Cold War defence market and the lingering recession in the civil side of the business have taken their toll on all the leading aero-engine manufacturers. Profits have slumped, restructuring has intensified in a drive to cut costs and increase competitiveness, while research and development spending on future engines has remained high. To win new engine orders in the current depressed market, the big three aero-engine makers (General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney in the US and Rolls-Royce in the UK) have been forced to make hefty concessions and offer enlightened terms to attract customers. 'We must stop killing ourselves with our crazy pricing structure,' remarked Mr Brian Rowe, the head of GE's aero-engine operations during a visit to the big US company's plant in Cincinnati. 'We are not only having to give away new engines but we are now having to make deals with airlines on spare parts. That's how tough it is,' he added. Sales of spare parts have traditionally been a large source of profit for engine manufacturers. But the slump in air travel caused by the Gulf crisis last year and the subsequent recession in many western markets has had an inevitable impact on the spares business. There are now signs that air traffic is recovering, but airlines are still financially squeezed and a significant pick-up in the aircraft and engine ordering cycle is not expected by the industry until later next year or perhaps not before 1994. During the past 12 months even small orders have provoked big battles. Some have ended in court. When Malev, the Hungarian airline, cancelled a Pratt &amp; Whitney engine order for GE engines to power two Boeing aircraft, Pratt took legal action. An even bigger row erupted when British Airways decided to buy GE rather than Rolls-Royce engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 777 widebody jets. The combined pressures of the market and the frustration of the European Airbus consortium over its repeated failure to win an order from BA prompted Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman, to attack the BA deal with Boeing and GE. Airbus asked the European Commission to investigate the deal but ultimately decided not to file a formal complaint. BA, Boeing and GE all rejected allegations of foul play. The BA deal eloquently reflected the current battle in the aero-engine market focused on the new large commercial engines being developed by all three manufacturers in partnerships with other second tier engine makers. These partnerships are designed to help reduce the financial risks of developing these new engines. GE is spending about Dollars 1.5bn to develop its new GE90 heavy thrust engine which was chosen by BA for its Boeing 777 fleet. Rolls-Royce is investing around Pounds 400m to develop a large thrust version of its RB211 engine family called the Trent. And Pratt &amp; Whitney is also investing heavily in the development of the PW4000. Widebody aircraft are forecast to absorb an increasingly large share of the commercial jet market during the next 20 years. Airbus expects the average aircraft size to grow from around 174 seats today to 241 seats by 2012. The battle for this important new market has so far been even. Pratt took an early lead by winning the first big Boeing 777 engine orders from United Airlines and All Nippon Airways. GE struck back by winning the BA order and Rolls-Royce subsequently retaliated by clinching Boeing 777 orders from Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, and Cathay Pacific, the Hong-Kong carrier. The problem for engine manufacturers is that the development costs of new commercial engine programmes take much longer to recoup than those of an airframe. In the case of an airframe, payback can come in around seven years; for an engine, the figure is between 10 to 15 years. For this reason, the industry believes that the leading engine manufacturers will be forced into forging even broader collaborations than their existing risk-sharing partnerships on specific engine programmes. GE has already established a long and fruitful alliance with Snecma, the French state-controlled aero-engine group. Pratt, more recently, has linked up with Motoren-und-Turbinen Union (MTU), the aero-engine arm of Deutsche Aerospace. Rolls-Royce has also formed a joint engine venture with BMW of Germany. However, some industry experts believe it will be eventually necessary for the big three engine makers to consider some form of wide-ranging alliance because they argue that three large manufacturers are too many for the market to sustain. Rolls-Royce, which broke off a partnership with GEin 1986, disagrees and has made it clear it is not seeking strategic alliances with either GE or Pratt, its two principal and larger US competitors. Instead, the UK group appears determined to 'go it alone' and to continue to broaden its market base to secure a 30 per cent share of the commercial jet engine market by the middle of the decade. To this end, the UK company has shown an interest in possibly investing in a large minority stake in the US Allison engine company. This would resurrect Rolls-Royce's presence in the large turboprop, small and medium turboshaft and small jet sectors in which the UK company was once active. But if Rolls-Royce is ruling out any wide-ranging association with one of its main US competitors in the aero-engine business, it has decided to forge a 15-year partnership in the industrial power generation sector with Westinghouse of the US. The agreement reached with Westinghouse in June is consistent with the UK company's efforts to broaden its overall industrial base to compete more strongly with its two rival US aero-engine manufacturers, both of which are part of much larger diversified industrial groups. The first important move by Rolls-Royce to increase its power generation activities was the acquisition three years ago of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI), the UK power equipment supplier. This diversification strategy helped Rolls-Royce, far more dependent on aero-engines than GE or Pratt, to ride through the current cyclical slump in the commercial aero-engine market and the decline in military aero-engine activity. Industrial power accounted for 42 per cent of the UK company's Pounds 3.5bn sales last year and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 73m compared with a Pounds 6m loss by the aerospace division. But to make headway in the world market and increase the share of its industrial power operations to 50 per cent of group turnover, Rolls-Royce decided it needed to negotiate a partnership with Westinghouse, the traditional rival of GE in the industrial power generation business. The decline in the military aerospace business has now put additional pressure on aero-engine manufacturers to concentrate increasingly on commercial jet engine and industrial power operations. Although the civil market is still struggling because of the recession and the financial problems of airlines, the industry remains confident it will recover. It also expects new markets to emerge including the vast potential of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the former Soviet Union anxious to develop strong ties with western aerospace partners, and the replacement of older aircraft with new more environmentally friendly jets. The challenge for aero-engine manufacturers is to pull through the current recession to cash in eventually on a commercial jet engine market with sales forecast to total about Dollars 200bn over the next 20 years.</p>

Last year, the province  conscientiously implemented the guideline laid down by the  central authorities on intensifying macroeconomic regulation and  control. All the projects under construction were sorted out  and rearranged in order of priority, and resources and funds  were pooled together to support selected key projects.    In 1993, all the fixed asset investment projects completed  by  enterprises in the province involved a total value of 25.3  billion yuan, an increase of 33.8 percent over the previous  year. Of this investment value, capital construction  investments shared 13.5 billion yuan, an increase of 36.6  percent; and technological transformation and equipment updating  projects shared 8 billion yuan, an increase of 36.6 percent. It  is expected that the investment value of completed local-run  investment projects will have reached 15.6 billion yuan by  year's end, accounting for 61.8 percent of the total investment  value.    As far as the power industry is concerned, the year 1993  witnessed the province's largest ever scale of projects under  construction and the highest ever amount of investment funds  involved. The value of completed investments in the power  industry totaled 1.56 billion yuan, total installed power  generating capacity increased by 505,000 kilowatt-hours, thus  raising the province's total installed power generating capacity  to 8,135,000 kilowatt- hours and ranking the province seventh in  the country.    The province also made great progress in expanding its  communication facilities. By the end of last year, the  province's total length of highways open to traffic amounted to  45,000 km, and the per-unit-area distribution of highways was  26.48 km per square km, ranking the province eighth among other  provinces in the country. The province's total length of local  railroads open to traffic was 1,710 km, ranking the province  first in the country. Smooth progress has been made in the  construction of the Zhengzhou- Kaifeng-Luoyang expressway  project, the leading one of the province's 10 key projects  designated by the provincial government as part of its plan to  expedite the process of reform and opening up. A section of  this highway--the northern part of the Kaifeng- Zhengzhou  section--has been completed and is about to be officially opened  to traffic. Meanwhile, 79.2 percent of the earthwork to build  the roadbed of the Zhengzhou-Xinzheng expressway has been  completed. The Huang He bridge at Sanmenxia which links Henan  and Shanxi provinces was already opened to traffic by the end of  last year.    The province also made breakthroughs in water conservancy  capital construction. With regard to the two major projects to  divert the water of the Huang He to Yuzhai in Xinshan and to  Dafeng, more than 20 million cubic meters of earth digging work  was completed last year as part of the main canal construction,  and 85 related sub- projects were completed. Now the basic  requirements have been fulfilled to enable the two projects to  be put into primary operation by the end of the 1990's. The  Huai He harnessing project has been progressing smoothly; by the  end of last year 20 related projects had been launched, and the  annual investment plans for all these projects were completed.    In 1993, the province made major progress in the development  of postal and telecommunication services. A total of 447,000  local telephone lines and 10,490 long-distance direct-dial  telephone lines were newly installed. Meanwhile, the  Beijing-Zhengzhou-Guangzhou optical fiber cable laying project  has been completed and put into operation, 2,000 km of local  second-class trunk-line optical fiber cable has been laid, and  266 km of microwave telecommunication line has been put into  use. Telephone service at and above the prefectural and city  level in this province is now operated on a program controlled  basis. Cities above the county level now enjoy automatically  connecting telephone service, and the central town of most  counties enjoys long-distance direct-dialing telephone service.  In addition, mobile phone and telephone paging services have  been developing very rapidly. And a high-tech modern postal and  telecommunication service network with a large capacity is in  the making in the province.</p>

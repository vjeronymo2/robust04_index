			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (4): Royal boundary to free speech - The stirrings of political life in the kingdom When a middle-ranking member of the House of Saud opens a conversation by suggesting that most of the Council of Ministers should be dismissed for having failed to come up with any new ideas for managing the nation's economy, it is clear that political life in the kingdom is rather less moribund than its detractors suggest. Saudi Arabia is not facing an economic crisis, he insists, but is suffering from over-centralised, incompetent ministries best noted for the opportunities they have missed. Such comments to visitors are still likely to be made only by those confident of their royal status, but they do reflect a widely held view among the younger and more entrepreneurial generation of Saudis that a fundamental revision of government policies is required. The suggestion that too many ministers have been too long at their posts for the good of the country is not a particularly new phenomenon, but it has gained wider acceptance as a result of the Gulf war and the consequent impact on the kingdom's exchequer. King Fahd may have responded to those concerns in August when he finally named the 60 members of a consultative council (majlis al-shura). The concept of such a council was first raised three decades ago, and given the monarchy's legendary caution in initiating reforms, it is likely to be some time before the role and importance of the council can be fairly assessed. Reactions to the limited powers vested in the council, and the composition of its members, have varied widely. Taken at face value, the consultative aspect of the council's role appears paramount. It cannot initiate discussions and will deal only with issues referred to it. Its recommendations need not be adopted and will be carried forward only if they coincide with those of the Council of Ministers. Mr Mohammed Ibrahim al-Jubair, the speaker of the council and a former minister of justice, will have considerable authority over the working of the council. Deliberations are to be kept secret, members cannot speak at full council sessions for more than 10 minutes without special dispensation, and no documents can be removed from the council building. For critics of the council, particularly those yearning for a more westernised, democratic reform of Saudi political life, the king's proposals smack more of a rubber stamp than of genuine reform. However, within the kingdom, that seems to be very much a minority view. Many Saudis appear genuinely impressed by the quality and educational attainments of the council members and are cautiously optimistic that their deliberations will add an important new layer of ideas and debate within the decision-making process. King Fahd, who is also prime minister, can choose to adopt the council's recommendations just as much as he may reject them. To that extent, the council could well become the main vehicle through which policy options are aired and trial balloons floated without any endorsement or commitment by the ruling family. Several western diplomats admit that they were surprised by the council's composition. They had presumed that the members would strongly reflect the tribal, regional and religious characteristics of Saudi society. Instead, the professions are powerfully represented with 32 of the 60 members having gained advanced degrees at western universities, two-thirds of them in the US. The conservative religious establishment is only modestly represented and no members of the royal family are included. Conversations with the new members of the council reveal how seriously they are approaching their task. The appointments are full-time, salaried and for an initial period of four years. By the middle of last month most of them had already gathered in Riyadh and initial work had begun on the formation of committees where the bulk of the council's work is expected to be done. Members acknowledge that they are entering uncharted territory and are unsure what their influence may be. However, several have indicated that they expect to be given substantial topics to research and debate, such as methods for improving government revenues, how to achieve an overall reduction in the budget deficit, together with defence, foreign and social issues. Some senior members of the business community hope that the council will evolve into a primary source for new legislation, allowing the council of ministers to concentrate more on its role as the executive arm of government. 'Ministers just do not have the time to think about legislation,' says one businessman. 'They should be left to continue their primary role which is executive, and rely on the majlis al-shura for the new ideas.' King Fahd has also taken modest steps to reform the council of ministers. A decree issued in August sets a four-year term for ministers but this can be extended, both for the council as a whole and for individual ministers. It also specifies that ministers should not hold other government jobs, although exceptions are provided for. Similarly, restrictions are placed on ministers following separate business careers. These actions, together with the creation of a second ministry devoted to Islamic affairs, could also be interpreted as a response to criticism by radical Moslems. But the latest group to seek public attention for its grievances, the so-called Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights, set up last year, has also been left in no doubt that the government will not tolerate overt criticism. Some members of the 60-strong group, drawn mostly from a conservative, academic background, have been detained, and others banned from leaving the kingdom. Such strong official reaction might appear to dampen any western hope that the ruling family is moving towards a marginally greater degree of popular participation in government. But for Saudis it is more likely to have reinforced the understanding that criticism of the king and his government should not stray outside the family domain. In theory, a commoner can say whatever he wishes to King Fahd, and will be listened to. But if he challenges that convention, then displeasure is likely to be demonstrated. It is a lesson which the consultative council will, initially at least, observe with care.</p>

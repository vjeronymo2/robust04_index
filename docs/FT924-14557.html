			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance merge Australian operations ROYAL Insurance, and Sun Alliance, two of the UK's biggest composite (general and life) insurers are to merge their non-life insurance operations in Australia. The merged company, which will be 60 per cent owned by Sun Alliance, will be the fourth largest general insurer in Australia, with premium income of more than ADollars 500m (Pounds 200m) and a market share of more than 6 per cent. Mr John Mallick, managing director of the new merged company, Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance Australia, said the merger would strengthen the competitive position of both parent companies. Sun Alliance, the larger of the two, was previously ranked number 11 among general insurers. 'I believe there is going to be a lot more rationalisation in the market because there is far too much capacity,' he said. 'The big companies are saying it is time they had better market share.' He added that the businesses were 'very compatible'. Sun Alliance is particularly strong in New South Wales, while Royal has a larger market share in Victoria. As part of the merger Royal will take out Pounds 50m from its Australian operation. The money will help strengthen operations elsewhere. The merger follows the acquisition of Australian Eagle by QBE Insurance, the purchase of 75 per cent of GRE by Zurich Australian, and the merger of the recently privatised New South Wales GIO with the Melbourne-based SIO, owned by the state government of Victoria. The merger will help reduce pressure on other large insurers, notably Mr Rodney Adler's FAI Insurances, which recently reported a net loss of ADollars 49m for the year to June. Mr Adler said the market remained 'very difficult' because of 'generally insufficient' premium rates. GIO, which reported net profits of ADollars 117m for the year, also said the outlook was 'difficult'. Sun Alliance said the merger would not affect the life businesses of the parent companies, which will continue to operate independently. About 1,000 staff will be transferred to the merged company and 200 are expected to be made redundant. Market, Page 44</p>

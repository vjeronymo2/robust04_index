			<p>BFN     [Text] Our country considers the change in the Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] flag to be a  practical sign of goodwill. Government Spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos also said that the government has received no official  statement and that its information is limited to press reports.  Venizelos repeated that the Greek Government wants a quick  solution to the issue, but that this is a hope, a goal; it does  not mean things are close to agreement. The only development in  the issue of Skopje, Venizelos said, is the Thursday [12 May]  meeting in New York between Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis,  Foreign Ministry director general, and UN mediator Cyrus Vance.  The Greek Government, Venizelos stressed, is not satisfied with  the proposal for a mutual guarantee of borders. The spokesman  concluded by saying that Skopje knows the conditions laid down  by the Greek Government. They are international legal  regulations that Skopje must respect.</p>

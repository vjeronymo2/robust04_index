			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> II. Rangeland Resource Teams <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Within each BLM District and administrative unit, local Rangeland Resource Teams could be formed for the purpose of enhancing public and community-based involvement in federal public lands decision-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rangeland Resource Teams are premised on the notion that rangeland decisions ought to be made with good stewardship, with appropriate multiple use and compliance with federal laws as guiding principles. They are also premised on the following principles:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Permittees are in the best position over time to exercise good stewardship, and to ensure full compliance with federal laws, and that this opportunity is further enhanced by direct dialogue and full participation of community-based environmental and wildlife/sportsmen interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Good stewardship and full compliance with federal law is enhanced and strengthened when community and public interests are empowered with permittees, members of the public and agency officials in making decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A substantial portion of the increase in grazing fee revenues from public lands should be retained and expended at the local level for the purpose of promoting the ecological health of the range and investing in good stewardship practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;There is value in empowering individuals no matter where they live to work in concert with federal and public interests in resolving local public lands/rangeland issues at the community level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that these community-based Rangeland Resource Teams will have a true ecosystem focus. With time and experience, this model could be organized around eco-regions rather than according to arbitrary land ownership and federal management boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This vision cannot be achieved in one step. The opportunity presented by this model is to encourage good stewardship by permittees and other users, and to improve rangeland use, rangeland ecosystems and management. The Colorado working group believes this model is an important step toward enhancing these goals_while laying the foundation for this broader vision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Jurisdictional Level <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In order to have credibility and to ensure that both community and public interests are represented, Rangeland Resource Teams should be allowed to spring up in as small an area as a single allotment but in no case to go beyond an area larger than that encompassed by the corresponding Multiple Resource Advisory Council for that area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Creation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> They could be established and dissolved in any of the following ways: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> 1. By local initiative and petition to a respective Multiple Resource Advisory Council. If a petition is denied, the locals could petition to be a FACA (Federal Advisory Committee Act) body (see below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. By the Multiple Resource Advisory Council when deemed necessary by that Council. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As a matter of formality, all appointments would be made by the Multiple Resource Advisory Council. The teams could be terminated by an affirmative act of the Council. Individual terms for team members would be established by the Council.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Membership <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Rangeland Resource Team membership would be limited to five members from the following interests: Two resident permittees who hold permits in the area, one resident at-large community representative, one environmental representative and one wildlife/recreation representative. The environmental representative and the wildlife/recreation representative could be nonresidents; however, all members shall be required to demonstrate substantial knowledge and experience of the land and community where they serve. Nominations will be accompanied by letters of recommendation from local interest groups which the nominee will be representing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These members would be required to participate in a ``rangeland ecosystem course of instruction'' (the working group agreed to an acceptable standardized curriculum and process_such as the Rangeland Ecosystem Awareness Program developed by a subgroup_with a full understanding of the associated costs and a number of the details yet to be worked out), and would also be required to demonstrate knowledge of the local rangeland ecosystem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

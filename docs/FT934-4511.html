			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Calling time for the smaller company Clocking in and clocking out can be expensive because the paper time cards have to be continually replaced. But electronic time recording systems have often only been available economically to larger companies. French manufacturer Bodet has eliminated time cards in its BT50 system which is intended for companies with as few as 20 employees. The BT50 uses personal badges, each containing a magnetic stripe. These are swiped through the machine like a credit card. The electronic data gathered by the machines can be sent directly to a personal computer. There the information can be used in conjunction with payroll software to calculate wages. Bodet: France, 41 71 72 00; UK, 0442 234141.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement that asylum applicants wishing to proceed in a language other than English provide an interpreter is currently enforced by the INS as an operations policy. Any other rule would impose an undue financial burden on the Government. Currently, asylum applicants may use a family member, friend, or volunteer from the community, or may hire a professional interpreter. The proposed rule was intended to adopt this policy into the regulations. The recommendation that a registered representative, as well as an attorney, be prohibited from serving as an interpreter will be adopted in the final rule; an advocate should not be called upon to serve two distinct roles in the course of a proceeding. However, the final rule does not prohibit an employee of the applicant's attorney or registered representative, such as a paralegal, from serving as the applicant's interpreter. Finally, while an applicant's failure without good cause to provide an interpreter may be considered as a failure without good cause to appear for the asylum interview itself, the asylum officer has discretion in applying this sanction. If the failure to provide an interpreter is justified by good cause, the INS will not consider the applicant to have waived his or her right to an interview or to have abandoned his or her asylum application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These provisions of the proposed rule are retained with appropriate amendments in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Failure to Appear (Section 208.10)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New Amendment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have made no amendment to 8 CFR 208.10. However, in the course of reviewing the comments regarding the interview of asylum applicants, it was concluded that this section should be clarified to modify the provision that an applicant who fails to appear for a scheduled interview may be deemed to have abandoned his or her application for asylum. The final rule will modify this section to provide that failure without good cause to appear for a scheduled interview may be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to an interview or, in the case of an alien crewman, stowaway, person excludable under section 235(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1225, or person in current lawful immigration status, may be deemed to constitute an abandonment of the application. The final rule also will amend 8 CFR 208.14(b) to provide that an applicant who is deemed to have waived the right to his or her asylum interview in accordance with this section may be referred to an immigration judge for adjudication in the course of exclusion or deportation proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Comments From the Department of State (Section 208.11)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As amended by the proposed rule, 8 CFR 208.11 would retain the practice of submitting asylum applications to the Department of State but would eliminate the mandatory period during which asylum officers and immigration judges must await the receipt of State Department comments in individual cases. The State Department could provide such comments, but the intent of the rule is to change the role of the State Department to one of providing detailed and current country conditions information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments supported this change. Several comments stated that applicants should have access to the country conditions information provided by the State Department and relied upon by INS, and that applicants should continue to receive copies of case-specific comments from the State Department. Some comments stated that the applicant should be given 30 days to respond to any such comments from the State Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 208.11(c) of the rule, applicants will receive copies of case-specific comments provided by the Department of State. Immigration judges will have discretion to grant an appropriate time period, if necessary, for rebuttal. A uniform and mandatory waiting period will not be beneficial because it would add unnecessary delay to the process. Copies of generic country conditions information relied upon by immigration judges also will become part of the record available to the applicant. The INS currently is considering means by which country conditions information used by asylum officers may be made more generally available and will continue to work with attorneys, advocacy groups, and other interested members of the public in accomplishing this goal. This provision of the proposed rule is adopted in the final rule with amendments to clarify the text and eliminate unnecessary words.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Elimination of Notice of Intent to Deny (Section 208.12(a))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule, section 208.12(a), would have eliminated the requirement that an asylum officer provide the applicant an opportunity to inspect, explain, or rebut the material relied upon to find that the applicant's claim has not been approved. This is commonly referred to as a Notice of Intent to Deny, or NOID.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many comments criticized this proposal, arguing that the NOID requirement protects the rights of applicants and promotes more accurate decisions by asylum officers. Comments characterized the NOID as useful to clear up misunderstandings or incorrect applications of the law before cases reach the immigration court. As discussed previously, some comments also felt that the proposed rule would violate the due process rights of applicants by denying them an opportunity to give a meaningful response to material other than the interview and the application relied upon by the asylum officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

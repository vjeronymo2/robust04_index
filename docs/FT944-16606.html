			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia seeks partner to develop copper mine - Outright privatisation of the giant Konkola deposit is ruled out The government of Zambia is likely to hive off the massive ore body of Konkola from the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines in an attempt to attract foreign loan or equity capital to develop the Dollars 600m project. President Frederick Chiluba acknowledged in an interview that private investment was urgently required to reverse the ailing fortunes of Zambia's copper industry, which remains the fulcrum of the economy. Since nationalisation, copper production has nosedived from a peak of 700,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s to below 400,000 tonnes. Output is forecast to halve again by the turn of the century unless the Konkola Deep deposit, with mineral resources of 381m tonnes containing 3.5 per cent copper, can be brought into operation before ZCCM's existing mines are exhausted. 'New projects, such as Konkola, should be able to attract private investment on their own,' President Chiluba said. To make the project more attractive to foreign investors, he said Konkola might be run as a subsidiary of ZCCM, free from the parent company's financial constraints. President Chiluba's plan, however, stops short of outright privatisation. Both he and ZCCM's management are searching for formulas that would keep Konkola under state control. 'Konkola is the jewel in our crown,' says Mr Edward Shamutete, ZCCM's chief executive. 'If we privatise Konkola the rest of ZCCM is a dead duck.' The government has already turned down an offer by Anglo American Corporation of South Africa to lead a consortium that would develop Konkola as an independent joint-venture - relegating ZCCM to a minority role. Anglo American is disappointed. As ZCCM's main minority shareholder, having retained a 27 per cent stake in the company following nationalisation, the South African mining house is as anxious as the government to get Konkola off to an early start. Mr Shamutete believes ZCCM could raise the Dollars 600m required to develop Konkola if the government were to lighten the company's Dollars 740m debt burden by absorbing Dollars 220m owed to the Paris Club of creditor nations. Earlier this year, the ZCCM board appointed Nikko Securities of Japan to put together a loan package for Konkola. But few believe Nikko will be successful. ZCCM's chief executive knows that he is in a race against time. In the meantime, his own investment budget is shrinking. Low copper prices drove ZCCM's operations into the red last year, with the company posting losses of Dollars 135m in the six months to March 1994. A short-term recovery plan, which includes slashing ZCCM's investment budget from Dollars 150m to Dollars 105m this year and making redundant 10,000 miners - one-fifth of the workforce - is behind schedule. Mr Shamutete admits that by September production of finished copper was still 7 per cent below target and that efforts to lower production costs had only met with partial success. His aim is to transform ZCCM into an efficient, low-cost producer ahead of privatisation, which remains the government's stated goal. When and how privatisation will take place is less certain. The cabinet last week rejected a report by German consultants that recommended the carve up of ZCCM into five units for privatisation. Not surprisingly, both Anglo American and ZCCM's management were also opposed to the options outlined by Kienbaum Development Services, the German consultants. Mr Anderson Mazoka, Anglo American's managing director in Lusaka, believes the company would be better managed as a single unit under one group of shareholders. 'The break up of ZCCM would lead to the rapid closure of the less profitable divisions,' he says. He believes the negotiations to sell off separate units would be long and costly and would open up opportunities for corruption. Few doubt that if ZCCM were to be privatised as a single unit Anglo American would become the controlling shareholder - an option which is also politically unacceptable to the government, as it would place the country's entire copper wealth, and the source of 90 per cent of Zambia's export earnings, in the hands of one multinational. President Chiluba says he plans to commission another study into ZCCM's options for privatisation. He admits that the sheer complexity of the exercise as well as the absence of a national consensus on the issue make it unlikely that ZCCM will be privatised during his present term of office, which ends in 1996.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Chicago begins test of anti-fraud device THE Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two largest futures markets, begin tests today on a hand-held electronic trading card, reports Barbara Durr in Chicago. The two exchanges have spent some Dollars 6m developing Audit, which promises to help resolve many of the regulatory issues of trading fraud. It will replace the time-honoured practice of scribbling on paper cards and create a tamper-proof trail for each trade. Traders are known to have mixed feelings about the electronic trading device partly because they fear they will not be able to work as quickly in fast moving markets. Although testing was due to begin last year, development delays forced a postponement. The first prototype, a touchscreen model from Spectrix, will be tried in the wheat pit of the CBOT and the D-Mark pit of the CME.</p>

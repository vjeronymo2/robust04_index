Three times he gave an assurance that the new  Cabinet of Ministers would "not retreat from the adopted  programs and will make no changes to the reform policy."    But did the premier actually have a clear and consistent  reform policy in the past that would justify his talking of  continuing that policy? No, radical economic reform was linked  above all with the name of Yegor Gaydar, who shouldered the full  burden of responsibility for implementing government policy but  who had of late essentially had no opportunity to seriously  influence that policy. The social fulmination about "shock  therapy" bypassed the premier and was aimed directly at Gaydar  as the father of reform and in whose shadow Oleg Soskovets, Oleg  Lobov, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and other industrial, financial,  and agrarian lobbyists -- who had been appointed by Chernomyrdin  to key posts -- flourished. Without concealing their  aspirations with market rhetoric, many of them (Lobov, for  instance) openly talked of the need to return to a centralized  economy and to revive planning and state regulation. But the  presence in the government of Yegor Gaydar and people in his  team allowed the premier, while distancing himself from the  radical reformers and their activity, to talk, as now, about the  existence of a firm and consistent policy of fundamentally  transforming the economy.    But if there are no deviations from this policy, as the  premier assures us, then what does he mean by fighting inflation  -- as he has announced -- "not with monetary means but with  other means"? What should we read into the intention to  distribute state subsidies "more effectively" and to repay all  the debts of the military-industrial complex, the agricultural  complex, and the budgetary sector? And will there really be no  "soft loans handed out right and left" if the premier is  nonetheless planning to issue them "selectively"?    Judging by the composition of the new government, which  reflects an evident and seemingly difficult compromise between  the premier and the president, the "period of market  romanticism," as Viktor Chernomyrdin put it, is indeed over.  Exactly what is meant by the market "realism" to which the  premier is clearly more inclined will become clear in the next  few months. But, one way or another, the head of the government  will now have to assume full responsibility for the fate of  reform. If this new stage in building the market economy ends  in hyperinflation and a Russia-wide political strike prompted by  it, then the prime minister will have to be held responsible.  Him above all.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Primary culturing for transmittal to a certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that this change would not prevent any RPCH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from providing tests that are not listed in &sect;485.635(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An RPCH is free to choose a higher level CLIA certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the certificate of waiver if it wishes to provide tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a higher complexity and to comply with all CLIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulations do not set out a clear and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent position on the applicability of the advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directives requirement. Under the regulations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;485.645(b)(1), swing-bed RPCHs are required to meet a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of skilled nursing facility (SNF) requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including &sect;483.10(b)(4). That regulation requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient be given the right to make an advance directive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (An advance directive is a written instruction, such as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> living will or a durable power of attorney for health care,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that deals with the provision of health care when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual is incapacitated. See Subpart I of 42 CFR Part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 489.) Thus, the regulations apply the advance directives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to RPCH inpatients receiving a SNF level of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in swing beds, but not to inpatients receiving RPCH care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe the RPCH benefit could be administered more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simply and equitably if both hospitals and RPCHs were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to comply with the same advance directives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. As explained in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 26, 1993 final rule on EACHs (58 FR 30635&hyph;30636), as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized by section 1861(e) of the Act, we have read the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> word ``hospital'' to include RPCHs where the context appears  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support such a reading. We believe the context of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1866(a)(1)(Q) of the Act would support this reading,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since many patients are likely to seek RPCH care as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to treatment in a hospital or SNF, and many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RPCHs will accept patients who are at risk of the kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incapacitating condition addressed by an advance directive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, we propose to revise the regulations at &sect;489.102 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide for more consistent application of the advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directive requirement, by specifying that it will apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RPCHs on the same basis as to hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe this approach is simpler to administer and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expands beneficiary rights. Moreover, since all prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RPCHs must be (or have been) hospitals and have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to meet the advance directive requirement, there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be any added burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Clarification of Payment to RRC/EACH Hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We wish to clarify a response in the EACH final rule of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30639&hyph;30640), regarding the effect on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rural referral center's (RRC) payment rate should it elect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to become an EACH. An RRC that elects to become an EACH is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to have dual classification; that is, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as an RRC/EACH. Since section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(5)(D)(iii)(III) of the Act specifies that an EACH is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be treated as an sole community hospital (SCH), in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining which of the three payment rates will yield the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest aggregate payment, we will use the ``other''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized amount in determining the Federal payment rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. (As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above, as of that date, the other urban and rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment rates will be the same.) For discharges occurring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before October 1, 1994, the Federal payment rate is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``other urban'' payment rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, an RRC that elects to become an EACH is paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on whichever of the following rates yields the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greatest aggregate payment for the cost reporting period:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The national Federal rate applicable to the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, other urban before October 1, 1994 and ``other'' on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or after that date);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The updated hospital-specific rate using FY 1982 cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per discharge; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The updated hospital-specific rate using the FY 1987  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost per discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Direct Graduate Medical Education Payment (&sect;413.86)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Definition of Initial Residency Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(h)(4) of the Act bases payment for direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduate medical education (GME) costs on the hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents multiplied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital-specific adjusted base year per resident amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of FTE residents is determined by applying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighting factor to each FTE resident. A resident in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial residency period is weighted as 1.0 FTE. Residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in approved training programs that are beyond their initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residency period are required by law to be counted as .50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTE. The initial residency period is defined at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.86(g)(1), as the minimum number of years of formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training necessary to satisfy the requirements for initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> board eligibility in the particular specialty plus 1 year,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to exceed 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13563(b) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 amended section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(h)(5)(F) of the Act by deleting ``plus one year'' from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statutory definition of initial residency period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective July 1, 1995. To conform the regulations to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute, we propose to revise &sect;413.86(g)(1) by specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, effective July 1, 1995, an initial residency period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as the minimum number of years required for board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

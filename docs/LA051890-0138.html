			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FOR SALE: The $17.6-million Irvine Theatre, due to open in October at UCI, is  up for sale -- seat by seat. . . . A $1,000 donation will get your name on one  of the upholstered chairs, says executive director Douglas C. Rankin. "We're  hoping to raise at least $500,000 this way." . . . For a gift of only $999,000  more, you can get your name on the entire auditorium -- museum directors still  don't have a million-dollar donor. Mark I. Pinsky and Jan Herman  </P></p>

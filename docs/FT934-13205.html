			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Salomon Brothers barely breaks even in quarter SALOMON Brothers, Wall Street's most volatile investment bank, was out of favour with investors again yesterday after reporting that it had barely broken even in the third quarter. This result followed a big trading loss in the US. The full scale of the loss was not disclosed, but it was large enough to wipe out trading profits made in Japan and Europe and lead to an overall pre-tax loss on proprietary (or own-account) trading of Dollars 173m. The loss dragged down post-tax profits of Salomon Inc, the parent company, to Dollars 20m, or one cent a share, during the period. In the previous three months, it had recorded the highest-ever earnings of a Wall Street firm, at Dollars 498m before one-off charges. The news pushed Salomon's shares down Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 , though they later recovered and were trading at Dollars 45 1/8 by midday in New York. Salomon said only that the trading loss was 'incurred by the US arbitrage unit in previously established long-term strategies'. The losses are not believed to have come from direct bets on European interest rates, which has been an active area for all investment banks in the past 18 months. However, the unit is thought to have anticipated a quicker alignment of European and American interest rates than has occurred. Salomon refused to comment on persistent market rumours that it also lost money in US mortgage-backed securities, which failed to match the rally in US Treasury bonds during the summer. The bank said the US trading loss arose from the need to revalue long-term trading positions at the end of each quarter, and does not reflect the true long-term results of the proprietary trading business. During the previous three months it reported total income (net of interest expenses) of Dollars 523m on own-account trading, after a Dollars 303m loss in the first quarter of the year and revenues of Dollars 645m in the last three months of 1992. Pre-tax income from what the bank terms 'client-related activities'  - commission income, investment banking fees and trading related to customers' securities transactions  - reached Dollars 192m, the second-highest level ever after the previous quarter.</p>

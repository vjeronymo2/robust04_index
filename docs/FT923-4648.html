			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Strains in financial system felt by small companies, not banks Sir, Quentin Davis demonstrates ('Worthy sacrifice', August 28) that he is completely out of touch with what is happening to small and medium sized businesses (SMEs in Euro jargon) in the current situation. He states that default and bankruptcy creates strains in the financial system reducing the capital of banks and their ability to lend. That is true, but it hits the SMEs much harder than it hits the banks and SMEs do not even get a mention from Quentin Davis. As the owner of a small business, I get a letter nearly every week from newly appointed receivers to another of my customers instead of a cheque. It is invariably the banks which have called in the receiver. The banks also have security and in my experience in nine out of 10 cases the banks get 100 per cent or close to 100 per cent paid back. It is the unsecured creditors like myself who go empty handed in nearly every case. So the banks may be losing some of their capital, but I can assure Quentin Davis that unsecured creditors (ie, suppliers) like myself lose at least 10 times as much. The fact that this large percentage is lost by a large number of SMEs is not newsworthy because of their small individual size, and so apparently escapes the notice of our political masters. My heart bleeds for the banks, for their monopoly practices, for their high fees - the latter deducted at source without even having to issue an invoice, let alone monthly statements and numerous phone calls before getting paid. The banks should be split up into SMEs so that they also escape being newsworthy. We would then have a level playing field and a lot more competition. Is that not what the Single European Market is meant to be about? Antony P Hummel, T/A Lumberjack, Unit 8, Kinglsey Business Park, Kingsley, nr Bordon, Hampshire GU35 9LY</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "INFORM" rubric: "All Quiet </F> at the MORG [Republic of Georgia Defense Ministry]"]    [Text] In its three years of independence the Georgian  Army has fallen short of 300,000 draftees. People in the  republic use any methods to evade service, and the most  widespread of them is bribery. Plus desertion, which is not  subject to any record-keeping at all. Even the Republic of  Georgia Defense Ministry headquarters is 15-20 percent  undermanned.    Nevertheless, Major General Guram Nikolayshvili, chief of  the  General Staff, yesterday delivered a statement abolishing the  drafting of reservists for service. According to him the 20,000  personnel at the Defense Ministry's disposal are quite  sufficient to solve any problems of this department and the  country as a whole.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> HOOTERS: PAINFUL EARNESTNESS AT ROXY  </P> <P> The Hooters' act is showing some stretch marks these days. The Philadelphia  quintet is nothing if not talented, hard-working and well-meaning, but some  wonder has gone out of the way these well-scrubbed rockers use "roots"  instruments to spice up their polished, Midwest bar-band spiel.  </P> <P> And their ever-increasing sense of Social Consciousness strains their tight,  light pop fabric at the seams.  </P> <P> Two sorts of painful earnestness were on display Monday at the Roxy. Reflecting  those early years spent on the club circuit were their dated moves. Reflecting  their subsequent maturation and concern were the topical references ("This one  goes out to Nelson Mandela"), the obligatory swipe at organized religion, and a  woeful closing sing-along of a Dylan standard ("Mr. Tambourine Man," with  confused-looking guest Stevie Nicks as the Tambourine Lady).  </P> <P> The mandolins and accordions and social awareness should make the music more  human, but more often remind us how sterile much of it is. The Hooters were  better off concocting such guilty pleasures as "And We Danced" and "Day by  Day," both of which provided rapturous highlights Monday.  </P> <P> Opening act Nuclear Valdez has a similar dubious achievement: They've written  as silly a Lenny Bruce tribute as Bob Dylan's. But that and a few other  youthful missteps aside, they're a pretty terrific rock 'n' roll band. Their  sizzling, aching single "Summer" -- the best pop song ever written about the  Cuban revolution? -- is a successful example of the sort of tune the Hooters  keep going for.  </P> <P> Both bands play tonight at the Bacchanal in San Diego, Friday at the Ventura  Theatre, and Saturday and Sunday at the Coach House.

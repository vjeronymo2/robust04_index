			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "HH": "Coalition In Dispute Over Finances"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The disputes in Bonn's coalition over  monetary and fiscal policy are getting worse. Following  Economics Minister Rexrodt's announcement that he plans to cut  taxes during the next parliamentary term, Finance Minister  Waigel said that a certain period of time had to pass before  taxes could be cut. He rejected making a comment on the  expected duration of the solidarity surcharge. He said it is  "dishonest" to promise its abolition for 1996, one year after  reintroducing it.    According to its monetary policy spokesman, Poss, the Social  Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag group considers the  Rexrodt statement to be a "clumsy election campaign promise."  He said Rexrodt is not even taken seriously within the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. The FDP Bundestag group's  economic policy spokesman, Graf Lambsdorff, had warned against a  new hole in the 1994 budget and demanded that Waigel presents a  supplementary budget. Waigel's spokesman referred to the  positive budget balance in 1993 and warned against the "nonsense  of such scaremongering as we have heard from the FDP every time  over the past few years."    Critics of the monetary policy were supplied with arguments  by the Finance Ministry's Scientific Advisory Board. In an  expert opinion it demands "a fundamental rethinking in monetary  policy." Taking housing, the hard coal policy, and compulsory  pension insurance as examples, it shows how "considerable gains  in efficiency" could be achieved by privatizing and  rationalizing.    It calls the hard coal subsidy "a particularly drastic  example of government control that completely neglects economic  efficiency and is enormously expensive in terms of taxes." It  recommends to replace the "existing maze of subsidies by a  uniform premium that is linked exclusively to production."</p>

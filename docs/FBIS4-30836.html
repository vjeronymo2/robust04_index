			<p>BFN     [Text] After the session of the Constituent Assembly of  the Federation, the Assembly of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina began work this afternoon. The agenda  included several points, which were discussed by the deputies.  The first point on the agenda was the determination of the  guidelines for the continuation of negotiations and the  nomination of the delegation for the negotiations in Geneva and  France. Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke about that. After that the deputies  held a discussion behind closed doors at which they adopted the  guidelines for the continuation of the negotiations. They  endorsed the stands presented by Alija Izetbegovic, president of  the Presidency, when he address the deputies.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Esteemed deputies, dear  guests, we face two sets of negotiations. The first set of  negotiations refers to the establishment of a general cease-fire  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and are scheduled to take place the day  after tomorrow, on Thursday [2 June]. These negotiations were  called by Mr. Akashi.    The other negotiations are the continuation of the  negotiations held in Talloires on the constitutional  organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the further refining of the  constitution, that is, the negotiations with Serbian side. In  other words, they are determining the external borders of the  federation. Therefore, there are these two meetings that are  different in content, but are mutually closely connected.    Regarding the meeting that should be held the day after  tomorrow -- as you can see, I have put this in conditional form  of should be held, because we have made our participation in  these talks conditional on the withdrawal of Karadzic's Serbs  from the exclusion zone in Gorazde. [sentence as heard] We have  been repeating this demand since we received the invitation.  This has already lasted six or seven days. They have not  withdrawn to this date. [words indistinct] We will wait. If  they withdraw in the (?meantime), we will go to these  negotiations and discuss a cease-fire throughout  Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the end of hostilities, as they say. So,  the condition is the withdrawal. This is the condition for our  participation in these negotiations. If this condition is not  met I propose that we do not go to these negotiations. If the  withdrawal does take place, we will go. We should then present  the following stands:    First of all, we are talking about a temporary cease-fire.  Akashi has proposed that this cease-fire last four months. We  think, I think that this period is too long and that our  delegation should demand not a cease-fire of four months but of  four weeks. Why? Because, whether this was Mr. Akashi's  intention or not, but Karadzic's Serbs energetically support  this proposal, this cease-fire could obviously turn into the  freezing of the lines. The agenda envisages, first, the  separation of forces, second, the arrival and interpositioning  of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] between the warring sides, as  is written there. All this indicates a danger and smells a bit  of the freezing of the lines. In the situation when some 70  percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina is occupied, we, of course, cannot  accept the freezing of the lines. We have very bad experience,  the world has very bad experience with the situation in Cyprus  where the temporary cease-fire has lasted 30 years. The line  there has virtually become the state line.    Of course, it would be in the interest of Karadzic's Serbs  to  maintain and (?prolong) even more the state of occupation.  Therefore, if these negotiations take place, our delegation  should primarily demand the shortening of the cease-fire period.  Another thing, we should carefully think what to do with the  interpositioning of UNPROFOR.    I think that we should start with about a four-week  cease-fire. We could accept a six to eight week cease-fire at  the maximum. After four months we would face, we would be on the  verge of the winter period and, of course, fighting for the  liberation of the occupied parts would be very difficult in such  conditions.    Regarding the other negotiations, the negotiations in  Talloires, the negotiation on refining the constitutional  organization, the reorganization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  agreement with the Serbian side, or, if you want, the  determination of the external borders of the federation, I think  that there are many ideas, and the discussion will probably  produce even more ideas, but I would like to stress that our  delegation should have two starting points, two bases that it  needs to defend in these negotiations. The first is the  preservation of the integrity of the state in every possible  way, the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state within  internationally recognized borders. The second is what we could  describe as everyone being his own master. This means that the  map of the federation as envisaged in Vienna should be defended.  In doing so, the additional provision could, of course, be as  follows: Give the freedom to the delegation, proceeding from  that map, to reach a certain agreement with the Serbian side.  The delegation should be given the opportunity to be flexible  in the talks. It should be given the opportunity, space to  negotiate. There are various ideas here, such as the one on the  gray zones, on [word indistinct] zone in the areas on which the  agreement could (?not) be reached. The gray zones would have a  special regime in them. They would be demilitarized and under  UNPROFOR control. They would thus facilitate the realization of  one of our important interests, if not the most important  interest, namely that our army be deployed in these regions, or  at least that the population return there.    As regards the delegation, I think that the composition of  the delegation in both cases should be the same. I propose that  the delegation consist of six members. Here is my proposal:    These should be Ganic, Zubak, Silajdzic, (?Bicakci),  Akmadzic, and Lazovic. The delegation would be the same but, in  the talks on the cease-fire, the delegation would be led by  Professor Ganic, together with Mr. Zubak. The delegation in  Talloires, in the negotiations with the Serbian side, the  delegation would be led by Dr. Silajdzic together with Dr.  Zubak. The delegation at the talks on cease-fire would also  include two generals, Mr. Delic and Mr. Roso. This is my  proposal. [end recording]    This is all on today's session of the Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The session will continue tomorrow at 1000.</p>

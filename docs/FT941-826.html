			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / ANC action aims to secure poll freedom in S Africa province The African National Congress said yesterday that it would escalate mass protest action aimed at ensuring free political activity in the strife-torn Natal province, where ANC and Inkatha Freedom party members clashed again at the weekend over preparations for next month's all-race elections. South African government officials said Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, held a five-hour meeting with President FW de Klerk on Saturday, at which he gave assurances that free campaigning would be allowed in the KwaZulu homeland which he heads, and that elections could take place there despite Inkatha's poll boycott. However, Inkatha supporters appeared to have ignored these assurances yesterday, when armed Zulus occupied a stadium in northern Natal where the ANC was to have held an election rally. This was the third time in succession that Inkatha had prevented a weekend election rally in Natal, where more than 100 people have died in the past week. Officials said they hoped that Chief Buthelezi's assurances to Mr de Klerk would defuse the immediate crisis over Natal, and help persuade the ANC to defer its demands that some of the chief's powers be suspended and a state of emergency declared. However, this seems unlikely. The ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, the multiparty body overseeing government in the run-up to elections, is due to meet again today to discuss the crisis in Natal province. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, yesterday said South African troops should move into the region to help halt the violence. 'We are going to insist that security forces must protect the lives of our people in Natal. They must also ensure that there is free political activity. 'The ANC on its part has embarked on a programme of rolling mass action to ensure that we win our demand for free political activity,' Mr Ramaphosa told a Cape Town news briefing. 'That is going to escalate for as long as Buthelezi and his government do not finally agree that they will give space to political parties to operate freely, and unless he agrees the KwaZulu government will co-operate with the IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) in as far as the holding of free and fair elections is concerned,' said Mr Ramaphosa. Chief Buthelezi said at the weekend that a troop deployment 'could be seen as an invasion'. More than 10,000 people have died in violence in Natal over the past decade.</p>

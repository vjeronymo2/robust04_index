			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: No fall in repossessions - Mortgage arrears persist . . . THE Government will have found little cheer this week in the findings of a report which concluded that measures to prevent an increase in the rate of repossessions are failing. The study from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research foundation, says the government hoped to reduce the number of repossessions in 1992 by 40,000 through the launch of its mortgage rescue scheme last December. However, the report concluded that the figure will be in the region of only 10,000. The rescue package agreed with the Council of Mortgage Lenders included a decision by the government to pay the mortgage interest element of income support directly to lenders. This was introduced on May 25. But the report, which was based on a survey of Nationwide building society borrowers, found that over 80 per cent of claimants pass this on in full to their lenders. Direct payments to lenders would prevent only 10,500 repossessions. Mortgage-to-rent schemes, where those in arrears could remain in their homes as tenants, have been even less successful according to the report. 'The scheme is administratively complex and people want to remain as homeowners,' said the Building Societies Association. Around 40 per cent of those with arrears live in the south east where average mortgage payments owed are Pounds 500 a month. This falls to Pounds 369 a month across the country. Almost a fifth of borrowers owed more than Pounds 4,000 in arrears - half of these are in the south east. Lenders have realised that increases in the number of repossessions are exacerbating the problems in the housing market by adding to the number of properties that cannot be sold. There were more than 75,500 repossessions in 1991. 'The most effective way to prevent repossessions has been for lenders to accept lower repayments but it is not a permanent solution,' said the Building Societies Association. Lenders have been encouraging those facing repayment difficulties to get in touch with them sooner rather than later. 'We are being flexible on repayments from those borrowers who are in serious arrears,' said Mike McQueen, home rescue co-ordinator at Nationwide. 'In some cases we are even prepared to accept 25 per cent of normal monthly interest payments for up to two years.' Mortgage lenders are critical of the paucity of help extended to them by the government in trying to solve the problem of a sluggish housing market which has affected all income brackets. They have been particularly disappointed that the government will not be extending the temporary suspension of stamp duty on house purchases below Pounds 250,000 beyond August 19. 'On the one hand the government is reimposing stamp duty which will make home-buying more expensive, and on the other its use of National Savings to fund the PSBR will restrict our ability to cut mortgage rates,' said David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, one of the ten largest societies. The Rowntree report recommends a mortgage benefit scheme providing help with housing costs to people on low incomes, regardless of whether they are unemployed as the most effective measure towards preventing an increase in repossessions. 'The economic conditions are in place for arrears and possessions to persist at high levels,' said Steve Wilcox, co-author of the report. 'This evidence of unprecedented difficulty and failure must, in turn, be expected to act as a drag on the recovery of the housing market.' The Building Societies Association said it had expected an improvement in conditions by now and was disappointed that the number of repossessions in the first half of the year is likely to be 32,500. 'Because of a big increase in arrears, it is possible that possessions would start rising again if there is no improvement in the economy. Lenders are doing all they can to stop that happening,' it said.</p>

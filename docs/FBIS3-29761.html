			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [`Summary' of interview with Nobuo Matsunaga, former </F> Japanese ambassador to the United States, by ASAHI SHIMBUN;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Matsunaga] It is regrettable that Japan and the  United States failed to reach an agreement in the framework  trade talks. Japan could not concede to Washington because what  they asserted in the talks was unreasonable.    Japan is also to blame for its inappropriate response to  U.S.  demands. Japan flatly rejected U.S. demands for setting  "objective criteria," saying: "They will lead to managed  trade." Although the rejection was reasonable, Japan had no  counterproposals. Washington was very dissatisfied and said:  "What can Japan propose instead?" Japan should have a sense of  remorse over its actions.    The relationship between Japan and the United States in the  postwar era has been like that of a child and an adult.  However, now that Japan has become a powerful state, it is no  longer allowed to yield and act under pressure. In other words,  I think Japan is now in the process of freeing itself from  "gaiatsu [external pressure]" by the United States. The recent  summit meeting was a reflection of this process. Japan will not  be free from gaiatsu unless it makes decisions and implements  them on its own. I told foreign and finance ministers that the  future of Japan-U.S. relations depends on how Japan deals with  the United States.    What Japan should do now is to achieve economic growth  through the expansion of domestic demand. Also, it should  promote deregulation in priority areas in the framework trade  talks.    There are undesirable trends both in Japan and the United  States. In Japan, people tend to praise the "Japan that can say  no." This is very dangerous. On the other hand, some Americans  are in favor of "Japan bashing" measures. Japan should watch  this trend carefully.    There are arguments in the United States that Washington  should take punitive actions against Japan and that it should  incite the yen to rise. These arguments are wrong and too  emotional. It is necessary for both the United States and Japan  to refrain from becoming emotional.    If Washington imposes sanctions on Japan, Tokyo should react  calmly. Since it is obvious that such sanctions run counter to  GATT rules, Japan should file a complaint with GATT. Concerning  the appreciation of the yen, I think Japan will be able to avert  a further hike if it makes efforts to open Japanese markets  wider and increase imports.    The Japanese system, practices, and rules are slightly  different from those in the United States. However, the two  nations have the common goal of achieving reforms in accordance  with principles of the market economy. I do not think the  conflict of opinion between the two nations will intensify and  become serious.    In the recent summit meeting, the two leaders confirmed that  Japan-U.S. relations are more important than anything else in  such fields as politics and security. I want to stress that  this is a great result. They also noted that despite severe  economic relations and many twists and turns, the two nations  should continue to cherish their entire relationship.    First of all, Japan should decide what it should do and  implement what it has decided. After having done so, it should  consider how to deal with the next Japan-U.S. summit meeting.</p>

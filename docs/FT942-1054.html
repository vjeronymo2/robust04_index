			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares Yields on permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) have risen since we last published the table a month ago, writes Bethan Hutton. Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital. They pay a fixed income indefinitely but are not redeemable, so investors can get back their money only by selling them on the open market. Rising Pibs yields are, generally, linked to the gilts market but variations in the price differentials between different Pibs are due more to building society factors. The market is still reacting to the proposed take-over of the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society by Lloyds bank. Elaine Milner, a director at Hoare Govett, says the main impetus behind market movements recently has been speculation over which building society could be the next target for take-over. But, she adds, investors' principal motivation is not the cash incentives sometimes offered during a take-over, such as the Pounds 500 promised initially to those at C&amp;G holding Pibs in the Lloyds take-over. Instead, investors are prompted by the better credit ratings of Pibs issued by larger institutions. If a small society is taken over by a large one, it becomes more credit-worthy and the price of its Pibs will increase. This has increased demand for the Pibs issued by the smallest societies such as the Skipton, Newcastle, Cheshire and Leeds Permanent.  -------------------------------------------------------- Stock                       Coupon   Minimum   Issue date                          (gross %)  (Pounds)  -------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires          9.38     1,000     16/12/93 Bradford &amp; Bingley           13.00    10,000      30/9/91 Bradford &amp; Bingley           11.63    10,000      29/6/92 Bristol &amp; West               13.38     1,000     11/12/91 Bristol &amp; West               13.38     1,000     31/10/91 Britannia (1st)              13.00     1,000      13/1/92 Britannia (2nd)              13.00     1,000      8/10/92 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs          11.75    50,000     21/10/92 Coventry**                   12.13     1,000      28/5/92 First National               11.75    10,000       4/5/93 Halifax                      12.00    50,000      23/1/92 Halifax                       8.75    50,000       7/9/93 Leeds Permanent              13.63    50,000       3/6/91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck              13.38     1,000      31/3/92 Newcastle                    12.63     1,000       8/9/92 Newcastle                    10.75     1,000      15/6/93 North of England             12.63     1,000      23/6/92 Skipton                      12.88     1,000      27/2/92  -------------------------------------------------------- Stock                  Issue price    Price*       Yield*                            (pence)   (pence)    (gross %)  -------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires        100.17     87.75       10.674 Bradford &amp; Bingley          100.20    114.24       10.175 Bradford &amp; Bingley          100.13    125.75       10.338 Bristol &amp; West              101.79    125.00       10.700 Bristol &amp; West              100.34    125.00       10.700 Britannia (1st)             100.42    123.50       10.526 Britannia (2nd)             107.13    123.50       10.526 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs         100.96    114.75       10.240 Coventry**                  100.75    114.75       10.547 First National              100.25    101.00       11.634 Halifax                     100.28     88.25        9.915 Halifax                     100.62    118.75       10.105 Leeds Permanent             100.00    131.00       10.401 Leeds &amp; Holbeck             100.23    124.50       10.743 Newcastle                   100.45    100.125      10.737 Newcastle                   100.32    116.00       10.884 North of England            100.14    118.50       10.654 Skipton                     100.48    110.00       10.819  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett.  -------------------------------------------------------- *Purchase price as at 23 June; excludes accrued interest; **includes stamp duty payable on Coventry Pibs only  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

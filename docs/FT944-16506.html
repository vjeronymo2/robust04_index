			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Report fuels homes-for-votes row Pressure on Westminster City Council will intensify today with allegations in a BBC television documentary that councillors were misled over the contents of the consultants' report used to justify the council's controversial housing policy. Public hearings start next week into the district auditor's provisional report that Westminster sold council houses between 1987 and 1989 in a deliberate attempt to bolster the Conservative vote in eight marginal electoral wards. In January, Mr John Magill, the district auditor, described this as 'gerrymandering', and ruled provisionally that five councillors - including Dame Shirley Porter, Westminster's former leader - and four officers should be surcharged Pounds 21.25m to repay the money wasted on the policy. However, the BBC documentary, First Sight, claims that the policy was part of a 'long-term objective' to 'socially engineer the city's population'. It produces a council document from September 1986 which says: 'The sale of council properties offers little opportunity to socially engineer the population of Westminster. This should remain a long-term objective.' A Conservative councillor, Mr Anthony Prendergast, told the programme that councillors were misled over the findings of a report which found that Westminster was losing population. He said: 'I think they decided to re-interpret some of the conclusions to suit their own means . . . trying to obtain a population which is more likely to vote Conservative than Labour.' Yesterday, Mr Peter Bradley, a Labour councillor and one of the objectors to the policy who first called for the district auditor's investigation, said: 'I just think it's a sad reflection on the state of the Conservative party that it's taken him this long to speak his mind.'</p>

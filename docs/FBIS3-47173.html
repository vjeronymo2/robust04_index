			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Trade negotiators from  Japan and the United States wound up two days of framework trade  talks Friday [7 January] on the Japanese Government's purchase  of medical equipment, but reported little progress.    Japanese officials who participated in the negotiations said  the two sides spent an "endless" length of time exchanging ideas  on drawing up a mutually acceptable draft, but said no agreement  is in sight.    A major sticking point that has bogged down a series of  working-level negotiations that began last September is a U.S.  demand for numerical benchmarks to measure import penetration in  Japanese markets.    "There was no progress in this area," a Japanese official  said.    Medical equipment procurement is one of four priority market  sectors under the Japan-U.S. framework trade accord concluded  last July.    The two governments have promised to come up with an  agreement by the time Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  meets with President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11.    Japanese officials said the two sides plan to meet again to  discuss medical equipment procurement, but no date has been set.    Trade negotiators from the two countries are scheduled to  hold talks in Japan next week on the insurance and automobile  markets.    Neither Japanese nor U.S. officials appear optimistic of an  early breakthrough.    "There was no movement at all on the quantitative and  qualitative indicators," a senior U.S. trade official said  Friday of the telecommunications framework negotiations.    U.S. officials say Washington wants to introduce a multiple  set of yardsticks to peg import penetration in Japan to the  other industrial countries.    Japanese officials have rejected the U.S. proposal, saying  Japan cannot accept any criteria that "smack of market share."    The framework talks were only one set of trade negotiations  that took place in Washington between Japan and the U.S. on  Friday.    While Japanese and U.S. negotiators huddled at the Commerce  Department over medical technology, another group of officials  met at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to review the  purchase of foreign telecommunications equipment by Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT].    A senior U.S. trade official who spoke to Japanese reporters  following the NTT session said while Washington is pleased with  the progress in the amount of foreign equipment purchased by NTT  in recent years, the U.S. feels the foreign share "should be  significantly higher."    According to Japanese figures, the amount of telecom  equipment purchased by NTT from foreign suppliers increased to  100 billion yen in fiscal 1992 from 80 billion yen in fiscal  1991.    Japanese officials said the foreign suppliers accounted for  14 percent of the high-tech equipment sourced by NTT in fiscal  1992, compared with 11 percent in fiscal 1991.</p>

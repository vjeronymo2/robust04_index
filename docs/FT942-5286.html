			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Indonesia hit by 12 tidal waves Indonesians mourned their dead yesterday after up to 12 tidal waves engulfed Pancur, 880km east of Jakarta after an earthquake just after midnight on Friday. Pancur and its surrounding areas stand on a spur near the resort island of Bali. More than 400 earthquake aftershocks triggered fears of a fresh tragedy in the remote south-east corner of East Java. No official death toll has been issued but police estimate the toll at more than 200. It was Indonesia's worst tidal wave disaster since over 2,000 people were killed on Flores island, east of Bali, after a big earthquake and tidal waves in 1992. Wreckage from nearly 500 wooden homes was strewn among palm trees in the fishing town of Pancur. Children played among the debris while people sought to salvage possessions from their homes.</p>

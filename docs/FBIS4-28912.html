			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation Marks as Received] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh 15 Jun (AKP) -- His Majesty King Norodom  Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, on 12 June granted an interview to a  BMD [Bulletin Mensuel de Documentation -- monthly bulletin of  Sihanouk's secretariat] team in Beijing. Here is the entire  interview.    BMD team: "Sir, your 11 June 1994 interview with Nate Thayer  will please many compatriots and displease and offend other  Cambodians, who dread your return to power. What will you do to  reassure the honorable Cambodian personalities currently in  power that it is not your intention to return to power?    Norodom Sihanouk: "I wish to reassure our current leaders in  fact on my so-called "possible return to power." My age,  health, and personal interest will not push me into [words  indistinct] (?power) which brings me only deception,  unpleasantness, extreme fatigue, and great dangers. I only  answered a specific question from Nate Thayer who spoke to me  about the case in which Cambodia (?and its) people were  desperate and in mortal danger. In such a case, I was asked by  Nate Thayer, would I let Cambodia and the Cambodian people die  without trying to save them. To be frank, I answered no. I  would prefer to die while trying to help save my fatherland and  my people rather than to die on my hospital bed in Beijing. So,  I gave Nate Thayer some details of my "political program" in  case I was called upon by our current leaders (N.A. and the RGC)  [National Assembly and the Royal Government of Cambodia] to  ensure the rescue of Cambodia for one or two years. Well, "the  Cambodian ship" will not sink anytime soon, despite serious  damage. Therefore, we do not at all need a rescuer... [ellipsis  as received] even one named Sihanouk. The only plan I have "in  mind" seriously is not my return (not wished and not desirable)  to power, but rather a new 35-mm film entitled "an apostle of  non-violence" for which I will write the scenario and dialogues.  This was inspired by the admirable action of Samdech Preah  Khousananda and a venerable Khmer (?monk) killed by the Khmer  Rouge during the third Thammyeatra [peace march by Buddhist  monks]. So, I hope that our current leaders (whom I support and  will always affectionately support) will not give too much  importance to my so-called "plan" in case I was forced to  "return to power." There is only one possibility in a thousand  that such a case will present itself.</p>

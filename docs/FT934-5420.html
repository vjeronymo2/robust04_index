			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: The Nutcracker meets goodie two-shoes - Ballet Warner Brothers' film of New York City Ballet's Nutcracker, cumbersomely entitled George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, was released in the US this week, not without considerable advance publicity in the form of a fight between the studio and Kit Culkin, father of 13-year-old film star Macaulay Culkin, who plays the Nutcracker. The elder Culkin has tender feelings about Balanchine's 1954 Christmas ballet. As a boy he danced in it himself; he too was the Nutcracker. So when Macaulay was offered this role in the film version, the Culkins accepted on far more modest terms than the child star normally commands: Dollars 10,000 plus 5 per cent of the gross. (For Home Alone 2 Macaulay received Dollars 5m plus 5 per cent of gross.) In return, Kit Culkin expected that the producers too would have tender feelings about the ballet - film it straight, not 'adapt' it: an approach that everyone seems to have agreed on in the early stages. But at test screenings it turned out, reportedly, that many children could not follow the story. So the producers hired Kevin Kline to narrate it, over the music, at various moments in the film. When Kit Culkin saw the narrated version, according to an article in New York magazine, he told the producers, 'You've s*** all over Tchaikovsky.' If the narration were used, Culkin said, Macaulay would take no part in promoting the movie. If the narration were not used, on the other hand, Macaulay would renounce his 5 per cent of the gross. After considerable scuffling, Warner Brothers rejected Culkin's offer. When the film hit the theatres on Wednesday there was Kevin Kline's voice, smack on top of the music, telling us, for example, as the Christmas eve guests enter in Act I, 'Here they all came, the Christmas eve guests.' I do not know where Warner Brothers obtains the children for its test screenings, but every year I attend NYCB's Nutcracker in a theatre full of children, and they all seem to get the drift. Silly though it is, however, the narration is sparse. A far greater problem is the camera work. 'We trusted the dance,' says producer Bob Hurwitz of the film team's philosophy. 'We trusted Balanchine.' Nothing could contradict that statement more flatly than the filming of the dances. Never is a dance given its proper time and space: never is it allowed to establish itself. Presumably for the same anxiety about our attention span the camera is constantly moving into closeup. We gaze into the Sugarplum Fairy's armpit, we inspect Macaulay Culkin's mouth. (He is missing the first premolar on the upper left.) The nearer we get to any one dancer, the less we see of the choreography. Nor do the closeups enhance realism of the movie. On the contrary. Seen from a few inches away, the 'snow' is clearly paper; the ice cream, plaster. Crazy-wigged Drosselmeyer, who in the stage production is a figure of weird glamour, here looks like a man who might ask you for a quarter in the subway. Emile Ardolino, the film's director, produced and directed first-rate dance programs for the Public Broadcasting Service in the 1970s and early 1980s. When he went to Hollywood four days before the release of the Nutcracker movie, he died of Aids at the age of 50. Ardolino's memory should be honoured - for his earlier work. I do not envy anyone the task of adapting the non-realistic medium of ballet to the realistic medium of popular film, but in this case no interesting solutions were found. In the film as in the theatre, the ballet is danced by New York City Ballet, and the cast is well chosen. If for nothing else, the film is valuable in that it records the cool, brilliant allegro work of Kyra Nichols as the Dewdrop and the glorious expansiveness of Darci Kistler as the Sugarplum Fairy. Twelve-year-old Jessica Lynn Cohen, who plays the heroine, Marie, has a pretty face and a peppy spirit. The only serious piece of miscasting is Macaulay Culkin. He has danced in NYCB's production before - he played Fritz, Marie's truculent little brother, in 1989 and 1990 - but he is not at home in ballet. His neck and shoulders are tight and he walks as if his shoes hurt. Culkin is a comedian, a rare gift in a 13-year-old, but not one that is required for the Nutcracker. Culkin plays it with an ironic half-smile, as if he were in a children's production of The Importance of Being Earnest. He was clearly hired for box office reasons, which would have been fine had he been right for the part.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Consumer electronics - future lies in software and facilities (1) Sir, In his analysis of the consumer electronics industry ('How to stand out in a crowd', September 10), Tony Jackson does not mention the implications of the growing role of software. The figures are startling: a top-line television may contain 500,000 bytes (500kB) of software, and this may grow to one million in the next three or four years. A vacuum cleaner currently contains some 8kB - even an electric shaver contains some 4kB. This software exists to add features and reduce costs, which makes it central to competitiveness. If it contains errors, it may force a product recall. The software is complex, and therefore difficult to get right in every detail, yet some companies still do not treat software development as a task requiring disciplined engineering management, mathematically sound design methods, and specialised quality assurance. The growth in the role of software has taken some managements by surprise. In working with companies in the UK and overseas, we often find that software engineering issues are not getting the management attention that they need, with consequent risk to product development time scales and budgets. Software engineering is a hugely important profession. It is far from mature, but modern engineering methods are reducing development costs and risks. In the future battle for growth and survival in consumer electronics, software competence may well play a grater part than 256M D-Ram chips.

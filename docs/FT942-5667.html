			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Stroke sufferers learn to talk again Computers are teaching people to talk again after suffering strokes. A team at Bristol's Frenchay Hospital in the UK uses personal computers to help patients supplement therapy. They allow patients to practise repeatedly routines that will help them find words they have in their heads but cannot express or write. The Frenchay's aphasia (stroke-induced speech and language difficulty) computer team has worked in this area for seven years. The patients it deals with range from 33 to 82 years old and have suffered strokes of varying severity. The stroke patients call up words on screen which they have difficulty locating mentally, explains Jane Mortley, of the aphasia team. 'Where the word is stored in the brain, that's where the damage is as a result of the stroke.' Courses are held at the hospital to train speech and language therapists in the method.

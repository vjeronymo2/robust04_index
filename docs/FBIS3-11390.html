The technical meeting  runs through Friday at Kingston's convention center.    The meeting, which has brought together numerous  representatives from most of the countries and territories that  border the Caribbean Sea, yesterday evening held its first  working session, which was attended by nearly every chief  delegate.    Cuban Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ramon Sanchez Parodi  reaffirmed Cuba's commitment to regional integration and  reasserted that Cuba remains an inseparable part of the  Caribbean region.    The vice foreign minister stressed that Cuba believes it has  the duty and obligation to fully support efforts to establish  the AEC because of Cuba's cultural, geographic, historic, and  economic ties to all of the Caribbean Basin nations.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Sanchez Parodi  underscored that the fundamental feature of the first day of  work was the agreement among representatives of the various  subregions to join the association, regardless of other issues  that may be raised in the course of the meeting.    Experts from Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, the special  French Government envoy for overseas Caribbean departments, and  other officials outlined their points of view regarding the  future intergovernmental organization's potential structure,  scope, and outlook.    On Thursday, the agenda will deal with technical discussions  on membership, the goals of the organization's primary agencies,  decisionmaking procedures, and financing -- all of which are  elements contained in the draft document dealing with the  founding of the AEC.    Observers believe that a specialists meeting might be needed  before a ministerial-level meeting to finalize the groundwork  for the AEC, which is scheduled to be approved by the  member-nations' heads of state and government who will meet in  Barbados in July.</p>

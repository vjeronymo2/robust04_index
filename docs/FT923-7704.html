			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Much ado about doing nothing: Peter Norman examines the economic options facing the UK government Mr Norman Lamont finally got away on holiday this week, leaving behind a chorus of demands for action to revive Britain's recession-bound economy. Over the past three weeks, bankers, industrialists and, more predictably, trade unionists and the Labour Party have clamoured for the government to 'do something' to end the longest recession since the second world war. The proferred prescriptions - to 'kick start' the housing market, stimulate investment, lower interest rates and even devalue the pound - have been as varied as their promotors. In spite of rising unemployment, falling business confidence and a growing fear that declining industrial orders will lead the economy into a new nosedive after the summer, the Treasury's instinct is to do nothing. Officials draw comfort from falling inflationary pressures and faint signs of rising manufacturing output. They argue that the business cycle will gradually recover from its present 'corrugated bottom' once consumers gain sufficient confidence to spend more. But the do-nothing approach sits ill with political realities. The mandarins of Great George Street are as aware as the prime minister and chancellor that Tory back benchers are restive, the constituency parties grumpy, and that plans must be made to head off dissent at the party conference in Brighton in October. So, despite denials, officials are sifting options for action, more, it has to be said, in the hope of achieving a presentational success than actually changing the course of the economy. In fact, the government's hands are largely tied. It has hardly any monetary leeway so long as it sticks to its goal of low and, if possible, zero inflation through membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Short term interest rates are determined by the Bundesbank where there is little hope of a fall in the all important Lombard rate from its present 9.75 per cent much before the end of this year. With the UK's 1992-93 public sector borrowing requirement expected to exceed the targeted Pounds 28bn and some pundits projecting a further rise to about Pounds 40bn the following year, there appears little scope for fiscal activism. The so-called 'nuclear' options of withdrawal from the ERM or devaluation of sterling can be ruled out so long as Mr Major and Mr Lamont are neighbours in Downing Street. The only conceivable basis for such a policy change would be if a French 'No' to Maastricht on September 20 triggered monetary chaos in Europe, leading to a collapse of the ERM: a turn of events that would in any case pose serious problems for the prime minister during the UK presidency of the European Community. A review of the possible domestic policy moves also shows that there are no easy choices. Even the much touted option of a temporary cut in value added tax from its present 17.5 per cent rate to stimulate consumption has weighty downside elements. According to its supporters, a VAT cut: would tackle directly the economy's main problem of sluggish consumer demand, could be implemented without delay, would exert further downwards pressure on retail price inflation, so improving the climate for eventual interest rate cuts once Germany's policy eases, and, would act as an effective substitute for lower interest rates at home. Like an interest rate cut, a VAT reduction would lower costs for consumers and businesses and reduce the attractions of saving but have the additional advantage of not undermining sterling on foreign exchange markets. However, VAT reductions are expensive. Treasury figures suggest that a six month VAT reduction to 15 per cent would cost around Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 2.6bn - a heavy burden at a time of budgetary restraint. High costs and a strong objection to additional subsidies for home owners were an important reason why the Treasury reacted with such hostility to recent suggestions from the Abbey National and National Westminster Bank for new tax breaks to help the housing market. But this does not mean that no thought is being given to schemes to boost housing. One no-cost option would be to change building society regulations so that credit-worthy house buyers could borrow more than the value of their planned home purchase. This could help people at present prevented from moving because of negative equity in their existing homes as a result of falling house prices. But whether house buyers would take advantage of such a scheme when house prices are still falling, or whether building society managers would have the necessary skills to assess credit worthiness in the absence of full collateral is open to doubt. There is support in parts of Whitehall for institutional reforms and supply side measures to improve the economy. Some ideas, such as giving independence to the Bank of England, could bring long term benefits by enhancing the credibility of the government's counter inflation policy. But it is difficult to see such a proposal bringing the party faithful to their feet in Brighton while a short term risk would surely be that a newly independent central bank could be inclined to push interest rates higher to establish its credibility with financial markets. Another suggestion is that the government should abandon its rule of fully funding the government borrowing requirement, which requires it to sell its debt entirely outside the banking and building society sectors. Advocates say 'underfunding' could lower long-term interest rates. But the supposed benefits are a subject of dispute among experts and would hardly have voter appeal. Some serious thought will be given to bringing forward already agreed spending on public sector projects as a way of helping the hard pressed construction industry. Ministers are acutely conscious that local builders are often local constituency party stalwarts. A few well-timed announcements would also add strength to the nascent government campaign to clamp down on public sector pay. But the general belief in Whitehall is that such moves can only help at the margin. The emergence of recovery - just like the course of the recession - will ultimately depend on the behaviour of Britain's consumers. Here recent trends have made Treasury ministers and officials more confident that a recovery of sorts is in the pipeline. Yesterday's unexpectedly good inflation figures, coupled with a sharp deceleration in wage inflation in recent months, augur well for Britain's long-term competitiveness. In the meantime, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, claims that in real terms a family of four with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage and on average earnings should be Pounds 35 per week better off than at the time of ERM entry in October 1990. If true, that is, as one Whitehall official said this week, 'big bucks'. If that mythical family of four can be persuaded to part with some of its gains, Britain's economy may lift off the bottom without overt government help.</p>

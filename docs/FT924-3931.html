			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Nine more GM plants to be closed GENERAL Motors, the US motor manufacturer in the throes of a sweeping restructuring, yesterday announced plans to close nine more North American plants, employing more than 18,000 workers, and to dispose of some 14 per cent of its automotive components operations. The closures, designed to help restore GM's lossmaking North American operations to profit, are the latest stage in a plan the company announced a year ago to shut 21 plants and shed 74,000 jobs by the mid-1990s. It announced the names of 14 of the plants earlier this year and had promised to decide on the remaining seven by the end of 1992. In the event, it yesterday named nine factories, bringing to 23 the total to be closed between now and 1996. They include two assembly plants: Wilmington, Delaware, which employs 3,500 and makes Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta cars, and the Flint, Michigan, truck assembly plant, which employs 4,450. Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said the closures would allow GM to cut its capacity to 5.4m vehicles by the mid-1990s, which it believed to be in line with market demand for its products. Employees are likely to be shielded from the worst effects of the cuts by a GM scheme which allows redundant workers to remain on virtual full salary. The company is also working on a new early retirement scheme for blue-collar employees. Other plants to be shut include a metal fabricating operation in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which employs 3,100 and makes doors, floor pans and other items for a variety of GM vehicles. Five other US plants are to be closed as part of a restructuring announced yesterday at GM's Automotive Components Group, the world's largest supplier of vehicle parts. An axle plant in Canada will also be shut or sold. Analysts have long argued that GM needs to cut back on its components operations, which supply about 70 per cent of the company's vehicle parts, a far higher proportion than at its two US rivals, Ford and Chrysler. The group said yesterday it would now channel its energies into seven major business segments, accounting for some 86 per cent of its Dollars 24bn annual sales, in each of which it ranked first or second in global market share. These were: energy storage and management systems; engine management systems; lighting systems; occupant environment management systems; power and signal distribution systems; ride and handling systems; and thermal management systems.</p>

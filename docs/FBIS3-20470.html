			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ch'en Hsiu-hsien (7115 0208 6343): "Red Guard </F> Sells Taiwan Computers"]    [Text] He is combative after the test of a decade of the  Cultural Revolution.    He has gone from cooperation to a split with Acer.    He is typical of the astute and tough partners and  adversaries that Taiwan firms have encountered on the mainland.    When thinking about the red guards who went through the  severe test of 10 years of turmoil on the China mainland, one  conjures up an image of burly men possessed of indomitable  spirit and a booming voice.    On first sight, Li Feng [7812 6912] turned out to be of  slight build and extraordinarily quite, particularly so in the  noisy lobby of a hotel in Shenzhen.    It was impossible to know that as soon as he opened his  mouth, this impression would be completely reversed. He was  really a very incisive person!    "If it hadn't been for my advertising, Acer would never have  sold anything (in China)." He spoke like a machine gun, and not  just rapidly but forcefully as well. "You must use strong words  in advertising to Chinese. Acer's ads were not strong enough."  He held back nothing when he talked. "Acer is too gentle. Stan  Shih and the others are all too nice."    "Computer ads in China are not for customers to read; they  are written for the bosses who do not understand computers who  may happen to read them." He began to give pointers. "There is  no use talking all the time about Acer's history or concepts. No  one wants to read that." Waving his hands, he said, "My ads said  that Acer is best in six ways. What their own ads did not say, I  said for them."    Standing there, he was really complex. In the eyes of people  in Shenzhen, Li Feng is a mystery. For Acer Computer, which  longs to open up the China mainland market, Li Feng was a strong  partner deserving of respect, but today he is a difficult to  control local bully. To other Taiwan and overseas information  entrepreneurs who want to open the mainland door, Li Feng  provides a key on which they pin their hopes.    Li Feng is a 39 year-old Hunanese. "No one knows where he  sprang from." In talking about his background, one Shenzhen  entrepreneur shook his head and said, "My friend who plays cards  with him has never seen him lose."    Another person who sells computers on the mainland seems to  have heard a lot about Li Feng, but still really not enough. He  said that Li Feng is the name on his name card, but his identity  cards bears the name Zhai Lifeng [5049 7812 6912]. However,  "this identity card was also bought, so just what his real name  is, I have no way of knowing." In making the rounds of Shenzhen,  Li Feng draws a lot of attention. His car is an imported Lincoln  Continental. Sometimes he drives it himself rather than use a  chauffeur.    A year ago, Li Feng, who had been operating in Shenzhen for  seven years, established the Liji Corporation, which specialized  in the sale of Acer computers. Li Feng was very candid in saying  why he had taken the name Liji for his corporation. "It was to  cooperate with Acer." Within one year, he found 25 salesmen on  the China mainland, and he claimed to have spent a total of  $200,000 on advertising.    In order to help Liji expand the mainland market rapidly,  Acer provided all possible help.    For this reason, all the computers in the Liji office were  provided by Acer, and Acer helped set up all the office's E-mail  networks. Liji's financial and management systems were all set  up with the help of Acer. One person well versed on the inside  story could not help saying that "Their (Liji's) whole  enterprise is a duplicate of Acer."    In 1992, Acer unexpectedly learned that Liji had privately  sold copies of Acer computers. After contacting a Hong Kong  lawyer unsuccessfully, Acer decided to sever relations with  Liji. An Acer mainland market official said, "On anything having  to do with the intangible asset of a trademark, Acer's principle  is very clear: absolutely no compromise." In April 1993, Acer  formally established a branch corporation on the mainland.  <H5>  Makes Own Way in the World Using Taiwan Connections </H5>   While I was talking with Li Feng in the coffee shop of a  Shenzhen hotel, his cellular telephone suddenly rang. After  hanging up the telephone, Li Feng said that Acer had sent a fax  demanding that Liji immediately settle outstanding debts.  Hardening his voice, he responded, "Acer says it will not sell  machines to me. Who cares? I can buy them from Hong Kong, Japan,  or the United States."    No matter how matters develop between Liji and Acer, Li Feng  has decided to continue to use Taiwan computer contacts to make  his own way in the world. "Now I am cooperating with Taiwan," Li  Feng said. All the products that Liji needs in order to have a  brand of its own -- mainframes, monitors, chassis, or script  computers, etc -- will be provided by Taiwan concerns. In order  to sell low cost computers for home use, he went to the Beijing  branch of the American Yingdaier [phonetic] Company, which he  told that he wanted 1 million 80386 computer chips each month.    From his contacts with Taiwan entrepreneurs, Li Feng is  quick  to apply what he learns. After hearing of the Taiwan computer  industry's business problems in recent years, he said with a  laugh, "I only sell. I don't manufacture. Manufacturing is too  tough."    Because Li Ming's car had been sent to the airport to meet  an  official from the Ministry of Electronics in Beijing, he walked  back to his office. Asked as he walked along the streets of  Shenzhen whether Shenzhen was a so-called risk taker's paradise,  he nodded agreement. To succeed in Shenzhen takes three things:  "First is outside assistance. This is the facade. Second is  contacts. This is the real strength. Third is assistants.  Because of the many opportunities, it is impossible to get  around to all of them."    "How will your Taiwan overcome our mainland? Forty years  ago,  the Kuomintang lost out to the Communist Party," he said as he  walked along. "Nowadays, there is no talk about politics; just  about making money. The likes of Acer do not love money. I  really have trouble understanding it." Except for the mainland,  this is a world that operates using laws and concepts. In the  mainland, by contrast, a fist is sometimes more useful than a  lawyer.    Li Feng is just the kind of astute and tough partner and  adversary that a typical Taiwan trader meets on the mainland.</p>

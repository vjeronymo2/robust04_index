			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1989 WAS THE WORST YEAR FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS;  </P> <P> SECURITY: ASSAULTS AGAINST U.S. INTERESTS JUMPED BY 45% TO A TOTAL OF 112 AND  AMERICAN BUSINESSES EXPERIENCED A CORRESPONDING INCREASE, REGISTERING 29  ATTACKS.  </P> <P> An analyst who advises businesses how to offer better protection for their  executives and personnel traveling abroad says 1989 was the worst year on  record for terrorist attacks worldwide.  </P> <P> Matthew Freund, senior analyst with Business Risks International, based in  Nashville, Tenn., said the level of terrorist violence worldwide increased last  year to its highest level since the company began keeping statistics on  terrorism in 1970.  </P> <P> Freund said terrorist incidents against businesses increased by 12% last year,  making businesses the leading target for terrorists for the sixth straight  year.  </P> <P> The rise in terrorist activity in 1989 came despite the lack of a single major  incident such as the Dec. 21, 1988, terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103  which killed 270 people, including 11 on the ground, when it exploded over  Lockerbie, Scotland, on a flight from West Germany to New York.  </P> <P> Freund said the attack on Pan Am 103 was apparently the work of a radical  Moslem fringe group angered by what it considered PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's  softening of his stance toward Israel.  </P> <P> "The news media does a good job of reporting on terrorism, but a lot of  terrorist activities happen behind the headlines," Freund said. "The Pan Am  attack has kind of faded out of the public mind, but there were still a record  number of terrorist attacks last year."  </P> <P> There were 4,422 terrorist incidents reported worldwide in 1989, according to  Business Risks International. That is a 16% increase from the level of 1988.  Terrorist attacks left 8,237 people dead in 1989, a 10% increase from 1988.  </P> <P> Bombs accounted for 1,930 of the terrorist attacks in 1989, the company said.  </P> <P> Attacks against U.S. interests jumped by 45% to a total of 112 and American  businesses experienced a corresponding increase, registering 29 attacks, most  of them in Latin America.  </P> <P> Freund said Latin America and the Middle East, particularly Lebanon, remain the  most violent areas of the world.  </P> <P> Latin America accounted for 1,964 of the total terrorist incidents last year.  Peru, besieged by drug traffickers and leftist extremist groups, led all  countries with 647 terrorist incidents.  </P> <P> Terrorist activity increased in Asia during the past year, as religious and  ethnic strife intensified. Terrorist activity almost doubled in the Middle East  and North Africa.  </P> <P> For the first time in three years, successful attacks occurred in the United  States, including four bombings and five assassination incidents linked to  white supremacist and Islamic fundamentalist elements.  </P> <P> "Last year's figures were not an aberration," said Gene Mastrangelo, manager of  the risk assessment information service. "The total number of terrorist attacks  from 1980 through 1989 is 31,426 -- about four times the total number of  attacks recorded in the 1970s."  </P> <P> The company's risk assessment information service monitors all forms of  terrorism worldwide including both international and domestic acts carried out  by indigenous groups. The service maintains a computer database containing  information on the global scope and nature of terrorist incidents, patterns and  trends dating back to 1970.  </P> <P> Freund said the increase in worldwide terrorist activity in 1989 reflected a  rise in attacks carried out by religious and ethnic groups seeking independence  or greater political power within their own countries.  </P> <P> The U.S. government monitors only international terrorist incidents, defined as  attacks involving the citizens or territory of more than one country.  </P> <P> "We don't criticize the State Department's method of reporting terrorist  attacks," Freund said. "We just say that we monitor a broader range of  terrorist activities worldwide."  </P> <P> Freund said Business Risks International publishes reports on terrorist  activity for its clients. The reports offer the company's intelligence on  terrorist activity and information on how to offer better protection for  executives traveling abroad.  </P> <P> "We're not a guards, guns and dogs type of company, but we do provide security  counseling for our clients, particularly those who plan to travel to high-risk  parts of the world."  </P> <P> Freund said the company basically advises people who work for high-profile  companies to avoid making their itineraries public, vary their travel schedules  and make sure they have adequate security plans, including a driver trained in  what to do in case of a terrorist attack.  </P></p>

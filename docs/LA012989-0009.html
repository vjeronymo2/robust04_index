			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> What a sad commentary on our society that "Gary Collins' Hour Magazine" will be  canceled because he isn't controversial enough. Collins' show was a breath of  fresh air after Phil and Geraldo's sleaze. I don't see how they can top their  barrel scrapings in 1989.  </P> <P> Florence Glick, Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commentators suggested that there should be even greater conformity between the AMT and regular tax systems than that provided in the proposed regulations. These commentators urged that, in computing AMTI, all references to taxable income or a component thereof (such as AGI, modified AGI, earned income, or taxable business income) should be treated as references to regular taxable income or a component thereof for purposes of determining any item of income, exclusion, or deduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commentators stated that any regulatory attempt at conformity was inappropriate. According to these commentators, the separate and parallel system should be adhered to in full. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, there were some commentators who suggested that taxpayers be allowed to make a binding election to make computations based either on regular tax AGI or AMT AGI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, in computing AMTI, all items of income, exclusion, or deduction that are determined by references to defined measures of income were based on such defined measures as determined for regular tax purposes, the system envisioned by Congress would be substantively changed. Accordingly, the final regulations have not been expanded to provide that all references to taxable income, or a component thereof, be treated as references to regular taxable income, or a component thereof, in computing AMTI. The final regulations clarify, however, that for purposes of computing the AMTI of a noncorporate taxpayer, all references to the taxpayer's modified AGI in determining the amount of any item of income, exclusion, or deduction must be treated as references to the taxpayer's modified AGI as determined for regular tax purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations also do not adopt the suggestion that an election be permitted to use either regular tax AGI or AMT AGI in computing AMTI. Such an election would add administrative complexity to the AMT and would be contrary to the goal of simplicity sought by these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations were intended to reduce complexity without deviating from the separate and parallel concept to such an extent that the purpose of the AMT provisions would be subverted. The Treasury and the IRS believe that the general intent of Congress to apply the AMT on a separate and parallel basis is not undermined where this concept is not followed in limited, specific instances for the purpose of reducing some of the complexity and recordkeeping burdens of the AMT. Accordingly, the final regulations adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations in full. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS will continue to consider other possible areas of the AMT where the separate and parallel concept should, on a limited basis, be modified in order to reduce complexity. The IRS may, in the future, address other possible areas through regulations or other published guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Forest Boone of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting).

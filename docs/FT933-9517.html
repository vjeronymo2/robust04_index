			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Investors set to recharge E German energy sector: A total of DM46bn is waiting to be spent, mainly by the domestic utilities THE way has been cleared for an investment programme totalling DM46bn (Pounds 17.8bn) to upgrade the energy sector in eastern Germany and to privatise the region's utilities. The investments, to be made by east Germany's principal utility, Vereinigte Energiewerke, or Veag, and by west Germany's main utility companies, will follow agreement by the last of eastern Germany's 164 local councils to accept the Stromvertrag. The latter effectively created a monopoly over the generation and distribution of electricity in the east of the country. . However, its restrictive nature will make it extremely difficult for foreigners to invest in the region's utilities. Veag, which operates the high voltage transmission network in eastern Germany, has earmarked DM25bn for modernising power generation plant fuelled by brown coal, or lignite. It will also link the eastern and western high voltage grid. Germany's three largest utilities - RWE Energie, Bayernwerk, and PreussenElektra, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Veba, Germany's energy-based conglomerate - and Veba Kraftwerke Ruhr, also owned by Veba, plan to spend DM21bn on building or upgrading the east's power stations, to be fuelled mostly by lignite. Combined, the investments will give the region a total annual capacity of 12,300MW. Few foreign investors have been able to obtain a foothold in eastern German utilities. Exceptions are Britain's PowerGen, and the Minneapolis-based NRG utility company, which together are negotiating to buy the giant Mibrag lignite mines and a stake in a power station at Schkopau, near Leipzig. This is because the sector's future has been mapped out by the Stromvertrag agreed in August 1990 between Bonn, the last East German administration and the West German utilities. This not only creates an effective monopoly but also inhibits the Treuhand privatisation agency from opening up the utilities sector to any competition. For example, under the Stromvertrag: Germany's three largest utilities, known as the Big Three, were given a combined 75 per cent stake in Veag, which means they control access to the high voltage grid in eastern Germany. While Veag is under the control of the Treuhand, which will sell it later this year, it cannot change its ownership structure. Along with west Germany's five smaller utility companies, the Big Three have secured majority stakes of 51 per cent in eastern Germany's 15 regional distribution networks. East Germany's local councils are allowed to own only 49 per cent of the region's 15 utilities. The remaining 51 per cent is technically owned by west Germany's eight utilities. The east's regional utilities are also under the Treuhand which is currently selling off the 51 per cent stakes. But again, the Stromvertrag does not permit a change in the ownership structure. East Germany's regional utilities must buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the next 20 years. The remaining 30 per cent of their needs can be generated locally. For two years, several local councils challenged the Stromvertrag on the grounds that they had owned 100 per cent of public assets before they had been expropriated by the east German Communists in 1952. Essentially, the councils wanted access to the lucrative business of power generation. For their part, west Germany's utilities defended this structure on the grounds that their large investment in the east had to be underwritten by guaranteed energy sales. Although Germany's constitutional court ruled against the councils, a compromise was reached last month giving them the right to their assets provided they sold their 49 per cent stake in the utilities. The money raised would allow them to build their own power plants, but they will first need a licence to do so. There could be a chance for foreign investors to buy a share of these 49 per cent stakes, but Mr Winfried Mathes, from Deutsche Bank Research, is not optimistic. He said other local councils would have first option on them, followed by the eight west German utilities. 'There is hardly any chance for foreign investors to get hold of these stakes,' said Mr Mathes. However, they had the right to buy a share of, or co-operate with local councils in generating 30 per cent of local energy needs. They could also buy brown coal fields, later selling a stake in them to a west German utility in return for access to distribution and the high voltage grid. The monopoly enjoyed by west German utilities in the east carries a high risk: energy consumption is still falling because the region's industry is still collapsing. According to a utility expert: 'The Stromvertrag provides guaranteed electricity sales. But the massive investment plans could exceed demand if there is no new industry created. This worries domestic and foreign investors. Indeed, if no economic upturn is in sight, west German utilities might cut back their investment commitments in the region.'</p>

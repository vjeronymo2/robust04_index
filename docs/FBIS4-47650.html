			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 29 Apr (PANA) -- Burundi Prime Minister  Anatole Kanyenkiko set a new 48-hour deadline Thursday [28  April] for civilians to surrender illegally kept weapons to the  appropriate authorities.    The deadline was given at the end of a two-day meeting in  Bujumbura with the governors of 15 provinces to review the  security situation in the interior of the country. But, he  warned, those asking for an extension of the deadline should  know that the disarmament plan is now in its implementing stage.  He said that the Army would maintain the necessary pressure on  rebelling districts and arrange safe passages to evacuate people  who wish to leave insecure areas.    Another meeting was held in the capital between  representatives of rebels and some high-ranking officers of the  Army operating in the troubled sector of Kamenge, in the north  of the capital.    The minister of defense, Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, said that  this was an attempt to appease the public. But eyewitnesses  reported Bujumbura to be extremely tense. There has been heavy  gunfire in the southern and northern parts of the capital.</p>

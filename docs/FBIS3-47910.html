			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun,  chairman of the North side headquarters of the National Alliance  for the Country's Reunification, in his telephone message to the  "minister of the unification board" of South Korea Thursday  notified him that we were going to send a mourners' group to  Seoul with a view to cherishing the memory of the Rev. Mun  Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion for reunification, on his sudden  death and sharing pains with the South Korean people, and  proposed to have a contact between working officials of both  sides at the conference room of the Neutral Nations Supervisory  Commission at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on January 21 to discuss  working matters concerning it.    But the contact between the working officials of both sides  failed to be held today owing to the unjustifiable attitude of  the South side.    The South Korean authorities did not come out to contact  without a reply telephone message, avoiding our compatriotic and  courtesy proposal for a consolatory visit under an inhuman,  illegal, unjust and unreasonable pretext contrary to common  sense.    The North side representatives in Panmunjom of the  North-South liaison office informed the South side of our stand  concerning the contact at 09;00 this morning by telephone and  urged it to come out to the contact but it evaded the contact,  not saying a word.    The working officials of the North side failed to discuss  the  Seoul visit of our mourners' group with the South side and,  accordingly, the group failed to go to Seoul and mourn the late  Rev Mun Ik-hwan on January 22 [as received], the funeral day, as  scheduled.    The behaviour of the South Korean authorities who refused to  accept the North side mourner's group this time showed that they  are not human beings, far from being the same nation, and they  have neither ancestral manners and customs nor courtesy and  morality.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING INTO THE '90S. A NEW WORLD IN TIME. WALLS FALL, DEBTS RISE,  POLITICIANS THRIVE, ENVIRONMENTS SUFFER-A LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER AND OVER THE  HORIZON.;  </P> <P> 1989: FOUR POLITICAL FIXTURES SUFFER HARDS TIMES AND BAD CALLS ;  </P> <P> RUNNING INTO TROUBLE  </P> <P> Tom Bradley, 72, was the loneliest and strongest of long-distance runners, the  student from South-Central Los Angeles who refused to take shop classes, the  UCLA track star who became a policeman, lawyer, city councilman and, in 1973,  mayor of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Tall, dignified -- even inscrutable -- the first black mayor of a huge  white-majority city, Bradley won four terms and ran without a tumble. Perhaps  his finest moments came with the 1984 Olympics, when Bradley pushed the games  and watched the city turn a profit.  </P> <P> Then came 1989, with a deluge of charges that the mayor offered preferential  treatment in return for campaign contributions, that he accepted payments from  a bank while depositing public funds in it, that carnivals were staged  illegally to raise campaign funds. The city attorney found "insufficient  evidence" to prosecute. But the public lost faith. The unmaking of a self-made  man.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was running hard for mayor until early 1989,  with big money and a powerful amalgam of liberal groups ready to unseat Tom  Bradley.  </P> <P> But his own campaign advisers -- company acronym BAD -- helped do him in. BAD  memos on campaign strategy -- with a hint of elitism, a possible whiff of  racism -- became public. Yaroslavsky disowned them but the damage was done.  </P> <P> Polls showed voters swinging back to Bradley. Environmentalists who once  embraced Yaroslavsky looked around to count new projects high-rising on the  home turf; they began wondering if he was really a developer in disguise.  </P> <P> For 15 years, Yaroslavsky raced smartly, from UCLA activism to City Hall, from  blue jeans to white collars. Then he stumbled, figured the odds were long and  went back to the council. The promising young man who said he wanted to save  the world decided not to go the distance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alan Cranston, elected to the U.S. Senate for four consecutive terms, stays in  superb physical shape. At 75, he does morning wind sprints and dines on low-fat  fish. A senator for forever.  </P> <P> Liberal crusader and master fund-raiser, Cranston is suddenly in rotten  political shape. He took $47,000 in campaign money and $850,000 more for  voter-registration groups from Charles H. Keating Jr., the S&amp;L mogul who  gave millions to both parties until the government seized his insolvent firm.  Now, Internal Revenue agents investigate the $7 million Cranston raised for  voter registration. The Keating-related charge: giving special treatment to a  donor. The IRS-sponsored probe: possible violation of tax-exempt status to play  partisan politics.  </P> <P> The senator denies doing wrong and plans to run again. But 71% of his fellow  Democrats in California say he should not compete in '90; 38% think he should  step down right now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peter F. Schabarum's peers at the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors know  him as Pete. In 1989 his enemies were calling him Pedro, when Schabarum  celebrated his Mexican grandmother.  </P> <P> The one-time triple-threat fullback for UC Berkeley represents more than 1.6  million citizens, but now he bucks a whole wall of agencies that claim 1981  district lines were designed to dilute Latino voter strength -- hence, Latino  representation. The U.S. Justice Department filed suit. Two local activist  groups joined as plaintiffs. Even a Republican colleague on the board seemed to  help hobble Schabarum's 1990 reelection chances.  </P> <P> The issue comes to trial this week. While Schabarum says he honors his Mexican  heritage, some Latinos say he has been their worst enemy.  </P> <P> Schabarum style is neither sweet nor salsa -- more maverick, blunt. His next  race may depend less on form than on where the playing field is drawn.  </P></p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Arthur Wood in profit at midway Arthur Wood &amp; Son (Longport), maker of earthenware, beakers and terracotta teapots, turned round from a loss of Pounds 42,724 to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 16,402 in the first half of 1993. With turnover down 2 per cent at Pounds 1.53m, Mr Anthony Wood, chairman, said the 'modest' result reflected the effects of a cost reduction drive. The company experienced exceptionally bad trading conditions during the period, but there had been a recent improvement thanks to a 41 per cent rise in exports and a pick-up in orders from the home market. First-half earnings per share were 0.55p (1.69p losses).</p>

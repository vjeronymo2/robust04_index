			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1987 analysis of crib toy strangulation incidents also recommended that crib mobiles should be labeled to warn that the article should be kept out of the reach of infants, and should be removed when the infant attains the age of five months or is able to push up on his or her hands and knees. That analysis further recommended instructions accompanying crib toys should include warnings to place the crib mattress in one of the lower positions and to raise the crib drop side when attaching a crib toy. (24) However, the Commission has received newer information indicating that labeling alone cannot be expected to reduce strangulation hazards associated with crib toys (25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Effect of Mandatory Requirements on the Cost, Utility, and Availability of the Product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission was unable to obtain information about the costs which might result to manufacturers or consumers from imposing any of the requirements for crib toys discussed in the ANPR. The Commission did not attempt to make cost estimates because of uncertainty about the numbers and specific kinds of crib toys which might be affected by each of the requirements discussed in the ANPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> D. Voluntary Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also considered alternatives to development of mandatory requirements for crib toys. These alternatives included existing provisions of a voluntary standard for toy safety intended to address risks of strangulation injury associated with crib toys, and revisions of that voluntary standard which were under consideration at the time the Commission decided to terminate this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revisions included the addition of design guidelines to the voluntary standard to minimize strangulation hazards from protrusions on crib toys. The guidelines are intended to be used by manufacturers in the development of crib toys (27, 28).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the Commission staff was not able to devise objective criteria to identify protrusions on crib toys which present a strangulation hazard. In the absence of objective criteria to identify hazardous protrusions, the Commission concludes that addition of the proposed design guidelines to the voluntary standard would be worthwhile (27).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revisions of the voluntary standard under consideration also included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;Language to limit to 14 inches the perimeter formed by strings or cords which can tangle to form a loop;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;Improved warning labels concerning strangulation hazards associated with crib gyms and similar toys intended to be strung across the top of a crib or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> playpen;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;Addition of labeling requirements for crib mobiles to advise parents of precautions needed to minimize strangulation hazards associated with those products;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addition of language to the instructions to accompany crib gyms and similar toys to advise parents of precautions to be taken to minimize strangulation hazards associated with those products. (27) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering information about the voluntary standard and proposed revisions of that standard, the Commission concludes that the proposed changes would adequately address the hazards identified in the ANPR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3(g)(2) of the FHSA requires the Commission to terminate a proceeding for the development of a rule to address an unreasonable risk of injury associated with a toy or children's article if the Commission determines that a voluntary standard developed or modified after publication of the ANPR adequately addresses the risk of injury under consideration and that substantial compliance with such a voluntary standard is likely to be achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, provisions of section 3(g)(2) apply only to a voluntary standard which has been ``finally approved'' by the organization which developed the standard. The proposed revisions of the ASTM voluntary standard for toys discussed above have not yet been finally approved by ASTM. For that reason, the Commission is not required by section 3(g)(2) of the FHSA to terminate this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Conclusions by the Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From its consideration of all available information about risks of strangulation injuries to children associated with crib toys and mandatory requirements to address those risks, the Commission concludes that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The joint organization for production, processing,  and marketing of agricultural products of counties and cities  was formally established in Laiyang on 22 May. This is  Shandong's first transregional agricultural economic  organization with the nature of association voluntarily  organized by Laiyang, Laixi, Changle, Shouguang, Yushu, suburban  Taian, and Jinxiang counties and cities.    It is learned that all of these seven counties and cities --  the executive members of this organization -- are the province's  backbone bases to produce, process, and export agricultural  products. The vegetable exported and processed by these  counties and cities alone accounts for more than one third of  the country's total. In addition, more than 50 enterprises and  bases in Zhejinag, Henan, Liaoning, and two other provinces have  joined this organization as ordinary members. This joint  organization will certainly exert a tremendous influence on  agricultural produce markets at home and abroad.    Xiao Wanjun, deputy director of the Central Policy Research  Center, and Wang Jiangong, vice governor of Shandong Province,  made a special trip to the county to attend the inaugural  meeting and make speeches. Wang Jiangong was invited to serve  as honorary director of the organization. And the general  office of the provincial government, the provincial agricultural  commission, the provincial planning commission, the provincial  foreign economic relations and trade commission, and 10 other  units were invited to be advisers of the organization. The  people have generally regarded the establishment of this  organization as a new move of Shandong and even China in  developing the production, processing, and marketing of  agricultural products on an even wider scale and at an even  higher level. The people have also regarded it as an essential  trend of development of the rural market economy.    (Mu Yutai), secretary of the Laiyang City Party Committee,  initiator of this joint organization, and executive chairman of  the first committee of this organization, said: In line with  the principle of voluntary cooperation, by jointly handling  affairs, conducting economic consultation, and issuing journals  of the organization, this organization will commonly analyze the  agricultural produce markets at home and abroad and circulate  the notice on the amount, variety, and quotas of the production,  processing, and marketing of respective agricultural products  and on the distribution of agricultural products on markets.  This organization will also conduct the exchanges of sciences,  technologies, funds, professionals, and management experiences  and will subject itself to the guidance and supervision by the  government in order to avoid overlapping construction and  overlapping import of agricultural products and the unlawful  competitions between different areas. This organization will  also go beyond the limits of administrative divisions to help  optimize the distribution of natural resources, readjust the  structure of agricultural products, and push the province's  agricultural and sideline products to the domestic and  international markets in an all-round manner.</p>

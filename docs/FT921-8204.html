			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / 'Gorbachev' of the platteland seeks mandate: Mr F W de Klerk's attempt to halt his sliding popularity with white voters SOUTH AFRICA'S president has a touch of Gorbachev about him: he seems to be less popular among his own people (white Afrikaners) than with his former enemies, at home or abroad. Today's by-election in the conservative western Transvaal platteland town of Potchefstroom - a centre of Afrikaans learning and religion - will give the best indication yet of white support for Mr F W de Klerk and the revolution he has wrought in South African politics. He has challenged the ultra-right Conservative Party (CP) - which wants to reinstate and perfect the apartheid policy abandoned by the ruling Nationalists - to prove its strength in Potchefstroom. It is a risky strategy. Every by-election since Mr de Klerk took power in 1989 has shown a substantial swing away from his party. Potchefstroom could well prove little different, though Mr de Klerk is clearly hoping the swing will not be enough to overturn the National Party's 1,584-vote majority in a constituency of 22,000 voters. The government has perhaps not helped its chances with the announcement on Monday that white parents will soon be required to pay considerably more for the education of their children. The timing of this announcement, two days before a sensitive by-election, is extremely odd. This is home ground for Mr de Klerk, who attended Potchefstroom University. When he addressed an election meeting in the town last week, his message was surprisingly candid. Whites, he said, must face the reality of numbers: they are outnumbered 3:1 in Potchefstroom by blacks, and they are no longer able to tame the majority with force. They must learn to share power; the alternative, he said, would be suicide for the Afrikaner volk. He was referring to the alternative proposed by the Conservatives: classic apartheid, as practised by H F Verwoerd and his successors, to keep white and black ever separate under the law. Potchefstroom will help to answer a crucial question: do the Conservatives now speak for the majority of whites? Has Mr de Klerk lost his legitimacy as an Afrikaner leader? The answer will matter little in constitutional terms: even if the Conservatives triumph in 'Potch', they will remain vastly outnumbered in parliament by National Party MPs. And with Mr de Klerk's party caucus holding firm, the Conservatives know they cannot count on members crossing the floor to topple the president in a no-confidence vote. The constitutional route to revolt is blocked for them. But a Conservative victory could provide a moral basis for the right-wing struggle; whites can argue that they are being governed by an illegitimate regime which has lost its mandate from the electorate. This could fuel white terrorism - the only real threat to Mr de Klerk's reforms. Mr de Klerk would have to cede a lot of psychological ground to white supremacist groups and to the whole fractured right in South African politics. And though the lunatic right has relatively few members, it remains an important spoiling force: the effect of a few well-timed assassinations and well-placed bombs could prove catastrophic. A Conservative victory in Potchefstroom would, inevitably, raise the frightening prospect that the National Party might also fail when they put a new constitution to a planned referendum of white voters. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC), has said there would be a revolution in South Africa if whites reject a constitution agreed to by the rest of its people. Conversely, a defeat in Potchefstroom could work to Mr de Klerk's advantage: it would concentrate the minds of ANC leaders on the need to win whites over with a constitution that gives minorities real power Because they, too, will lose if Mr de Klerk's referendum fails; they are far from keen to return to the revolutionary struggle, and have begun to like the taste of national political power. If Mr de Klerk wins Potchefstroom, he can claim to be white South Africa's undisputed leader; if he loses, he can press the ANC for help. He could end up winning, either way.</p>

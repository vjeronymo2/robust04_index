			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCAPE OF YOUTH WHO HURLED CONCRETE IS INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Authorities are searching for a teen-age boy -- convicted last year of throwing  a chunk of concrete from a freeway overpass and severely injuring a motorist --  who escaped from a minimum-security juvenile facility, reportedly with the help  of his mother, who was under court order not to see him.  </P> <P> But the mother, interviewed by a San Diego television station, said she doesn't  know the whereabouts of her son, even though she talks with him from "time to  time." She also said the youth had been mistreated at the facility.  </P> <P> "He's cold. He's tired. He's hungry. He was getting beat up out there," Sharon  Hendricks told TV station KFMB (Channel 8) in a brief interview about the  disappearance of her 16-year-old son, Lance Hough. Speaking from behind a  screen door, Hendricks, who lives in Golden Hill, said she wants her son "to  get a fair trial."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Word of Mouth'  </P> <P> Carlos Armour, chief of the juvenile division for the San Diego County district  attorney's office, said the office is investigating whether Hendricks is  involved in the escape.  </P> <P> "All we have is word of mouth," he said, adding that the escape was not  reported until a few days later.  </P> <P> The escape was "not an unusual occurrence," Armour said. "It happens a lot.  It's probably a daily occurrence, but this is a notorious case."  </P> <P> The escape brought harsh words from the brother of Kurt Meyering, the  24-year-old aspiring model who was injured. Meyering was sitting in the  passenger seat of his girlfriend's newly purchased Corvette on Feb. 29, 1988,  when a 6-pound chunk of concrete crashed through the sunroof as the couple were  about to pass under the Pershing Drive overpass on Interstate 5.  </P> <P> Meyering, who was in a coma for three months, underwent rehabilitation but has  not regained his full mental capacity. He lives with his parents in Wenatchee,  Wash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Predictable'  </P> <P> Meyering's brother, Ralph, said Thursday that Hough's escape "was very  predictable. This only goes to prove what we were trying to tell the judge a  long time ago: This kid has got some serious problems. . . . I pray to God  nobody else gets hurt. Nobody should have to go through what my family went  through.  </P> <P> "It's like a bad movie, and the judge wrote the script," he said.  </P> <P> Hough escaped Feb. 19 from the St. John's School for Boys in Whitewater, near  Palm Springs. According to authorities, an arrest order has been issued for the  youth, who was convicted of three counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Also  convicted for taking part in the incident was a 13-year-old boy.  </P> <P> Hough was sent to the Southwood Psychiatric Residential Treatment Center in  Chula Vista before being transferred to the residential school, said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Robert O. Amador, who prosecuted the case.  </P> <P> Hendricks, who was barred by Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Kapiloff from seeing  her son until she completed psychological treatment, was accidentally permitted  by a probation officer to visit him Feb. 19 at St. John's, said Doug  Willingham, deputy chief probation officer in charge of juvenile services in  San Diego.  </P> <P> "The mother was not supposed to have contact with her son until she went into  therapy with the boy," Willingham said, but a probation officer missed the  judge's order and failed to notify the school about the restriction. Officials  from the school declined to comment on the escape.  </P> <P> The mistake was made by a probation officer who "deals with thousands of court  orders a month," Willingham said. "He missed that one item, and (Hough)  happened to be a newsworthy kid. . . . Those things happen.  </P> <P> "It's not the facility's fault. They were doing as they were supposed to do."  Parental visits to the school are supervised, he said.  </P> <P> Willingham, who also said such escapes occur daily, downplayed Hough's  disappearance.  </P> <P> "He was in an open setting. This is not the great jail escape. Every day  someone AWOLs. There are over 300 juveniles from San Diego County in 50 open  private facilities," he said.  </P> <P> Willingham said Hough was undergoing treatment by a psychiatrist and was  participating in a group program at the school. He said the boy was "doing  fine," before his escape.  </P> <P> "He was there a short time, but he was quite treatable and making progress," he  said.  </P></p>

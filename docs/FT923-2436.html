			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: World of Leather edges up to Pounds 94,000 World of Leather, the USM-quoted furniture retailer, saw profits of Pounds 94,000 pre-tax for the six months to June 30. The increase from the comparable Pounds 41,000 was achieved despite turnover falling to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 13m) reflecting the closure of two stores last year; turnover on a like-for-like basis showed a marginal improvement, the company said. Earnings per share rose from 0.5p to 1.2p. There is no interim dividend; the last distribution to shareholders was a final of 0.8p in 1989.</p>

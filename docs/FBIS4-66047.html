			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Luisa Palma report: "PSOE Deems Integration Promoted by </F> Gonzalez To Have Failed"]    [Text] Madrid -- The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers  Party] remains divided into two, and the integration promoted  since the 33d PSOE Federal Congress has not worked. The balance  of forces between Guerraists and renewalists is virtually the  same as before, and Alfonso Guerra currently controls 42 percent  of the party, while the renewalists hold 58 percent.    This balance is also apparent in the makeup of the Federal  Committee, which will be completed with the holding in the  summer of the three remaining regional congresses -- the Canary  Islands, La Rioja, and Navarre -- although these federations'  results are not decisive as far as the distribution of forces is  concerned.  <H5>  Ignored </H5>   So the failure of integration is one of the main conclusions  that have been reached following the holding of the PSOE  provincial and regional congresses. Renewalists and Guerraists  have ignored the "integration efforts" made by Organization  Secretary Cipria Ciscar, who has done his utmost to achieve this  aim with his interventions in the federations.    The process of the regional and provincial congresses shows  that Guerra dominates six federations -- Galicia, Murcia,  Cantabria, Aragon, Extremadura, and Asturias -- while the  renewalists have achieved ascendancy in the Balearics,  Castilla-Leon, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, and Andalusia.  Nevertheless, the last-mentioned federation -- the PSOE's  largest and most important -- is divided into two, as is the  case in Madrid. Strictly speaking, integration has really  worked only in Valencia and the Basque Country.    The three remaining provinces -- La Rioja, Navarre, and the  Canary Islands --will have to be added to the renewalists'  tally. The members of the Federal Committee, on which Alfonso  Guerra has succeeded in "narrowing the gap" in the balance of  forces to a substantial extent, have also been selected in this  process.  <H5>  Lists Committee </H5>   This fact assumes particular importance as regards the  future, since it is the Federal Committee that will have to  approve the lists committee that will designate candidates for  the 1995 municipal and autonomous community elections, as well  as the pacts policy to be followed by the PSOE.    All this makes it clear that the division in the PSOE still  exists in a ratio that is virtually the same as that estimated  before the 33d congress, at which the renewalists' aim of  crushing the Guerraists was not achieved. The integration  advocated by Gonzalez has come to nothing, and the trial of  strength between the two sectors still exists.    The Guerraists are satisfied at having succeeded in "holding  on to 42 percent," while the renewalists, although emphasizing  the victory of holding the majority in the party, criticize  themselves somewhat for having been unable to reduce their  rivals to a minority.</p>

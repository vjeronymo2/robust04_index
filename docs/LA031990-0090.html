			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBIN HARRIS, 36; COMEDIAN ON THE RISE  </P> <P> Robin Harris, the rotund comedian known locally for his pillorying of famous  blacks and nationally as Sweet Dick Willie in the movie "Do the Right Thing,"  has died in Chicago.  </P> <P> His manager, Bill Gross, said his friend and client had completed a performance  before a sold-out crowd of 2,400 at Chicago's Regal Theater on Saturday night,  returned to his room at the Four Seasons Hotel, and was found dead in bed  sometime later.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said Sunday a cause  of death had not been determined pending an autopsy today.  </P> <P> Harris, 36, seemed poised for a major breakthrough in his career.  </P> <P> A Times article last August had called him "one of the unheralded pleasures of  the black community. . . ."  </P> <P> He was then emceeing a lineup of comedians at the Comedy Act Theater on 43rd  Street in Los Angeles' Crenshaw District.  </P> <P> To that club came members of the Lakers basketball team after home games,  former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and various black film and TV stars.  </P> <P> All were treated with equal irreverence by Harris.  </P> <P> He was a little-known presence outside the black community when Spike Lee cast  him as Sweet Dick Willie last year. The character was part of the modern-day  Greek Chorus in "Do the Right Thing" that provided a street-smart philosophical  underpinning to the film's biting commentary about white and black  relationships.  </P> <P> Willie was the memorable braggart among the three black men hanging about on a  street corner ("Mike Tyson ain't nothin'. If I fought Tyson I'd drop him like a  bad habit.")  </P> <P> His success in that role placed him in Lee's next film, "Love Supreme," and in  Lee's "Variations on the Mo' Bettah Blues," which is yet to be released.  </P> <P> He also was featured in the recently released film "House Party," Eddie  Murphy's "Harlem Nights" and had cut a comedy album. And he was being courted  by several television producers.  </P> <P> But it was at the Comedy Act Theater that he had become likened to a black Don  Rickles, commenting on customers' wearing apparel ("Like that suit, brother. It  might come back in style."), their trips to the restroom, or on his  conversation with a white cop who stopped him one night ("You got a gun in the  car?" Harris said the cop asked, to which he replied, "No, it's home with the  dope.")  </P> <P> Harris prided himself on maintaining his roots. He rode the bus around town and  frequently stopped to chat with people on the street.  </P> <P> "I don't want to get out of touch with buddies," he said last year as his  successes mounted.  </P> <P> Harris was born in Chicago and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was 8.  Here, he said, he was encouraged to follow his dreams.  </P> <P> Although he weighed more than 200 pounds at his death, Harris once ran a 4:18  mile and went to Ottawa University in Kansas on a track scholarship after  graduating from Manual Arts High School.  </P> <P> He came back to Los Angeles, worked a series of odd jobs and then gradually  realized that what he did best was make people laugh. ("I may have had a  two-bit job at the bank, but everybody wanted to sit with me at lunch.")  </P> <P> He played a series of Los Angeles nightclubs before Lee and others helped make  him a part of the national comedy scene.  </P> <P> Lee said he gave Harris a lot of latitude in his role as Sweet Dick Willie. "I  couldn't write that character as funny as Robin could," said Lee.  </P> <P> Survivors include his wife, Exetta, a son, his parents and a brother and  sister.  </P></p>

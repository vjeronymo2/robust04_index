			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARSENIO HALL  </P> <P> Patti LaBelle gave Arsenio Hall the best advice he'll probably ever hear. By  Hall's being himself we are rewarded with a host who is sincere, interested in  his guests, fun and, best of all, funny. Where I live we receive one channel.  I'm grateful it happens to be the one that carries "The Arsenio Hall Show."  </P> <P> JILL BROUILLARD  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

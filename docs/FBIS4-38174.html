			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel has offered Jordan open meetings that will be  held in Israel and Jordan alternatively, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin told the members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee today. He believes that the negotiations will  begin in July. Speaking on the Syrian issue, the prime minister  said that the secretary of state will arrive in the region in  mid-July on a shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem.  The gaps with the Syrians have not been narrowed and, until the  Syrians launch a serious dialogue with us, there will be no  progress. Our correspondent at the Knesset Tamar Asalem reports:    [Begin recording] [Asalem] At present, there are serious  doubts regarding Jordan's willingness to sign a separate peace  agreement with us, Rabin said. At the same time, we have  reached an understanding that the tripartite framework -- the  United States, Jordan, and Israel -- should be employed on  economic issues. The talks aim at creating a reality of  dialogue in the region, even if a peace agreement is not signed  and only economic and civilian agreements are attained. Rabin  also disclosed that Israel had offered Jordan the holding of  open meetings in Israel and Jordan alternatively. In the first  stage, Jordan wants to find a spot in the 'Arava, near the  disputed areas, and also demands that talks be held in air  conditioned mobile homes. The prime minister believes that  these negotiations will begin in July.    Regarding the Syrian issue, the prime minister said that  U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher will shuttle between  Damascus and Jerusalem in mid-July. The United States will not  make offers, and we are not interested in them doing so. The  Americans may relay stands but, until the Syrians begin a more  serious dialogue, there will be no progress.    Knesset Member Binyamin Netanyahu said that he believes the  Syrians are growing weak in several spheres, including the  military. Rabin responded to that by saying: Where did you hear  this joke? Netanyahu showed the committee a document drafted by  the Foreign Ministry's Political Planning Department regarding  the negotiations with Syria.    [Netanyahu] The document, drafted by the Foreign Ministry's  professional echelons, says: The negotiations with Syria should  be conducted with a cool mind, no haste, and patience. The  prime minister is doing the opposite: He is impatient, rushes  forward, and is nervous. In fact, he seems to be panicking with  real or imaginary fear of the next war.    [Asalem] The prime minister said that it seems to him that  the party most concerned with his declaration regarding a  possible war with Syria -- is Syria. According to him, he does  not remember such a vast amount of weapons, some of which are  the most advanced, arriving in Syria since the end of 1993.  Coming out of the committee room, Rabin added that this is part  of the overall Middle East arms race.    [Rabin] All the Middle East countries are increasing their  military power. Egypt, which lives in peace with us, is  increasing and upgrading its military ability. So are Saudi  Arabia, Israel, and Syria. The current reality is that there is  an arms race in the Middle East. [end recording]    The prime minister also told the committee members that  Israel has already established an authority for handling and  rehabilitating Palestinians collaborators. He added that large  amounts of money have been allocated for the authority, and  former Major General Shlomo Gazit has been appointed to head it.</p>

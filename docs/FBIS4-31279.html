			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Grzegorz W. Kolodko under the </F> "Answers and Questions" rubric: "Situation Used To Be Worse"]    [Text] As it is opening up to the world, Poland is  proceeding on its road to democracy, to a social market economy,  and to the free enterprise of sectors with equal rights. To  strengthen this process, we now need a strategic concept of  long-term economic development. We have lacked such a concept  for years; the economic policy, especially the financial policy,  which was supposed to resolve only short-term problems, in fact  resolved only some problems, while at the same time creating new  ones. Today these problems are stacking up so much that we need  a new complex approach. Otherwise, the achievements of the  transformation made so far will be seriously jeopardized.    One might pretend that it is still possible to increase  unemployment or the internal public debt, that all foreign  credit can easily be accepted, and that the present system of  social insurances does not have to be changed. It might be  assumed that economic growth will be maintained without  reinforcing the people's tendency to save money, that simply  giving state property to people is the road to an  efficiency-oriented privatization, that there are not very many  poor people, and that all the rich people are doing nothing but  trying to get hold of the finance minister to pay him their  taxes. Things were and still are different from that. This is  why we need an active economic and social policy that would  provide a foundation for the creative work that will have to be  done by all of us. The directions of this policy are presented  in the Strategy for Poland, which will find its way to the Sejm  this week.    We are entering a new phase of transformations. Its main  characteristics are: lowering the social costs of the reforms,  adding dynamism to the economy, and effecting systemic  stabilization. An economic strategy is also necessary to make  the growth trends lasting and balanced. To achieve this, it is  indispensable to lengthen the period during which the economic  policy is carried out. Transforming work relationships,  reforming the social insurance system, mobilizing the country's  savings, granting equal rights to all ownership sectors,  establishing a higher level of international competitiveness,  improving the security of the economic turnover--these are the  key elements of such a strategy. It stresses the establishment  and development of institutions supporting a modern and  functional market economy. So far we have reached a paradoxical  situation in which public opinion places greater trust in  "Solidarity '80" and "Self-Defense" than... in private banks.    The people feel lost. This is because the reality is  changing from the vision that appeared five years ago. The  people still do not have a clear picture of their future and do  not know the path that leads to it. Statements concerning the  lack of a so-called third road (actually, there are more than a  dozen) suggest only a sharp alternative: either a return to the  rejected past or simple continuation, ostensibly leading to  capitalism at the cost of humility and subordination to the  wisdom of those who call the shots in both politics and finance.  Therefore, the people need an even more credible strategy of  development over a longer period. When one wants to resolve  problems that have piled up over generations, he cannot rely on  short-term programs. The lack of a strategic approach in the  past is one of the reasons for the current difficulties.    However, the people, who have for some time now been most  frequently called "the electorate," which should make them  protest, can make evaluations. Exactly five years ago they  proved this in the elections, which, along with the results of  the Roundtable, gave rise to a new stage in history. It seems  that we were able to draw the right conclusions from that--not  only in Poland. We should bear in mind, however, that  government policies have already been evaluated several times  since that breakthrough--in the following elections. Such a  perception of the Polish process of transformations will  probably be seen in the coming self-government elections as  well. This is what this means, particularly in the context of  economic and social policies:    First, it proves a lack of approval for the method of  transforming the economy, the excessive costs of this process,  and the distribution of these costs. One cannot try to persuade  oneself and others that social dissatisfaction is caused by a  wrong perception of the people, who cannot see that the  situation is already better. Even if that were the case, what  counts here is the state of social awareness, and it cannot be  underestimated. The conviction that the situation has  deteriorated emerges in this awareness only now, which is a  clear delay. In other words, even though the real incomes and  the level of consumption have been on the increase recently, the  people are still comparing their living standards over a longer  period. It is with a certain delay that they respond to the  deterioration or improvement of those standards.    Second, the process of transformations is accompanied by an  enormous redistribution of incomes and reserves. For most people  this means poverty, for the minority--wealth. However, everyone  is complaining, including the greatest material beneficiaries of  the transformations. Recently only 7 percent of the people have  admitted that their material situation has improved over the  past year, whereas more than 50 percent claim that it is worse  than it used to be. Material and social facts, unlike pieces of  bad luck, do not happen at the same time.    Third, the state of dissatisfaction is caused by comparing  reality with excessively aroused expectations. Today it turns  out that even considerable economic growth--close to 10 percent  in 1993 and 1994--and good prospects for the future are not only  unable to offset the nearly 20-percent decrease in the GDP  between 1989 and 1991 but also unable to wipe out the bad  impression that was given by false declarations concerning the  prospect of growth after only a six-month recession, or by empty  promises, made several times, about lowering monthly inflation  to less than 1 percent. The authors of these irresponsible  declarations pretend that they have not been made at all;  however, the people have not forgotten them. One cannot forget  that, between September 1989 and September 1993, prices  increased 40 times, and particularly that enormous  redistribution was made by mechanisms that have still not been  accepted and that for many people are not even understandable.  Only now have we been able to make a decision on decreasing the  face value of the Polish zloty at the beginning of next year.  This is an expression of the conviction that we will not swerve  from the path of lowering inflation.    The view that in the transformations made so far it was  possible to achieve more at a smaller cost no longer raises any  serious doubts among independent observers and experts. The  argument that in some other countries of the region the  situation is worse than in Poland does not change either this  evaluation or the conclusions resulting from it. If somewhere  else the situation is worse, it is because the conditions are  and were different there, and primarily because even more  mistakes were made there, which is not a great comfort for us.  Frankly, I do not fully understand why those who should be  praised for their achievements and criticized for their mistakes  keep rejecting this obvious conclusion. One must go hand in  hand with the other, also in the future. Subjecting oneself to  constructive criticism is an indispensable condition that offers  a chance to avoid some potential mistakes in the future. I  would like my presence on the hospitable pages of POLITYKA to  serve this purpose.</p>

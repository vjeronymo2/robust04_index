			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Water chief departs abruptly NORTH West Water yesterday surprised the market with the abrupt departure of its chief executive, Mr Bob Thian. The privatised water utility said Mr Thian had left the company over a 'difference in management styles' between the chief executive and the board. The shares fell 12p to 527p. It is widely believed that the relationship between Mr Thian and the recently appointed chairman Sir Desmond Pitcher was particularly strained. Sir Desmond is described as a hands-on manager who likes to take control. This is believed to have caused some friction with the equally hands-on Mr Thian. Associates who had been in close contact with the two men in recent weeks said it was obvious that the relationship was under considerable pressure. Mr Thian's aggressive management style is also believed to have alienated a number of the company's non-executives. Matters came to a head on Friday. Mr Thian - who had only on Thursday been planning publicity meetings this week in advance of the interim results on December 9 - left suddenly after a meeting with Sir Desmond. Mr Thian, who joined North West in January 1990, was the architect of the utility's international water and waste water business. The group has this year won more international water and waste water contracts than any other UK utility. Since privatisation North West has spent Pounds 160m in building an environmental engineering division, and a process equipment and instrumentation business based in the US. It is likely that Mr Thian's pay-off will be substantial. He was on a three-year rolling contract, with annual remuneration of Pounds 284,000. He also had options on 235,500 shares. Sir Desmond will assume Mr Thian's responsibilities until a replacement is announced. Speculation has centred on Mr Derek Green, managing director of the core utility operation, as a possible candidate. The finance director, Mr Bob Ferguson, will take control of the international and non-regulated businesses. The company reassured investors that the interim profits would be in line with expectations. Analysts are forecasting about Pounds 135m pre-tax, against Pounds 131m, and a dividend rise of 7.3 per cent to 7.65p.</p>

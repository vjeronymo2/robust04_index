			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Angel Iraheta] </F>   [Text] Shafik Handal, FMLN general coordinator, has denied  categorically that the attack on Deputy Marta Valladares [name  as heard], who is better known as Nidia Diaz, was perpetrated by  members of this political institution. Handal said that despite  differing ideas within the FMLN, this violent act was not  carried out by FMLN members. He, however, did not rule out that  it was politically motivated:    [Begin Handal recording] I rule that out totally and  absolutely. It was a dirty maneuver to cover up impunity, to  keep impunity alive. I rule that out completely. My arguments  are: one, we know each other in the FMLN. We know that an  action of this sort is morally impossible. Second, this is a  repeat of a similar operation. Thus, since then it has been  clear that this is a typical case of a politically motivated  action. This is among the cases that the Joint Group is  handling. I reject that totally and absolutely. I even reject  that this could happen among us at any time. [end recording]    Handal added that this morning's action, which left a member  of Nidia Diaz' security team injured, is part of the political  situation facing the country at present:    [Begin Handal recording] Second, I must stress that  companera  Nidia Diaz, as a deputy, is currently chairing the Legislative  Assembly Justice and Human Rights Committee. At this time the  Legislative Assembly is concluding debate on the elimination of  secret presidency expenses and is about to start debating the  problem of exemptions granted to deputies in order to start  cleaning up their (?image). This is something that focuses our  attention.    Another thing that focuses attention is that this act was  perpetrated at a time when there is an ongoing debate within the  FMLN. There is a debate within the FMLN. These are, I think,  the first things that must be taken into account. I have little  doubt, although one must always leave room for doubt, that this  is politically motivated.    In fact, speaking about the other crimes committed since the  latter part of 1993, since the latter half of 1993.... [pauses]  that is, if we link this to the kind of campaign carried out by  the right wing during the electoral campaign, I would conclude  that all this was related.... [pauses] that there was a message  in all that. The message is: Look, we can still kill! We have  the means to do so; we can do so, and impunity still reigns in  this country. [end recording]    The politician pointed out that no current investigation  into  politically motivated crimes has yet produced positive results.  Handal added that as long as perpetrators are protected, the  country will not be able to overcome impunity.</p>

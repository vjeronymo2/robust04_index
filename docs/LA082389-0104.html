			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH POLICE UNION'S LEADER SUPPORTS CITY COUNCIL'S CHOICE FOR CHIEF  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach police officers' union Tuesday said Police Chief-designate  Ronald E. Lowenberg will be an "excellent representative" of the 213-member  force.  </P> <P> "We're going to serve our chief 100%," said Sgt. Bill Martin, president of the  Huntington Beach Police Officers Assn.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach City Council on Monday night named Lowenberg its new top  law enforcement officer after a national search. He was one of three finalists  vying for the $80,000-a-year job.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Assume Post Sept. 25  </P> <P> Martin called Lowenberg, now chief of police in Cypress, a good leader and  teacher of law enforcement. Lowenberg, 43, will assume his new post Sept. 25.  </P> <P> Although the council took more than two hours to approve the choice of City  Administrator Paul Cook behind closed doors, the vote was unanimous, Mayor Wes  Bannister said.  </P> <P> "He was good in the interviews, and he's committed to police work," Bannister  said Tuesday. "And he's not eligible for retirement for eight years. We might  actually keep him for more than two."  </P> <P> Lowenberg will succeed Grover (Bill) Payne, who retired Aug. 4 after two years  as chief.  </P> <P> Bannister said Lowenberg, president of the county police chiefs' association,  said he is active with state law enforcement groups and will add visibility to  the department.  </P> <P> Before the selection, Martin criticized the job-selection process as too fast  and said Cook's refusal to hear suggestions from rank-and-file members of the  department tarnished the relationship between the union and the city.  </P> <P> But Martin said all that is behind them for now. "I'm optimistic," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Transition Ahead  </P> <P> Lowenberg, who acknowledged Monday night that he will have to make a transition  from a smaller city to a larger one, described himself as a "high-energy  communicator" who can quickly get to know the operation.  </P> <P> Martin said the new chief faces a lot of challenges.  </P> <P> "What lies before him is getting the department heading toward one goal," he  said.  </P></p>

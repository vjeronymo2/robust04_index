			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The constitutive assembly of the federal  Bosnia-Herzegovina today proclaimed the Constitution of the  Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is to come into effect  at 2400 this evening. Zdenko Vranjes reporting from Sarajevo:    [Begin recording] [Vranjes] It is worth mentioning that all  deputies of the Croat and the Bosniak nations voted for the  draft Constitution signed in Washington. The Constitution was  proclaimed at 1710 this afternoon. [passage omitted]    Here is what Kresimir Zubak, the president of the  Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna,  stated following the adoption of the Constitution of the  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina:    [Zubak] As far as we, the Croat deputies, are concerned,  this  was a formal act, an act of formal recognition of what we had  confirmed by our signature.    [Vranjes] General Ante Roso, the HVO [Croatian Defense  Council] chief of the General Staff, stated the following:    [Roso] I have been a soldier, and I am going to remain one.  It is certain that a new situation has been created by the  adoption of this legal document. New conditions have been  created. One of the bases of this document is the restoration  of peace in this area. We, Croats, are ready to restore peace in  a consistent and dignified way. It is beyond any doubt that  this is a great event for our people, for our people of  Herceg-Bosna and for the people of Bosnia in general. I hope  that the Bosniak people also welcome this offer.    Morale among the people has changed somewhat. People's  behavior has also changed. It had been very difficult to  believe this would happen just a few days ago. [passage omitted]  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> NUCLEAR FACILITY BLAST DANGER PROBED  </P> <P> Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) said he wants a new Energy Department safety oversight  board to review the possibility that tanks holding radioactive and chemical  waste at the Hanford nuclear reservation could explode. A 1984 report concluded  the tanks at the reservation in south-central Washington state could explode  and scatter radioactivity. A follow-up report, however, essentially dismissed  the danger of explosion, according to the lab that prepared both reports.  </P></p>

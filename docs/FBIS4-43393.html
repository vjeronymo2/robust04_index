			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Walter Veltroni: "Important Choices in Stormy </F> Years"]    [Text] [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary]  Achille Occhetto's resignation is similar to his work over the  years. There is the same generosity and the same impetuosity,  without which the PDS would never have been born. Achille  Occhetto is certainly no conservative, either in politics or in  his life. Nor has he ever been attached to power. He likes  pure politics, he likes to challenge conservatism of every kind.  This cultural, even more than political, attitude has enabled  him to make difficult choices at the right time. To look back  now over the years of his secretaryship causes a feeling of  seasickness, inasmuch as the waves were high and the navigation  difficult. And yet at times of great difficulty Achille  Occhetto succeeded in making the right choice. Some examples?  The response to the bloodthirsty events of Tienanmen, the  decision to "remain within" the institutional referenda, and  support for the Ciampi government. Indeed, he has never lacked  that rare gift in politics, courage, the willingness to take  personal risks. As he did in November 1989 when he took prime  responsibility for a task of political innovation that would  have frightened anyone -- the transformation of the PCI [Italian  Communist Party] and the building of the PDS. Occhetto and his  youthful leadership group in Rome and throughout Italy devoted  their best energies to that task. The fact that there is now a  strong left-wing force is due to that courageous choice. And in  subsequent years Occhetto acted on the basis of a correct  motivation -- to build a modern Left capable of uniting and  capable of governing. The course that was pursued was not  always straight; the fact that there is now a strong left-wing  force is due to that courageous choice. And in subsequent years  Occhetto acted on the basis of the right motivation -- to build  a modern Left capable of uniting and capable of governing. The  course that was pursued was not always straight; there were  errors and delays. But it was the right course, in a rough sea.  And major successes were scored on the basis of that motivation  -- in the 1989 European elections, the referenda, the municipal  elections. The last two elections, however, have revealed a  major difficulty within the Left, an inability to interpret the  demands for change and innovation.    Of course, not all the responsibility lies with Occhetto.  Nevertheless the PDS secretary has decided to facilitate the  innovation of his party and of the Left with his gesture. But  the main issue is not leadership. There are other more  difficult, and certainly more worrying problems. For instance,  how to initiate a process of genuine policy innovation, based on  the ability to identify the major options of "innovation" on  which to challenge the Right. I would cite, for instance,  working hours and related issues, federalism, the regulations  governing the media, and the strategic option for the so-called  "information highways." Convergence must be developed between a  government of the Left and a democratic Catholic center that  must individually seek possible understandings on legislation  and policy. The language and political forms of the Left must  be rebuilt. The party must be reshaped, with a new and strong  organizational network capable of inventing new forums for  politics, new centers where citizens can gather according to  their interests and professions. Finally, we must carry out our  opposition to the right-wing government tactically -- not  filibustering to prevent it from governing, but rather waging  tough battle on issues and principles placed on the agenda by  the progressive forces. That is no small matter. But it is  urgently necessary, right away. If we want to grant the  supporters of the Left and of the progressive forces new pride  in their support and a new desire to win. Come what may,  Achille Occhetto will contribute to this quest.    This is a "difficult time" for me; there are ties that bind  people who have lived through the same experiences and the same  political situations. These ties are created by days spent  together, difficult moments, disappointments, enthusiasms,  difficult tests, and courageous decisions. Disputes and  solidarity. Ties that are not easily broken.</p>

Ryzkov, former  prime minister of the now defunct Soviet Union, arrived in  Taipei Friday [27 May] for a week-long visit.    Ryzkov, accompanied by his wife and a six-member party, is  here at the invitation of the Republic of China [ROC] &amp;  Russia  International Association for Humanitarian Dialogue.    Cheng Po-chiu, West Asian affairs director of the Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs, officially greeted the Ryzkov delegation at  Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.    Ryzkov, 65, who was first elected as secretary-general of  the  Soviet Communist Party by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 before being  elevated to the post of prime minister, resigned in 1990 after  objecting to the 500-day economic reform program launched by the  Soviet Government.    During his stay here, Ryzkov will call on President Li  Teng-hui, Premier Lien Chan, and Foreign Affairs Minister Chien  Fu. He will also deliver a speech at the Legislative Yuan and  hold seminars with local business leaders.</p>

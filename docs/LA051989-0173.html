			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN VOICES SHOCK OVER EFFORTS TO CHANGE FSX PACT  </P> <P> Japan's defense chief expressed shock today over efforts in the U.S. Congress  to amend the FSX jet fighter agreement approved last month by President Bush  and called on Bush to veto any changes adopted by Congress.  </P> <P> The U.S. Senate attached amendments to the agreement that would require Japan  to give the United States 40% of the production contracts on the plane and  restrict Japanese use of U.S. technology.  </P> <P> The FSX agreement is being debated in the House. Bush Administration officials  said Thursday that putting new conditions on the agreement could result in  Japan's breaking off the deal.  </P> <P> "It would be best if President Bush would veto any amendments," Defense Agency  Director Kichiro Tazawa said at a news conference.  </P> <P> Tazawa said he was shocked that Congress even suggested changing the agreement.  </P> <P> "Japan maintains continuity in observing international agreements," Tazawa  said, implying that the United States does not.  </P> <P> A Defense Agency spokesman said he could not comment on whether the amendments  would cause Japan to break the agreement.  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Beales Hunter shows 5% advance to Pounds 1.43m Despite a lower contribution from its textiles side, Beales Hunter increased pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.43m in the half year to November 30. Sales grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 27m. At the operating level, profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.6m, including Pounds 20,000 from two businesses acquired during the year. Higher interest of Pounds 173,000 (Pounds 53,000) reflected the cost of these acquisitions. Earnings per share edged ahead from 10.4p to 10.6p, while the interim dividend is stepped up to 2.55p (2.45p). The refrigeration division - including new subsidiary JT Herbert - increased sales and profits. Obtaining installation business remained difficult, but order levels continued to improve. The electrical side also showed an improvement, mainly as a result of demand for non-rewirable plugs. Some recovery was also seen in sales of traditional plugs, sockets and connectors to consumer product manufacturers. Textile results continued to be affected by low margins. Beales said that at the present levels of profitability, the division still required a substantial volume increase to produce an acceptable level of return.</p>

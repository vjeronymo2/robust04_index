			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Ruling power Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, is due to decide the future of the two generating companies by the middle of this month. He has threatened to send them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if they do not agree to curbs on their power to move electricity prices. Since the issues are complex and the companies have yet to agree to anything at all, time is short. Professor Littlechild may have to choose between carrying out his threat, imposing a solution or backing down. The companies may be forced to reduce their market share by selling plant, so encouraging other competitors, or to accept price limits in the spot electricity 'pool'. Yet price controls run counter both to government policy and the regulator's instincts, while small-scale plant sales may be insufficient to introduce effective competition. Almost all the marginal plant, which only operates part time and sets the price, is owned by National Power or PowerGen. If they were to sell it, the new owner would be tempted to run it full time to earn cash and thereby push some of the generators' more efficient plants into the marginal category, leaving the duopoly continuing to set the price. National Power and PowerGen may also not be prepared to sell power stations at the low price a part-time plant would command if they suspected that they would subsequently be run full time. Professor Littlechild is unlikely to be able to agree anything but the weakest bromide on plant disposals in time. Voluntary price controls are more feasible, though they would have to be presented as a temporary restraint imposed while a fully competitive market bedded in. The stock market is assuming that this is the worst the companies will face. Yet judging by the generators' strong share price performance recently, investors may be too sanguine. A price cap may hurt profits more than expected, and arm-twisting to sell plant could be severe. National Power and PowerGen have plenty of pockets of hidden value stored up against such a rainy day, but some of those may soon be sealed. Both generators, but particularly National Power, have made very large provisions against liabilities, which could be added back to profits if they are not needed. Yet the Accounting Standards Board may soon limit companies' ability to flatter profits in this way. The acres of land around disused power stations may also have limited value, given the environmental liabilities they carry. Steady erosion of the generators' market share will also hurt earnings. That particularly affects National Power, which is likely to cede share more rapidly than PowerGen. Against that, the high level of dividend cover is usually cited as a defence. National Power's cover is already lower than PowerGen's, emphasising the difference in growth prospects. Even without a Monopolies reference, by 1996 National Power may be selling no more than 25 per cent more electricity than its smaller brother. Assuming similar margins, that might imply a market value no more than 25 per cent higher. National Power has lagged recently in share price terms but its market worth is still 45 per cent larger than that of PowerGen. The adjustment may have further to go.</p>

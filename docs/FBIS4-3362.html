			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 April, State Councillor Chen Junsheng made an  inspection tour of our province's Nanle County to acquaint  himself with the details of preparatory work for spring plowing  and cotton production this year. Chen Junsheng and his party  came to Zhengguocheng and Gujinlou Townships in Nanle County to  have cordial discussions with local cadres and the masses on the  farms and the edges of the fields. He asked them in detail  about local cotton production over the past two years, the  acreage under cotton this year, and also the situation regarding  preparatory work for sowing.    Chen Junsheng and his party also visited peasant households,  asking peasants what they needed from the government with regard  to cotton production. In the county's cotton and linen company,  Chen Junsheng inquired in detail about the preparation and  supplies of chemical fertilizer, farm chemicals, and so on.    On the morning of 9 April, Chen Junsheng, responsible  comrades from the relevant departments directly under the  provincial authorities, and relevant leaders of Puyang City and  Nanle County listened to a report on our province's agricultural  and rural economic work. Chen fully affirmed the efforts made  by the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the whole  province to promote cotton production.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: The situation in Henan Province  this year is favorable as a whole. The production output of  cotton and tobacco has fallen but that of grain and oil crops  has risen. Peasant incomes have also increased by a fairly big  margin. However, we must not be too optimistic about the  situation in cotton and grain production this year. Chen  Junsheng stressed: Agriculture is the foundation of our national  economy. People's livelihoods must be protected and we must  provide them with food and clothing. Both of these are very  important. The main problems in grain production are that large  areas of the grain farms have been affected by drought and rice  seedlings are not growing well [words indistinct]. The problem  with cotton is the most serious this year. Provincial, city,  and county governments have done a lot of work and made great  efforts to deal with this problem. At present, what is most  important is that we must ensure sufficient acreage under  cotton. This year Henan must plant 14 million mu of cotton and  strive for 15 million mu. We must firmly grasp preparatory work  for sowing cotton and ensure sufficient supply of improved  varieties of cotton and various kinds of agricultural means of  production. We must not miss the farming season. We must do  well various kinds of farm management work well and, in  particular, we must properly grasp the work of preventing plant  diseases and insects to strive for a good cotton harvest this  year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current application for APO requires that an attorney assume responsibility for a non-legal ``other representative'' if an attorney has been retained to represent a party to the proceeding. The proposed modification will allow a party greater flexibility in its choice of representation and would allow a party to hire a second representative, an economic consultant or ``other representative,'' separate from a law firm. In addition, the ITA will only allow a non-legal representative access to proprietary information if that representative has a relatively active practice before the ITA, so that barring practice before the ITA is an effective sanction in the event the representative abuses the APO system. In this circumstance, the ITA will consider the non-attorney applicant's established practice before the ITA and proven reliability before granting the requested APO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Word Processing Duplication of APO Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed APO application (Item 2) allows the applicant to produce page 1, and the names of the representatives and their affiliations (Items 29 and 30) on a word processing system to facilitate the application process. To prevent unauthorized alteration of the content of the substantive requirements contained in the application, the main body of the application may only be photocopied by the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties have requested that the ITA consider allowing the entire application to be reproduced on the applicant's word processing system to facilitate the application process. Based on prior practice we do not find this acceptable because of the possibility of an inadvertent error in the preparation of the application by the applicant, and because ITA would be required to review every application to ensure it was consistent with the standard form. In the past the ITA allowed applicants to submit versions of the ITA's applications that had been prepared on the applicants' own word processing system, and at times found that applicants made significant changes. The increased review time made it difficult for the ITA to issue APOs in a timely fashion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address the concerns of the Bar Committee's request, however, we have revised the format of the application containing the terms and conditions of disclosure, and are proposing that the sections of the application that require typing from the representatives be reproduced on the applicants' word processing system. Page 1 of the application identifies the case and the segment of the proceeding in which access to proprietary data is being sought. It also identifies the request as the original application or an amended request. Items 29 and 30 require the applicant's name, signature, date of application, firm, and the identification of admission to a bar or court if an attorney, and any professional associations for a non-attorney ``other representative''. The main body of the application, however, may only be photocopied by the applicant. In continuing to require that the main portion of the application be photocopied only, and allowing page 1, and Items 29 and 30 to be reproduced on a word processing system, the ITA will limit the time necessary for administrative review, and also facilitate the application process for the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative is to permit a representative to reproduce the entire form on its word processing equipment, but certify that it is identical to the ITA standard form, and agree that any if there are any discrepancies, the parties are bound by the standard form. We invite comments on these proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Time Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ITA is searching for a practice that will reduce the number of untimely applications. In accordance with the current regulations, the present application sets forth strict deadlines. Timeliness in submitting an application for APO continues to be a major issue of concern for the ITA and the applicant. The ITA does not wish to impair a party's ability to fully represent its client. The ITA, however, must impose an application deadline in order to properly administer the APO function, and the earlier in the proceeding, the more efficient the process for the ITA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed application changes the deadline as set forth in 19 CFR 353.34(b) or 355.34(b) to require that the application be filed with the first written submission made by a party after it has retained a representative, but in no event later than the date the case briefs are due (Item 5). A written submission is any written correspondence by a representative with the ITA in the course of an AD or CVD proceeding on behalf of a party to the proceeding. The proposed change in this area mandates a firm deadline, however it will allow greater flexibility for a party to retain a representative at a later date in the proceeding. The representative must apply for an APO with its first written submission made on behalf of its client. Failure to apply at that time would result in a subsequently filed application for APO being denied as untimely. Applications filed after the date the case briefs are due will not be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another alternative is to require parties to file a notice of appearance, and to file the APO application with the notice of appearance. The ITA also intends to remind parties in its notices of initiation of a proceeding to file an early APO application. We invite comment on these two proposals, as well as other suggestions on what procedures the ITA can implement to obtain timely APO applications early in proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Electronic Business Proprietary Information Defined <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed application defines the term ``electronic data'' to include (1) proprietary data submitted by a party, generated by the ITA, or entered by the recipient on computer tape, disk, diskette, or any other electronic computer medium, and (2) all electronic work products resulting from manipulation of this data, as transferred in any form onto any other electronic computer medium, such as tape, disk, diskette, Bernoulli cartridge, removable disk pack, etc. (Item 9 of the proposed APO application).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

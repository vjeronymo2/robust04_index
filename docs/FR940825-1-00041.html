			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1994 proposed rule closely tracks the statutory protections found in 42 U.S.C. 1436a (d)(4)(A)(ii) and (d)(4)(B)(ii). These statutory sections require HUD to provide a ``reasonable opportunity'' to submit documents, and to appeal to the INS. The 1994 proposed rule requires that a responsible entity not deny admission to an otherwise eligible applicant to a covered program solely on the basis of immigration status, when such assistance is available, or terminate assistance to a tenant, during the ``reasonable opportunity'' to submit immigration documents, or pending the INS verification process, or the INS appeal. Under this expansive interpretation, an applicant or tenant would not be penalized for any delay in verifying eligible immigration status, irrespective of the cause for the delay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, for applicants, the protections against ``delay'' in providing assistance only extend through the INS appeal process. The statute does not provide protection for an applicant against delay in providing assistance during the pendency of the informal hearing process. While the statute provides that during the pendency of the informal hearing process, assistance may not be denied or terminated (42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(6)(D)), the statute drops reference to ``delay.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters noted that the proposed rule failed to establish a timetable for owners to submit documents to the INS for verification. They contended that delays in the submission of immigration documents to the INS could jeopardize a person's eligibility for assistance or continued assistance, and thereby violate the statutory mandate that assistance not be delayed, denied, or terminated as a result of the verification process. These commenters urged HUD to include in the rule a timetable for the submission and processing of documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule adopts this suggestion although protections provided by 42 U.S.C. 1436a (d)(4)(A)(ii) and (d)(4)(B)(ii), as discussed above and incorporated in the rule, renders the issue largely moot. As discussed above, a responsible entity must admit an otherwise eligible applicant to an available unit during the period provided to submit immigration documents, or pending the INS verification, or INS appeal process. Thus, even if an owner delays the submission to the INS of an applicant's immigration documents, the delay will not affect the applicant's ability to obtain assistance if the applicant is otherwise eligible, and if assistance is available. Nevertheless, the 1994 proposed rule requires that a responsible entity submit to the INS no later than 10 days following the date of submission copies of immigration documents that it obtains from applicants and tenants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD has refrained from establishing a specific time period for processing immigration documents, because this can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances. However, for the same reasons discussed above, the failure to establish a processing deadline will not affect a person's eligibility for assistance or continued assistance if the person is otherwise eligible for assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Purpose of Secondary Verification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked whether secondary verification would have to be instituted whenever the primary verification process is unable to confirm eligible immigration status, including instances where the primary system verifies ineligible status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance to an applicant or tenant may never be denied or terminated solely on the basis of the primary verification system's determination of ineligibility. The 1994 proposed rule provides that a responsible entity must institute secondary verification whenever primary verification is either unable to confirm eligible status, or when it verifies ineligible immigration status. The only instance in which primary verification would be used without the benefit of secondary verification is when the primary system verifies eligible immigration status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters asserted that the 1988 proposed rule improperly characterized the INS secondary verification process as an appeal. They cited the General Accounting Office's October 1987 Report on SAVE, in which the INS stated that ``no denial of benefits may be based solely on primary verification.'' These commenters contend that secondary verification is not an appeal, but a necessary step because of inadequacies of the INS primary verification system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD has consulted with the INS concerning IRCA's reference to an appeals process, and the INS agrees with the commenters that secondary verification may not substitute for the appeals process under 42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)(4)(A)(i). Further, the INS confirmed that secondary verification is a necessary step to the denial or termination of assistance to an individual, and that the INS appeals process cannot be initiated until after secondary verification establishes that the individual is not an eligible alien. The 1994 proposed rule therefore removes the reference to an ``appeal'' that accompanied the ``secondary verification'' heading in the applicable regulatory sections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Appealing Secondary Verification of Ineligible Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1994 proposed rule includes a discussion of the procedures for initiating the INS appeal once secondary verification establishes ineligible status. Under these procedures, the responsible entity must notify the applicant or tenant of the INS determination of ineligibility, and of the individual's right to appeal to the INS the verification decision, to submit additional documentation or a written explanation in support of the appeal, or to request an informal hearing. The responsible entity must submit photocopies of these documents to the appropriate INS district director, together with a copy of INS Form G&hyph;845S (used to process the secondary verification request) and a cover letter identifying the package as an appeal of the INS determination of ineligibility. The INS will issue a decision on the appeal within 30 days from the date of  <!-- PJG 0172 columnbreak -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> its receipt of the documents. If the INS is unable to respond within this time period, it will notify the applicant or tenant and indicate the reasons for the delay. Pending the outcome of the INS appeal, an otherwise eligible applicant must be provided with housing assistance, if such assistance is available, and assistance to a tenant may not be interrupted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

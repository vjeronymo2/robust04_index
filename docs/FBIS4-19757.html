			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today  stressed that if the efforts to reach an agreement have failed  by the end of next week, then everyone who is interested in the  Cyprus issue must conclude that the Turkish side has no  political desire for a solution on either the  confidence-building measures or the substance of the Cyprus  issue. The spokesman concluded: Therefore, the way the issues  are handled following this evaluation will have consequences  that might even extend the status quo.    Kasoulidhis stressed that the government will not let the  issue dominate efforts to solve the Cyprus problem. He said:  One year is more than enough.    Answering questions, the spokesman reiterated that the Greek  Cypriot side insists on the 21 March UN document on the  confidence-building measures.. He added that yesterday's  meeting between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel,  the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in  Cyprus, does not fall within the framework of proximity talks  but is part of customary meetings.</p>

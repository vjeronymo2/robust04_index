			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Rescue plan proposed for Upton &amp; Southern A RESCUE reconstruction has been proposed at Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the Middlesbrough-based department store and property group. A new management team, headed by Mr James Hodkinson, a director of Kingfisher, the retail conglomerate, is also planned. USH lost Pounds 2.86m before tax in the financial year to end-January. The balance sheet showed negative net worth of Pounds 500,000 and the accounts were qualified. It owes the Bank of Scotland Pounds 5.9m. The bank has agreed to a reconstruction involving Pounds 1.5m of the debt being turned into convertible preference shares, a Pounds 3m sale and leaseback of freeholds, a Pounds 375,000 write off of accrued interest leaving the group with a term loan of Pounds 800,000. USH also aims to raise Pounds 785,000 through a firm placing of 65m shares and an open offer of 36m shares at 1p a share, which will be roughly equal to net asset value after the reconstruction. The shares, traded on the Stock Exchange's new SEATS system, stood at 5p yesterday. Mr Hodkinson will become a non-executive chairman, and Mr Jeffrey Gould, ex-managing director of the John Kent chain, will be chief executive. Of the existing board only Mr John Upton will remain. Mr Ian Steven, who was finance director of A Goldberg, a Scottish retailer which went into receivership, will be a non-executive director. Directors will apply for 8.25m of the shares and the new directors and associates will subscribe for 9.75m, giving a combined stake of 16.4 per cent. Mr Gould said the group had been dragged down by its property side, but that the retail business was fundamentally sound. He said that with annual sales of Pounds 12m and after the capital reconstruction, the group was large enough and had the cash to be turned round. However, looking ahead, he said 'it is not our intention to run a group with Pounds 12m of sales' hinting at acquisitions and expansion.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / BAT lifts profits by 56% to Pounds 1.03bn BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services company, yesterday announced that profits rose 56 per cent in the nine months to September 30, helped by strong worldwide cigarette sales and a turnround from loss to profit in general insurance. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 657m to Pounds 1.03bn while earnings per share more than doubled to 35.9p. For the latest quarter, profits increased 60 per cent to Pounds 387m. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the results were further evidence BAT's growth could be maintained. 'We're really rather pleased,' he said. He repeated a pledge that full-year dividend growth would 'at least' match the 9 per cent interim increase. BAT's shares added 8p to 914p, after touching a record 922p. Turnover from continuing operations increased 3 per cent to Pounds 14.5bn. Tobacco trading profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 805m helped by rising margins. Exports, mainly to eastern Europe and Asia, grew by a quarter and now account for 20 per cent of total volumes. Brown &amp; Williamson, the US subsidiary which had a weak second quarter, reported growth in volumes and profits in the latest three months, Sir Patrick said. Trading profits from financial services jumped from Pounds 142m to Pounds 376m, mainly due to reduced losses at Eagle Star. Mortgage indemnity charges, to cover house repossessions, fell from Pounds 169m a year ago to Pounds 78m and helped Eagle Star cut its losses from Pounds 248m to Pounds 66m. Sir Patrick said Eagle Star was unlikely to return to profit until 1994 because of continuing uncertainty in the housing market. Mortgage indemnity charges were likely to continue at about Pounds 25m a quarter. Other financial services divisions performed well, with US subsidiary Farmers lifting trading profits 18 per cent to Pounds 305m. Allied Dunbar increased profits 4 per cent to Pounds 93m. Reduced losses at Eagle Star, and improved underwriting results, led to profits from general insurance business of Pounds 173m, against losses of Pounds 39m. BAT restated its life assurance profits for the past two years under the new 'accruals accounting' method, which would have increased to Pounds 310m published post-tax profits for 1991 of Pounds 193m.

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Reshaped Norske Skog stages sharp recovery NORWAY'S Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers, returned to the black in the first eight months of this year. It made pre-tax profits of NKr9m (Dollars 1.27m), against a pre-tax loss of NKr304m last year. Net losses in the eight-month period fell sharply to NKr20m from NKr253m in last year's comparative period. The improvement reflected better results in the business paper sector and from affiliated companies, reduced costs and positive net financial items. Last year there was a NKr76m restructuring charge. The group forecast an improvement for the full year, pointing to a cost-cutting programme, lower interest rates and realised profits on the bond portfolio. It recorded a pre-tax loss of NKr659m in 1992. Group sales in the eight-month period fell by NKr386m to NKr4.893bn. Norske Skog said prices for pulp were at an all-time low due to over-capacity in global markets while devaluations of the Swedish and Finnish currencies had made it difficult to push up prices. Gross operating profit dipped by NKr7m to NKr494m. Losses at associated companies narrowed to NKr91m from NKr135m.</p>

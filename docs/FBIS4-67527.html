			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Halvor Tjonn report: ``Berntsen Dissatisfied With </F> Environmental Progress on the Kola Peninsula'']    [Text] Moscow -- Thorbjorn Berntsen is seeking new Russian  initiatives in the environmental work on the Kola Peninsula.    The Norwegian environment minister has said there is no  reason to express satisfaction with the progress in the work to  clean up the nickel works on the Kola Peninsula. For the last  two days he has been discussing this issue, among others, with  his Russian counterpart, Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, in Moscow.    ``I had been hoping that we would have made greater progress  in the work to finance the rebuilding of the nickel works on the  Kola Peninsula,'' Thorbjorn Berntsen said. ``The Russian  environmental authorities are working on the matter. It is  impossible to find fault with their work. But they are meeting  with resistance at home, not least because of the difficult  economic situation. You have to remember that the project has a  budget framework of 1.5 to 2 billion Norwegian kroner, of which  Norway will contribute 300 million. That is a lot of money in  today's Russia.''    Berntsen also stressed that we must nevertheless not give up  hope of a breakthrough on the Kola Peninsula soon. ``I have  been discussing this matter for several years with the Russian  environmental protection authorities. We will solve the  problems as quickly as possible,'' he said.    At a press conference at the Russian Environment Ministry  Berntsen's Russian counterpart got into a heated exchange with  journalists present. Danilov-Danilyan said that it is  impossible for money to be allocated to the Kola project this  year. Berntsen in turn said that its serves no purpose to make  a drama out of a crisis. The cooperation between Norwegian and  Russian authorities remains constructive, and the Norwegian side  is concentrating on one step at a time.    As well as the question of Nikel, Berntsen has also  discussed  the question of building a storage facility for radioactive  waste in northwestern Russia. ``Everyone has the aim of  building this facility. But where it will be sited is as yet an  open question. It is desirable that transport routes should not  be too long, whether it is on the Kola Peninsula or Novaya  Zemlya. But I would stress that the budget framework is so huge  that this will be a major effort. There must therefore be  further discussion of financing,'' Berntsen said.    He thinks that there is every reason to follow closely what  is happening at the storage facilities for liquid nuclear waste  near the town of Chelyabinsk in Siberia. At present there are  floods in this area. At worst the liquid waste could run out  into the River Ob, then the Kara Sea, and eventually reach the  Norwegian coast and fishing waters. ``This is a permanent  problem, and Russian and Norwegian authorities are working  together on the matter the whole time,'' Berntsen said.    On Thursday [28 April] Berntsen met with Russian Atomic  Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov. According to what has leaked  out from the meeting, the shape the meeting took was that  Mikhaylov launched into a long monotonous monologue directed at  Berntsen about the blessings of nuclear power. According to  those present at the meeting, Berntsen remained ``surprisingly  calm,'' given the claims the Russian minister was making.    ``I have to say that one rearely meets a person with so  devoted a relationship to nuclear power. To me it seems  unsubtle and uncritical. But I would like to stress that when  it comes to cooperation on concrete problems, there is nothing  to be said against Russia's willingness to cooperate,'' Berntsen  stressed.</p>

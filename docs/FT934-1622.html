			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: PSB's counter bid intensifies the battle for control of ICD THE battle for control of International Communications &amp; Data intensified yesterday with a counter, though unquantified, bid for the marketing services company PSB Group, a direct marketing concern which claims to control 23.6 per cent of ICD's voting rights, said it would set a price once it was given access to ICD's books. The first bid, from IMC Industries and its supporters, was forced into a 9 1/2 p a share offer for the company on December 8, although the USM-quoted soft drinks and leisure company said it did not wish to gain ICD. Mr David Cicurel, full time executive chairman of IMC and a big shareholder in the company, obtained for IMC an option to subscribe for 6.95m shares at 7p as payment for his services as ICD's chairman. IMC exercised its option, triggering a mandatory takeover bid under the takeover code. IMC was a reluctant bidder and pitched its offer at the lowest price permitted under the takeover code. IMC exercised the option to support the ICD board in its battle with PSB, which has been seeking control of ICD for about three months. The option gave IMC a 10.6 per cent stake in ICD. The company and its supporters now claim to hold about 40 per cent. At a special meeting held on December 9 ICD shareholders defeated all resolutions put forward by PSB, which requisitioned the meeting for the removal of a majority of the existing directors and their replacement by PSB nominees.</p>

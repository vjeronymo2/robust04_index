			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> JOE SATRIANI STRIKES THE RIGHT CHORD WITH AUDIENCE  </P> <P> Back in the '60s, rock-guitar god Eric Clapton once said that when a player is  at his peak, on certain levels he's talking to the audience -- and they  thoroughly understand him.  </P> <P> At the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on Thursday, in the first of a two-night  stand, hard-rock guitarist Joe Satriani held some rambling, melodramatic  conversations with the audience, which was clearly in tune with him most of the  time.  </P> <P> Satriani, considered by many the best hard-rock instrumentalist to emerge in  the '80s, really is good. Even if you're skeptical about the whole guitar-hero  genre, you might like him. Those flurries of piercing notes and those  explosions of thunderous chords really do add up to cohesive dramatic  statements.  </P> <P> But it's easy for this kind of player to fall into arid stretches where, for  all his effort, he's simply not connecting with the audience. These are the  inevitable detours that come as part of speeding around the cluttered aural  landscape in search of paths to glorious dramatic peaks. Some turns lead to the  right roads and sometimes they don't. Most of the time Thursday night, Satriani  chose right.  </P> <P> He also varied the mood with some toned-down, tension-releasing pieces and some  that featured his strained vocals. Few great guitarists have been better than  average singers, and Satriani is no different. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Arts: Why success is all a question of pitch - Television While radio is an excellent medium for broadcasting music, television has always had problems: the sound has to be accompanied by something in the way of pictures, and most programme makers clearly feel that they should provide 'added value'. This notion has reached its logical extreme in the pop video where the pictures are often more interesting than the music and, these days, frequently dominate the experience. On Saturday in Pictures At An Exhibition: Concerto For Paintbrush And Orchestra BBC2 came up with a sort of orchestral video. While the orchestra played the Mussorgsky, artist Norman Perryman painted on glass plates which the camera showed us either straight on the television screen or projected onto a tall screen behind the orchestra. Such ideas are not new. Decades ago a documentary about Picasso's technique was made by setting up cameras behind glass screens upon which the artist worked. Moreover the type of image created by Perryman reminded you of the light shows accompanying rock concerts in the 1960s where oil, water, paint and dyes were mixed and squeezed, sometimes between small glass plates, and then projected on giant screens. The effects were particularly pleasing, it is said, for anyone who happened to be enjoying hallucinogenic substances at the time. My own memories, admittedly somewhat hazy, suggest that the effects at a Doors concert at the ICA and at a Time Out concert at - could it have been? - Alexandra Palace were far more dramatic and gorgeous than anything we saw on television on Saturday. In any case the idea of Perryman 'interpreting' the music through paint and working to the rhythms of the orchestra was irritating. It brought to mind a passage from Howard's End: 'What is the good of the arts if they're interchangeable? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye? Helen's one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting and pictures into the language of music. It's very ingenious and she says several pretty things in the process, but what's gained I'd like to know?' What indeed. Much more entertaining was Discovering Beethoven, also screened by BBC2, which consisted of a lecture about the fifth symphony with musical illustrations followed by a performance of the entire work. The success of the venture stemmed almost entirely from the personality of Michael Tilson Thomas who conducted the orchestra and choir (why a choir for the fifth? - well, he showed us how it might have sounded had the composer given us a choral section as in the ninth) and delivered the lecture. This was cleverly pitched so that it neither insulted anyone's intelligence nor demanded such musical expertise as to put people off. It took us from Gregorian chant to Beethoven via Monteverdi with remarkable ease and lucidity. Tilson Thomas has that trick of conveying learning without supercilious didacticism which was such a winning characteristic for Kenneth Clark and Jacob Bronowski. Of course in 1993 many broadcasters view that sort of expertise with deep suspicion. The Reithian notion of aiming programmes slightly above the heads of your expected audience has been turned upside down: now broadcasters are competing to see who can aim lowest. Some years ago Granada, then the most highly regarded commercial television company in the world, launched what was planned as a major series called Man And Music. Four or five splendid documentaries were completed, with extensive foreign footage and lots of expensive archive research. But what has happened to the rest of the series? Today it is not programme quality which gets Granada's name in the newspapers but its predatory activities in the stock market. The magazine Time Out is, of course, the most fashionable and flourishing of London's 'what's on' magazines. Launched in the 1960s, it has stayed at the centre of successive social trends and now toes the sort of politically correct line which avoids publication of sexually stimulating photographs unless they appeal to homosexuals. This month it ran a feature about female comedians which neatly encapsulated the received wisdom on this topic: fewer (or to use their word, less) female than male comedians appear on television and on the London club circuit because of prejudice against women. 'Almost anybody, no matter how liberated, reacts differently to a woman trying to be funny. There's this arms folded 'show us what you can do' type attitude.' Just as it is repeatedly asserted of television in general that 'you have to be twice as good to get on if you're a woman' so 'women have to work much harder to get an audience's trust' and 'it's just not seen as attractive for women to be funny; people see it as ugly and unladylike . . . The industry is discriminating and under-serves a rich seam of female talent . . . it's important to ask why so few females feel able to make it in comedy'. Never at any stage does anybody even whisper the suggestion that perhaps there simply are not very many talented female comedians around, yet all the evidence suggests that this is the only reason for the disparity between the sexes. When you think of the dramatic inequality between men and women in other activities (orchestral composition, philosophy, chess, physics, cartooning) this scarcely seems surprising. And when you remember the global success achieved as much as 40 years ago by a woman who did prove her talent - Lucille Ball - you feel obliged to ask what happened to the prejudice in her case? There is such pressure in broadcasting these days to discriminate in favour of women that, far from needing to be twice as good to get a chance, you only need to be half as good as a comparably inexperienced man. But while broadcasters may desperately kid themselves that the talent is there so that a new one-woman series is justified (Emma Thompson, Tracey Ullman and Josie Lawrence come to mind) they cannot force the public to share their blinkers. The idea that this is misogynistic prejudice on the part of viewers rather than the ability to discriminate would be more convincing if Victoria Wood, French and Saunders, Ruby Wax and Sandi Toksvig had not been so successful. Nor can you accuse these successful women of abandoning their sex and buying acceptance by becoming quasi men (an argument used about leading female comics in the Victorian music hall). Since giving birth Ruby Wax has specialised in detailed and discursive, not to say lurid, sequences about childbirth, and the funniest routine in Victoria Wood: Sold Out on Saturday was her account of buying a pregnancy testing kit and attempting to use it in a public lavatory. To more strait-laced viewers that may sound distasteful, but it is as pure as the driven snow compared to the material used by somebody such as Jo Brand in television's late night alternative comedy slots. Note the way Brand deliberately emphasises her natural unattractiveness in her dress, hairstyle and facial expressions; listen to her man-hating diatribes, wonder to yourself what would happen to a man who delivered a line as nasty as her threat to sit on men's faces at certain times, and it is not hard to see why no one offers her a prime time slot. If you point to the violent contempt for all men expressed in the work of so many of these female comics and suggest that this may have something to do with their unpopularity they narrow their eyes and hiss remarks about 'centuries of mother-in-law jokes' as though joking about a notoriously difficult relationship was justification for spitting out a stream of hatred against half the human race. It is difficult to imagine a nastier prejudice than that of these female comics against all those who happen to be of a different sex.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH VOWS TO STOP DECLINE OF INNER CITIES;  </P> <P> 'YOUR PROBLEMS ARE MY PROBLEMS,' RIGHTS LEADERS TOLD  </P> <P> President Bush, telling a group of civil rights leaders, "Your problems are my  problems," vowed today to work toward stopping the decline of inner cities and  making "the '90s a decade of urban renaissance."  </P> <P> "We must create conditions for urban growth and economic revival, conditions  that leave no one behind," Bush said in remarks to the 79th annual meeting of  the National Urban League.  </P> <P> Bush made no mention of current disputes between his Administration and civil  rights advocates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Striking Down Barriers'  </P> <P> But he said at one point: "Before I go on -- I want to make sure everyone in  this room knows just where I stand, just where our Administration stands. My  Administration is committed to reaching out to minorities, to striking down  barriers to free and open access.  </P> <P> "We will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any kind -- period,"  Bush said.  </P> <P> The President did not announce plans to visit sub-Saharan Africa this fall,  despite earlier speculation by White House officials.  </P> <P> Although Bush reiterated promises to work against poverty and racial  intolerence, civil rights leaders attending the Urban League conference earlier  suggested that Bush's deeds have not always matched his words.  </P> <P> Before hearing directly from Bush today, several prominent civil rights  advocates said the President's record thus far has been weak, though they  embraced Bush's role in achieving legislation extending civil rights protection  to disabled Americans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Low Marks"  </P> <P> "The civil rights community would give the President high marks for  accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on substantive civil  rights policy," said Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership  Conference on Civil Rights.  </P> <P> Civil rights leaders cited Bush's acceptance of Supreme Court rulings limiting  affirmative action, his veto of minimum wage legislation and his choice of  black Detroit lawyer William Lucas to be the Justice Department's top civil  rights enforcer. Lucas was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 7-7  tie vote.  </P> <P> Separately, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that the  President is still undecided on whether to resubmit Lucas' nomination during  the current congressional recess -- a process that would temporarily sidestep  the confirmation process.  </P></p>

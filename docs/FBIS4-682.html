			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- African National  Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday [14  April] blamed the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] for scuttling the  international mediation process.    Addressing a media briefing on Thursday afternoon shortly  after Henry Kissinger said his mediation team was packing up and  going home, Mr Ramaphosa said the IFP had tried to use the  mediation to have the elections postponed.    He said security force numbers were being increased in  Natal/kwaZulu to implement the state of emergency that was  imposed to ensure elections in the province. "The breakdown in  the discussions around the terms of reference was occasioned by  the IFP's insistence that postponement of the elections had to  be addressed by the mediation process."    He said the ANC was saddened by the mediation breakdown.  "The mediation has failed and it has failed because the parties  could not come to agreement on the terms of reference."    Mr Ramaphosa said there had been a "misunderstanding" among  the parties that had led to terms of reference being decided  upon when there were deficiencies with these.    The joint ANC, IFP and government task force had attempted  to  address these deficiencies but its proposals had been rejected  by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. "Chief Buthelezi's  rejection of the timeframes clearly showed the IFP wanted the  date of the election to be a subject of mediation," he said.    Mr Ramaphosa said the ANC was prepared to conduct  negotiations with the IFP before and after the elections. He  said discussions were continuing in the joint task group about  the future of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. But he warned that  security force action would be stepped up.    He said the ANC had made a last-minute proposal to the IFP  to  include it in provincial elections in Natal/kwaZulu and other  provinces. This had been rejected.    IFP senior negotiator Ben Ngubane warned that a political  solution was necessary. He said the South African Defence Force  had failed to crush the ANC. "There is no ruler in the world  that can crush people's aspirations with brute force. The ANC  is refusing us the opportunity and is pushing armed force as the  solution. They are very wrong."    Dr Ngubane said the ANC had agreed at the highest level to  the original terms of reference negotiated by its national  chairman Thabo Mbeki. "We are concerned that both the ANC and  the government in this case have negotiated in very, very bad  faith," he said. Dr Ngubane said he regretted what had happened  to the mediation "but we had to stand firm".</p>

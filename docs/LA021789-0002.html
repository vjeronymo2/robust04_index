			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREPARING FOR DROUGHT  </P> <P> As California inches closer to a third consecutive drought year, Metropolitan  Water District and other Southland water agencies are laying detailed plans for  reducing water use this summer (editorial, "The Dry Years," Feb. 2).  </P> <P> How stringent these measures will be depends, of course, on how dry the rest of  this winter is. Hopefully, a bounty of snow and rain will hit the state --  particularly in Northern California -- making the whole issue moot.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Southern California will again be able to draw a full supply of  water from the Colorado River this year, which will help this region meet its  overall water needs. These supplies, however, are no longer dependable and are  only being made available on a year-by-year basis.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Metropolitan is developing a tiered plan of action to promote  conservation as the summer approaches. This plan includes a major public  information campaign aimed at alerting Southern Californians about the state's  drought and the need to save water. Last year, similar efforts were undertaken  and consumers responded by saving about 30 billion gallons of water -- enough  to meet the annual residential needs of approximately 180,000 families.  </P> <P> In conjunction with these public information activities, MWD will, if  necessary, activate its interruptable water service program by curtailing  ground-water recharge programs and deliveries to storage reservoirs, easing  pressure on strained State Water Project reservoirs in Northern California.  </P> <P> While Southern California's supplies appear sufficient at this juncture, other  parts of the state which rely on less dependable water systems could face  severe shortages this summer. Over the past 70 years, Southern Californians  have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in water transfer and storage  projects to both meet demand and protect against multi-year drought. That  investment is paying off during this dry period and, with the cooperation of  the 14.5 million people in our service area, should see us through a dry 1989  without highly restrictive water-use rules.  </P> <P> We can minimize the frequency of droughts by providing a reliable and stable  water supply through the construction of additional features on the State Water  Project, including needed storage facilities and a more efficient means of  transporting water. Such projects would be in addition to adopting water  conservation as a way of life.  </P> <P> CARL BORONKAY  </P> <P> General Manager, MWD  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Yuliya Khaytina article: "For Each Enemy--One `Topol.' </F> Missile Regiment on Combat Alert."]    [Text] After saying farewell to Belorussia [Belarus], the  RS-12M mobile intercontinental nuclear missiles, customarily  called simply "Topols" [poplar trees], along with their support  systems, have arrived home in Russia--in a division in  Yoshkar-Ola. Col Vladimir Kashkin's missile regiment, having  gotten off combat alert duty, was not part of our military  forces which were serving with the 43d Missile Army in Ukraine  and which were moved out of there by the sensitive local  leadership, taking nothing with them: All military property now  belongs to Ukraine.    The system of barriers at the "missile corner" where the  Topols are located is very inhospitable to those not authorized  to be there. For example, the so-called electrified zone looks  like a sort of spiney network, through which at regular  intervals an approximately 1500-volt current flows.    Officers and noncommissioned officers service the Topols.  This gives them the modest right to call themselves Strategic  Missile Forces professionals. For good service, an officer with  the rank of major can earn 300 thousand rubles a month--they get  money for food, for keeping up appearances, for shift duty, and  for other good things in life. In view of the fact that most  men in military service do not have apartments and do not expect  to have them any time soon, but do have plenty of unemployed  wives and hungry children, one can say happily that our great  Motherland's nuclear shield is in the hands of enthusiasts!    But fortunately the country is poor and the Defense Ministry  poorer, while an officer is a sort of father in a subsistence  economy. He must not only service the missiles, but in his  "free time"--as if he had any--he must build a barracks, mess  hall, and so on. Their desperate wives stubbornly work as  communications officers, dispatchers, and so on, and proudly  contribute their 150 thousand rubles to the family budget.  There are 108 of them in Vladimir Kashkin's regiment--almost  the entire communications and medical staff.    Vladislav Zotin, president of the Republic of Mariy El,  after  he attended the above-mentioned ceremony, felt so sincerely  about "his" military men that he thought that the best way to  prevent bad consequences in the missile forces was to visit  personally the General Staff in Moscow. He asked for more  generous financing so that the forces could be at normal  strength. As to whether the presidential travels will help the  missile troops--who knows, but his travels have made them feel  more friendly towards their commanders.</p>

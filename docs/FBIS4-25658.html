			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 KYODO -- Chinese Vice Foreign  Minister Tang Jiaxuan blamed the threatened withdrawal of North  Korea from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the  agency itself Tuesday [14 Jun], while calling the situation  critical, a former Japanese defense minister said in Beijing.    Taku Yamasaki, a House of Representatives member of the  largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and his  colleague met with Tang before leaving for a visit of "two or  three" days to North Korea.    His visit comes a day after North Korea announced late  Monday  it will withdraw from the IAEA in retaliation to the IAEA's  cancellation last Friday of technical assistance to Pyongyang.    "The IAEA sanctions caused this result, China abstained from  voting (on the sanctions) and calls for a peaceful solution  through dialogue," Yamasaki quoted Tang as saying.    "China is continuing consular efforts, we are doing this in  a  more positive way, but the North Korean attitude is very firm.  I think our efforts will not be decisive," Tang was quoted as  saying.    "The most important thing is not to force North Korea out of  the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)," Tang told Yamasaki.  "We are at a critical moment. The international community  should promote a peaceful solution, mainly through dialogue  between North Korea and the United States."    In Pyongyang, Yamasaki hopes to discuss with North Korean  leaders recent developments concerning the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula and the ongoing consultations in the UN  Security Council of sanctions on North Korea.    He said Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison  Department of the Chinese Communist Party, said at a meeting  Monday that China should not be counted on to abstain on  Security Council sanctions on North Korea as they did on the  IAEA sanctions.    "We have not decided what to do. We will decide according to  the situation at the time," he quoted Li as telling him.    Yamasaki is also expected to discuss North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons program and its refusal to allow IAEA  inspections of the refueling of a 5-megawatt experimental  nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: President of CBoT clearing body quits MR Roger Rutz, the president of the Chicago Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, has resigned after 10 years at the head of the Chicago exchange's independent clearing organisation. Mr Rutz, 40, cited personal reasons for his departure. Mr William Feldman, the Clearing Corporation's chairman, named Ms Denise Hagerty as interim chief executive while an international search is conducted for Mr Rutz's replacement. Ms Hagerty, presently chief operating officer, joined the Clearing Corporation in January after 12 years managing clearing operations for a prominent Chicago brokerage firm. Mr Rutz's departure comes at a critical time for the Chicago Board of Trade. The Clearing Corporation guarantees trades for the exchange, and maintains its top quality credit rating. A year ago, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered exploratory talks to merge their clearing operations. Mr Patrick Arbor, chairman of the CBoT, said Mr Rutz's departure should not affect those discussions. 'The board of directors of the Clearing Corporation are fully committed to unified clearing,' Mr Arbor said. 'They will choose a successor (to Mr Rutz) with that goal in mind.' The new Clearing Corporation president will have to contend with the professional differences that have impeded progress in those talks, industry sources said.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo rises on bid hint The oil share sector, one of the market's best performers in recent weeks as the oil price has topped Dollars 15 a barrel, remained the centre of attention as dealers picked up hints that a bid for Lasmo may be in the offing. Elf, the French oil group, was once again identified as a potential bidder. Lasmo shares performed well, against the market trend, throughout the session, but suddenly moved sharply higher in mid-afternoon following a big buy out of the money May 154 call options, said to have been carried out by one of the big French-owned stockbrokers in the City. News of the option market trade saw Lasmo shares spurt from 141p to 146p within seconds. Subsequent profit-taking caused the shares to drift off to close a net 5 higher at 141p. The 'new' nil-paid shares jumped to 38p before settling 6 higher at 37p. Significantly, turnover in Lasmo 'old' and 'new' shares expanded as the takeover stories did the rounds. Lasmo old traded 9.3m shares and the new 4.3m. turnover in the options market was the equivalent of 2.3m shares. Dealers noted strong transatlantic buying of Lasmo shares last week as the stock traded ex the Pounds 219m rights issue.</p>

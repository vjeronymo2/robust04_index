			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Male beasts in trading pits only partly tamed: US investment banks are leading the way in tackling harassment of women, but the bias is firmly entrenched If you pack a trading floor the size of a football pitch with hundreds of healthy young men and a sprinkling of women and expect them to work side-by-side for up to 15 hours a day, thoughts of sex will never be far away. Even if there is no rampant bottom-pinching or fondling behind the filing cabinets, a sexual undercurrent is kept alive by the locker-room culture which thrives in such a competitive environment. Traders often give sexually loaded answers to their female assistants' innocent questions and use graphic language when referring to their deals. The high proportion of men in dealing rooms, from London's foreign-exchange departments to the commodities trading pits in Chicago, has exposed women to a gauntlet of dirty jokes and loutish behaviour from male colleagues and superiors. Women in subordinate roles are particularly vulnerable but even female traders find that they have to act aggressively to avoid being harassed. A member of a foreign-exchange department at a US bank in London says some male traders still see themselves as 'masters of the universe riding in on their horses  - quick draw, quick fire and ride off into the sunset'. He adds that women who do make it in that environment have to be 'more macho than the men'. The resignations last week of three male foreign-exchange dealers from the London branch of Goldman Sachs, the prestigious US investment bank, following complaints of sexual harassment by a female colleague, indicate that the animal culture of the trading floor is being tamed. The heavy legal costs and unwelcome media publicity associated with sexual harassment or discrimination cases in the US have prompted senior management at US banks to take such complaints far more seriously than their European and Asian counterparts. Some US banks in London have telephone hotlines so that individuals can register complaints in confidence. Others regularly remind staff of the conduct policy in their contracts and even go so far as to state what constitutes sexual harassment. Remarks such as 'Honey, you look nice today' or rolling one's eyes when an attractive woman walks past are put forward as examples of unacceptable behaviour. Women working at US banks say these measures have created a healthier working environment and that their promotion prospects have improved. One woman banker who previously worked at a European bank feels that 'the rights of women are taken much more seriously at a US bank'. Another recalls how her complaints after being passed over for a promotion for which she was due resulted not only in her promotion the following year but also the departure of the man who had held her back. The sexual imbalance on the City's trading floors is being corrected by the growing number of women entering the industry and rising to senior positions. In addition, the increasing sophistication of the financial services industry has meant that the 'barrow boys' are being replaced by highly qualifed graduates who can deal with highly complicated derivative products. One senior woman executive at a European bank says these developments are contributing to a more 'politically correct' atmosphere. However, she also points out that no amount of political correctness will ever eradicate the 'gold-digging' which has been part of City life for years. 'I see those girls with their mini-skirts and plunging necklines who are just dying to have an affair with a high-earning trader,' she says. 'When it doesn't go their way, will they now be able to claim that they were sexually harassed?' Goldman's action shows that senior management in the City is getting tough on behaviour to which it once turned a blind eye, but only up to a point. The men who resigned were not in positions of authority; nor were they big revenue-earners. Some observers question whether, in future cases, if the harasser were a star trader it would be the unfortunate secretary who was asked to move on.</p>

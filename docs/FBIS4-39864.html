			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Special Newscast"--recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] [Correspondent Seyyat Agbabali] During his brief  working visit to Turkey, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev met  with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller, foreign ministers of a number of foreign countries, and  other officials. Dear listeners, you will see a detailed report  on this visit later. On our special program we bring to your  attention Aliyev's news briefing in Istanbul on his visit.    [Aliyev] I came to Istanbul, Turkey, for a brief working  visit at the invitation of the esteemed Suleyman Demirel. I am  now returning to Baku, Azerbaijan. Meetings of very great  importance Azerbaijan have taken place here. One reason for my  arrival here at the invitation of our esteemed friend and  brother Suleyman Demirel was to hold talks and consultations and  put forward certain proposals regarding accelerating the  development of ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan. For this  purpose, we held detailed and lengthy talks yesterday with the  Turkish president, esteemed Suleyman Demirel, and we discussed  all the issues of interest to Turkey and Azerbaijan.    Today I met the Turkish prime minister, esteemed Tansu  Ciller, and the deputy prime minister, esteemed Murat  Karayalcin. We discussed the development of friendly and  fraternal ties between Turkey and Azerbaijan and speeding up the  solution of certain matters. We reached agreement on many  issues. This was the main purpose of my visit, and as such I am  very satisfied with my visit here.    Of course, during our meetings with esteemed Suleyman  Demirel, Tansu Ciller, and Murat Karayalcin and during our brief  meeting with esteemed Hikmet Cetin we also discussed the present  situation in Azerbaijan, particularly the ongoing war between  Armenia and Azerbaijan, Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan,  and the ways to solve this problem.    It is known to the world that the Azerbaijani side, and  myself personally, favor the peaceful resolution of this  problem. That is, we favor ending the war, halting the  fighting, and peacefully resolving this problem. We have put  forward some proposals in this direction but, regrettably,  achieved nothing.    The Azerbaijani side has very strict conditions for the  peaceful resolution of this problem, these being: The  Azerbaijani Republic's territorial integrity and the  inviolability of its borders must be ensured; Armenian Armed  Forces must leave the occupied Azerbaijani lands; and the  refugees, the Azerbaijani citizens, should be returned to their  homes in these occupied lands. We favor a peaceful solution to  this problem under these conditions, and to this end we are  trying to make use of CSCE, of the CSCE's Minsk Group. And of  course, we are also trying to make use of the good offices of  the major powers--most of which are members of CSCE--and of the  UN and the UN Security Council. We have taken various measures  in this direction. Russia, too, is actively involved in this  problem. Russia is trying to act as a mediator to peacefully  resolve this problem; and recently the CSCE Minsk Group and its  chairman Jan Eliasson has agreed that Russia should have a  special role in this endeavor. Minsk Group also (?consented)  that CIS too should get involved in this matter.    We are working within these parameters. I met with the  foreign ministers of a number of Western countries yesterday and  today. [passage omitted]    I think that our contacts were very beneficial and  important.  Azerbaijan once again reiterated its position at these meetings,  and asked these major states, the European states, to take part  in this process. In turn, the foreign ministers of these  counties said that they favor the resolution of this problem  exclusively within the CSCE framework--through the Minsk  Group--and told me that they will be more active in this  direction in the future. [passage omitted]    [Agbabali] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev was seen off  at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport by Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister  Murat Karayalcin, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu, and other  officials.    Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev was welcomed at Baku's  Bina Airport by the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Rasul  Guliyev, Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, and other officials.</p>

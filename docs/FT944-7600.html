			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Metropolitan Phoenix rises as construction industry hots up: Building employment is booming, but competitive market is helping restrain pay inflation In a construction-driven economy like the Phoenix metropolitan area, where building accounts for 30 per cent of all new job creation, you can see the signs of expansion all around you: in the red-tiled homes sprouting among newly-planted palm trees and saguaro cacti in the north valley and the shiny office buildings and shopping centres downtown. Other sectors are prospering, too. Intel is putting up a Dollars 1.3bn microchip plant in the southern suburb of Chandler, and surging copper prices have brought good times again to Arizona's old-established mining industry. Employment in the state is projected to climb by 5 per cent this year, with much of the growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and construction employment has been expanding at an annual pace above 15 per cent. 'The Greater Phoenix economy is booming, and signs point to continued prosperity over the next several years,' proclaims the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, a public and private sector partnership which boosts development in the metropolitan area. As the Federal Reserve seeks to cool down a national economy where employment is growing only half as quickly, hot spots like Phoenix are the sort of area where the inflationary pressures the Fed fears might be expected to be showing up already. But local economists say that even the most rapidly growing sector of the local economy - construction - is not showing the kind of wage inflation that might be expected. 'There is definitely a lot of pressure on wages but I don't believe that it is being translated into higher wage levels. It's a sufficiently competitive housing market that you couldn't simply raise wages, or you'd be priced out of it,' says Mr Dan Anderson of Arizona's Department of Economic Security. Home prices in Phoenix have risen by 3.3 per cent over the past year to an average of Dollars 91,100, but remain well below those in nearby cities such as Albuquerque or Las Vegas, and less than half the average of Los Angeles or San Francisco. Bottlenecks are emerging, however, particularly for construction skills such as framing carpenters. 'When you see hand-painted signs on building lots saying 'Framers wanted - apply on site' you know there are skill shortages,' says Mr Bill Stephenson, director of economic development with Arizona Public Service, the largest local utility. Skilled framers are more likely to look for work in neighbouring Nevada  - also experiencing strong construction activity - or in southern California, where demand for construction labour has been heavy this year as the Los Angeles area seeks to rebuild after January's earthquake. 'The wages California pays are clearly higher than wages offered here. We simply could not compete with them,' says Mr Anderson. 'Basically, the building companies have hired all the really skilled people they can and they are now down to hiring people who are really learning on the job, and those people are not paid that much,' says Mr Tracy Clark of the Economic Outlook Centre at Arizona State University in Tempe, a southeastern suburb of Phoenix. Instead of raising wages or prices, builders are simply stretching out their construction times. 'Where they might have been able to complete a house in 90 days we are now seeing 120 or 150 days,' says Mr Anderson. In other segments of the labour market, however, Arizona still has a degree of slack. 'We've got tool and die makers selling hardware at the department store, waiting for the right job to come along,' says Mr Stephenson of Arizona Public Service. Local economists say growth this time around is built on much more solid foundations than the construction boom of the mid-1980s, which burst spectacularly when the tax breaks which had prompted it were repealed. This year, construction activity has been centred on single family homes, with building closely tied to real demand. The boom in this sector is now slowing down, as pent-up demand from the recession has now largely been satisfied, and is expected to glide down to a pace tied to the state's population growth, forecast at around 2.6 per cent a year. Apartment construction may now start to pick up the slack, but the building industry is not expected to have all cylinders firing at once. Still, there is one sign of speculative overheating that the Fed might want to keep an eye on. The Arizona Cardinals American football team plays in a first rate stadium deemed good enough to host the Superbowl national football championship game in 1996, but Mr Bill Bidwill, the team owner, is already talking about building a new stadium. Cynical Phoenix sports fans suggest that Mr Bidwill might want to build a winning team before he starts thinking about a new stadium.</p>

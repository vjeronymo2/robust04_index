			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 18 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] has dismissed three telephone calls to SAPA in  which alleged PAC armed wing members denounced the  organisation's decision to end the armed struggle. PAC Deputy  President Johnson Mlambo said in a statement the names used by  the callers were unknown to the PAC. He suggested "security  agencies" were responsible for the calls, aimed at undermining  the PAC.    PAC national organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanani told SAPA the  code name Karl Zimbiri used by one caller was out of use within  the organisation and that the original Mr Zimbiri had died.    The only three military commanders who were entitled to  issue  media statements on Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA]  operations were APLA Commander Sabelo Phama, APLA political  commissar Romero Daniels and APLA information chief Johnny  Majosi.    Mr Nemadzivhanani also denied there was dissent within  APLA's  ranks over the PAC's announced moratorium on violence. "APLA has  always been a disciplined organ of the PAC. It has been led by  the political leadership of the PAC at all times and APLA  soldiers follow orders from the command structure of APLA."    He said the PAC and APLA commanders had not given any orders  for APLA operations since the announcement of the moratorium.  The leadership had no knowledge of involvement of APLA  operatives in Sunday night's attack on a Durban satellite police  station.    He alleged claims to the contrary were the work of "enemy  agents" intent on discrediting the PAC in the run-up to the  elections. "We have given all our commanders orders to instruct  the cadres to cease fire under the moratorium to give our  political leaders the chance to negotiate a mutual cessation of  hostilities (with the government)."    While Mr Nemadzivhanani conceded the message might take some  time to filter through to the rank-and-file membership, he  insisted the proper command structures had been informed and the  majority of members had been contacted.    Mr Nemadzivhanani said the PAC suspected government agents  had infiltrated APLA with the intention of framing the  organisation and discrediting it as a party committed to  democracy. He alleged this had long been a calculated programme  of the "regime" and the "rightwing".</p>

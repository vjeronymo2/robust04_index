His visit is important in terms of  exposing the true nature of Armenia's aggression against  Azerbaijan.    President Aliyev delivered a speech in the Institute for  International Relations. He explained issues relating to  Azerbaijan's independence, the new stage in relations between  Azerbaijan and Britain, Azerbaijan's new state structure, and  the Republic's new foreign policy. Geydar Aliyev also explained  in detail Armenia's aggressive war against Azerbaijan. Several  members of his audience asked him questions on various issues.  We want to brief you on the questions and Aliyev's replies.  One question was as follows: President Ter-Petrosyan said,  when he visited this country two weeks ago, that the Azerbaijani  Government is reluctant to guarantee the security of Armenians  in Karabakh. He stressed that the Armenians in Karabakh are  struggling for their security. Can you comment on that?    Aliyev replied: The information Ter-Petrosyan has conveyed  to you is wrong. I stress that Azerbaijan fully guarantees the  security of the Armenian people in Karabakh. The Armenian  military forces have occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan's  territory. They must withdraw. Only after Armenia's withdrawal  can the issue of guaranteeing the Armenian people's security be  discussed. A war is being fought on Azerbaijan's territory.    Another question was: The Armenian and Azerbaijani people  have been involved in bloody disputes since the ninth century.  Can't the two sides make territorial concessions. For example,  has any proposal been made in the talks between the two sides to  join Karabakh with Armenia and the area between the Nakhichevan  Autonomous Republic and Azerbaijan with your republic? Aliyev  gave a very clear reply. He said: No one knows how long the  dispute has continued between the two sides. But I don't  believe we need to study the history of the region. A glance at  historic facts does reveal that part of Armenia belonged to  Azerbaijan in the past. I can point to the territory that  belonged to Azerbaijan on a map. It is known as Zangezur. That  area belonged to Azerbaijan in the past. Zangezur is a historic  part of Azerbaijan. It was transferred to the Armenians in  1920. In short, a glance at history will reveal that the  Armenians must return many things to Azerbaijan. We covet no  part of Armenia's territory.    Aliyev was asked: A glance at history will reveal that [word  indistinct] countries have the right to outline their views and  voice their demands. But everyone knows that the dispute began  after former President Gorbachev sent Aganbegyan to Paris. He  informed the Armenians in Paris that Karabakh must be united  with Armenia. A dispute with the Armenians in Azerbaijan did  not exist before then. It seems that Moscow and the local  residents in Karabakh must be blamed for the dispute. If that  is the case, then they must be blamed for the war. Can you  assess this? Aliyev replied: The people of Armenia and  Azerbaijan have had friendly relations and existed peacefully  for decades. True, the academician Aganbegyan said in Paris in  November 1987 that Karabakh must be united with Armenia. He  also said that Gorbachev gave his consent. That kindled the  bloody war. History will blame those who are responsible for  the dispute, regardless of who they are. They will be tried by  the people soon. The claim that the Armenians in Karabakh alone  are waging a war against Azerbaijan is wrong. The Karabakh  population is not even 100,000 people. How can 100,000 people,  including the elderly, women, and children, carry out combat  operations? How can 100,000 Armenians force 1 million  Azerbaijani people to become refugees? Undoubtedly, the issue  is Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan.    There is another question that our listeners will find  interesting: Can you comment on how you assessed Iran's  proposal to mediate? We hope you can also assess Iran's  relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Has Azerbaijan achieved  progress in its policy on Iran? Aliyev replied: Normal  relations exist between Azerbaijan and Iran. Due to the policy  maintained by the former Azerbaijani Administration, our  relations could not be described as normal until recently. No  problem exists right now. Iran and Azerbaijan have established  very favorable relations. So Iran has revealed that it can  mediate between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Iran has appealed to  Armenia in that regard. But we are convinced that mediation by  one country cannot be successful in such a complex situation.  The effort by international organizations must be united. We  have rejected no mediation effort by any country.    Dear listeners, we hope the war will end quickly, that peace  and security will be established, and that the Armenian  occupiers will withdraw from the occupied territories, but  Armenia has not [word indistinct]. President Geydar Aliyev's  visit to France and Britain has enabled the Western countries to  establish the identity of the aggressor. Misleading people is  no longer possible.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers tumbles to Pounds 432,000 Profits at Stoddard Sekers, the carpet and furnishings manufacturer, fell from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 432,000 in the half year ended September 30, reflecting continued deterioration in consumer durable products. With the purchase of BMK sales rose to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 22.2m). But those from the original group showed a fall because of a drop in volume and the effect of pricing pressures and a weaker mix of sales. The losses at BMK have been stemmed and the drop in pre-tax profit was attributable to other companies. Finance charges rose to Pounds 458,000 (Pounds 189,000). Earnings per share were 0.3p (1.2p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.75p. Gearing rose to 43 per cent with the purchase of BMK and assimilation of its debt.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISTER FRISKY IMPROVING, IS NOW ABLE TO EAT  </P> <P> Mister Frisky, the beaten favorite in the Kentucky Derby, was said to be  responding to treatment Sunday and gaining in his battle against a  life-threatening abscess in his throat.  </P> <P> The colt, who finished third in the Preakness, "is alert and responsive,  breathes normally and can eat hay and drink water with little difficulty," said  Dr. Scott E. Palmer, surgeon at the New Jersey Equine Clinic.  </P> <P> Mister Frisky lost about 100 pounds because he was unable to eat.  </P> <P> "He's not out of the woods yet, but he's making good progress and we can relax  a little," Palmer said.  </P> <P> The colt was listed in stable condition, responding well to antibiotics, but  remains in intensive care. Palmer said the abscess was drained and the  infection does not appear to have spread. The colt was being given medication  for a slight fever.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Fritz, the horse's veterinarian at Belmont Park, transferred Mister  Frisky to the clinic Thursday. Fritz said the growth probably interfered with  Mister Frisky's performance in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness.  </P> <P> Fritz believes the growth started before the Kentucky Derby. Mister Frisky won  his first 16 starts, but was beaten by 19 1/4 lengths at Churchill Downs,  finishing eighth.  </P></p>

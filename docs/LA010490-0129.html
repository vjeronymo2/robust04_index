			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIND GUSTS PUSH OIL SPILL CLOSER TO MOROCCO'S COAST;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE 100-SQUARE-MILE SLICK FROM A DAMAGED IRANIAN TANKER THREATENS  FISHERIES, BEACHES, WILDLIFE RESERVE.  </P> <P> With winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h., heavy sea swells pushed a 100-square-mile  oil slick to within 12 miles of Morocco's Atlantic coastline Wednesday,  hampering a cleanup operation and raising fears that the vessel could break up  in the storm.  </P> <P> Meteorologists said weather conditions deteriorated sharply Wednesday and  pushed the oil oozing from the 283,632-ton Iranian tanker Kharg 5 toward the  port of Oualidia, about 80 miles south of Casablanca.  </P> <P> Fisheries, tourist beaches, a migratory bird reserve and an important breeding  ground of pink flamingoes would be threatened by the oil, the Interior Ministry  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Moroccan authorities said floating barriers were laid along the coastline, but  French experts doubt they can withstand the high seas. Despite the weather,  cleanup crews continued to spray oil dispersants into the spill.  </P> <P> Morocco on Wednesday threatened to file a lawsuit against Iran's national oil  company as a result of the spill. It also criticized salvage workers for  reacting too slowly.  </P> <P> A series of unexplained explosions on the night of Dec. 18-19 tore through the  Kharg 5's hull, rupturing its tanks. So far, 70,000 tons of crude oil have been  spilled into Moroccan waters.  </P> <P> The tanker, which still has 200,000 tons of crude in its tanks, is reportedly  being towed to the Cape Verde Islands, where the remaining oil will be  unloaded, the salvage company said.  </P> <P> In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday that the Coast Guard is  sending a team of experts to Morocco in response to that government's request  for help.  </P> <P> In the Netherlands, a shipping official said that Dutch authorities had  prevented five Iranian supertankers from leaving Rotterdam in the last 14  months because they failed to meet international safety standards, the news  agency ANP said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The official said that three of the vessels are sister ships to the Kharg 5.  All the vessels were permitted to leave after the most necessary repairs were  made.  </P> <P> ANP quoted other officials as saying that one of the tankers was to have a  large hole in its engine room -- the result of an attack during the Iran-Iraq  War.  </P></p>

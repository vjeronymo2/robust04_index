			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK wants to accelerate talks on Patten's plan: Major says time very short for Hong Kong deal THE BRITISH government yesterday gave strong support to the efforts of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to broaden democracy in the colony and asked China to accelerate negotiations on his proposals. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said after a cabinet committee meeting chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that London had proposed 'that we move into a more intensive phase (of talks) straight away to try to reach agreement on the outstanding issues.' Britain wants to reach agreement quickly on uncontroversial aspects of elections in Hong Kong next year and in 1995, so negotiations can focus on the issues most in dispute with Beijing. However, after 15 rounds of talks over six months in which there has been little progress, ministers indicated that they would not allow negotiations to continue indefinitely. Mr Major told a London business conference on Hong Kong: 'Time is now very short. I do not believe, and nor does the governor, that an agreement is worth any price although we will do our best to get one.' He said he recognised that 'some in the business community would prefer that we did not have this argument.' But he said it was unavoidable. 'The point at issue is a vital one. We owe it to the people of Hong Kong to hold elections which give them a genuine choice.' Mr Hurd said: 'It is weeks rather than months in which we have to reach a conclusion.' He said quick agreement on uncontroversial matters would enable the legislative work to begin. Officials said this would provide more time for further talks on the main issues, though they cautioned that an agreement would still be needed by the end of the year to permit elections to proceed. The issues most in dispute are expansion of 'functional constituencies' from which business groups will elect 30 legislators; an election committee which will elect 10 legislators; and the 'through train' - retention of office by all 60 legislators elected in 1995 until 1999, two years after China assumes sovereignty. China indicated privately last week that it may be prepared to settle on the smaller issues. British officials see the next round of talks beginning November 19 as a key test of Beijing's willingness. Mr Hurd said Mr Christopher Hum, the senior foreign office official responsible for the Far East, will lead the British side in the next round. He will stand in for Sir Robin McLaren, the ambassador in Beijing, who had an operation this week on his back and will be out of action for some weeks, officials said. Britain wants to double the frequency of the talks to a round per week. Anti-corruption official sacked in Hong Kong, Page 6</p>

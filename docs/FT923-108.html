			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Sears to close 350 shops and shed 1,800 jobs SEARS, the UK retail and mail order group, will close 350 shops and shed up to 1,800 jobs over three years in the latest reorganisation of the British Shoe Corporation, which includes shops such as Dolcis, Saxone and Freeman Hardy Willis. The group also cut its interim dividend from 1.525p to 1p. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said the final would also be reduced to give a total of 3.5p, down from 5.355p. The cut came as no surprise to the market and the share price gained 8p to close at 80p. It has risen 25 per cent since last week's announcement of a withdrawal from men's wear. The Pounds 32.2m exceptional cost of rationalising British Shoe pushed Sears into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.8m in the six months to July 31, and increased the loss per share from 0.3p to 0.5p. Turnover slipped to Pounds 902m from Pounds 923.7m, reflecting a Pounds 55.2m fall from discontinued activities. Pre-tax losses for the same period last year were Pounds 2.4m after Pounds 25.2m of rationalisation costs for men's wear. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive since February, said the stream of exceptional charges was over. The announcement of job-cutting at British Shoe follows a 2,000 reduction in the workforce over the past year. After converting some of the closed shops and opening others out-of-town, the net effect would be to reduce the number of shops from 1,200 to to 1,000. The number of concessions (shops within shops) stays at about 570. Freeman Hardy Willis and Curtess would be most affected. 'They sell shoes cheaply to all the family,' said Mr Strong. The footwear division recovered from a trading loss of Pounds 3.3m to a profit of Pounds 1.9m on sales of Pounds 249.4m, down Pounds 7.7m. Dolcis improved on last year's good figures and Saxone returned to like-for-like sales growth. Verdict Research, which monitors the retail sector, said British Shoe had 18.3 per cent of the UK's Pounds 3.73bn shoe market last year. The market had been flat in real terms since 1986. Other divisions contributed to Sears' Pounds 27.4m trading profit as follows: speciality retailing - children's wear, women's wear and leisurewear - up to Pounds 6.5m; Selfridges department store, up to Pounds 5.5m; home shopping, down to Pounds 11.9m; property up to Pounds 8.5m; others, mainly discontinued, lost Pounds 6.9m.

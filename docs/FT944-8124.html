			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / French right to study US-style primaries France's centre-right coalition parties finally agreed yesterday to study the practicalities of US-style primary elections to select a single conservative candidate to carry their colours in the race for the Elysee. After months of desultory discussion about the dangers of a divided conservative movement losing a third successive presidential election next year, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister and interim president of the RPR Gaullists, and Mr Francois Bayrou, education minister and secretary general of the centre-right UDF federation, agreed on a joint feasibility study of primaries. The study group would report by Christmas, Mr Juppe said, on whether primaries could be held and, if so, how. The RPR leader said there was now no time to lose, with the first round of the presidential election set for April 23 and the final round on May 7. Any primaries would have to be held 'by January-February, at the outside', he said. In the aftermath of their second defeat at the hands of President Francois Mitterrand, the RPR and UDF did in fact sign 'a charter for primaries a la francaise' in 1991. This stipulated that their parties' members and loyalists should vote in primaries held by region and at weekly intervals ending no later than 13 weeks before the first presidential election round. But all this remained a dead letter until very recently. That primaries are now at least a possibility for the French right is largely due to Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR interior minister, who has been campaigning for them for months. But up to now the problem has been that proponents of primaries have been suspected of being closet supporters of Mr Edouard Balladur, because the RPR prime minister leads his fellow Gaullist, Mr Jacques Chirac, in opinion surveys. The Chirac camp, as well as some UDF politicians, have therefore shied away from the idea of primaries as favouring the Balladur campaign. But the steady rise in the polls of Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president who is weighing a Socialist presidential bid, at last seems to have convinced the Chirac campaign - of which Mr Juppe is co-president - of the need for an early end to their divisive civil war with Mr Balladur. Primaries for the RPR and UDF would require no legislation, because they would be an internal party matter. But by the same token, organisers would not be able to use state facilities, such as town halls, as voting booths. Mr Juppe said it would also be important to prevent outsiders infiltrating the ballot and for all candidates to promise to respect the eventual result.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by De Wet Potgieter: "Police Boss Warns Government </F> About Truth Commission; High Ranking Officers Probably Guilty"]    [Text] You are digging a hole for others. Watch out -- you  will also fall into that hole.    This is the implication of a serious warning delivered by  Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe this week to the  ANC-controlled government over the planned Commission of Truth  and Reconciliation. The commission's task is to hear  confessions from "criminals" of the apartheid era. This could  lead to top members of the ANC's National Executive Committee  [NEC], as well as members of cabinet, being scorched as a result  of terrorist activities during this period. This could be a big  embarrassment for the ANC.    RAPPORT is in possession of a harshly worded document in  which General van der Merwe issues a stern warning to the  government over the establishment of the planned commission.  The general also deals sharp blows to the Goldstone Commission.  According to him the Goldstone Commission has come forward with  wild allegations against the security forces which still cannot  be proven in a court of law.    General van der Merwe also points out to government that the  Skweyiya Commission of Inquiry warned back in August 1992 that  "no one guilty of crimes should ever again be allowed to occupy  an official post. If the ANC is not willing to take definite  steps in this regard then the risk of repetition will always be  present."  <H5>  Names </H5>   The document, handed to Minister of Safety and Security  Sydney Mufamadi on Wednesday, names among others Defense  Minister Joe Modise, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale,  Ministers Joe Slovo and Mac Maharaj, and Mr. Jacob Zuma, Mr.  Siphiwe Nyanda, and Ronnie Kasrils as "the prominent members of  the ANC implicated in certain acts of terror."    The commissioner's document mentions a firm commitment to  see  to his men in the police service. The sharp words of warning to  the government is regarded as an urgent attempt to defuse the  explosive situation behind the scenes and to prevent any  irresponsible actions.    Certain former members of the disbanded security branch and  serving members of the Criminal Investigation Department were  involved in the struggle against the ANC under the old  dispensation. All parties who participated in the struggle may  be involved in the scuffle, to the embarrassment of all  concerned, especially the current government of national unity.  According to General van der Merwe, police investigations,  evidence heard in court cases, as well as other available  information, indicated that members of the ANC and Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing], involved in  the gruesome violation of human rights, did this under the  orders of the National Executive Committee of the ANC.  <H5>  Acts of Terrorism </H5>   "During the 1976-1990 period at least 623 acts of sabotage,  terrorism, murder, car bomb explosions, and landmine explosions  can be directly linked to the ANC. In these acts of terrorism  153 people have died, 1,158 people were injured, and more than  20 million rands of damage caused."    Some of the attackers were caught and charged but others hid  outside the country's borders. In some cases there was  overwhelming proof that certain acts of terrorism were carried  out by senior members of the ANC's NEC abroad, or approved by  them. "Today these individuals occupy senior positions in  government," according to the document by General van der Merwe.  (The implication is that they are occupying these positions in  contradiction with the above mentioned quote by the Skweyiya  Commission: "No person guilty of crimes ... should ever again  be allowed to occupy an official post.")    The commissioner mentions individual examples of the most  gruesome cases:     -  25 January 1980 -- Silverton bank siege;    -  20 May 1983 -- Church Street bomb in Pretoria;    -  3 April 1984 -- Durban car bomb;    -  23 December 1985 -- Amanzimtoti bomb;    -  9 January 1986 -- landmine explosion in Durban;    -  14 June 1986 -- Durban car bomb;    -  Several landmine explosions in the rural areas of Transvaal  during 1986;    -  20 May 1987 -- landmine explosion at the Johannesburg Court;  and    -  Several attacks in restaurants and shopping centers.   <H5>  Temporary Indemnity </H5>   Members of the ANC's NEC are enjoying temporary indemnity  until 17 May next year. If no amnesty is granted by 17 May then  civil or criminal charges could be laid against alleged  criminals. "The members of the NEC have never publicly  apologized for the crimes they were responsible for. These  people are, therefore, legally responsible for these acts even  if it is just as accomplices, and in many cases as co-accused,"  says Gen. van der Merwe. He adds that it should be emphasized  that not a single member of the ANC's NEC has thus far applied  for indemnity, but have only been granted temporary indemnity  from prosecution.    "The Commission (of Truth and Reconciliation) will lead to  further mistrust in the South African Police Services and an  increase in acts of violence against its members. An atmosphere  of mistrust will prevail, affecting prominent individuals  occupying senior positions in government. Steps will have to be  taken to ensure that the amnesty process is not politicized and  does not result in renewed racial conflict and acts of  terrorism."  <H5>  General Amnesty </H5>   RAPPORT was told that before the elections, police officers,  who insisted behind the scenes that government grant general  amnesty, are waiting to see how the government reacts to the  commissioner's report before further action is decided upon  concerning the establishment of the Commission of Truth and  Reconciliation.    General van der Merwe's document also refers to the Douglas  Commission and the Motsuenyane Commission, who both heard  evidence on terrible violations of human rights committed by ANC  members while they were outside the country's borders. "These  violations of human rights include murder, serious attacks, and  torture," according to the document. The names of Minister of  Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo, Mr. Joe Slovo, Mr. Modise, Mr.  Kasrils, and Mr. Nhlanhla, implicated in the reports of the  above-mentioned commissions, are mentioned.</p>

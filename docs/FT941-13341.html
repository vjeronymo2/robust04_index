			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Arts: Perils of the presentation game - Television Look for trends in television current affairs programmes early in 1994 and only one thing is really clear: numbers are going up. Much the same is true of all other programme categories, but current affairs may be the best place to identify other developments also occurring to a greater or lesser extent throughout the medium, but more easily detectable here than elsewhere. In style and presentation there are two trends, and they seem to be moving in opposite directions. Of course in the centre there is still plenty of conventionally constructed work. In last week's Assignment on BBC2 Brian Barron in Hong Kong, investigating the approach to Britain's surrender of the territory in 1997, provided the sort of exhaustive report which the better current affairs series have always made. There cannot have been anybody of consequence that Barron did not interview. Three weeks ago, also on BBC2, there was an exemplary, structurally familiar, and highly enjoyable profile of the journalist and politician Bill Deedes in Dear Bill. In last week's Undercover Britain series on Channel 4 Graham Hall contributed a report on the torture and killing of badgers which was enough to fill the most timid viewer with a lust for vengeance against the sadists who make their dogs drag out badgers by the nose from their underground setts. However, while the programme was vivid, deeply upsetting, and shot by one man using hidden camera equipment, it was put together in a familiar enough way. There was some reference to Hall's exploits, as there had to be, but he was not promoted as the programme's chief focus of interest, not even as much as Roger Cook is in his investigative programmes. We were kept informed by a perfectly ordinary script delivered in voice-over. However, increasing numbers of programmes do not conform to the old conventions. On the one hand, there are those which merely shovel material into the viewer's lap, abandoning the use not only of a presenter but even of a voice-over. On the whole such programmes are clearly not expected to be big ratings winners. On the other hand there are more and more soft, user-friendly programmes which obviously are meant to attract big audiences and in which a 'personality' presenter is a vital part of the attraction, sometimes the most important part, as with BBC1's Thursday night series Jonathan Ross Presents and possibly even Michael Winner's True Crimes on ITV. A particularly striking instance is The Bigger Picture on BBC2 in which the presenter, comedian Billy Connolly, proves considerably more interesting than the subject matter - Scottish art. Channel 4's archaeology series, Time Team, looked at first as though it might be another example since the presenter, for no clear reason, is Tony Robinson, best known as Baldrick, the idiot with a cunning plan in the Blackadder series. In Time Team, sounding like an enthusiastic primary school teacher, Robinson turns out to be a rather good presenter; moreover the computer graphics used to superimpose a Roman fort, say, on a picture of the countryside as it is today, work very well. It is the underlying structure of the programme which is irritating, having been modelled, it seems, on Challenge Anneka. Instead of investigating King Alfred's stronghold at Athelney in the normal manner, the archaeologists are obliged to do it at the trot, in three days, in response to some sort of challenge from a (supposed?) letter writer. The archaeology is in perpetual danger of being smothered under the game element. But even more annoying than the 'Never mind the programme, look at me' style is the opposite extreme where the producers pretend that the material is reaching the viewer untouched by human hand; quite unmediated. A prime example was a recent edition of 40 Minutes called 'Caraline's Story' which purported to reveal, solely through her own mouth, the history of a woman suffering from anorexia and bulimia. The difficulty with this approach is that the viewer has no way of knowing how much credence to give to the subject: was Caraline's account of childhood abuse the gospel truth or a classic case of False Memory Syndrome? How should we know, the producer shirked his journalistic responsibility to investigate and explain and left us to guess for ourselves. Worse, he had shot Caraline's neurotic activities - bolting food and vomiting it down the lavatory - in a way that made Polanski's Repulsion look like Bambi: huge closeups of gobbling lips accompanied by amplified slurping effects, and then horror-movie back lighting to give Karloff-like dramatisation to the lavatory sequences. What you might call manipulator-on-the wall television. Happily this season has also brought Further Abroad, a BBC2 series on Fridays, presented by Jonathan Meades, which is impossible to categorise. The first three of the five programmes have dealt with high buildings and consequent vertigo, brewing and pubs, and golf courses. Still to come are pigs and Belgium. Some might say that Meades' chief concern is architecture, others that it is the English class system, and yet others that it is to champion the old over the new. For comparison some of Lucinda Lambton's programmes might come to mind, though you could be nearer the mark with John Betjeman's poetry and even The Sloane Ranger Handbook. The programmes are wonderfully funny, first because Meades is witty: 'Marmite, a German invention, a French name, an English institution. But that's not so odd really, many of our institutions are imports; think of the royal family, think of vindaloo, think of Rottweilers'. Second because he takes trouble with his scripts, which demand that you listen: 'This utilitarian landscape is golf's answer to, and unfortunate apeing of, agri-industrial prairie. It refers only to itself.' Third, Meades and his producers, David Turnbull and Russell England, have set out deliberately to undermine and ridicule some of the supposed rules of television presentation. An interviewee talks into the lens and years of viewing tell us that Meades must be behind the camera and that in a moment we shall see him in a reverse shot  . . except that we suddenly notice him miles away in the background in his usual double-breasted blue suit and dark glasses. So who is the interviewee talking to? Us of course. The golf programme included the thesis that English golf courses are a form of Scottish colonialism, so Meades appeared at the beginning, wandering onto the links from a sunlit pine forest miming 'Annie Laurie' to an Andy Stewart recording. There are few things more suspect in the eyes of some English viewers than cleverness. 'He's too clever by half', they say, and no doubt loathe this series. Yet although Meades is sometimes flippant and occasionally deliberately absurd he has serious points to make, whether about the motives for putting up tall buildings, the social pretentions of some suburban golfers, or the odd contrast between the high-tech surroundings of the places where beer is brewed and the contrived merrie Englande atmosphere of the places where it is sold. We tend to believe that, like effective medicine, 'serious' programmes ought to be thoroughly unpleasant to ingest, so the splendidly entertaining nature of this series may count against it. But if there is any justice it will win awards. It is inconceivable that the series should inspire enough imitations to lead to a sea change in current affairs television generally because it depends wholly upon Meades' idiosyncratic personality. However, it does prove that outstanding programmes can be created which depend neither on soft-centred celebrity presentation, nor on the scriptless fly-on-the-wall formula.</p>

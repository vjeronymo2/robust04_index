			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Counting the cost of a less than easy route into Spain / A look at the complexities that Bibby faced over its hostile Pounds 86m takeover of Finanzauto J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural group, has broken new ground as the first wholly-owned foreign corporation to acquire a Spanish company in a hostile takeover. Establishing the precedent proved more nerve-wracking and costlier than had been originally envisaged. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman of Bibby, says he has 'no regrets' about the company's acquisition last week of Finanzauto, Spain's leading supplier of earthmoving equipment. 'There was nothing that happened which made us feel 'gosh, we should never have gone in'.' On paper it had looked like a pushover purchase. Bibby is 79 per cent-owned by Barlow Rand of South Africa, which has longstanding ties with Caterpillar of the US. Caterpillar backed the takeover and Finanzauto is the sole distributor of Caterpillar equipment in Spain. Finanzauto, moreover, looked ripe for a friendly takeover. Its consolidated profits plummeted by 68 per cent to Pounds 4.8m last year. It faced the bleak prospect of a worsening domestic construction slump exacerbated by delayed government payments to contractors. But instead of welcoming Bibby's overtures, Finanzauto resisted them. The Spanish company's response was, in part, a knee jerk reaction against a foreign bidder that had taken a cheap acquisition for granted. The controversial six-month long struggle to take over Finanzauto was nonetheless more complex than that and it produced valuable lessons for all concerned. A sample of opinions over the acquisition process includes the following: Mr William Connelly, of Barings, Bibby's advisers, learnt that Class One purchases, a denomination which included the Bibby bid and which requires shareholder approval under UK company law, are inherently risky in Spain: 'We were faced with two basically different company legislations which were in conflict and contradictory.' Mr Santiago Eguidazu, of Madrid brokers Asesores Bursatiles who advised Finanzauto, discovered that a very diluted equity - nearly 80 per cent of Finanzauto's stock was held by 14,000-odd small shareholders - does not mean a trouble free bid, even when the market is as exceptionally depressed as Spain's is. 'A very efficient defence can be mounted for very little money and the board, representing the shareholders, will insist on a good price.' A senior analyst at a top Madrid valuation firm believed that Finanzauto could be partly faulted because it initially failed to put a proper price on its company. 'It should have put in place a reputable investment bank in order to get a reputable valuation.' Lack of such a valuation left the impression that Bibby paid a moderate price. A senior corporate finance manager at a London-based accountancy firm reckoned Bibby partly brought problems upon itself. 'Lesson one is get yourself an adviser with a good knowledge of the Spanish markets and lesson two is don't underestimate the Spaniards.' The implication was that Bibby bought over the odds. As the divergent views indicate, Bibby had anything but an easy ride. It initially approached Finanzauto, via Barings, in February. But then over the past three months Bibby clashed openly with the Spanish company's board over pricing, scorned the way it had managed its business, had its original takeover bid rejected by Madrid's stock exchange commission and finished up paying Pounds 86.2m, for Finanzauto, Pounds 11m more than it had originally intended. At the core of the UK company's tension-fraught acquisition was the Class One category of its bid. Because Bibby's original offer of Pounds 75m for Finanzauto made a significant impact on its own market capitalisation and because, by consolidating Finanzauto's debt it exceeded its own borrowing limitations, Bibby was obliged, under UK company law, to issue a Class One circular to its shareholders and to request them to waiver the limitations at an extraordinary general meeting. The delay for shareholder approval eliminates the surprise factor of a bid and allows the target company to kill it either through introducing home grown defensive mechanisms or by invit-ing in counter offers. Madrid's stock exchange commission automatically suspended trading in Finanzauto shares when Bibby informed it of its bid on account of the price sensitive nature of the information. But when Bibby was unable to simultaneously deliver an egm vote of shareholder support, the commission lifted the suspension as soon as it was satisfied that the market was aware of the development. Mr Mansell-Jones says Bibby made it clear to the commission that Barlow Rand, Bibby's majority owners, backed the acquisition. To his chagrin the market regulators chose however a 'legalistic' interpretation and insisted on a shareholder vote at the egm. The commission offered a different interpretation. Bibby knew perfectly well that its shareholder support documentation was not in order but it put in its bid anyway in the hope of scaring off any counterbidders. 'Bibby should have acted quickly and delivered the price sensitive information and the shareholder support at the same time', said a commission spokesman.' The upshot was that over a 14 day period last month Finanzauto resumed trading on the Madrid stock exchange; and Bibby, which was awaiting its egm, could only watch Finanzauto's share price rise and worry about rival bids. Additionally, Bibby discovered what Mr Mansell-Jones calls a 'critical difference' between the London and Madrid market practices. As the offer period came to a close, the UK company found itself unable to count the acceptances and thereby decide whether to walk away, maintain the offer or revise it. 'We were operating in the dark, we couldn't take the temperature,' Bibby's chairman says. The UK company believed that its offer of Pta1,300 (Pounds 7) per share had a 'sporting chance' but offered no certainties. It therefore unilaterally chose to increase the bid to Pta1,500. Bibby's predicament was increased by the highly aggressive defence mounted by Asesores Bursatiles, Finanzauto's advisers. It included a wide-ranging press campaign, letters to individual shareholders and detailed presentations to the institutions. 'Our strategy was to convince everyone that Finanzauto was worth more than what Bibby was saying,' said Mr Eguidazu of Asesores. By last week when more than 80 per cent of Finanzauto's shareholders accepted the increased price, there were neither winners nor losers.</p>

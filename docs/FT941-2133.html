			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (10): English is new French weapon - Continental schools are seeking to internationalise their intake The relatively small domestic market is one reason why the leading French business schools are pushing for foreign MBA students. Insead's intake has long been international. The Institut Superieur des Affaires (HEC) and ESC Lyon say that respectively 30 per cent and nearly 20 per cent of participants in their current classes are non-French. ' Our objective is to increase the proportion to 30 per cent in three years, and 50 per cent in the next five to seven years,' says Patrick Molle, dean of Lyon's MBA programme. HEC/ISA's MBA is already fully bilingual, but next September Lyon plans to introduce an international track for foreign students. Until now, core courses at Lyon have been in French, which has tended to restrict non-nationals to those with French spouses, family connections, and educational backgrounds. The new English courses - 20 per cent of the Lyon Faculty already teach in English - will be accompanied by full time tuition in French. As for markets, Molle is targeting Canada, Scandinavia, Germany and Spain, and plans to tackle the Asian markets over the longer term. The cost and time pressures bearing down on MBA students in France are little different from those elsewhere - but neither Lyon (full time programme one year) nor ISA (16 months) has much interest in the part-time approach. Lyon is, nevertheless, contemplating a two to three year option which would enable students to spread studies over a longer period and remain with their employer. 'Last year 60 per cent of our students went back to their old company, which would have been unthinkable five years ago', observes Molle. 'At the moment only 10 per cent are paid for by their employers, though I don't think the proportion could go much beyond 15 per cent.' At ISA, the dean, Eric Briys, is a strong defender of the full time MBA. Part time programmes cannot generate the mutual enrichment which comes from mixing people from different backgrounds and the total intellectual immersion and freedom from corporate responsibilities afforded by an extended training sabbatical, he says. Moreover, full time participants, display a risk-taking propensity which should bode well for their future careers. Briys believes, however, that what he calls the geometry of risk has become unbalanced for the student. He advocates more imaginative loan schemes and tuition fees, linked to performance or subsequent salary. ISA is also notable for its imaginative course content. Rather than teaching business ethics in the classroom, it sends students four times a year to the French Alps to study with Benedictine monks at the monastery of Notre-Dame de Ganagobie.</p>

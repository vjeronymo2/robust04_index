			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL ZEROES IN ON SITE FOR CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday took the first step toward acquiring property owned  by the Mission Viejo Co. for a civic center complex.  </P> <P> The council voted 4 to 1 to set up a subcommittee to investigate obtaining  eight acres at Chrisanta Drive and La Paz Road that would give the city enough  room to build a civic center, a community theater and expand a county library  on the site.  </P> <P> That parcel is now occupied by an Edwards Theatres movie complex and the  Mission Viejo Co. headquarters.  </P> <P> The council has already voted to bid on another City Hall site and last week  authorized its staff to make an offer of about $3 million on a two-story office  building at 24800 Chrisanta Drive.  </P> <P> The council's decision was angrily opposed by Councilman Robert A. Curtis, who  had negotiated with the Mission Viejo Co. last week to donate 7.2 acres of land  near Crown Valley Parkway and Interstate 5 for a civic center complex.  </P> <P> The land grant would have been tied to the city's approval of a 719-home  housing project in east Mission Viejo and the development of a hotel and  commercial project.  </P> <P> "I think this is an absolutely ludicrous attempt to undermine this gift of 7.2  acres," Curtis said. "I intend to protect this opportunity against any  ill-advised effort to sabotage it."  </P> <P> But Councilman William S. Craycraft, Councilwoman Victoria C. Jaffe and Mayor  Christian W. Keena have labeled as inappropriate Curtis' efforts to negotiate  an agreement on his own.  </P> <P> But Curtis said it would be "foolish" to reject the Crown Valley property  "regardless of its genesis and embark on a route whose ramifications have yet  to be fully explored."  </P> <P> Jaffe said the approval of the committee does not mean that the city has  committed itself to a City Hall site. "This does not in any way bind or tie the  hands of the council," she added. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

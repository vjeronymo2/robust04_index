			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uganda in Dollars 54m cobalt development UGANDA SIGNED a development agreement for a Dollars 54m project yesterday that should see that country become a substantial cobalt producer, contributing about 5 per cent of western world output by 1995. Barclays Metals of the UK, part of the Barclays Bank group, is marketing agent for the project, and BRGM, the state-owned French mining group, is the technical agent. Each will have a 27.5 per cent stake with the Ugandan government owning the rest. The aim is to produce for at least 15 years an annual 1,000 tonnes of cobalt  -an essential metal in some of the superalloys used by the aerospace industry and for some motor industry products - from waste dumps at the old Kilembe copper mine on the edge of the Queen Elizabeth National Park in south-west Uganda. The partners plan to built a pilot plant as part of a detailed Dollars 4m feasibility study over the next 12 months. This will provide the basis for a full scale, Dollars 50m, bioleaching, solvent extraction and electrowinning plant at Kasese. Copper production stopped there in 1972 since when various methods to recover cobalt have been looked at and found to be either too expensive or too polluting. However, BRGM (Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres) has developed a method where thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, a naturally occuring bacteria that is being used by some copper, gold and uranium miners to liberate metal from ore, can be employed. The partners claim that bioleaching is not only the least costly way of extracting Uganda's cobalt, it is also the most environmentally-friendly method. They suggest cobalt can produced profitably at its long-term historic average price of Dollars 10 to Dollars 12 a lb. Cobalt is at present about Dollars 25 a lb on the European free market, having doubled in price recently following production and political problems in Zaire and Zambia which between them account for about 70 per cent of western production of the metal.</p>

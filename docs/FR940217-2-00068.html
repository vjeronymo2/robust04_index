This priority is consistent with a HRSA strategy to increase the number of minority health professionals, to assure equal access to health professions education for all population groups, and ultimately, to provide a greater volume of health care in underserved areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also proposed that a funding priority be given for projects that address the program purpose of reducing the incidence of domestic violence. The incidence of reported violence, especially domestic or family violence, has increased significantly in recent decades. This proposed priority is intended to provide incentive to schools of public health to take responsibility for helping to reduce domestic violence through the special projects grant program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed funding priorities.

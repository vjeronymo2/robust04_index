			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: High prices bring no joy in Mexico - Ted Bardacke on problems faced by the fourth largest producer Mexico, the world's fourth largest coffee producer, is unlikely to benefit from the recent price surge because of falling production and the government's decision not to join the Latin America-wide export retention programme instituted last year. Instead, the small farmers who make up the bulk of the country's producers are lamenting the price rise, saying the survival strategy they patched together after the government abandoned the sector five years ago has suddenly been undermined. Meanwhile, coffee processors, now forced by declining production to consider importing raw beans, have also seen balance sheets thrown into disarray by the price mayhem. 'No one here is interested in these prices,' says Mr Luis Hernandez, a consultant to the National Co-ordinating Committee of Coffee Producers Organisations (CNOC). 'There will be no bonanza. For the moment, it is going to make our lives more difficult.' Growers will be unable to take immediate advantage of the high prices because they sold their entire crop by the end of March, two months before prices started their latest climb. Stored reserves have been completely depleted during five straight years of declining production. Since 1989 Mexican coffee output has fallen by 35 per cent to 5.3m bags (60kg each) this year. The price collapse that began after the International Coffee Organisation abandoned price support efforts in 1989 means that growers incomes have fallen by 65 per cent over the same period, according to the CNOC. The decline in production cannot be completely explained by the dramatic fall in earnings. Compounding the problem was the government's 1989 decision  -as part of its sweeping reduction in participation in the economy - to abolish Imecafe, which served the triple role of credit provider, buyer and wholesale marketer. The same free market logic led agriculture officials to refuse to join the retention programme set up last year, which is reaping big dividends for those countries which did participate and so have extra coffee to sell at today's dramatically improved prices. The armed uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the country's largest coffee producing state, forced the government to offer a one-off handout of USDollars 210 a hectare to coffee growers throughout the country. But that is unlikely to stimulate much new production. 'I'm going to use this money to buy corn for my family, not fertiliser for my orchard. I've got no other choice, life is hard,' confessed Mr Neojito Morales, a grower in the central state of San Luis Potosi, upon learning that a government check was coming his way. The abrupt disappearance of Imecafe also forced growers to explore new marketing avenues for their harvests. A variety of new associations sprang up that eliminated some of the middle-men who preyed on the industry. But according to Mr Hernandez, these associations will have a tough job surviving the price rise because more credit will be needed next year to collect harvested coffee in volumes sufficiently large enough to be commercially viable. 'Credit is scarce and expensive, so we are going to see a resurgence of the middle-man, who of course will not offer the full market price, but will be able to give growers more cash up front,' Mr Hernandez says. In addition, some Mexican growers have been successful in selling their crops in the organic and gourmet niche markets; but the price differential between those niches and the standard coffee is rapidly being wiped out by the general price increase. Lack of reserves and the disappearance of traditional sourcing options is forcing processors to consider importing raw coffee for the first time in living memory, according to the National Association of Coffee Industry. Association members are under tremendous pressure to compete with instant coffee imports, volumes of which have increased dramatically since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect. Yet what seemed like a viable option a couple of months ago has suddenly become very expensive. Passing the price increase on to consumers is a possibility, but a dangerous one, given Mexico's weak level of coffee consumption, less than 1kg a year per head, the lowest among the world's major producing nations.</p>

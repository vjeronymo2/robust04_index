Mr Mfeya said he was phoning from  central Cape Town. "The Afrikaner regime should expect more  attacks. APLA confirms these operations will continue as long  as our people don't have the vote...Ours is the vote for  majority rule. APLA operations will continue as long as our  people are being maimed and killed by the SA Defence Force and  police."    SAPA was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of  the  claim. Mr Mfeya would give no more details of the attack other  than those reported.</p>

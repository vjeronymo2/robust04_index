			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other commenters were in favor of obligating facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to bear the cost of temporary management, and several asked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we state that the cost of temporary management is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an allowable expense for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommended that the salary payment be funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the facility but routed to the State which would deliver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the payment to the temporary manager. The commenter was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that direct facility payment would undermine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectivity of the temporary manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We will continue to require that facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay the salary of the temporary manager, and we will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deem this cost to be an allowable expense for Medicare or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid reimbursement. We believe that to do otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would undermine our enforcement efforts to motivate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action and encourage sustained substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. If we relieved facilities of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for bearing the costs of correcting serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, we would be providing them with a clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disincentive to remain in substantial compliance. We also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that providing the services of a temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without charging for them would be an inappropriate response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a facility's failure to meet the responsibility it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed upon entering the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet participation requirements. A noncompliant facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be held accountable for breaches of responsibility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, it (and not HCFA or the State) should bear the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of the temporary management it has incurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because responsibility for paying for the cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management is one condition of the remedy, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's unwillingness to pay will be considered a failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to relinquish control to the temporary manager, and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause the facility to be subject to the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination instead. A facility's inability to pay for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of the temporary management will have the same result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A provision has been added at paragraph (c)(4) to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this. The conspicuous absence of consideration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's financial condition as a statutory criterion for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing temporary management (as opposed to its inclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a criterion for determining the amount of a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty) implies that the Congress did not intend for it to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a factor in imposition of the remedy. Consequently, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are also compelled to proceed with action to terminate those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities that are unable to assume the cost of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe that our position conflicts with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory references cited by certain commenters. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act states that funds collected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State as a result of imposition of civil money penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be applied to the protection of the health or property  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary finds deficient, including maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or closure. A temporary manager does not maintain operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a facility. Rather, it is the facility ownership that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for sustaining facility operations. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State assumes control of a facility after it has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abandoned by its ownership, then it would be appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State to use civil money penalty funds to pay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses of maintaining the abandoned facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also believe that commenters misinterpreted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of the Act found at section 1919(h)(2)(E). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section states that the reasonable expenditures of a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide for temporary management shall be considered for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal payment purposes to be necessary for the proper and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient administration of the State plan. We believe this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refers to the resources necessary to locate, orient, guide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and monitor the temporary manager, and does not include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of the temporary manager's service itself. When a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility pays for the temporary manager, we believe that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be unnecessarily circuitous to route the salary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment to the State before delivering it to the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager, and disagree that direct payment would compromise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the temporary manager's objectivity. A facility would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to use the temporary manager's salary as leverage to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence his or her actions because a facility could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively keep the salary from the temporary manager. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager would be paid even if the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempted to withhold his or her salary because HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State could recoup the amount owed to the temporary manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from payments later made to the facility. Therefore, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring that the facility pay the salary of the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager directly, and are modifying the provision at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.415(c) to reflect this.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A large number of commenters believed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities should not be given the opportunity to refuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management. Commenters were concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities would reject temporary management if given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choice, thereby subjecting residents to continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care, promoting facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminations, and exposing residents to relocation trauma.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

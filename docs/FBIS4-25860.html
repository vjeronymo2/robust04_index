			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yin Hongzhu </F> (1438 7703 4376)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, delivered a report  on economic work [as received] at a national education  conference this afternoon. He said: The national conference is  very important. The party Central Committee and the State  Council are attaching great importance to it, and General  Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have made important  speeches to give specific guidance to the conference.    Zhu Rongji said: Education remains the focus of China's  strategy and an important part of China's modernization drive.  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on attaching  importance to education, respecting knowledge, and respecting  trained professionals, China has scored marked achievements in  educational work. Leaders at all levels should follow the  teaching of Comrade Xiaoping and grasp education as if they were  doing economic work.    Zhu Rongji said: The current economic situation in China is  good. After the introduction of several major reform measures,  such as the financial and tax reform and the banking reform,  this year, the basic framework for a socialist market economic  structure has taken shape in China, and work in this respect is  progressing smoothly. Along with the development of the  economy, we will certainly be able to advance China's education  to a new level through this conference and under the leadership  of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core.    The afternoon the conference was presided over by Vice  Premier Li Lanqing.</p>

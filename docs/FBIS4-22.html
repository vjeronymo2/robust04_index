			<p>SUMMARY                                 Suggesting that Romanian willingness to enforce United Nations  economic sanctions against Belgrade is waning, Romanian President  Ion Iliescu, during a visit to Bucharest by Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic, criticized the sanctions as counterproductive  to the search for peace in former Yugoslavia.  Although Romanian  authorities had indicated their weakening support for the  sanctions since early this year, Iliescu's criticism was the  strongest authoritative statement to emerge so far from the  Romanian Government.  Despite Romania's wavering, other bordering  states are apparently holding the line on supporting sanctions.                          END SUMMARY     Breaking ranks with other neighbors of former Yugoslavia, Romania  has called for an end to the UN sanctions against Belgrade.  Speaking at a press conference during Milosevic's 5 April visit  to Bucharest, Iliescu declared the UN embargo a "forceful  measure" akin to military action that does not contribute to  "finding a solution to the problem" in former Yugoslavia.  As an  alternative, he argued, lifting the sanctions would be "an  important element" in "creating premises for finding peaceful  solutions" to the conflict.  While Iliescu did not go so far as  to declare that Romania would not continue to enforce the  sanctions, he and Milosevic did agree that Romania and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY--Serbia and Montenegro) make  preparations for immediate resumption of trade pending the  lifting of the embargo (Bucharest radio, 5 April).     Recent statements from the Romanians, who have long complained of  the adverse effects on their economy of the UN sanctions against  the FRY, foreshadowed Iliescu's 5 April remarks.  Foreign  Minister Teodor Melanescu recently expressed support for the  "slackening or complete lifting of the sanctions" as progress is  made "during negotiations" toward a peaceful settlement of the  conflict (Rompres, 1 April).  In a January interview, Iliescu  expressed his displeasure with continuation of the sanctions.  Criticizing unnamed "international bodies" for not treating the  crisis in former Yugoslavia with "adequate understanding," he  charged that they were taking an "approach" that "has been quite  dangerous'' for Yugoslavia and ''for the stability'' of the the  entire region."  The UN sanctions have caused "suffering to all  innocent people'' and ''nobody stands to gain'' from the  continuation of this abnormal situation" (Dimineata, 29-30  January).  At about the same time, Bucharest radio quoted FRY  Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic's claims that, during  Jovanovic's January visit to Bucharest, Iliescu said Romania had  never advocated and never supported" the "inhuman and very  harmful sanctions" (Bucharest radio, 25 January).  Iliescu has  not been observed to deny the accuracy of Jovanovic's  recollection.     Other States Claim Firm Stand     At least for now, the other states bordering the FRY continue to  declare their intentions to do their best to enforce the  sanctions:     -- Foreign Ministers Stanislav Daskalov of Bulgaria and Alfred  Serreqi of Albania recently met in Tirana and, according to the  Albanian media, declared that the "embargo against Serbia must  not be lifted" (ATA, 29 March).     -- Following a visit to Belgrade, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszensky reiterated his country's stance that Hungary "supports  the lifting of sanctions" only if "Belgrade meets international  expectations" (Budapest radio, 7 February).  Moreover, he denied  that Hungary would "ease sanctions" enforcement "in return for a  more tolerant policy" in the FRY toward Serbia's Hungarian  minority population (MTI, 7 February).     -- While the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has sought  relief from the UN for the severe impact of the sanctions on its  economy, President Kiro Gligorov has insisted that his country  has "consistently" done its "part in the implementation" of the  sanctions (Nova Makedonija, l October 1993).     Implications     While Iliescu did not threaten to end enforcement of sanctions in  Romania as long as they are still legally in force, his  statements suggest that Romanian officials are unlikely to take  vigorous enforcement.  Indeed, Romanian border guards and customs  officials may well take Iliescu's  remarks as a signal that they  should look the other way at sanctions violators.  Moreover,  other frontline states may question the wisdom of taking strong  enforcement action if Romania begins to gain economically by  allowing the sanctions regime to deteriorate on its borders.

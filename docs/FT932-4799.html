			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Guatemala minister dismissed MR Ramiro de Leon Carpio, Guatemala's new president, yesterday dismissed General Jose Garca Samayoa, the powerful defence minister, and shook up the military high command, Reuter reports from Guatemala City. A day after taking office, Mr de Leon named as defence minister General Roberto Perussina, known as a hard-liner, to succeed Gen Garca. 'I made the decision, not because he (Gen Garca) participated in a coup d'etat but because of some confusing events that took place,' Mr de Leon told a news conference. Gen Garca helped engineer the ouster of President Jorge Serrano last week, the president having dissolved Congress and the Supreme Court on May 25. Then the general supported Vice-President Gustavo Espina as head of state. Gen Garca said initially that Mr Espina had resigned, but later he changed his story. Mr Serrano was given asylum in Panama yesterday.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / People: From Lambeth council to CRE The Commission for Racial Equality, the statutory body set up in 1976 to help promote equality of opportunity and to eliminate discrimination, is to get its first black chairman. Herman Ouseley (right), 46, born in Guyana and brought up in Peckham, south London, takes over in February. His appointment comes at a sensitive time for race relations. Immediate issues facing him will include unemployment - which affects members of the ethnic minority communities disproportionately and is being aggravated by the recession - and the state of race relations law. Although the government has shown little inclination to strengthen the Race Relations Act in the past, the commission is arguing for changes to 'challenge entrenched forms of discrimination more effectively'. These would include statutory provision for workplace ethnic monitoring and a discrimination division in the industrial tribunals system. Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, says he took a personal interest in this 'key appointment' to the CRE; the commission had secured in Herman Ouseley a 'dynamic and resourceful' chairman with proven management and leadership skills. Ouseley has needed these skills to the full in his present post as chief executive of Lambeth council in south London. Lambeth has a long tradition of controversy, sometimes marked by clashes between elected members and full-time officers. Earlier this year Ouseley instructed his staff to walk out of meetings if they were abused by councillors, saying he would not allow staff to become victims of 'officer-baiting'. Sir Michael Day, the present chairman who is coming to the end of his five-year term of office, went to the CRE from the West Midlands probation service. Clarke says Sir Michael had 'worked ceaselessly towards the fair society we all want'.</p>

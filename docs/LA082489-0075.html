			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: EVEN DIETERS CAN GET THEIR JUST DESSERTS  </P> <P> Eliminating calories and fat from dessert doesn't have to mean eliminating  taste, or the psychological pleasure indulging in it provides, just to achieve  balance and moderation in the diet.  </P> <P> While most health professionals recommend the strict approach for calorie-wise  consumers, the USDA's Human Nutrition and Information Service says that there  is a place in the diet for dessert. Since fresh fruit doesn't completely  replace the desire for after- or in-between-meal treats that are sticky and  rich, the key is to choose these desserts in modest amounts, then balance them  with foods that are lower in fat, sugars and calories the rest of the day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Half the Fat  </P> <P> HNIS suggests consumers have half the usual amount of fats and sugars  throughout the day to make room for a dish of ice cream or other favorite  treat. Or, modify traditional desserts so that they utilize low-fat  ingredients.  </P> <P> For this type of imaginative cookery, base desserts on ingredients such as  unflavored gelatin, low-fat yogurt, evaporated skim milk, egg whites and angel  food cake. Then, choose fresh fruits like raspberries, peaches, strawberries  and cherries, which make exceptional flavor accompaniments.  </P> <P> Start out with Frozen Raspberry Yogurt, which takes advantage of plain low-fat  yogurt instead of whole milk or cream, for nearly half the calories of ice  cream. To re-create the rich and creamy smoothness of traditional frozen  desserts, raspberries and cranberry juice cocktail are blended with unflavored  gelatin to give the treat its frosty smoothness.  </P> <P> Another light but silky fruit dessert is Peach-Almond Mousse. In it, evaporated  milk, fresh peaches and almond extract are whipped up into a sweet puree.  Instead of a whipped cream topping, garnish with sliced or chopped fresh  peaches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Layered Look  </P> <P> Cherry Party Compote features layers of sweet cherries, blueberries, pineapple  chunks and apricot halves, all arranged in an attractive trifle bowl, and  topped with a splash of white wine and orange liqueur. After a generous  chilling to allow the flavors to mingle, pour club soda over just before  serving to add effervescence.  </P> <P> Cherries also are highlighted in another calorie-sparing dessert, Cherry-Brandy  Ice Cream.  </P> <P> This cool and refreshing dessert tastes rich -- evaporated milk and low-calorie  whipped topping mix provide its texture. Low-calorie sweetener and brandy  extract contribute flavor.  </P> <P> Other featured light, summer fruit desserts include Summer Berry Meringue Pie,  Nectarine-Brandy Sorbet and Raspberry Angel Roll.  </P> <P> CHERRY-BRANDY ICE CREAM  </P> <P> 1 cup pitted and chopped cherries  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon brandy extract  </P> <P> 9 packages low-calorie sweetener  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin  </P> <P> 1 cup evaporated skim milk  </P> <P> 1 packet low-calorie whipped topping mix  </P> <P> 2 egg whites or 1/4 cup egg substitute  </P> <P> Gently toss cherries with 1 teaspoon extract and 1 package sweetener. Set  aside.  </P> <P> Sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup skim milk in small saucepan. Let stand 5 minutes.  Stir constantly over low heat until gelatin dissolves, about 3 minutes. Remove  from heat, then stir in remaining sweetener and cool.  </P> <P> Prepare whipped topping according to package directions, substituting remaining  skim milk for water and remaining brandy extract for vanilla. Whip in cooled  gelatin. Beat egg whites until soft, but not dry, peaks form. Gently fold  whipped topping mixture and cherries into egg whites. Freeze until firm.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 28 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president of  the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], sent a letter today to  Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the UN Security Council, in  connection with the extension of the UN peacekeeping forces'  mandate. The letter says:    Excellency,    The people of the RSK welcome your report to the Security  Council of 16 March 1994, because you proposed extending the  mandate of the UN peacekeeping forces in the RSK and the  Republic of Croatia until 31 March 1995. This decision, with  the involvement of the United States and the Russian Federation,  will prevent further bloodshed and destruction. However, I  expect great problems on the road to achieving a final peace,  because the expectations intimated in your letter to the  Security Council of 28 January 1994 have not been fulfilled.    At that time you expressed your intention of carrying out a  detailed assessment of the role and functioning of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] before the Security Council considered  extending its mandate. This assessment -- although it was made  with the assistance of command centers under Yasushi Akashi,  Thorvald Stoltenberg, Mrs. Sadako Ogata, and all the UNPROFOR  Officials, at least according to your report -- does not make a  single mention of the suffering of the Serbian nation in  Croatia, or does it condemn this UN member for its state terror  against Serbs, which began in 1990.    You are well aware that the Republic of Croatia was the  first  to begin ethnic cleansing and that, according to your report of  15 May 1993, UNPROFOR had registered, up until 18 March 1993,  251,000 exiled Serbs in the Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia  alone. Despite this, in your latest report -- in Section III,  point five, paragraph "d" -- you request that refugees be  returned only to areas under UN control. In other words, the  Serbs driven out of Croatian towns -- and at that time, on 15  May 1993, you said that they were greater in number than the  Croatians who used to live in the RSK before 1991 -- do not  concern you.    In point six, you accuse us of having a different view on  the  UNPROFOR mandate, while we are only asking that the facts on the  expulsion of Serbs from Croatia be registered in the normative  documents of the United Nations, and only then will the UN  Security Council be in a position to make just and unbiased  decisions.    Your Excellency,    We have lost so much time and the UN has failed to identify  the causes of the Serbian-Croatian war. Attention was focused  on 25 percent of the territory of former Croatia which is now  part of the republic of Serb Krajina, while 75 percent of the  territory -- under the control of Croatian authorities -- has  been totally omitted from your assessments. It is precisely the  territory of the Republic of Croatia which has seen the most  cases of ethnic cleansing, destruction, and killing of the  Serbian people. The information center of the Serbian Council,  a non-governmental and non profit-making organization, with its  headquarters in 7 Safarik Street, Belgrade, tel. 3221 108, has  discovered the existence of 87 mass graves. There, and in other  as yet unidentified places of execution, lie over 14,000 Serbian  civilians killed by members of the Croatian MUP [Interior  Ministry police].    Do not be astonished to find that peace is so difficult to  bring about along the Krajina-Croatia borders. All you are  considering is part of the problem, the one linked with the RSK  territory, or, as indicated in UN documents, UN Protection  Areas. Without an appropriate analysis and without making an  official record of the fate of the Serbs expelled from Croatia,  you are searching for a solution in vain, especially given that  Croatia began its state terror, the expulsion of Serbs, back in  1990. Croatia is the only culprit for the Serbian-Croatian war,  and the only one responsible for the creation of two ethnic  states -- the Srpska republic and the Republic of Croatia.</p>

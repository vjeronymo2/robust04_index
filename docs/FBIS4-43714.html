			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick Coquide: "But Where Have All the </F> Free Marketers Gone?"]    [Text] In the 1980's,  contemporaneously with Thatcher and Reagan, our free marketers  enjoyed success and power. Only yesterday they were influential  ideologues. Have they now become a mere sect--or the victims of  their own success? Here is a survey of the last of the faithful.    Are the free marketers out of fashion? Guy Sorman, the  patented free marketer, is indignant. "As soon as our ideas are  no longer challenged and our program has been implemented, it is  only natural that no one would speak of us any more," he says.  The impetuous crusader for mass distribution, Michel-Edouard  Leclerc, does not share this fine enthusiasm. "For a year now  the masks have been coming off," he says. "The protectionist  arguments hold sway today. The free enterprisers have gone into  hiding. To speak of deregulation or of competition has become a  provocation!"    Guy Sorman is not mistaken. Privatization, independence for  the Bank of France, and elimination of governmental  authorization for dismissals--all of which the free marketers  were demanding in the early 1980's--are no longer the object of  an ideological civil war, even though they have not been  completely incorporated into our national ethos. Nor is  Michel-Edouard Leclerc mistaken when he adds: "The right is  burning its idols. During these past five years it has been  distancing itself from Reaganism and Thatcherism, and ever since  it encountered its first popular challenge it has been  denouncing the excesses of the free-market extremists.'"    As a matter of fact, how many political leaders still dare  to  call for the privatization of Social Security, the prisons, the  ANPE [National Employment Agency], or the universities?  Moreover, those in the current majority who are self-appointed  advocates of "a different policy"--such as Philippe Seguin--do  themselves make use of state resources. Here is an anecdote that  speaks eloquently to this point: in 1985, acting in the name of  free enterprise, the Center region--led by the UDF [French  Democratic Union]--eliminated all forms of aid to private  business. It reestablished them last year, in the name of job  protection!    No one will deny that Balladurism--the heir to  Pompidouism--is partial to interventionist solutions such as  political control of the privatized groups and the revival of  regional planning, which presupposes the effective return of  state intervention. The upcoming European elections are another  tangible sign. Of about 10 slates of candidates, not one is  openly advocating liberal principles. Quite the contrary: the  Franco-British businessman Jimmy Goldsmith--who yesterday was  the herald of private enterprise--occupies the second spot on  the slate of Philippe de Villiers, who himself was once a free  marketer but today is campaigning for protectionism and against  the Europe of Maastricht. Worse still: on the eve of the  elections, indications are that the supporters of European  social democracy could become the leading political force in the  new European Parliament, thereby relegating the free marketers  to anonymity.    France is not the only country in which the free-market  doctrine is losing some of its luster. On the other side of the  Atlantic, the neo-Keynesians have held sway since the most  recent presidential election; and in Great Britain the heirs of  Margaret Thatcher have been devastated by two setbacks at the  polls. Even the former East bloc countries appear to have  reneged on their hasty conversion to Western-style free  enterprise. There is one exception, however--the exception that  proves the rule: Italy, where Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia  party is advocating solutions that are Reaganite in inspiration,  despite the ideological diversity of the coalition that was  victorious in the most recent elections. As one of the few  French politicians who have remained faithful to their  convictions of the 1980's, Alain Madelin was also the only one  to be pleased at Berlusconi's victory.    Even Minister of Enterprises Alain Madelin--although  deploring the fact--does not deny that the free-market ideology  has lost some of its attraction. "In a period of economic crisis  such as the one through which we are passing," he says, "people  are distrustful of the state while at the same time they are  seeking its protection." Will a renewal of economic growth  suffice to reverse the ideological current? The free marketers  are not naive enough to believe in such a mechanical scenario.  "Our discourse has been too exclusively economic in nature,"  Madelin adds. "We should henceforth propose reforms not merely  to achieve efficiency but also to promote justice." He calls for  "dialogue with a view to reestablishing the free-market  philosophy."    "The 1986-style free-market philosophy rapidly reached a  limit--the limit of its capacity to persuade the middle  classes," Herve Novelli declares. "It must do away with the  elitism professed by the intellectuals." The new UDF deputy for  Indre-et Loire, who is close to Alain Madelin, has enlisted  under the banner of a "people's free-market program." It is a  very comprehensive program indeed! With the creation of his  Ideas-Action clubs, Madelin promises that by next fall there  will be a program of this type to deal with issues ranging from  the problems of the suburbs to medical ethics.    The opposition in 1986 went to the voters with a very  free-market oriented program, which candidate Jacques Chirac  totally disregarded during the l988 presidential campaign. In  1993 the right soft-pedaled the free-market views held by one  segment of its troops. What will happen at next year's  presidential election? The free marketers are at a disadvantage  from the very start, because their two principal candidates for  the presidency, Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac, are not  serving as point men for the free-market cause. "Don't fool  yourselves," Guy Sorman counters. "To distinguish himself from  his opposition, Chirac will have to inject a substantial dose of  free-market philosophy into his program." Could this perhaps be  mere wishful thinking on Sorman's part?  <H5>  [Box, p 51] </H5> <H5>  Politics: Free Enterprise Has Its Supporters </H5>   If there were only one free marketer left, Alain Madelin  would like to be that person. Not really in sync with the  Balladurian policy (unlike his "friend of 30 years," Gerard  Longuet, who has incorporated a measure of Colbertism  [protectionism] into his free-market philosophy) and feeling too  cramped in a not very important Ministry of Enterprises, Madelin  decided to resume his role as an agitator of ideas. He launched  his Ideas-Action clubs in a speech he made to an audience of  political leaders and business executives (not all of whom were  free marketers, far from it) at a meeting held on 10 March in  Paris. The clubs were ostensibly designed to serve as the  intellectual laboratories of the free marketers of civilian  society and the world of politics (Madelin claims to have  already converted approximately 100 members of Parliament to  join with him). On 10 May he opened the first club in Lyons and  hopes to have 100 opened by next summer. The platform of the  movement will be formalized at meetings to be held this fall.  According to some observers, this is a way for Alain Madelin to  reestablish himself politically in the period leading up to the  presidential election.    With this one exception, the free marketers in the  government  are maintaining a conspicuous reserve. Neither the Giscardians  Herve de Charette and Pascal Clement, nor the attorney Philippe  Mestre, nor Francois Leotard or Edmond Alphandery have raised  their voices overmuch to defend their convictions of yesterday.  Yvan Blot, former RPR [Rally for the Republic] speechwriter for  Jacques Chirac at the time when the latter was flirting with the  free-market doctrine, has joined the National Front! As for  Raymond Barre, he is hopelessly somewhere else.    The new activists of the free-market cause are to be found  instead among the young deputies of the majority who were  elected in March 1993: for example, Herve Novelli, who followed  Longuet and Madelin from the extreme right into the Republican  Party [PR] and supervises the Ideas-Action clubs; Nicolas  Forissier, the newly elected PR deputy for Indre; Franck  Thomas-Richard (UDF) in Cher; and Claude Vissac (RPR) in the  Ardennes.  <H5>  [Box, p 51] </H5> <H5>  Business: The Revival of Colbertism </H5>   Is it symbolic? Despite their differences, the two declared  candidates for the presidency of the CNPF [National Council of  French Employers]--Jean-Louis Giral and Jean Gandois--do not  make excessive use of free-market arguments. Giral is more  accurately described as a follower of Philippe Seguin's "other  policy." The employers' pro-free market clubs--such as the  Enterprise Institute--have been somnolent for a number of years.  Except for Claude Bebear, PDG [CEO] of Axa; Michel-Edouard  Leclerc, fierce opponent of the Royer law and the cultural  exception [in GATT negotiations] Jacques Maillot, president of  New Frontiers, who argues tirelessly for the deregulation of  transportation; and Paul Dubrule, co-president of Accor, whose  pro-free market convictions are firmly rooted, these business  executives appear instead to welcome governmental  interventionism. The presidents of the newly privatized groups  cannot point an accusing finger at the tutelary state, to which  they are indebted for the executive positions they hold. Worse  still: for the most part, they are themselves high-ranking  government officials!    Although Jimmy Goldsmith--the former president of Generale  Occidentale and Groupe Express--insists that he is still a free  marketer, he has placed his ardor at the service of  environmental protection and protectionism. His faithful  follower Rene de Laportaliere--former publisher of l'EXPRESS and  owner of Libertes Services (a lobbying [preceding word in  English] firm in charge of preparing ready-to-use free-market  projects)--is devoting himself to real-estate activities  involving France and Belgium. Still another newspaper publisher  who is a well-known free marketer has also disappeared from the  scene: Alain Lefebvre, who returned to the professional press  after having launched MAGAZINE HEBDO in the 1980's.  <H5>  [Box, p 52] </H5> <H5>  Reflexions: Observations, Wanderings, and Survivals </H5>   The pro-free market intellectuals continue to be active but  seem to be living with a nostalgia for the past decade. The  group of the "new economists"--Pascal Salin, Henri Lepage,  Florin Aftalion, Jacques Garello, and Jean-Jacques  Rosa--continues to publish its discussions in the press but is  reviving issues (such as elimination of the SMIC  [intervocational minimum growth wage] and deregulation of the  labor market) that the government seems in no hurry to  implement. "For several years now, the leading lights of the  present majority have been disinclined to associate with the  intellectuals of the Right," is Henri Lepage's bitter comment.    This disaffection is serving to deepen the differences. By  adopting positions on Europe that are not deemed to be very  free-market oriented, Maurice Allais--"the" French Nobel  Prizewinner for economics--has fallen out with his colleagues.  Guy Sorman, author in 1984 of La Solution liberale [The  Free-Market Solution], who has just published Le  Capital, suite et fins [Capital: Conclusion] (published by  Fayard), insists that contrary to the views expressed by  orthodox free marketers such as Salin and Rosa, the market will  be unable to solve the unemployment problem in Western  societies. Sorman even recommends measures that are somewhat  constraining for private enterprises, in an effort to induce  them to hire unemployed workers who are in training.    Apart from the economists, other intellectuals are preaching  the good free-market doctrine as it applies to themes "that  concern society." In the magazine COMMENTAIRES (which he  publishes)--and in his editorials in L'EXPRESS--the lawyer  Jean-Claude Casanova calls attention to the timeliness of the  thinking of Raymond Aron. For his part, the philosopher Philippe  Nemo--antagonist of our educational system--praises a number of  free-market experiments in education and the autonomy of  educational institutions. As the heir to the anarcho-free market  tradition, FIGARO's editorialist and writer Alain Gerard-Slama,  who is also a professor at Sciences Po, denounces the new "moral  order" that involves bans on smoking, speed limits, and  AIDS-prevention campaigns, all of which are constraints that  would anesthetize individual responsibility. In short, the  free-market concept has been broadened--and some will say that  it has been diluted.</p>

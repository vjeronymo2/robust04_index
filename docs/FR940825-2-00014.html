			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, Sandvik states that the Department previously determined in the LTFV investigation of SSHP that the service charge for cutting hollow bar to length should properly be treated as a circumstance of sale adjustment. Sandvik stresses that the Department, during its verification in the LTFV investigation, found that hollow bar sold in Sweden was in fact cut to length, while hollow bar sold in the United States was not. Sandvik claims that nothing has changed since the LTFV investigation to warrant a change in the treatment of the expense. Based upon Department practice and in particular, the Department's previous treatment of the service charge in the SSHP case, Sandvik concludes that the Department should make a circumstance of sale adjustment under 19 CFR 353.56 to account for the additional selling expense that Sandvik incurs when it sells hollow bar in the home market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Sandvik contends that, contrary to the Department's claim in this administrative review that the company ``did not provide *&blank;*&blank;* the necessary information to make the adjustment,'' Sandvik asserts that the record demonstrates otherwise. Specifically, Sandvik cites to its November 7, 1991, submission which sets forth the cutting charge as a percentage of total Swedish hollow bar sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Department's Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department grants a circumstance of sale adjustment where the claimed expense is directly related to sales of the subject merchandise or sales used to represent foreign market value, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). In this case, Sandvik calculated a per unit servicing charge based upon the company's total servicing expense as a percentage of total sales of hollow bar in Sweden. As indicated in its January 19, 1990, response, the amount charged for cutting hollow bar to length for customers varies according to the grade and volume of hollow bar which is purchased. Thus, the service charge varies by sale, and should have been reported on a transaction-specific basis as specifically requested in the Department's deficiency questionnaire. We have, therefore, denied Sandvik a circumstance of sale adjustment in this case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to treatment of the servicing charge as an indirect selling expense under 19 CFR 353.56(b), Sandvik calculated the total servicing expense using the largest fixed percentage of the invoice price rather than an application of either the grade or volume of the sales, which would have reduced the amount of the servicing charge. Therefore, we have denied Sandvik's servicing charge as an indirect selling expense for these sales because the methodology used to calculate the charge overstates the total expense by failing to account for the effect of different grades and volumes on the total amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Results of Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final results of our reviews are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,16,9  -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/exporter  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Time period  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin (percent)  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Sandvik  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 05/22/87&hyph;11/30/88  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.65 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sandvik  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 12/01/88&hyph;11/30/89  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.33  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.

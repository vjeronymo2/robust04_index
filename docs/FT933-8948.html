			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Daily Mail wins tight terms on convertible STRONG expectations of a further cut in UK interest rates, and a buoyant stock market, enabled the Daily Mail and General Trust, the UK newspaper group, to secure favourable terms on its fourth bond issue exchangeable into ordinary shares in Reuters Holdings. Lead-manager Credit Suisse First Boston said the Daily Mail's Pounds 50m offering was the first convertible bond issue to carry a coupon of less than 6 per cent. Holders of the 10-year bonds will receive 5 3/4 per cent a year. The borrower was also able to set a conversion price of Pounds 19.18 for each share in the international financial information and news group. This represents a 27.02 per cent premium to shares in Reuters at pricing, well above the 19 per cent premium set in National Power's Pounds 250m convertible bond issue last week. Investors were attracted by the shorter-than-usual maturity of the Daily Mail's bonds and snapped up the relatively small amount on offer. The bonds traded at a 1 1/4 point premium to their par issue price in the afternoon. Reuters shares closed down 19p at Pounds 15.05 against a rising market. Mr Adrian Perry, the Daily Mail's group treasurer, said this method for reducing the group's holding in Reuters was the most economical, due to the potential gain on the share price and the possibility of deferring any tax liability. Before yesterday's transaction the Daily Mail had a 3 1/2 per cent stake in Reuters; it would be left with slightly less than 1 per cent if all outstanding bonds were converted. The Daily Mail intends to redeem the outstanding Pounds 14.48m of its 8 1/4 per cent bonds due in 2003, exchangeable into Reuters shares, on September 26. Abbey National, the UK bank, took advantage of strong Italian bond prices to raise a further L50bn by re-opening its L150bn seven-year Eurobond offering, launched on July 30. The high coupon of 10 per cent reflected the call option on the bonds, lead-manager JP Morgan said. The net price of the new tranche was 102.30, against a net price of par on the original amount. The bonds traded around 103 in the afternoon. The funds were raised for Abbey National's Italian subsidiary. Abbey National also made a SFr150m three-year bond offering, the proceeds of which were swapped into dollars. Bayernhypo, the Bavarian mortgage bank, was the third German bank this week to borrow D-Marks. The break-even price on its five-year offering was 99.10 and the bonds traded at 99.33 in the afternoon.</p>

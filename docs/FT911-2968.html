			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Public spending faces squeeze: Budget targets threatened by rise in jobless and high pay deals MORE THAN half of the Treasury's Pounds 3bn public spending contingency reserve has been wiped out within just three weeks of the start of the current financial year because of rising unemployment and high public sector pay deals. The trend has prompted warnings in Whitehall that the depth of the recession threatens a significant overshoot in the Pounds 8bn government deficit forecast by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his March Budget. The economy continued to dominate Westminster yesterday with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, citing a report by an all-party committee of MPs which accused the government of reacting too slowly to the recession. 'Britain's condition is very directly a result of your policies,' he told Mr John Major, the prime minister. 'Why don't you accept responsibility or, better still, take action to reverse this recession?' Mr Major insisted that falling inflation and interest rates signalled an early recovery, but it is acknowledged privately that the government may be dogged in the immediate future by rising unemployment totals. Senior ministers are concerned that key public spending programmes, notably health and education, face a financial squeeze just as the government is pledging an improvement in services in the run-up to the general election. The Treasury has signalled the start of negotiations covering next year's spending with a lengthy warning to every Whitehall department that it will be seeking considerable savings elsewhere to offset the cost of higher unemployment. The Pounds 205bn spending target for the 1991-92 financial year, which started on April 1, includes a Pounds 3bn reserve for unforeseen expenditure. But unemployment is already more than 300,000 higher than the 1.75m assumed when the target was set. Even if there were no further increase, the cost to the reserve in higher unemployment and other benefits is about Pounds 1bn. Another Pounds 320m of the reserve has been set aside to meet the cost of higher-than-expected deals in the health service and the armed forces. Pay deals in other areas of the public sector have been averaging 8 per cent, well above assumptions. The Treasury has acknowledged that its decision to raise child benefit will cost Pounds 220m from the reserve, while the Department of Employment has been allocated an extra Pounds 120m for training. Ironically, the Budget decision to raise VAT to 17.5 per cent will cost Whitehall departments some Pounds 450m. Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, has secured agreement from the Treasury that the extra burden on the NHS will be met from the reserve. Overall, the demands mean that half of the reserve has been spent, and about two-thirds of the Pounds 3bn which was notionally available three weeks ago has been pre-empted. Another rise in unemployment could account for the rest, since even the more optimistic forecasts point to a further 250,000 increase this year. The outlook for next year - for which spending departments will submit their bids by mid-May - is similarly bleak. In theory the Treasury has a Pounds 7bn reserve for 1992-93, but the increases this year will pre-empt half of that. Inflation will be sharply lower by next year, but that assumption is built into budgets for 1992-93. The allocations for the NHS and education, in particular, allow for only minimal real growth next year, suggesting the two departments will seek several billion pounds more from the Treasury. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, is expected to need at least Pounds 1.5bn in extra grants for local authorities to cushion the impact of the poll tax in what he has promised will be its final year. The new demands could wipe out the scope for tax cuts and force the Treasury to revise upwards what many in the City see as an over-optimistic view of the likely trend in public borrowing.

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Liberty Life plans global convertible bond offering Liberty Life, South Africa's largest proprietary life insurer, is preparing to launch the first global offering of convertible bonds for a South African company. The issue marks an important step in the country's return to the international financial markets, following its first non-racial elections in May. The plan to raise up to Dollars 500m globally is ambitious, given the relatively low profile of South African companies among international investors. However, the deal should benefit from the increased weighting of South Africa in many international investment portfolios. The convertible bonds are likely to have a relatively high coupon of about 6 per cent, given the large size of the transaction, and a maturity of 10 years. The bonds will be convertible into Liberty Life shares at a premium of 10 to 12 per cent, according to Robert Fleming, the UK investment bank charged with arranging the transaction. On Thursday, Fleming will lead a visit by underwriters and investment managers to South Africa. Subsequently, roadshows will be held in Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong as well as cities in the US and Europe, over a two-week period. Liberty Life, South Africa's fourth largest company, was chosen to take a leading role in the country's return to the international capital markets because of its particular attractions for international equity investors. As well as its stakes in top South African companies like Standard Bank, South African Breweries and Premier Group, the group also has substantial offshore holdings. The interests of its 57 per cent-owned, UK-based subsidiary Transatlantic Holdings include Sun Life, the UK life insurer, and Capital Shopping Centres, the retail development company which was recently listed on the London Stock Exchange. It is planned that around Dollars 100m of the bond proceeds will be used in the development of Liberty Life's business in South Africa and about Dollars 200m will be used to repay existing debt. The company 'has required a lot of mezzanine borrowing for the last 15 years,' which will now be replaced with longer-term financing, according to Mr Donald Gordon, chairman. He added that he would expect the bonds to be converted into equity quite rapidly. With regard to the remaining proceeds of the offering, Mr Gordon commented that 'we like to have a bit of a war chest'. He declined to comment on any specific targets, but observed that the reversal in the American interest rate cycle has increased the receptiveness of companies which until recently were unwilling to enter into discussions.</p>

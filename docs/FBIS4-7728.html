			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Following seven days of  fruitless efforts by Moslem forces to penetrate Serb lines with  offensive infantry and artillery attacks from Gorazde, a United  Nations protected area in eastern Bosnia, the troops are  panicking and deserting, Bosnian Serb military sources have said.    In the area of the village of Trebesevo on Monday the local  command of the troops loyal to Bosnian Moslem Leader Alija  Izetbegovic ordered four Moslem troops to be shot after they  abandoned their positions, the sources said.    The Moslem offensive is aimed at Cajnice, Foca and Rogatici,  and the heaviest fighting on Monday took place in the area of  the villages of Podkozarje and Oglecevo.    Moslem troops began an offensive on the Bosnian Serb  republic  in the second half of March, after they signed an agreement with  Bosnian Croats on setting up a Moslem-Croat federation in  Bosnia.</p>

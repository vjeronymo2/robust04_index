			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fletcher to sell stake in NGC unit FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand industrial group, yesterday said it will sell at least a third of its wholly-owned subsidiary Natural Gas Corp to Australian Gas Light. A further third is to be sold to the public, raising about NZDollars 305.2m (USDollars 165m). The news failed to spark interest in Fletcher Challenge shares which, still under pressure, fell a further eight cents to NZDollars 2.14 yesterday, largely because of its perceived debt problems. Analysts said NGC's sale had been signalled and taken into account in assessing the company's outlook. Fletcher Challenge had intimated in March last year its intention to sell a large stake in NGC. The company was extensively restructured over the past 18 months to facilitate a sale of this type. While an overseas company was expected to buy a significant stake, the identity of a possible buyer had never been disclosed. NGC is the main distributor of gas to both commercial and domestic consumers in New Zealand.</p>

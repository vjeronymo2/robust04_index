			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China will strengthen the  registration of foreign-funded enterprises to ensure their  healthy development and adopt measures to help them solve  problems quickly.    The number of foreign-funded enterprises has surpassed  170,000 in China and is still expanding.    "They have brought us advanced technology, equipment and  funds we need badly, and are playing an increasing role in  China's national economic development," an official of the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce said.    "However," he pointed out, "some localities have paid  attention only to the number and not to the quality of  foreign-funded enterprises, some have violated the state law and  regulations to offer extra preferential policies to go along  with the other side, and some even have under evaluated the  property of our state enterprises in order to set up joint  ventures with foreign business people or sell the property to  them."    He disclosed that a small number of foreign business people  have not yet registered their capital according to contract  since having their names registered.    To guide foreign-funded enterprises toward healthy  development, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  will adopt the following key measures:    -- Reinforce and improve the examination of investment  registration;    -- Approve the report of evaluation of the property  submitted  by a Chinese state enterprise which plans to cooperate with  foreign businessmen in setting up a joint venture;    -- Require foreign business people scheduled to set up joint  ventures or cooperate with Chinese to list the actual values of  their equipment and other materials in kind in the contract,  with figures subject to approval by intermediary and notary  organizations;    -- Require central state enterprises that plan to sell  stocks  or use state property to set up joint ventures or cooperate with  foreign firms to submit a report for state approval prior to  putting plans into action;    -- Require Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative  enterprises to share weal and woe despite the proportion of  investments;    -- Strengthen the supervision and examination of investments  made by foreign-funded enterprises.    An enterprise with registered capital of less than two  million U.S. dollars must deliver the funds within six months  from the day on which it gets a business license, and the time  limit for a business with registered capital of less than five  million U.S. dollars will be one year, and two years for those  with registered funds of less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The  period will be extended for larger projects.    -- Upon discovery, revoke the license of and punish any  Sino-foreign joint venture enterprise whose Chinese partner has  replaced the foreign side in handling registered capital,  according to the law and regulations.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Judge criticises BNF director British Nuclear Fuels' company secretary and legal director was yesterday criticised by a judge for 'posturing' outside the High Court. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, is challenging the government decision to let the company's Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant operate without a public inquiry. Mr Justice Potts, who is hearing the case, said the 'posturing' by Mr Alvin Shuttleworth - comments broadcast in a television interview - was 'highly undesirable'.</p>

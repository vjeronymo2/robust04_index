			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is building  missile launching sites along the Chinese border, the ASAHI  SHIMBUN reported in a Seoul-datelined story on Friday.    In an interview with the Japanese newspaper, former North  Korean Army 1st Lt. Yim Yong-son, who defected to South Korea  last September, said Pyongyang had selected areas along the  Chinese border as missile launching sites, judging that an  attacker would avoid these areas for fear of hitting China by  accident, the report said.    Saying he was quoting fellow soldiers at an Army engineering  unit engaged in construction of missile bases where he worked  before defecting to Seoul, Yim said that although North Korea's  missile launching sites are located along the eastern coastlines  of North Hamgyong and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan city, the  Stalinist North recently started building additional sites along  the Chinese border.    Some 5,000 people are working at such sites at Chunggangjin  in Chagang Province and the job will be completed next year, the  Japanese newspaper quoted Yim as saying.    "I heard that North Korea, presuming that the United States  and South Korea would not attack missile sites along the Chinese  border for fear of hitting China if war broke out, began  constructing the sites along its Chinese border," he was quoted  as saying.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAIRD ORCHESTRATES SPONSORSHIP DEALS  </P> <P> Don Baird, a former world-class pole vaulter and member of the 1976 Australian  Olympic team, has become an entrepreneur specializing in getting large  corporations and high school sports organizations together.  </P> <P> Five years ago, when the Oregon High School Activities Assn., which is that  state's governing body of high school sports, was almost broke, Baird  orchestrated a deal that helped keep the organization solvent.  </P> <P> He enlisted sponsorships from several corporations, then later put together a  deal with a bank that has brought the association $750,000 in the last 5 years.  </P> <P> "We were in trouble," said Bud Lewis, director of the association. "He helped  save high school athletics in Oregon."  </P> <P> Baird grew up in Australia, trained in West Germany and attended Cal State Long  Beach, where he was the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. indoor pole vault  champion in 1977.  </P> <P> His first major deal was for the Oregon association and he has organized deals  or is in the process of putting together projects for high school organizations  in 13 states, including California. His biggest deal so far has been a  $1.2-million, 3-year arrangement for the California Interscholastic Federation  with Reebok and Coca-Cola.  </P> <P> Last year, Baird formed School Properties Inc. in Yorba Linda and hired a staff  with a plan for licensing high school apparel and products in the same manner  that NFL Properties Inc. has made millions for owners of National Football  League teams.  </P> <P> In the next 2 weeks, each of the CIF's 10 sections will vote on whether to  authorize the CIF to negotiate with School Properties as its licensing body.

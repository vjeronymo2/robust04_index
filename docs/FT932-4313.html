			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / A budget balancing act beyond the wit of man: Quentin Peel assesses the German fiscal nightmare facing a hapless Mr Waigel WHEN Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's long-suffering finance minister, let it be known last month that he wanted to go home to the job of prime minister in Bavaria, cynics in Bonn immediately assumed the worst. They reckoned he had re-done his calculations and decided that the task of balancing the budget was beyond the wit of man, even of a witty man from Swabia. They may well have been right. For in the few weeks since Mr Waigel tried, and failed, to land the job in Munich, the financial figures for the coming years have got steadily gloomier. In the blunt words of Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the opposition Social Democrats in the German Bundestag: 'Sheer chaos reigns in the financial policies of this government. All the fundamental financial figures have proved to be false, and miles removed from reality.' Only last July, the government presented its medium-term financial plan, suggesting a combined net borrowing requirement between 1993 and 1996 of DM115bn (Pounds 46.7bn). According to the latest figures presented by Mr Waigel to the finance planning council last month, that four-year deficit will now be more like DM258bn - assuming that painful new savings of at least DM20bn a year can be agreed. In just 10 months since the last medium-term plan was agreed, that is an increase of 124 per cent. Mr Waigel has been forced to go back to his colleagues in the ruling coalition, and to the parliament, and call for a whole raft of new spending cuts. This time, he says, they will have to include the sacred area of social spending - whether the Social Democrats in opposition like it or not. The finance ministry is caught between the inexorable demands of the impoverished 'new' federal states of east Germany, the soaring costs of paying unemployment benefit to more than 3m jobless, and the shrinking, recession-hit tax base of once-prosperous western Germany, now feeling the full force of the economic downturn. Things have been looking bleak ever since the much-vaunted solidarity pact, agreed last March between the government and opposition, and the 16 federal states, fixed on a long-term formula to divide up their tax revenues and responsibilities in the new united Germany. First, the deal meant a long-term commitment to public spending transfers to the 'new' federal states of eastern Germany, starting from a base of DM110bn in 1995, when all their consolidated debts become a direct burden on the federal government budget. Second, to persuade the wealthy western Lander to go along with the deal, Mr Waigel had to give them extra tax revenues from his own kitty of DM20bn a year. The squeeze was just beginning. It was already clear that the 1993 budget was going to shoot way past its planned spending of DM435.6bn, based on a modest 2 per cent growth rate from 1992, with a deficit of just DM43bn. According to the supplementary budget now submitted to the Bundestag, the new spending level will be DM458bn, and the new net borrowing requirement almost DM68bn. Since then, the joint working group which advises the finance ministry on its future tax revenues has produced a series of devastating figures suggesting that the recession will wreak havoc with its income expectations. Revenues will be down DM12.76bn this year, DM45.75bn in 1994, DM56.19bn in 1995 and DM66.68bn in 1996, the experts said. The tax changes agreed in the solidarity pact will be totally inadequate to make up the difference. That suggests that even for 1993, a second supplementary budget will be necessary just to keep the deficit down to a maximum DM70bn. For 1994 and the years ahead, the deficits are set to stay around that level: a deficit of DM71bn on spending of DM482bn in 1994; DM71bn again on spending of DM485bn in 1995; down to DM51bn on spending of DM495bn in 1996; and DM41bn on DM505bn in 1997. The cost of soaring unemployment - expected to rise by 500,000 this year, and 300,000 next, even if the economy picks up - is one big factor in the equation. The jobless qualify for generous welfare benefits, just as they stop paying taxes. In eastern Germany, the 1.1m officially unemployed are more than matched by at least 1.5m 'disguised' unemployed, who receive even more generously finance in the form of job creation schemes, retraining allowances, and early retirement pay. Mr Waigel wants to cut the rates of welfare benefits by around 3 per cent, to freeze state spending, including civil service salaries, and to tackle another sacred cow: to postpone the move to Berlin until after the year 2000. Senior government officials believe that adequate savings will only be possible with a new cross-party agreement - a solidarity pact mark two. They know that any deal without cross-party support could be blocked in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, where the SPD has an effective majority. With no fewer than 19 elections looming next year at national, state and local level, they fear that the political will to take unpopular decisions will evaporate towards the end of the year.</p>

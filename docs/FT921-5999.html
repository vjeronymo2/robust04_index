			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / How to Spend It: Vintage glasses PRYCE &amp; Brise Antiques is a charming small shop in Fulham, west London, that specialises in English antique glass, mainly Georgian and Victorian. There are handsome celery vases, fine claret jugs and Georgian cut-glass port decanters, all of which would make splendid presents. You could buy a Bristol blue glass decanter for Pounds 180; a set of six green glasses, dating from about 1820, for Pounds 430; an 1810 whisky decanter for Pounds 310; or a Victorian celery vase for about Pounds 50. One of those rare, 18th-century wine glasses with a colour twist stem could cost a few thousand. Pryce &amp; Brise found, however, that demand greatly outstripped supply in one particular area - champagne flutes. The recession might be deep but champagne-drinking, it appears, still goes on. So, Nella Pryce and Jan Brise, the two women who own and run the shop, set about re-creating a champagne flute from an original early-19th century design. Made by hand and sold singly, in pairs or in boxed sets of four, the flutes can be bought in more or less unlimited quantities. The result you can see photographed here left. They are sold singly at Pounds 28 or can be sent by mail in a boxed set of four for Pounds 112 (plus postage and packing of Pounds 7). Those who are fond of initials on everything, or who have crests to which they are attached, can have those engraved to order. Pryce &amp; Brise is at 79 Moore Park Road, London SW6 2HH.

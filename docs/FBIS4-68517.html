			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Turkey Wants To Catch Up With </F> and Surpass the United States in Trade With Russia"]    [Text] The results of yesterday's meeting of the  Russian-Turkish Intergovernmental Commission on Commercial and  Economic Cooperation may become a breakthrough in relations  between the two countries. Although Turkey in recent years has  become one of Russia's leading partners, the protocol signed by  the commission's cochairmen--Oleg Davydov, head of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and Onur Kumbaracibasi,  minister of Public Works and Housing--sets an increase in trade  of up to $5 billion as a realistic objective. And then Turkey  could catch up with and surpass America as Russia's partner.    In and of itself, a trade turnover that has increased by  more  than 400 percent over the past eight years--and that is without  counting the activities of the army of many thousands of Russian  "shuttles"--attests to the successful development of commercial  relations. Of course, there are problems. And everyone who has  kept track of Russia's negotiations in recent years readily  guesses that they consist in debts (Russia's defaulted debt  amounts to $320 million). Granted, in the case of Turkey one  must speak of bilateral debt: Turkey owes for the construction  of the Beskamberun Metallurgical Mill (about $35 million), which  was built with Russia's assistance.    Yesterday Turkey proposed its option for getting out of the  existing situation--to repay the Russian debt with deliveries of  gas and military hardware. In particular, the proposal was to  sell Ankara $60 million worth of military helicopters and $200  million worth of small arms. The interest in the Russian  armaments is so great that Onur Kumbaracibasi expressed the  desire to increase purchases of military equipment and armaments  by an amount of up to $600 million a year. As KOMMERSANT has  learned, First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets has already given his  consent to the export of the small arms, and this year $60  million worth of deliveries will be made toward the repayment of  Russia's debt. But by solving the debt problem this way, Russia  risks acquiring a heap of unpleasantness far from Turkey's  shores. The problem is that Turkey's enthusiasm for acquiring  the aforementioned types of arms is directly proportionate to  the intensity of Ankara's war with the Kurdish separatists,  against whom the weapons are being used. The situation is a  sensitive one: The FRG, under extremely strong pressure from  other NATO members, recently refused Turkey precisely the types  of arms in which it is interested (the pretext was that they are  being used for fighting political opponents and for punitive  actions against civilians). Moscow, on the other hand, while  experiencing a need to increase the market for its arms,  simultaneously fears NATO's negative reaction and is not  especially rushing to accommodate Turkey's desires.    The Kurdish problem may, however, become an obstacle to the  development of one of the most promising branches of bilateral  cooperation--tourism. And the possibilities here are  considerable: the mild Mediterranean climate and comparatively  low prices (in comparison with the resorts of France or Spain),  along with first-rate service, are making Antalya, the center of  Turkish tourism, for example, increasingly attractive to  Russians who are not spoiled in terms of resort service.  However, their mass influx onto Turkish beaches could quite  possibly be prevented by considerations of personal safety. At  present, for example, many foreign groups are refusing tours and  reservations in prestigious hotels on the coast in connection  with the step-up in terrorist activities by the Kurdish Workers'  Party (PKK), which recently declared war on tourism throughout  Turkey's entire territory. Several explosions have already gone  off in Istanbul (including in the famous St. Sophia's) and  Antalya lately.    However, tourism does not hold the leading place within the  total range of economic relations between Russia and Turkey. And  therefore hopes for the future are more bound up with  traditional forms of cooperation, rather than with tourism.  Thus, in yesterday's negotiations it was decided to raise  deliveries of Russian gas to Turkey to 8 billion cubic meters a  year (and by another 2.5 billion over the next two  years--current deliveries are 6 billion cubic meters). It was  noted that the chief problem today is transit across Ukraine,  which has been pumping gas from the gas pipeline without  authorization. The Turks also voiced complaints to the  representatives of Gazprom [Gas Industry Joint-Stock Company]  who were taking part in the negotiations regarding the price of  the gas, which in their opinion is too high.    The development of investment and technical cooperation also  remains promising. Interest here is mutual: the Turks, who are  already carrying out $2.5 billion worth of contracts in Russia,  are prepared to take part in new projects (primarily in the  power-engineering industries). The Russians are not lagging  behind, either--the Tekhnostroyeksport Foreign Trade Association  is carrying out a number of contracts in Turkey that were signed  back during the time of the USSR and are connected with the  electrification of a railroad and the construction of three  highways near Ankara and a hydraulic engineering complex and  dam. Tekhnostroyeksport views winning the Turkish market as a  long-range strategy, which is especially important following  Russia's loss of its former positions in Asia Minor and the  Middle East. The main thing is that the Russians offer only  first-class goods and services. The only problem is that,  according the Viktor Velichko, chairman of the foreign trade  association, the Turks are chronically late in their payments,  which is interfering with the expansion of Russian firms'  activities in Turkey.    In the course of negotiations, the question of the shipping  regime in the Black Sea straits was also raised. The Russian  side insists on strict adherence to the 1936 Montreux shipping  convention. Lately Ankara has been trying to restrict it under  the pretext of an "environmental threat to Istanbul"--most of  the freight shipped through the straits is related to the export  of energy sources. And the recent collision of two tankers in  the Bosporus only intensified those fears. As an alternative,  the Turks are proposing to Russia to extend the oil pipeline  across the bottom of the Black Sea. Moscow is prepared to  consider that project, according to Oleg Davydov, minister of  foreign economic relations.  <H8>  Some Figures on Economic Cooperation Between Russia and </H8> Turkey (Based on the Information of the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations)    Trade turnover:    In 1993--$2 billion (with a positive Russian trade balance  of  more than $600 million). The increase in bilateral trade since  1986 exceeded 400 percent.    Some Russian projects in Turkey:     -  Construction of the Pazarcik-[Karegli] gas pipeline (200  km). Estimated cost--$4.5 million;    -  construction of the [Komkyurler]-[Osmanis] railroad section  (78  km). Estimated cost--$80 million;    -  modernization and expansion of the alumina and electrolysis  production facilities at the Seydisehir Aluminum Mill. Estimated  cost--$200 million.       Turkish business activity in Russia:    $2.5 billion worth of construction contracts alone have been  concluded as of this time. They include a sugar refinery in  Krasnodar Kray and chemical plants in Siberia, Tataria and  Bashkiria. Designs are being worked up for the modernization of  the petrochemical industry and airports in Tataria.    Military-technical cooperation:    In 1993 an agreement in principle was reached for the  purchase in russia of MI-28, K-126 and K-226 helicopters and  MiG-29 planes, the latest antiaircraft and armored weapons, and  also small arms. $60 million worth of arms will be sold and  credited toward the payment of debt to Ankara.    Russia's defaulted debt to Turkey:    For credits from the Turkish Export-Import Bank--$320  million. Formed as the result of the granting of two credits for  $150 million each to the former USSR in 1989, and two credits  for $200 million each in 1990-1991 (only $300 million of the  latter was used).</p>

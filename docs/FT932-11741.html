			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Security cameras catch the eye: The early success of a surveillance system in Northampton town centre NORTHAMPTON has long been proud of its historic battles, its shoe-making and its cricket. Recently a different kind of reputation has drawn the attention of politicians, senior police officers and business leaders to this Midlands town. In the wake of last weekend's devastating bomb in the City of London, local officials are finding themselves inundated with inquiries about the town centre's closed-circuit television surveillance system. Other towns have them but none on such a concentrated and integrated scale as in Northampton, where 96 cameras linked to a central system cover the main shopping areas and car parks. Mr Norman Howells, the council's head of finance and operations, said: 'The push for this came from the public and the traders. The crime threat was not as great as people imagined, but the public wanted us to install a system that made them feel safer. It was a question of confidence.' All the cameras in the town are linked to a control room housed in an office above the town's main multi-storey car park. There two operators working eight-hour shifts sit in front of rows of monitors - some split into four, others providing full-screen images. They can spot and record anything that is going on at any time in all the town's central pedestrian and vehicle routes. The controllers, employed by Firm Security Group, a private security company, sit at panels controlling camera angles and freezing pictures. They have a telephone link to the police, and at night the system becomes the responsibility of the local police force, which has another set of monitors in the nearby station. The visual accuracy and speed of the system in identifying vehicles and individuals is impressive. At about midday on Thursday I watched one monitor capture a truck on screen which had temporarily parked with flashing lights outside the town's main hotel. After zooming in from a wide-angle perspective of the street, the camera provided a clear close-up shot of the driver. The truck - similar in size to the one that exploded in the City at the weekend - turned out to be known locally. But had action been needed the operator would have contacted the police, who would have checked the vehicle on their monitors before taking between one minute and five to arrive on the spot. Chief Inspector John Cordner of Northampton Police said that the system was primarily a deterrent and a provider of supporting evidence. It could not provide a guarantee that security would not be breached. Its main success in the month it has been fully operational has been in providing evidence leading to 17 arrests. Both council leaders and police insist that the system can provide better security than simple foot or vehicle policing and is cost-effective. The system has been introduced during the past 2 1/2 years and 85 per cent of all crimes in the areas monitored have been solved by the police. The public seem to like it. The management of the car park believe that the 12 per cent increase in customers over the past year, in spite of the recession, is a mark of public confidence. The council spent Pounds 280,000 installing the full system, with Pounds 20,000 provided by the private sector, but it cannot afford to use the cameras' full potential. To monitor every vehicle would require about 32 individuals sitting without interruption for 24 hours - about five times the present staffing. Mr Leon Barwell, director of sales and marketing with Firm Security Group, said the aim was to make the most cost-effective use of the system. Chief Insp Cordner, reluctant to endorse it as a complete solution, said: 'Its only an aid. It's as good as the people who are monitoring it. You still need people to make a judgment.'</p>

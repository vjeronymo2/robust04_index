			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mirza Hajric: "Two Steps Backward"] </F>   [Text] The urgency, artificially created by the European  Union, to establish peace in Bosnia generated great caution.  Such a serious matter, a juggernaut of world politicians and  European ministers, did not deserve to be hurried. For, hurry  may lead to grave mistakes that, considering the present  situation in Bosnia, would later be impossible to correct.    Rumors composed of news from various sources have increased  the pressure even more. Russian sources say that the leadership  of the Bosnian Serb extremists is no longer trusted, but that  they demand confirmation from our authorities. The Russians  used high diplomatic channels to inquire whether it was true  that Prime Minister Silajdzic and Momcilo Krajisnik agreed to  divide Sarajevo, destroy Butmir airport, and build a new airport  for each side. Furthermore, we received information that the  Serbs came to Geneva with a map on which east Bosnia is just a  little bit bigger and nothing more. According to the same  sources, Croatia is prepared to relinquish enclaves held by the  HVO [Croatian Defense Council], but will not give up Neum. The  Serbian-Croatian side arranged that access to the sea be solved  via Prevlaka.  <H5>  "Demands of Europe" </H5>   The European Union, which, it seems, is pretending to hold  the key to the decision this time, presented secret demands for  "all three sides." The Serbs are required to give 3 to 4  percent of the territory within the framework of the agreement  made on the carrier "Invincible," to guarantee full freedom of  movement around Sarajevo and the enclaves, to accept the modus  vivendi, and to end the siege right away. European ministers  said that the inflexible attitude of the Serbs is the main  obstacle to peace. The Serbs were also warned that continued  bombing of safe areas under UN protection would no longer be  tolerated.    The Croats were told to grant access to the sea at Prevlaka  and Ploce, and to allow using the port on the Neretva River.  They were also advised to prepare an alternative in the area of  the municipality of Neum that, at Klek, will give access to the  sea, so that, in case of the divorce of the Bosnian republics,  it will be an access to the sea for the Bosnian republic.  Croatia was told that its international recognition would be at  stake if it did not comply with this demand. It was also told  that economic and trade relations with the European Union would  be strained even further if it did not meet the requirements for  the implementation of the final agreement.    The Bosnian leadership was asked to stop military activities  by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in central Bosnia and  provocations on the demarcation lines in Sarajevo.    The negotiations were exceptionally unorganized this time.  They were supposed to begin at 1200, instead of at 1100, but  they actually began at 1430. As a matter of fact, our  delegation was given the role of an observer. Throughout the  day, the cochairmen of the peace process informed it of the  progress of negotiations with the other two sides. And at 1800,  it was announced that a new Serb-Croat proposal was completed,  so Izetbegovic and Silajdzic met with Milosevic, Karadzic, and  Krajisnik, in the presence of Owen and Stoltenberg. Then they  presented the plan that gives 33.3 percent of the territory. It  all sounded like the right road to peace, until they put the map  on the table.    No one in our delegation expected to see something like  that.  We expected the one-third of the territory to be tied to those  areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that we are directly  interested in, considering the real situation. That proposal  did not comply with any concession we thought necessary.  Eastern Bosnia, was not expanded significantly, although that  had been promised. The map only showed the connection between  Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica. The same happened with west  Bosnia. Not a word about returning the territory of Sanski  Most, Kljuc, Prijedor....    The access to the sea, as seen by Milosevic and Tudjman,  has a very unnatural geographic silhouette. It is about 120 km  away from the territory of the Bosnian republic. The road to  Prevlaka, whose northern part of the peninsula is supposed to  become our harbor, mostly goes along the Croatian-Montenegrin  border, through a very difficult terrain, and that solution is  more of a worry than the one that solves any problem. The  Bosnian state delegation has no intentions of relinquishing  Neum, for that territory belongs to Bosnia-Herzegovina and it is  the only natural access to the sea. Indeed, there are some  difficulties, like shallow waters or the fact that there is no  harbor there, but no solution is ideal. Neum will be one of the  main headaches of European ministers due to the stubbornness of  Croatian President Tudjman. According to one proposal, Neum  could also be under joint Bosnian-Herzegovinian authority, or,  according to another, the United States could undertake to have  a two-year administration until the final solution is found.  <H5>  "Diluting the Agreement" </H5>   We were most disappointed to see some questions that we  considered solved opened for discussion again. Those questions  concern Brcko and Doboj. After details of the two problems were  explained, Silajdzic referred to the proposal as "two steps  backward" and accused the Serbs of coming up with a new proposal  every time, thus putting back the negotiations. Lord Owen  agreed that it was frivolous for "sensible adults" to change  solutions on which they had previously agreed.    According to the latest proposal, Brcko is cut off from the  territory of the Bosnian republic by 12 to 15 km. Milosevic  offered guaranteed access and territorial sovereignty at the  Sava River. He said one must not allow that the connection  between large Serbian territories in western and eastern Bosnia  "hang" on a viaduct like a "cherry petal." There was much  discussion about Brcko, but no agreement was reached. We  insisted on keeping things as we had arranged much earlier. The  solution for Doboj is supposed be significantly changed,  naturally in favor of Karadzic. There was no agreement about  that. We demand free use of the railway station and railway  junction, as was previously arranged.    Regarding central Bosnia, there were also many changes in  Milosevic's geographic vision of Bosnia. The Croatian  "intestine in the stomach" of the Bosnian republic was made  larger, but Milosevic proposed that Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo,  and Prozor belong to us, in order to round up the map of central  Bosnia in the shape of a ball, and Serbia would somehow arrange  with Croatia about some other concessions that would be  acceptable. President Izetbegovic demanded that Novi Travnik  and Vitez be assigned to the Bosnian republic.  <H5>  "Serbian Peasant Sarajevo" </H5>   Sarajevo is still one of the major problems. Karadzic is  pushing his proposal on, as he says, "peasant Sarajevo," a  parallel city between Rajlovac and Ilidza. He did not accept  the two-year UN administration, because he said it would only  postpone the undeferrable separation. According to the plan  presented at the table, out of 3.2 percent of the area of  Sarajevo in the total territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Republic, 2.3 percent would belong to the Bosnian republic.  That includes 90 percent of the city of Sarajevo. We think  that the problem of this proposal lies in communications. We  want free flow of all communications -- and we offer the same to  the Serbian side, in the form of roads and railroads toward the  north (Vogosca and Ilijas) -- or the UN administration. Momcilo  Krajisnik proposed that the city be divided in the direction  east-west on banks of the Miljacka River. Krajisnik "sadly"  deduced that the position of Sarajevo was ideal, but upside  down, so that it would be really difficult to reach a solution.  We repeated our demand for eastern Bosnia, i.e. several  territories that would connect Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia  (Zepce and Srebrenica to Gorazde, including Visegrad).    We were actually not talking about demands, but repeating  what was agreed on principle with the European Union. We must  only find the way to realize that. Definitely not the one  Karadzic wants. In general, the plan is painfully  implementable. By agreeing to this solution, we would accept  the plan that would resettle about 300,000 people and perhaps  another 500,000 would not be able to return to their homes. We  refuse to withdraw from any of territories that we are holding.  It seems that the entire campaign about peace in Bosnia as a  Christmas gift for the Balkans and Europe is premature. However,  it will be continued in Brussels, where Milosevic and Tudjman  will be pressured by European ministers. Some of our leaders  say that we are nevertheless much closer to peace than it seems.</p>

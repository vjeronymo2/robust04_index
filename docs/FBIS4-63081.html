			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Razgulyayev from Bishkek: "Sociology Is a </F> Pseudo-Science in Kirgizia. This Is What Askar Akayev's Staff  Has Decided"]    [Text] The results of a public opinion poll conducted in  Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] by Professor K. Isayev, a well-known  scientist, if published, could have caused a real sensation.  But newspapers that regularly published similar materials did  not find space for them this time around.    Let us disclose at once the reasons for this carefulness.  According to the poll service, Askar Akayev, who has always been  unrivalled in popularity ratings, ranked only... seventh!  Topping the list is Apas Dzhumagulov, current prime minister,  whose view on reform differs fairly significantly from that of  the president.    Frankly speaking, this is a scandal. The desire of the  "ruling circles" to delay the dangerous publication appears  entirely natural. Instead, SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA, the government  newspaper, has published an article entitled "Who Profits from  Populism in Sociology?" Apparently it is not hard to guess what  its thrust is.    But still, a complete "conspiracy of silence" regarding the  poll has never materialized. Opposition newspapers published  its results and gave their commentaries.    The article "refuting" sociology was followed by a statement  from the presidential press service and vehement denunciations  in televised addresses. But maybe they should have given a  thought to it instead of getting so excited, shouldn't they?  After all, a rating, for all its subjectivity, cannot drop by  itself.    Right on the eve of the poll, the local press carried a  report on removing K. Shakirov from the post of finance  minister. He gave his relatives huge interest-free loans from  the budget. Earlier, the parliament's controlling chamber named  dozens of high-ranking officials engaged in tax evasion. Among  them there was a brother of the president's chief of staff.  People have noticed that blue Volvo cars presented to the  president and other republican leaders by the notorious Siabeko  firm have disappeared from parking lots outside White House  entrances. They have been replaced with black Mercedes. Buses  and trolleybuses in the city are running less and less  regularly, however. I think it is these incidents, not  Professor Isayev's mistakes, that have combined to play a  malicious joke on President Akayev's popularity rating.</p>

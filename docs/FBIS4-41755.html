			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Practically one in a hundred  Russians is unemployed or is registered by the state employment  agency as "not being occupied by working activity," i.e,  jobless. Most of the Russian unemployed are women and unskilled  workers, since those are the ones most often laid off.    Statistics show that there are almost one and a half million  jobless in Russia now. One million 219 thousand of them had  been officially recognized as unemployed. Two out of every  three people on the dole are former unskilled labourers.    Women are the unluckiest of all in the job market.  Two-thirds of the jobless are women. Moreover, the youngest  seem to suffer disproportionately: every third is in the 16-29  age group.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Virgin Atlantic incurs Pounds 9m loss MR Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways lost Pounds 9m before tax last year on its continuing businesses according to its previously unpublished financial results. Voyager Holdings, the private holding company for the airline and its tour operator, is looking to raise Pounds 55m by selling a 20 per cent stake. Its search for partners, at the same time as Mr Branson's negotiations to sell Virgin Music Group, his record company, for a reported Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m), has prompted speculation that the airline needs cash urgently. The airline's results show it did not escape recession and intense price competition with British Airways and other transatlantic rivals, but its debts did not rise precipitously last year, contrary to industry comments. Mr Branson, last said: 'We don't need cash at all if the airline were to trade just with the routes it has now. But it is a cheap time to expand, and we like to bring in partners before we need them.' He added: 'Even if we do the music deal, we've gone a fair way with the airline placing and we'll probably go ahead anyway.' Virgin is marketing the airline stake - through Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank - against the backdrop of severe recession throughout the airline industry worldwide. Voyager's pre-tax profits slumped to just Pounds 775,000 in the year to July 1991 from Pounds 8.5m in 1989-90 as the Gulf war pushed up fuel costs and deterred potential passengers. Although the airline saw turnover leap to Pounds 248.3m from Pounds 180.5m as it started flights to Boston and added flights to Tokyo, it made a Pounds 3m pre-tax loss - compared with a Pounds 7.3m profit the year before - after taking a Pounds 6m book profit on selling one of its 747 aircraft. Virgin Atlantic started flying out of Heathrow in July 1991, launching a battle for market share with British Airways. The year to July bore the heavy start-up costs of the new routes, particularly six months advance training of crews, but received none of the revenue. In spite of the recession, Virgin Atlantic maintained its policy of low fares and add-on incentives, which squeezed profits. The airline losses were partly offset by Virgin Holidays, the tour operator, which more than doubled its profits to Pounds 3.3m.</p>

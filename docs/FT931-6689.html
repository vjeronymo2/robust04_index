			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel: Driven to distraction - Snapshot / Rio de Janeiro MUCH in Rio de Janeiro is hard to believe, especially to the first-time visitor. A fairytale destination? Not exactly. Who could believe it possible to find a cab driver in Rio unable to find Corcovada? The massive statue of Christ the Redeemer is perched 2,500ft above the city, visible from every street and square. Better-known, even, than Sugar Loaf mountain. Squeezed in the back of a sweaty VW Beetle we fumed and eventually had to laugh as our driver, new to Rio, asked directions of incredulous street-smart children at every junction. Of course, the meter was running and we were paying. However, any connection between the meter and what one pays for a cab in Rio is about as notional as the exchange rate for the Brazilian cruzeira. Any taxi journey has to start with a session worthy of the EC finance ministers. One can sympathise. In a country with annualised inflation running at close to 1,000 per cent, a rate-per-mile agreed at breakfast-time is likely to look meagre by sunset. For the first-time tourist in Rio - a dwindling species - things can be bewildering. Items are either very cheap or hugely expensive - and quite randomly. Clean, well-appointed hotel rooms overlooking Copacabana Beach for around USDollars 40 a night? No problem. Admittedly, the hotels are 20- to 25-years-old and in need of refurbishment. But there has been virtually no new building on the famous beach since US tourists - fragile creatures - decided Rio was the wrong side of the tracks. Yet the views and the local colour make the the beach-front hotels a bargain. Just avoid the telephone. Most visitors learn only as they are checking out of their hotels that Brazil is attempting to pay off its national debt via the tariff for international calls. An item of USDollars 76 for an eight-minute call to Britain certainly lodged in the throat. Grazing in street cafes is the most economical and enjoyable way to eat during the day. A thimbleful of strong black coffee and a voluptuous pastry layered with cheese and ham will cost the local equivalent of 75p. While the area two or three blocks back from Copacabana is lively and fascinating, it is also dangerous. Most Brazilian muggers seem keener on goods than violence but they are also thick on the ground. Hardly a day goes by without another unfortunate trailing into the hotel lobby minus handbag or wallet. One experienced Rio hand told me never to voyage abroad with more than a single credit card, handful of cruzeiras for walking-about money and Dollars 20 for emergencies. It came to seem like good advice.</p>

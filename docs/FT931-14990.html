			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Review of council grants set to begin A THOROUGH review of the way in which the government allocates grant to councils is likely to begin next month with the aim of introducing changes in the spring of next year. The commitment to looking again at the calculation of standard spending assessments will be critical to ministers in winning the Commons debate due shortly on the local spending settlement for 1993-94. Both Tory and opposition MPs have repeatedly criticised the SSA system through which the government decides how much it thinks councils should spend - and which thus determines how much grant they receive. Introducing changes to the SSA methodology for 1994-95 would mean that they coincide with the use of full information from the 1991 census. Only raw population data from 1991 have been used in determining grant for the coming year. Ministers admit privately that, as the system of limiting or 'capping' local spending becomes increasingly dependent on SSAs, the present system might not be 'robust' enough to be a fair basis. But they did not want to complicate the first year of the new council tax, which replaces the poll tax in April, with a review of another aspect of local-government finance. Instead, the 90 local authority delegations which have made representations to environment ministers about SSAs have been told that the only likely area for change in the coming year is in the account taken of the removal from councils of responsibility for further education. The review of SSAs will cover matters such as whether to change the way in which the grant reflects the number of people from ethnic minorities in a particular area, and whether the local unemployment level should become a factor. In advance of the Commons debate, Labour yesterday renewed its long-standing attack on the SSA system with a claim that the calculations were 'partisan'. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, highlighted government figures showing that in England Labour councils received an average increase of 2.5 per cent in their SSAs, while Conservative councils received an average rise of 3.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Funds face asset allocation changes The proposed minimum solvency standard is expected to have a significant impact on the asset allocation of UK pension funds, reducing the average fund's proportion of equities to as little as 50 per cent from the current 80 per cent to 85 per cent. The schemes likely to be affected are those with a 'mature' membership - schemes which have a disproportionate number of members who are either already retired or very close to pension age. Schemes that are at or under the minimum solvency level will also face considerable difficulties if the proposed timescales for rectifying underfunding are not modified. The main problem for average and mature schemes is that the long-term funding for liabilities linked to earnings inflation - as is the case with future pensions - demands a high equity exposure. However, the way the solvency level is calculated assumes the company becomes insolvent tomorrow and therefore the fund requires a much greater proportion of gilts since these are used to match immediate pension liabilities. Consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow estimated that in extreme circumstances, where a scheme's liabilities related to a membership solely comprised of pensioners, the fund could have to switch to 100 per cent in gilts. The average fund, which has one third of its membership already as pensioners, could be forced to disinvest up to 30 per cent of its UK and overseas equity portfolios. Mr Richard Whitelam, partner with Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said: 'The matched position for an average scheme with one-third pensioner liability is close to 50-50 in equities and gilts. This compares with the current Combined Actuarial Performance Services average distribution of close to 85 per cent in equities and the remainder in gilts, bonds and cash.' The impact on the equity markets cannot be gauged at this stage, but it seems certain that the schemes most likely to be affected are also some of the UK's largest. Former public sector companies and the heavy manufacturing industries are the most obvious examples of mature schemes. The mineworkers scheme, the steel and chemical industry funds, the merchant navy pension funds and even some of the banks' schemes are considered very mature due to the shedding of large numbers of staff during the recession and, in some cases, the privatisation process. Several of these funds are valued in the Pounds 12bn to Pounds 15bn range. Where funds switch from equities to bonds the likely impact in reduced annual returns is dramatic, as can be seen in the table. Mr Eric Lambert, investment consultant at pension performance measurement company WM, said, 'Each additional 10 per cent of bond investment equates in broad terms to a reduction in return of 0.3 per cent per annum over periods between 10 and 20 years. An increase of 30 per cent in bond investment could reduce prospective returns by about 1 per cent per annum.' Looking ahead, Mr Lambert said that the additional cost in terms of lost investment opportunity after 20 years for an average UK pension fund of Pounds 200m that had to switch to a portfolio structure of 50 per cent equities and 50 per cent bonds would be Pounds 861m. Mr Ross Russell, a partner with actuaries Hymans Robertson and a member of the Association of Consulting Actuaries (ACA) pensions committee, said that employers had an alternative option to switching wholesale out of equities. 'Employers could consider contributing more to the scheme to build up surplus funds as a buffer against investment fluctuations and other adverse experience.' A second alternative, to use futures and options to protect against investment fluctuations, was not workable because there was insufficient capacity in the equity markets, he said. Mr Russell added: 'The ACA's main concern is the tight timescales laid down to rectify an insolvency position. This could mean that a company has to make a huge cash injection or create yet another creditor to the company. 'However, despite the categorical wording in the white paper, we understand that the government intends to seek further consultation on this issue and we welcome this initiative.' The government is also understood to be considering a new type of gilt that would more closely match the future liabilities of schemes under the minimum solvency standard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------          Projected returns where equity holdings are reduced  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Years                                            10    15    20  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Return (% pa) Asset mix global equities*/ UK bonds 80/20                                    16.4  17.8  17.0 70/30                                    16.0  17.6  16.4 60/40                                    15.7  17.3  16.1 50/50                                    15.4  16.9  15.8 *Assumes  2/3  / 1/3   UK/Overseas equities  --------------------------------------------------------------------- On an average UK pension fund of Pounds 200m, the additional cost at the end of the period in today's money terms could be (Poundsm): 80/20                                     nil   nil   nil 70/30                                      31    59   451 60/40                                      53   145   661 50/50                                      75   255   861  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: WM Company  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- How fund managers will have to adjust the mix  --------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPS asset allocation for the average UK pension fund UK equities                     56.7% Overseas equities               25.6%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total equities                  82.3%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK bonds                         3.3% Overseas bonds                   4.8% UK index linked                  3.0%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total bonds                     11.1%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Other (property, cash etc)       6.6%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bacon &amp; Woodrow  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

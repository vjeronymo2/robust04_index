			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 20 WREATHS PLACED AT LINCOLN'S TOMB  </P> <P> About 200 people watched as veterans and state leaders laid 20 wreaths Monday  at Abraham Lincoln's tomb in an annual pilgrimage to mark the 181st anniversary  of his birth.  </P> <P> Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) presented a wreath  from President Bush made of red, white and blue carnations. Both compared  Lincoln's desire for freedom to the democratic movements in Eastern Europe and  the release from prison of black activist Nelson R. Mandela in South Africa.  </P> <P> Lincoln owned his only home in Springfield and lived in that downtown residence  from 1844-60 while he practiced law and served in the Illinois General  Assembly.  </P></p>

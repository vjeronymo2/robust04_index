			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Discounted sales Given the gloomy tone of consumer confidence surveys, the last few months' consumer spending figures have proved unexpectedly robust. Indeed, the government is keen to stress the current quarter's improvement over the previous three months. However, it would be unwise to rely on consumers too much. August's improvement followed a very weak July - suggesting that buyers were waiting for the summer sales before spending. The last two months have shown only small gains. And while volumes may be holding up, retailers' margins are still under severe pressure. The key question is the extent to which savings on mortgage payments and real income rises are used to spend rather than to reduce debt. The US may be an imperfect guide, but zero real short-term interest rates there have not tempted consumers. In the UK short-term real rates are about 3 per cent and on many mortgages real rates are still over 5 per cent. Yet as asset prices continue to fall and unemployment again accelerates, the incentive to save remains strong. With investment and exports under pressure, the government must hope consumers will produce a recovery. The danger is that there will be precious little recovery at all.</p>

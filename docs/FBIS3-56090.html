During a break, an Interfax reporter  asked several lawmakers to forecast election results.    The Kemerovo Region's Governor Aman Tuleyev believes that  First Vice-Premier Vladimir Shumeyko will be elected Speaker of  the House, "even though I voted against him." He explained his  belief by the fact that administration chiefs and other House  members had come in for too much pressure from the executive  branch.    Tuleyev voiced fear that if Shumeyko were elected Chairman,  the House "would turn into a Presidential Council." He remarked  for this reason that regions were at odds with the central  government on both political and economic issues. At the same  time, he argued that Shumeyko's victory meant overall regional  support for the president and government.    President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of Kalmykia believes that the  Federation Council should mirror the interests of voters rather  than cow tow the government, "a line being sought to be imposed  on House members." He noted in this connection that the  government's policy had not been reflecting the interests of  constituents in recent time. That, in his words, was borne out  by the parliamentary elections on December 12. "If the nation  had backed up the government's course, there wouldn't have been  the Zhirinovskiy's phenomenon," he remarked.    According to Ilyumzhinov, the nomination of Shumeyko means  presidential pressure on deputies. He admitted that he himself  had voted for Peter Romanov.    Ex-Speaker of the House of Nationalities of Russia's former  Supreme Soviet Ramazan Abdulatipov declared that he had no doubt  about the endorsement of Shumeyko as Speaker. In his opinion,  the election of the First Vice-Premier meant that the House  "extends a hand of cooperation to the country's president and  government." "It is important that the Federation Council's  position be appreciated by the Head of State and Council of  Ministers," he said.    The Nizhnyy Novgorod Region's Governor Boris Nemtsov feels  that if Shumeyko is elected, the Federation Council will have  proper relations with the president. However, he noted that  "the interests of the lawmakers, representing Federation  Territories, must not suffer from personal attachments of  Shumeyko and Yeltsin."    Nemtsov agreed that the Council could become a buffer  between  the president and State Duma. However, neither the president  nor Duma can desire a mediator, he added.</p>

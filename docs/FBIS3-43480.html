Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura yesterday delivered  a message from President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali. The message deals with issues linked to  Angola's current political situation. Minister Venancio de  Moura, who has been visiting New York for three days, took the  opportunity to hold talks with high officials from the U.S.  State Department and White House to discuss the country's  political crisis. Afonso van Dunem, Angola's ambassador to  United Nations, had this to say on the issue:    [Begin Van Dunem recording] In brief, I can say that the  foreign minister has been in New York for two days and his visit  is aimed at delivering a message from the president of the  republic to the UN secretary general. It was a very timely,  useful, and busy visit. [end recording]    We asked Afonso van Dunem to comment about the meeting  between the Angolan foreign minister and the UN secretary  general on the establishment of the new UNAVEM [UN Angola  Verification Mission]-3 contingent, and he said:    [Begin Van Dunem Recording] This issue was touched on  because  a number of steps must be taken before the UNAVEM-2 is  transformed to UNAVEM-3. First, the Security Council has to  meet and approve a resolution sanctioning the UN secretary  general undertaking a process of political and logistical  transformation, and this has a number of implications. However,  the time has not yet come for the Security Council to discuss  the issue of UNAVEM-2's transformation to UNAVEM-3. Obviously,  all this will depend on the whole process, since this does not  depend only on our government. It depends on concrete  conditions on the ground, on the talks which are under way, and  as I have said, on the whole peace process in Angola. [end  recording]    In his diplomatic mission, as well as dealing with political  issues, the Angolan foreign minister took the opportunity to  appeal to the international community to assist the victims of  war in the country.    [Begin Van Dunem] Our government's priority is not only  political issues regarding the peace process, but also issues  linked to humanitarian aid by the international community,  namely the United Nations.

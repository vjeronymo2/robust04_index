Cuccia is accused of registering the  equivalent of $17 million under a false heading in Mediobanca's balance sheets  from 1976 to 1980. Investigators say the money may have been used for such  things as employee bonuses and to improve the ailing balances of bank clients.  Cuccia and other bank officials deny the charges.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> County economy -- A bar graph accompanying an article published Sunday about  the county's economy was mislabeled. The graph made it appear that the total  amount of leased office space in 1990 is about 300,000 square feet. Actually,  that figure is the projected net increase in leased office space this year, a  figure roughly equal to the increases of the previous two years.  </P></p>

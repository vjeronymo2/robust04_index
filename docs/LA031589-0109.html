			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Consumer Expectations Ease: Consumers' expectations fell slightly in February,  and a record number of consumers said they expect interest rates to continue  rising over the year, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. The  university's index of consumer expectations, which measures consumer optimism,  slipped to 88.8 last month from 89.9 in January. The base of 1966 equals 100.  However, Richard Curtin, director of the university's consumer survey, told a  press conference, "Overall, the current level of consumer expectations remained  quite positive." The index is based mainly on questions about how consumers  view their personal financial prospects as well as prospects for the economy  over the short and long term.  </P></p>

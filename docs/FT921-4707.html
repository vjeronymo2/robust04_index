			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / An old dream feels its age: Ian Botham's triumphs have made Dominic Lawson ask if 35 really is ancient LIKE EVERY other schoolboy I used to daydream about playing cricket for England. I would write down batting line-ups in which the very unresonant name of Lawson would magically appear alongside those of Dexter, Cowdrey and the up and coming youngster from Yorkshire, Geoffrey Boycott. Naturally, my pull shot was more pulverising than Dexter's, my cover drive more elegant than Cowdrey's, and my forward defensive more impenetrable than Boycott's. Such fantasies worked because it was theoretically possible that they might come true. Who knew what the future and adulthood held? Admittedly, as the years passed by this theoretical possibility became increasingly . . . theoretical. But now I am faced with the depressing truth: at 35, it is all too late. It is possible to fantasise about what one might do in the future, but to fantasise about what one might have done in the past - this just does not work. I had never before thought that 35 was old, but the cricketing event of the past week - the achievement of Ian Botham in England's victory over Australia - has made me realise how wrong I was. Botham, barely a few months older than I am, is, according to various and different press commentators 'old', 'an aldermanic uncle' and 'a miracle of sporting longevity.' Even worse have been the comments of the commentators on Sky Television who squawk incredulously that 'the old boy has done it again' and 'it's an amazing achievement for a man of his age.' Graham Gooch who is, at 38, even more ancient than either me or Ian Botham, was also cited by one commentator as 'a remarkable triumph of mind over matter: 'is knees 'ave almost gone.' I suppose that the achievements of Messrs Botham and Gooch should have made me feel as though my fantasy of playing for England was not yet dead, but somehow the incredulity of the commentators at these supposed triumphs of gerontocracy have had the opposite effect. What is particularly unbearable is that these comments come from retired Test cricketers of enormous age - the sort of people who had their first experience of a creaking knee before Ian Botham could grow hair on his upper lip. I am not sure what the motives of these pundits are. Is it jealousy of the success of cricketers who have carried on playing international matches at an age when the commentators had already turned into shambling, pot-bellied wrecks? Is it because Sky Sport - the television channel with exclusive rights to the cricket World Cup - believes that the bulk of its audience is so young as to regard anyone of 35 as a venerable father figure? Perhaps it is just a journalistic desire to manufacture a story of triumph against adversity: how much more enthralling it is to believe that we are witnessing something miraculous, when in fact Botham and Gooch are far outshone, as examples of cricketing longevity, by the likes of Sir Jack Hobbs, Colin Cowdrey and Gubby Allen. I can envisage the next step to be taken by Sky Sport and the new school of cricket impresarios. They will create a veterans' tournament open to players over 30, exclusive coverage of which will fill the few hours not already occupied by veterans' tennis and veterans' golf. In these tournaments a boundary will be greeted with a howl of disbelief, while any 40-year-old bowler who manages to knock a stump out of the ground will be hailed as a marvel of modern health care techniques. His diet will be serialised, along with his exercise regime, in the better Sunday colour supplements. In the less good ones his wife will give interviews about how she keeps her man young. The effect of moving all the 30-something crocks into the veterans' league will, of course, be to allow the ageing commentators to opine that a certain Test cricketer in his late 20s is 'past his best' or to marvel that another is 'still able to turn his arm over at the age of 29.' Meanwhile, my own daydream has changed: I shall now fantasise about being a cricket commentator. That seems to be a profession without redundancy or obsolescence. Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.</p>

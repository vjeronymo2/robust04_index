			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: TORRES' PROPOSAL FOR STATE-RUN AIRLINE CRASHES, BURNS IN VOTE  </P> <P> Sen. Art Torres' ambitious plan to put the state of California in the business  of running a passenger airline crashed on the runway in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Spawned by what the Los Angeles Democrat deplored as "outrageous" commercial  air fares and inconvenient schedules, his bill (SB 2900) received only 13  favorable votes of the 27 required for approval by the Senate. Twenty-one  senators voted no.  </P> <P> From the outset, the notion of a state-operated airline, flying primarily  between Sacramento and Southern California, was given little chance of becoming  law, particularly in the face of heavy opposition from the influential airline  lobby.  </P> <P> At the state Capitol, the Torres proposal was regarded chiefly as a device to  prod the airlines into cutting back on fares and adopting more convenient  schedules in California. The proposal for a nonprofit, state-operated airline  suggested less costly and more passenger-oriented air travel.  </P> <P> "We're suckers for the airline industry," Torres told the Senate. "It's time  California raised its eyebrows and said enough is enough."  </P> <P> But an opponent, freshman Sen. Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), told Torres that  while "it's cute to discuss the issue . . . we ought to consider addressing  some of the more serious problems facing the state."  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> U.S. Flag: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 48-14 vote a resolution (AJR 97)  by Assemblyman Norm Waters (D-Plymouth) requesting Congress to propose a  constitutional amendment for ratification by the states to outlaw the  desecration of the U.S. flag.  </P> <P> Pesticide Research: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 42-22 vote a bill (AB  4161) by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to establish a center for  pesticide research within the University of California to come up with  alternatives for malathion and other chemicals now in common use.  </P> <P> Health Insurance: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 42-27 vote a bill (AB  3364) by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton) to set up a health insurance  guarantee fund to pay off claims of policyholders of bankrupt firms.  </P> <P> Student Teams: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 41-29 vote a bill (AB 4134)  by Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) to set up two-year mother/daughter  student team projects at San Diego State and Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Credit Cards: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 44-12 vote a bill (AB 2920) by  Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) to prohibit merchants from asking for  telephone numbers on credit card slips. These phone numbers are sometimes later  sold to advertising lists.  </P> <P> Looting: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 65-1 vote a bill (AB 3894) by  Assemblyman William Filante (R-Greenbrae) to declare as a state crime any act  of looting during a state of emergency such as an earthquake or flood.  </P> <P> Garage Door Openers: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 48-18 vote a bill (AB  3600) by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) to establish safety  standards for automatic garage door openers to prevent people from being  accidentally crushed by them.  </P> <P> SENATE  </P> <P> Floor Action  </P> <P> Rental Deposits: Rejected on a 21-10 vote a bill (SB 1755) by Sen. Quentin Kopp  (I-San Francisco) to require landlords to pay 5% annual interest on tenant  security deposits of $50 or more that are held for at least one year.  </P> <P> Governor: Passed and sent to the Assembly on a 27-12 vote a proposed ballot  measure (SCA 40) by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) to require the governor  to appear before the Senate three times a year to answer members' questions.  The measure was amended to delete a requirement that legislators also conduct  public forums in their districts three times a year to answer constituents'  questions.  </P> <P> Miscellany  </P> <P> "I want you to know that it isn't easy these days to get a state legislator to  tour the inside of a prison -- at least not voluntarily," said Senate Majority  Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia) after walking through the newly opened Pelican  Bay state prison near Crescent City with Gov. George Deukmejian. Former Sen.  Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) recently was sentenced to serve 6 1/2 years in  prison after being convicted of Capitol political corruption charges.  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> The Assembly has 25 standing committees and the Senate 24 standing committees  that conduct public hearings and accept testimony for and against proposed  legislation before it is sent to the respective house floors.  </P></p>

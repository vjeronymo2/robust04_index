			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: 0.37% accept Airtours offer Airtours has received valid acceptances of its hostile bid for Owners Abroad, its rival holiday company, from shareholders representing 0.37 per cent of the capital. Acceptances were likely to be low at the first closing date given that the Office of Fair Trading is still considering a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, called the level of acceptances paltry.</p>

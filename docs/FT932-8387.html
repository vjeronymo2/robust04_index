			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Inside profit THE INTEGRATION of German trade unions into the structure of German capitalism has been an abiding feature of the country's economy this century. After the second world war, co-operation between trade unionists and management, especially the joint presence of employees' and shareholders' representatives on supervisory boards, greatly contributed to West Germany's industrial recovery. Sometimes, however, trade unionists are well advised to keep a clear distance from the seductive world of money-making. By purchasing shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company shortly before their stock market price rose sharply, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall engineering union leader, and a member of Daimler's supervisory board, appears to have overstepped the limits of both propriety and good sense. Mr Steinkuhler is one of Germany's most gifted and astute union leaders. He played an important part in the strike in the east German engineering industry which has just ended with a partial, though probably pyrrhic victory for IG Metall. In contrast to Anglo-Saxon countries, insider trading in Germany is not illegal, although banks and companies run a voluntary code to try to curb it. As part of efforts to improve Germany's standing as an international financial centre, the government is planning legislation to outlaw the practice. Mr Steinkuhler maintains that his share purchases were not prompted by inside information. He bought nearly DM1m worth of Mercedes Holding (MAH) shares in March and April, shortly before a formal supervisory board decision to dissolve the company, giving MAH shareholders large windfall profits. Such transactions by a person possessing both a sensitive public profile and access to insider knowledge displayed an absence of caution, to say the least. Apart from anything else, the affair may raise doubts about Mr Steinkuhler's standing among union members - especially relatively low-paid workers in the east. Germany's roughly 4m people out of work, some of whom owe their unemployment to unduly high wage rises since unification, may also ask bitter questions. Mr Steinkkuhler's behaviour has evoked uncomfortable memories of earlier trade union blunders, such as over the Neue Heimat property scandal in the 1980s. He should now co-operate fully in the Frankfurt stock exchange's insider-dealing inquiries. If suspicions of malpractice are upheld, he will have no option but to resign. On a wider front, the incident is a reminder of the temptations facing individuals from both sides of industry in a corporatist business culture based upon both consensus and a good deal of secrecy. The affair underlines the need for more transparency in German business life.</p>

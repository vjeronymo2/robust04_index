			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE SEEKS WAYS TO RETAIN HEALTH CENTER  </P> <P> Torrance City Council members said Tuesday that they hope to persuade Los  Angeles County officials to retain the county-operated health center in  Torrance.  </P> <P> A recent county report questioned the seismic safety of the Torrance Health  Center at 2300 W. Carson St. County officials are considering renovating the  structure, constructing a new center or moving the facility to another city.  </P> <P> Mayor Katy Geissert said she would prefer that the county look into  rehabilitating the 58-year-old structure. "That is a beautiful old building. I  would like to see that building restored," she said.  </P> <P> But Councilman Bill Applegate said the city's primary focus has to be keeping  the center in the city -- not renovating the building. "The paramount thing is,  we want the center to remain in Torrance," he said.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Geissert said the council may be able to draw support from  neighboring cities that use the Torrance Health Center.  </P> <P> Hugo Almeida, chief executive officer for the Coastal County Health Centers,  part of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, said in an  interview that the recent study showed the health center may not withstand an  earthquake of 6.5 or greater intensity. He said a follow-up study is due out  shortly.  </P> <P> Costs have been estimated at $1.2 million for renovation, Almeida said. The  county also may look at leasing space in Torrance, or the center could be  consolidated with another facility in San Pedro or elsewhere, he said.  </P></p>

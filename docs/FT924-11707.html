			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Staff stop work over appointment at MGN STAFF AT Mirror Group Newspapers stopped work last night after the company confirmed that Mr David Montgomery, former editor of Today, had been appointed chief executive. Journalists and other staff on the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People newspapers said they would refuse to work with Mr Montgomery - who also edited the News of the World, another paper in the Rupert Murdoch stable. They held a newsroom meeting and said the stoppage would continue until they received assurances that his appointment would not take place. Mr Montgomery was called 'a sacker and union buster' by the National Union of Journalists' members, who fear he will end the Daily Mirror's traditional support for the Labour party. Mr Montgomery's appointment prompted Mr Joe Haines, the MGN non-executive director and former political editor, to resign on Thursday night, saying the Daily Mirror's reputation as a left-wing newspaper would be destroyed. However, in an apparent effort to maintain the political balance in the MGN boardroom, the company also announced yesterday that Lord Hollick, the Labour peer who is managing director of MAI, the financial services and media group, had been appointed a non-executive director. Mr Montgomery, commenting on the editorial policy of the MGN titles, said: 'The board has today reconfirmed that MGN's left-of-centre editorial stance will be maintained under the overall responsibility of the editors of the respective newspapers. I look forward to developing MGN as a strong independently owned company.' MGN also said Mr John Allwood had been appointed finance director. Mr Allwood is a chartered accountant with over 14 years experience in newspapers, including 11 years at News International.</p>

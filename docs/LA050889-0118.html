			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LENDL ROUTS PERUVIAN YZAGA;  </P> <P> TOP SEED WINS 3RD TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl routed unseeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru 6-2, 6-1 today to win his third  Tournament of Champions tennis title.  </P> <P> Lendl beat Yzaga in 70 minutes on another cold, windy day at the West Side  Tennis Club.

His other victories came at the  Australian Open, Scottsdale and Key Biscayne.  </P> <P> Lendl earned $82,450, and Yzaga received $41,255.  </P> <P> Lendl, who wore sweat pants during the match because of the chilly weather,  broke Yzaga in the opening game at love and went on to win the first set in 34  minutes.  </P> <P> "I was able to overpower him today," said Lendl, whose only problems today came  from the unseasonably cold weather and very strong winds at Forest Hills that  tended to keep the ball in the air longer than usual.  </P> <P> Lendl, who was not happy with his clay court game after his opener here,  improved with each match and leaves Forest Hills satisfied that he will be  ready for the French Open beginning May 29.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've ever been in better shape (this early in May)," Lendl said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Points Squandered  </P> <P> After Lendl opened the second set with another service break, Yzaga had a  chance to even the set. But he squandered three break points in the next game  by netting easy forehands and showed his frustration by slamming his racket to  the ground several times.  </P> <P> Lendl also won the Tournament of Champions in 1982 and 1985. He is 3-0 against  Yzaga, who is ranked 56th in the world.  </P> <P> In Hamburg, West Germany, Sergio Bruguera of Spain upset Monte Carlo champion  Alberto Mancini of Argentina 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 today in the first round of the  German Open men's tennis tournament.  </P> <P> Another Spaniard, Tomas Carbonell, ousted 12th-seeded Darren Cahill of  Australia 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> Mancini, playing his third tournament in as many weeks, was ousted by another  clay-court specialist as Bruguera overcame the loss of the first set to  eliminate the favored Argentine in 2 hours and 3 minutes.  </P> <P> "I didn't know my opponent at all, and I was very surprised by his strong  game," the 19-year Argentine said after his loss. "I really had problems with  his forehand. The only good thing is that now I'll have a week to rest before  the Italian Open."  </P> <P> Bruguera, 18, who is playing only his fourth Grand Prix tournament, said he  still could not believe he won. "I just tried to concentrate, that was all."  </P> <P> Organizers also announced that Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia had withdrawn  from the tournament because of a persistent back injury. He was replaced in the  draw by Pablo Arraya of Peru.  </P> <P> Boris Becker, the second seed in the $692,500 Nabisco Grand Prix event, and  Lendl, the top seed, received first-round byes.  </P> <P> In Rome, Petra Langrova of Czechoslovakia upset ninth-seeded Nicole Provis of  Australia 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-0 today in the first round of the $300,000 Italian  Open women's tennis championships.  </P></p>

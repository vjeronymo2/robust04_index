No details were  given about the issue discussed by Gen. Eyadema and Mr. Kwajo.  Their talks might not be unconnected with the shelling of our  Aflao border post yesterday with gunfire from Ghana. The border  post was shelled with automatic weapons. Togolese soldiers have  received instructions not to return fire against any attack from  that neighboring country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the Sandinist </F> National Liberation Front, FSLN, at the opening session of the  FSLN Special Congress at the Olof Palme Convention Center in  Managua -- live]    [Text] Companeros and companeras; delegates; national and  international observers invited to the FSLN Special Congress;  Sandinist brothers; Nicaraguan brothers: In this month of May,  we commemorated the 99th anniversary of the birth of Augusto  Cesar Sandino, our general of free men. On 4 May, we celebrated  the Day of National Dignity. May is the month when the rainy  season begins. May is the month of mothers. It is the month in  which we are holding this Sandinist Congress.    When we proposed this Special Congress, we did it with the  certainty that it will serve to consolidate and unite Sandinism  around its program and statutes. This way the people will be  able to count on a Sandinist Front that is united around  revolutionary principles and programs.    This is part of a process in which ideas have been presented  with complete freedom. This has been a rich process because of  the many proposals advanced at local assemblies and forums.  This is a process in which self-criticism is necessary, because  this process is being conducted in the fraternal, constructive,  and revolutionary way in which we are obligated to conduct it.    We are certain that the FSLN will emerge from this special  session with strengthened democratic unity. Under these  circumstances, we will be promoting internal changes that will  enable us to promote changes in favor of the entire nation. In  this way, we Sandinists will be returning to the people, who are  our fountainhead and raison d'etre.    In a world subjected to the neoliberal offensive that is  proclaiming the end of history, trying to bury the noble ideals  that moved mankind to search for a more just, free, and  equitable world, the people are resisting, the people are not  surrendering, and the people are achieving victories, such as  the one secured recently by the heroic people of South Africa.  The people want changes. This necessarily means seeking new  paths and alternatives to face neoliberalism. An example of  this is the resistance of the heroic people of Cuba, subject to  an illegal policy of U.S. imperialism, which violates the human  rights of all its people and which maintains the blockade and  embargo against our Cuban brothers.    The people of our America also are resisting. They are  resorting to the most extensive forms of struggle. This  includes the Haitian people, who see how their democratic  aspirations have been shunned. In the Middle East, the  Palestinians are increasing their efforts to fully recover their  territory, and the people of Libya and Iraq are resisting the  effects of a blockade imposed by hegemonic interests.    In the face of neoliberalism, the struggle for the survival  of mankind and the struggle for the environment are objectives  that are being strongly defended by the people in both the North  and South of our planet.    In a world that demands changes to save mankind, we  Sandinists must update and therefore enrich our program. We  must promote organizational transformations and therefore enrich  our statutes. We must strengthen the leadership by opening the  doors of our organization to everyone who may voluntarily want  to adhere to our principles and programs. By strengthening the  leadership in the rank and file, we would be strengthening the  leadership of the organization and we would be returning to the  people. To do this, it is necessary to integrate Nicaragua's  young people and its women.    The front has been a factor for change in Nicaraguan  society,  which allowed us to ascend from a guerrilla column that in 1963  carried out an incursion in Bocay to become a national and  popular insurrection which, on 19 July 1979, overthrew the  Somozist dictatorship.    While in the government, we always promoted initiatives and  worked for the strengthening of a de jure state, despite the war  the U.S. Administration of Ronald Reagan launched against us.  This earned us the respect and admiration of people from around  the world and nurtured solidarity with Nicaraguans in the most  remote places in the world. Our revitalized thoughts made  democracy possible and led to profound changes -- agrarian  reform, the literacy campaign, and the defense of sovereignty.    This open-mindedness allowed us to defend at the proper  moment the privatization of state enterprises in favor of  workers, retired Army and Government Ministry officials, and  demobilized Resistance people. This open mindedness also led to  the autonomy law in favor of our Atlantic coast brothers, and  today we must acknowledge the autonomous nature of the FSLN in  the autonomous northern Atlantic and southern Atlantic regions,  just as the companeros from the coast have proposed in recent  assemblies and congresses.    Now we have to put our imagination and our initiatives to  the  test to overcome the errors we have undoubtedly committed and to  create plans to work for new and better forms of organization to  recover the trust and credibility of Sandinists, both with and  without credentials, and together with them, we must work to win  the confidence of the Nicaraguan people as we defend their  interests, carry out daily efforts, and work to recapture the  government in the 1996 elections. By doing this, we would be  returning to the people.    The current neoliberal government has led the country to  economic stagnation, unemployment, and the disintegration of the  Nicaraguan family and society. In the face of a profound crisis  like the one burdening the Nicaraguan people, the front  represents a factor of national stability and hope for a change.    The reconstruction of the country and a national program  concerned with the people will be possible only with the  participation of all national economic, social, and political  forces. No sector in the country will escape the destructive  impact of neoliberal policies. This is why as soon as this  Special Congress concludes we must again take the initiative to  implement a national unity program. We must also seek support  for the workers who demand a new labor code. We must seek broad  agreement to demand respect for Laws 85, 86, and 88, which  benefit more than 200,000 families, to secure the legalization  and registration of these properties, just like the properties  that have been transferred since 1990 as a result of the  privatization process, which has benefited popular sectors.    We have to support the bonuses law to grant satisfactory  compensation to claimants when the law supports their claims,  including U.S. citizens. Therefore, U.S. citizens and  Nicaraguans who took U.S. citizenship will have to submit to  Nicaraguan laws. There can be no exceptions. The government has  the obligation of defending Nicaragua's self-determination  rights and reject foreign pressure.    We Sandinists must support the workers, the peasants, coffee  producers, ranchers, the producers of basic grains, and all  sectors that have been affected and are demanding that the  government change its economic policy to create conditions in  favor of economic recovery, production, and the creation of jobs.    We Sandinists must work for the modernization of the state  through the constitutional reforms being reviewed by the  National Assembly. We Sandinists must promote a broad national  movement for a long-term social and economic program that, with  the support of all the Nicaraguans, might make possible a  national solution to the crisis and bring about the arrival of  true peace and stability.    In our pluralist and democratic Nicaragua, there have been  two elections -- the one in 1984 and the one in 1990. On these  occasions, the Sandinists' respect for the will of the people  was tested. The outcome is that we peacefully turned over the  government on 25 April 1990.    National elections are scheduled for November 1996, and we  Sandinists must better prepare ourselves for the elections by  first assuming a policy of self-criticism that will allow us to  listen to one another and remedy our differences on time. We  have made many mistakes. After the defeat in the elections,  different groups emerged and then moved in their own directions.  This created even more contradictions. Not everything was well  done even though people were full of goodwill and were concerned  about the problems of the nation. To achieve victory in the  1996 elections, it is necessary to resolve our internal matters  by updating our programs and bylaws. We have to take on the  appropriate revolutionary discipline. We have to show  fraternity and respect for one another and for the people. By  going back to the people and by holding an electoral reform  debate that can promote national unity, the Sandinists are going  to achieve victory with the Nicaraguan people's vote in the 1996  elections.    Brothers, to achieve the objectives demanded by Nicaraguans  in this historic period, we have to reclaim Sandinist ethics and  morale. We have to reclaim the values that have supported the  great causes of humanity, solidarity, honesty, humility, and  respect for the poverty in which our people have been living.  These are the values we have to rescue in order that the  Sandinists can face the venom toted by the neoliberals inside  their bags that are chock-full of jaded values such as  individualism, selfishness, and the save-yourself philosophy.    We have to undergo a deep test of self-criticism that can  shake up our consciences. We cannot tolerate more abuses and  violations. We need to come out with our heads held high and  with our souls in intact to defend the rights of the people.    Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: We have tried to  give the best of our lives to the defense of freedom, justice,  and the sovereignty of the Nicaraguan people. We -- men and  women together -- met one another along a path originally marked  by our General Sandino. The National Directorate of the FSLN  assumed the commitment of those who were willing to wage a  profound battle. Many brothers fell with the silence of heroes,  who not only said they would die for the fatherland, but  actually did die for the fatherland. Among those who fell were  Carlos Fonseca, Santos Lopez, Jorge Navarro, Silvio Mayorga,  Luis Humberto Cruz, Casimiro Sotelo, Julio Buitrago, Oscar  Turcio, Ricardo Morales, Jacinto Hernandez, Filemon Rivera, Jose  Benito Escobar, [words indistinct], Eduardo Contreras, and  Carlos Nunez.    Following the difficult times of the Somoza dictatorship and  the defense of the revolution, the members of the FSLN National  Directorate, men of flesh and bone, making correct and incorrect  decisions via both our vices and virtues, and yet full of  revolutionary love and passion, we have tried to do our best for  the people. We have tried not to betray ourselves or to  surrender. We have decided to continue fighting until we  achieve a free, just, and peaceful fatherland -- a fatherland of  which our General Sandino dreamed and for which our heroes and  martyrs spilled their blood.    Long live the unity of the FSLN! Long live the unity of the  Nicaraguan people! Sandino lives! The struggle continues!  Free fatherland or death! [applause]</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Funds head into Europe WHILE the House of Commons debated the Maastricht treaty this week, two fund managers announced that they would plunge into Europe by launching investment trusts. Many thought that the time for investment trust launches had finished after the spate of new issues to take advantage of the personal equity plan rules at the end of the 1991-92 tax year. But Europe is now established firmly as the most popular global sector for new investment, thanks to Japan's difficulties and widespread sentiment that the US market is now overpriced. Henderson is launching Henderson EuroTrust, which is aiming to raise at least Pounds 20m. Its portfolio will hold mainly blue chip companies and it will aim for both growth and income, filling what the company sees as a gap in its investment trust range. To achieve this, it will have a minimum holding in bonds of 15 per cent, and can invest up to 10 per cent of its assets in derivatives. This will allow it cheap exposure to growth stocks. It will have a split capital structure, with 75 per cent ordinary shares and 25 per cent in zero-dividend preference shares. Zeros are still popular and this structure will, Henderson hopes, stop the shares from moving to a discount to net asset value. The company has a ten-year life until October 2002, when the zero shares will be redeemed at 70p. This is equivalent to a gross redemption yield of 10.2 per cent. Projected initial gross yield on the ordinary shares is 5 per cent. During the launch, only packaged units, consisting of one ordinary share and one zero at a price of Pounds 1, will be available. Total launch expenses have been fixed at 4.5 per cent, with an annual management fee of 0.85 per cent. Gerrard Vivian Gray is sponsoring the issue. The prospectus will be available on June 8 and applications for personal equity plans will close on June 22. The offer closes on June 30, with dealings in the shares starting on July 6. Thornton Investment Management is, even more ambitiously, seeking to raise Pounds 100m via an international placing for its European Smaller Companies trust. Fund management will be conducted jointly by Thornton in the UK, Banque Nationale de Paris in France and Dresdner Bank in Germany, and management will be devolved to the three countries. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is the sponsor. Thornton hopes that close contact with the markets involved will help to deliver performance in an area where stock-picking is particularly important. It will qualify as a UK investment trust but will also be listed on the Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges. Stock will be distributed in Pounds 5 'units' consisting of five ordinary shares and one warrant, and investors will also be allowed to subscribe in German or French currency at a 'comparable' price. Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister and chairman of Thornton, said the fund would aim to take advantage of the establishment of the EC single market and the reconstruction of eastern Europe. According to the provisional timetable, the offer for subscription will open on June 15 and close on July 7, with dealings starting on July 14.</p>

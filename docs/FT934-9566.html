			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A bad democratic idea Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, November 4) concludes: 'The main case for an independently accountable (my italics) central bank is not that it can magically bring price stability at a zero cost. It is the case for having one body clearly responsible for monetary policy, which could not then be blamed on some amorphous amalgam of politicians, officials and central bankers as at present.' He goes on to argue: 'Moreover, it is a good democratic idea that fewer decisions should be taken by a central government, constantly looking over its shoulder at its parliamentary majority, and that more should be taken by other bodies accountable in other ways.' He destroys his own case by not giving us any definition of 'accountable' other than that other bodies should be 'accountable in other ways'. The real case against him, however, is that no government would, or should, give up responsibility for its central, and essential, control of the economy. For monetary policy is about very much more than price stability. It goes to the very heart of economic policy, and cannot be left to another quango with an ill-defined form of 'accountability'. That would not be a 'good democratic idea'. It would be a very bad one. Joel Barnett, 7 Hillingdon Road, Manchester M25 7QQ</p>

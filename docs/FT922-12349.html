			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Euphoria succumbs to hard currency reality / A look at the change of mood in the money markets BRITAIN'S interest-rate euphoria proved shortlived. Hopes that Mr John Major's winning of a fourth term of government might be followed by a swift fall in borrowing costs have been dashed. Events on the money markets since last week's election victory suggest that the government is in no rush to lower rates. Once it is, it will find that its power to determine interest-rate policy is limited. UK membership of the European Monetary System protected sterling from speculative attack in the election campaign. But the EMS is now more likely to be blamed for preventing the government from bringing interest rates more into line with the country's needs. Bank base rates, which have been stuck at 10.5 per cent for more than six months, are unusually high given that the UK is struggling to get out of its longest recession since the 1930s and that inflation, as measured by the retail prices index, has fallen to a year-on-year rate of 4 per cent. Yet the chances of a big cut are slim, and will remain so while Germany's Lombard rate stays at the 9.75 per cent fixed in December when the Bundesbank announced a 0.5 percentage point increase in Germany's key interest rates. Germany still provides the anchor currency for the EMS in spite of a surge of inflationary pressures since unification. The view in the Treasury is that the present 0.75 per cent differential between UK and German short-term interest rates is small by historic standards, making a cut in UK rates less likely in the absence of lower German interest rates. A modest 0.5 per cent cut in UK base rates cannot be ruled out, however. The authorities have been waiting to see how sterling settles down after the election. The chances of a rate cut could increase if sterling continued to strengthen and moved above its DM2.95 central rate in the EMS exchange rate mechanism. So far, the Bank of England has displayed no enthusiasm for a cut. In response, the three-month interbank rate, which often acts as a guide to base rate movements, was only slightly below base rate at about 10 3/8 per cent this week. During the election campaign Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, made clear that he accepted the constraints imposed by UK membership of the ERM. He said that historians would probably say that Britain joined the ERM at a very difficult period. The chancellor nailed his colours to the ERM mast when he told a group of Birmingham businessmen that it was providing Britain with greater price stability, which would help the international competitiveness of UK industry. Although in many ways a Euro-sceptic, Mr Lamont clearly regretted Britain's non-membership of the ERM over the past decade. It would have helped the UK 'enormously' in keeping inflation under control, he said. Britain's ability to cut base rates from 15 per cent at the time of ERM entry - and not to follow the majority of Germany's ERM partners in raising rates following the German move in December - is regarded in the Treasury as an achievement in itself. The dangers for the UK of lowering interest rates to the German level or below were highlighted by France's experience at the end of last year, when the Bank of France was forced to raise its money market intervention rate to 9.6 per cent from 9.25 per cent following the Bundesbank's tightening of policy. Moreover, the Treasury does not believe that sterling interest rates would fall below German rates if the pound quit the ERM. It points out that since 1979 there has only been one very brief period - in 1981 - when UK short-term rates were lower than German ones. That was after two years when sterling had been unexpectedly strong, allowing it to build up credibility in financial markets. A strong pound is an integral part of the UK's counter-inflation policy. With an open economy such as Britain's, the Treasury cannot risk the imported inflation that might arise from a US-type policy of cutting interest rates sharply and tolerating currency depreciation. Such policies can also have unwelcome effects if bond markets sense an inflationary danger. While the US federal funds rate has been cut to 3.75 per cent, US bond yields are substantially higher. The US Treasury 10-year bond currently yields 7.33 per cent while yields on a comparable UK government bond, at about 9.13 per cent, are below base rate. Another telling argument against an early and sharp cut in UK interest rates is political. Mr Major has won an election victory in spite of the recession that followed the post-election boom of 1988. A government priority now will be to bring the electoral and economic cycles back into synchronisation so that the Conservative party does not have to fight the next election in similarly unfavourable circumstances. Before embarking on significant interest-rate cuts, therefore, the government may wait until Germany starts to lower its rates. This week German money market rates have been indicating no change for at least six months.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The listed companies in  the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China's largest economic  center, are leading the area's economic development.    Pudong is a newly-established economic zone that is expected  to lead the transformation of Shanghai's industrial and  financial sectors.    According to the latest statistics, Pudong commended 100  robust industrial enterprises last year, and seven of the first  ten have listed their stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.    These 100 enterprises generated profits totalling 3.323  billion yuan last year, accounting for 77.8 percent of the total  in the area.    Included was 1.03 billion yuan made by the seven listed  companies, about one third of the profits generated by the 100  enterprises.    A local official said that these companies are able to raise  funds at home and abroad to boost production, and the market  economy has forced them to alter their operational mechanism so  as to ensure rapid economic growth.    Of the 100 industrial enterprises, 17 are listed companies,  24 foreign-funded ones, and the rest major state enterprises and  rural industrial businesses.</p>

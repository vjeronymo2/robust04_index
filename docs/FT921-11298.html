			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Suspected links with IRA discussed last year after police probe A HIGH-LEVEL meeting attended by the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, the Serious Fraud Office and the Royal Ulster Constabulary was held in London last year to discuss an investigation into suspicions that individuals connected with the Wace Group may have had links with the IRA. The meeting, also attended by the Metropolitan Police, was held within the Stock Exchange in June and followed earlier investigations carried out by the Insider Dealing Group of the Stock Exchange and by police in Sheffield. The SE investigations are believed to have stemmed from share dealings at the time of Wace's takeover of Parkway in August 1990, although insider dealing is understood to have been ruled out. The SFO declined to take up the case but detectives in Sheffield carried on investigations, liaising with the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit. Investigations were held into the background of Mr John Clegg, the chief executive of Wace, and Miss Jane Wright, his cousin, who helped fund his purchase of a controlling share in the Wace Group in 1983. At the time Mr Clegg said that Miss Wright, who is based in South Africa, had largely financed the takeover from a family inheritance. Detectives were mainly concerned to discover the exact source of the funding and whether there were any links between Wace and the IRA. A senior security official, confirming the investigations yesterday, said that they had uncovered no evidence to link Mr Clegg with the IRA. 'We did the investigation but the story died very quickly. We could find no linkage.' The police were working, however, on a large dossier of evidence on unusual transactions concerning Wace and related interests. Some of the transactions are believed to have involved corporate interests with an address in South Africa. The investigation is understood to have been shelved some time ago. 'We will not be carrying out any further investigation unless someone can bring out some hard facts,' said the official. The probe into the alleged links between the Wace Group and the IRA is only part of a much larger drive designed to identify several potential sources of IRA funds. In their search for large sums of money, the security forces are understood to be up against a complex organisation through which the IRA attempts to exploit the financial system. Other public companies are also known to have been featured in suspected insider dealing rings in Northern Ireland which detectives believed could have been raising funds for the IRA. These were quite separate and unrelated to any dealings in Wace shares. The transactions that came under scrutiny in initial inquiries involved millions of pounds of dealings. Some discussion on the investigation is believed to have been held between the Bank of England and the Bank of Ireland. Officials believe the IRA raises up to Pounds 6m a year, financing arms and explosives, payments to about 500 active volunteers, safe houses, travel, bribes, and research and development on armaments. The RUC's C13, set up in its present form in 1986, has recently increased its personnel and now uses high-tech state-of-the-art surveillance equipment and computerised intelligence databanks. While several investigations into illicit fund-raising are understood to be continuing, the RUC and government officials are anxious to keep them as secretive as possible.

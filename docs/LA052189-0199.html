			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES  </P> <P> Every country in the world has restrictions on owning property except the  United States. Oregon, a state, will not sell coastal property. Minnesota only  leases land around lakes.  </P> <P> A real estate man told me the Japanese are their best customers. Even our high  prices are cheap to Japanese. Americans are in Tokyo stimulating interest in  investments in the United States. The citizens of U.S. are selling out their  own country. Many of the silent majority care, but feel helpless.  </P> <P> Our elected officials should pass laws limiting foreign investment in business  and lease land only -- never sell it!  </P> <P> HELEN KAIN  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

With the functions of  government and enterprises not separated, the state-owned banks  play the dual role of both policy-lending and commercial  banking. They monopolize the banking business to a certain  extent, creating a situation characterized by lack of  competition and low efficiency. This has distorted the role of  the specialized banks prevented the banks from operating in the  manner of enterprises and curbed the influence of the banking  industry in the realm of economy. All this does not conform with  the principle of seeking maximum beneficial returns in market  economy. Nor is it conducive to building the foundation for  strengthening the macro-economic control.    China is a developing nation which will have a shortage of  funds for a long time to come. Meanwhile, the nation has a  bound duty to insure that enough funds are available in  promoting economic development in backward areas, in developing  infrastructural facilities and major construction projects, in  increasing agricultural production and in readjusting the  industrial structure. Policy-oriented banking is a form of  financing that the state uses in performing the aforementioned  functions.    Policy-oriented banking is aimed at resolving issues for  better social efficiency. However, there are some economic  sectors with lower social efficiency that cannot afford to make  the regular interest payments for their loans. For example, one  of major investments of policy-lending banks is agriculture,  including funds for the storage and purchase of farm and  sideline products and for agricultural development. China is a  major farming country. Either right now or in the future,  agriculture remains China's foundation for economic development  and social stability. This situation will not change, despite  the development of the market economy. Meanwhile, agriculture is  also a sector that requires a large amount of investment, while  its financial returns are low and its cycle of investment  turnover long. Therefore the use of policy-oriented banking in  support of agricultural development is a long-term task. In this  sense, this form of banking is similar to the state policy,  which help the state exercise its macroeconomic control. This  is the basic difference between policy-lending banking and  commercial banking.    Policy-lending is different from other financial function.  The sources of the funds are not from taxes. Nor are the funds  unpaid appropriation. Policy-lending is a banking business.  Policy-lending financial institutions must raise their funds in  the form of debts such as issuing bonds. Therefore, the banks  often use the funds to make money in the form of loans.  Naturally, loans must be repaid. Policy-lending financial  institutions must follow the macroeconomic policy of the state  concerning the amount of loans, outlets for investments and time  frame for the loans; take into consideration the peculiar  characteristics of the fund-using units; and give them  preferential treatments in terms of interest rate. However,  loans are debts after all. It is necessary to guarantee the  return of capital plus a small amount of profit. This is  precisely the basic difference between policy-lending and  financial appropriations.    China's specialized banks are doing policy-lending  businesses  over a protracted period. They do policy-lending as well as  commercial businesses. Therefore, there are many drawbacks such  as problems in agricultural development, IOU problems in the  purchase of farm products, problems in investments for major  state construction projects, problems of technical  transformation for large- and medium-sized enterprises, and  problems of credit and loans for the import and export of  large-sized production equipment. All such problems cannot be  easily solved. However, some of the regular commercial  businesses have been neglected due to this kind of chaotic  situation in management. This has also prevented China's  specialized banks from starting to reform themselves. Several  years ago, some theoreticians and the central bank had the idea  of reforming specialized banks by separating policy-lending  banking from commercial banking in terms of accounting, but  there were great deal of difficulties when such reform measure  was put into practice. The "Decision of the CPC Central  Committee on Some Issues Concerning Establishment of a Socialist  Market Economic Structure" pointed out: "We should establish  policy-lending banks, and should separate policy-lending banking  from commercial banking. We should organize the National  Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, all of them  handling strictly defined policy-related business." A department  concerned reveals that in the next round of financial reform,  the state will establish three policy-lending banks to  specialize in handling policy-related financing.    To separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking  will be conducive to reforming the investment system. The new  National Development Bank will be a policy-lending bank aimed at  financing the major construction projects of the state. It will  manage the funds it has raised in a centralized manner to ensure  the completion of the major construction projects in the state  plan. It will evaluate the projects and determine the lending  priorities; keep spending within the limits of its own  resources; and supervise and control the utilization of its  funds. By doing so, it will be able to not only meet the  requirements in the development of all major construction  projects and make the best use of the loans for the development  of capital construction projects, but also change the situation  whereby sources of construction funds are unreliable; no one  assumes the responsibility for investment risks; or the total  amount of investments is entirely out of control.    By establishing policy-lending banks, we will be able to  provide financing in support and in favor of agriculture. One of  the functions of the Agricultural Bank of China, which will be  in charge of policy-lending business after its reform, is to  issue policy-related loans for the storage of grain crops,  cotton and edible oil for the state and for the purchase of farm  and sideline products on a contractual basis. This means that  all the policy-related businesses in support of agriculture  which are now being handled by several specialized banks will be  managed by a single policy-lending bank. This will be conducive  to efficiently using the credit and funds for agriculture, and  helping retrieve agricultural loans and implement the state  policy of supporting agriculture.    The major task of the new Import and Export Credit Bank is  to  provide credit and funds for the buyers and sellers in importing  or exporting complete sets of large-sized equipment and provide  credit discount and guarantee for the Bank of China in exporting  complete sets of machinery and electronic products.    The separation of the policy-lending business from the  commercial business is conducive to turning state specialized  banks into modern commercial banks. For many years, the  state-owned specialized banks have been unable to act according  to the business principle in tapping fund resources, in making  full use of their funds, in determining interest rates and doing  accounting work, since they handle both policy-lending and  commercial financing businesses. They cannot operate like a  modern commercial bank. Meanwhile, various banks handle  different volume of policy-related business. It will be  difficult to objectively evaluate each bank's performance in  extending loans and create conditions for all banks to compete  with one other on an equal basis. After the complete separation  of policy-lending financing from commercial financing, no one is  able to "eat from the same big pot" of policy-lending business.  Nor can anyone use policy-lending business as an excuse to cover  up poor performances in management. Naturally, policy-lending  banks should assume their own risks, manage their businesses  with their capital safeguarded, and refrain from competing with  commercial banks.    The current situation shows that the separation of  policy-lending banking from commercial banking will be faced  with a great deal of difficulties in forming the correct  ideology, bringing about structural changes, hiring personnel,  clearing up accounts, handing business accounting, and  transferring financial claims and liabilities. There will be a  period of transition in actual operation. However, we have to  march toward this direction sooner or later. Without this  separation, it will be hard to establish a new financial system.  We believe that following the separation of China's  policy-lending banking from commercial banking and the progress  in other aspects in the financial system reform, there will a  new leap forward in China's banking business.</p>

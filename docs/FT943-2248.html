			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Little strength behind nervous rally in shares - Market Report Securities markets in London rallied yesterday but trading volume was subdued and concern over the outlook for interest rates in the US and Germany remained high. Gains were trimmed towards the close when UK bonds reacted to sterling weakness in the face of a strong US currency. The FT-SE 100 Index continued to move between two important trading benchmarks, dipping to 3,048.3 in early dealings and then rising to 3,085.3 at the day's best. The final reading of 3,079.1 showed a net gain on the day of 14 points. The December contract on the Footsie, now the lead player in stock index futures, regained a premium against the underlying cash market. Analysts saw little change in market sentiment yesterday. The focus remained very much on the US interest rate outlook, with investors showing nervousness ahead of a speech from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve and of the possibility of a move on rates at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee next week. The next rise in US interest rates was seen as a matter of timing. Although shares opened lower, it was clear that Friday afternoon's selling bout had blown itself out, at least for the present. The long end of the gilt-edged market, which reflects inflation worries, improved, but falls in the short dates, more closely linked to base rate prospects, indicated underlying fears. With turnover relatively poor, it was the blue chip, dollar-orientated, stocks which saw most of the recovery. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a wide range of shares, slipped 8.1 to 3,608. Seaq volume totalled only 469.1m shares, down more than 17 per cent from Friday when, despite the shakeout in share prices, retail, or genuine investment activity in equities was worth only Pounds 1.2bn, a modest total by recent daily averages. London was keeping a wary eye on the trading screens for the announcement of the latest M3 money supply data due this week from Germany. 'A further tightening in Federal Reserve policy has probably been priced into the market; but any sign of tightening by the Bundesbank will send markets plunging,' said one leading analyst. This week also brings hurdles for the stock market in the shape of the UK M4 lending figures and non-EU trade statistics. At the end of the week, markets will be poised for the US August durable goods orders, which fell sharply in the previous month but are expected to show a renewed surge and thus fuel fears that the Federal Reserve may feel obliged to tighten policy more quickly than markets anticipate. On Friday, the latest estimates of UK gross domestic product will also throw light on the progress of economic recovery in the UK. The London stock market paid little heed yesterday to comments from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that he would continue to adjust interest rates so as to sustain recovery. A rise in mortgage rates by the Halifax building society, while no surprise in view of last week's rise in base rates and similar moves by other building societies, kept the market focus on the near term outlook for domestic interest rates. Gains in leading oil and pharmaceutical stocks gave a good lead to the Footsie index, but owed some of their strength to the dollar rather than to investment activity in the London stock market. Retail and consumer issues had a more uncertain session, with some struggling to recoup a little of Friday's losses while others gave further ground. Construction issues, also closely linked to interest rate perceptions, traded narrowly with losses among those with interests in the German economy. But traders stressed that much of yesterday's activity reflected little more than a tidying-up operation in the wake of Friday's widespread shakeout.</p>

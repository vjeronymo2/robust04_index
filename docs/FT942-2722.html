			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures retreat from 7 1/2 -year highs Coffee futures surged to fresh 7 1/2 -year highs at the London Commodity Exchange before surrendering nearly all the gains. The September delivery position peaked in the morning at Dollars 2,490 a tonne, extending the rally following Wednesday morning's shake-out to Dollars 150. Traders told the Reuters news agency that the early gains were in response to a report by the Green Coffee Association of New York showing lower warehouse stocks. But the trend was not followed up when the New York market opened and London quickly went into retreat. By the close profit-taking and liquidation had trimmed the September price to Dollars 2,395 a tonne, up just Dollars 7 on the day. 'Things have gone quiet,' said one trader. 'The excitement went after New York failed to follow us up, and then we just followed them down.' The earlier rise had triggered stop-loss buying and prices had leapt in a vacuum, other traders said. It was a similar story in the cocoa market. Wednesday's strong tone was maintained in early trading and the September price jumped Pounds 14 to Pounds 1,055 a tonne at one stage. But it ended Pounds 6 down at Pounds 1,035. 'New York failed to live up to expectations, which also hurt sentiment,' said one trader, who added that there was 'a fair amount of book-squaring going on'. 'The market is being ruled by the specs (speculators) and ignoring fundamentals, which are quite bearish,' said another.</p>

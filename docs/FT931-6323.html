			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Sterling boosted by prospect of lower German interest rates STERLING enjoyed a powerful rally against the D-Mark yesterday amid strong expectations in financial markets that Germany's official interest rates would be lowered again after an interval of just four weeks. European bond and equity markets also experienced rallies following comments at the weekend by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, indicating that he has taken a more relaxed attitude to further interest rate cuts. However, Germany's latest inflation figure yesterday raised concern that the Bundesbank might not be willing to ease its Lombard and discount rates at its council meeting on Thursday, despite the deterioration in the German economic outlook. Consumer price inflation rose to an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent in the year to February. After falling to new historic lows against the German currency last week, sterling yesterday rose 3 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.37. In New York the pound was trading at DM2.3725 and closed against the dollar at Dollars 1.439. It also rose sharply when measured by its exchange rate index, which expresses the pound's value against a basket of currencies. The pound closed at 77.1 on the index from a previous close of 76.0. The London stock market also surged to an all-time closing high, on hopes that a cut in German interest rates would assist a further easing in UK monetary policy. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed 14.6 points up on the day at 2,882.6. European stock markets were buoyant on expectations of an easing in Bundesbank policy. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index gained 15.09 points on the day to end at 1,998.8. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index gained 16.6 points to close at 1,700.95. German government bond prices rose half a point with 10-year bonds yielding around 6.65 per cent yesterday evening. After the weekend meeting in London of finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, Mr Schlesinger suggested that a reduction in the minimum reserves which German banks have to hold in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank should prompt a slight fall in German money market rates. New reserve requirements introduced yesterday triggered a sharp fall in the cost of borrowing D-Marks overnight, from about 9 per cent to 8.78 per cent. This raised speculation that the Bundesbank could lower its 'repo' rate  - at which it provides wholesale funds to commercial banks - by as much as 15 basis points later this week from the current level of 8.5 per cent. However, the operations of dealers in German money markets clearly implied that they also expect a cut in the discount rate, currently at 8 per cent, which sets the floor for German interest rates. Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the main requirements of an easing in the discount rate were not in place. The German government's solidarity pact had not been agreed and important wage agreements with the country's trade unions had not yet been completed.

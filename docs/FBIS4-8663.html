			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (TANJUG)--The Bosnian Serb  Republic (RS) has as of April 14 revoked the credentials and  banned the movement in its territory of all American journalists  and persons working with U.S. media .    The RS Information Ministry also informed foreign  correspondents that it would no longer acknowledge press  credentials and visas issued by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].    This measure follows two NATO air strikes of Serb positions  near Gorazde but, as is stated by the Information Ministry,  could have m been adopted much earlier because of the  unobjective, warmongering and openly anti-Serb coverage of  events in the RS by American journalists.    NATO-U.S. planes carried out air strikes Sunday and Monday  against the positions of Bosnian Serbs near Gorazde, eastern  Bosnia, which should have been demilitarized long ago as a  protected area. Instead of being demilitarized more than 10,000  Moslem troops concentrated in this area and surged at the end of  March into a fierce offensive against Serb territories.    Following the strong counter-attack of the Serb forces when  the Moslems were threatened with total defeat the U.N. got  involved in the combat calling on NATO forces to carry out  strikes on Serb positions to allegedly protect peacekeepers in  Gorazde.    So far the American journalists were given equal treatment  as  the one reserved for journalists from other countries, the RS  ministry statement says.    RS Information Minister Miroslav Toholj praised the decision  of Yugoslav Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic Tuesday to  revoke credentials of the journalists of AFP and CNN for  spreading anti-Serb propaganda, the Bosnian Serb agency SRNA  reported Thursday.    SRNA states that Toholj supports the decision because the  war-mongers with journalist accreditations are responsible for  the largest number of the victims of the war in former  Yugoslavia, and also those who died as a result of the economic  sanctions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Art of the Possible"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  impending visit to Syria and Israel in a bid to rekindle their  negotiating track comes amidst renewed speculation that not much  could be expected to emerge from his latest shuttle diplomacy.  Washington has in fact predicted no imminent breakthrough in  the Israeli-Syrian peace talks even though it made sufficient  hints to suggest that their bilateral negotiations have entered  a new stage and could come to fruition later on. This suggests  that enough progress was attained during the last trip by  Christopher to warrant its continuation.    It would naturally be unreasonable to presume that the  secretary of state is coming back to the region on a wild goose  chase. But, it must be remembered that Damascus has also made  an issue of the fact that it is still on the U.S. list of  countries sponsoring "terrorism" and has injected this matter  into its contacts with Washington. Presumably this subject will  figure highly on the Syrian leaders' talks with Christopher when  he arrives in the Syrian capital Sunday. President Hafiz  al-Asad cannot be expected to accommodate Washington on its  efforts to energise the Syrian-Israeli track as long as his  country is viewed and treated as some kind of terrorist state.    Israel, on the other hand, seeks to know in advance the  extent and scope of peace that Damascus would be willing to  offer in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.  In this vein, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has proposed  a phased Israeli pullout stretching over eight to ten years in  order to test the workability of the Syrian peace intentions.  Rabin has yet to confirm or deny, however, that Israel would be  willing to withdraw completely from the occupied Syrian  territory at the end of the tunnel.    President al-Asad insists, and rightly so, on receiving a  clear commitment from Rabin that full withdrawal from the  heights would be in the cards in return for normalisation of  relations between the two countries. What this complex  situation boils down to is similar to the vexing egg-and-chicken  syndrome where one set of questions begs the other. This is  where Christopher may help by attempting to offer simultaneous  answers to concurrent questions.    Bridging the gap between the two countries is still  possible,  and that, we guess, is why the secretary of state is coming back  so soon to the region.</p>

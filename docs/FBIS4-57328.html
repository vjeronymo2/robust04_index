			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 17  May:    Despite the economic recovery achieved by Honduras in 1993,  there was a considerable drop in the per capita GDP which  registered 0.3 percent, compared to 2.2 percent in 1992. Also,  the economic slump caused the per capita income to drop from 1.7  percent in 1992 to 1.2 percent in 1993. (San Pedro Sula TIEMPO  in Spanish 10 May 94 p 6)    Official statistics indicate that during the first four  months of 1994, inflation rose in Honduras to 8.42 percent,  which is twice as much compared to the same period of 1993.  Also, consumer prices increased by 2.76 percent. The Central  Bank of Honduras reported that the most significant increases  were in transportation costs, which increased 7 percent, housing  4.4 percent, and foodstuffs 3.3 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in  Spanish 1752 GMT 15 May 94)    Honduran Government and business officials have rejected a  report issued by the British magazine THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE  UNIT which notes that Honduras is a high-risk country for  investment. According to the magazine, Honduras is on the same  economic risk level as Nicaragua and Bosnia, among others.  Adolfo Facusse, president of the Honduran businessmen's  association, said the problem is that such publications do not  receive any response from the authorities in their country. He  admitted, however, that Honduras is experiencing an economic  crisis that could scare away investors. (Paris AFP in Spanish  1856 GMT 16 May 94)</p>

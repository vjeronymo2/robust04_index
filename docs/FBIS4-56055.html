			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sead Susovic from the Information Service of the </F> 1st Army Corps]    [Excerpt] Counting probably on the factor of surprise, the  chetniks carried out a strong attack on the city's defense lines  in the Hladivode region late last night. This futile attack  began with fierce shooting from light infantry weapons. The  chetniks then started gradually to introduce anti-aircraft guns  and machineguns, mortars, and similar types of weapons. The  fighting culminated with the infantry attack, which the ever  ready defenders of Sarajevo uncompromisingly repelled, forcing  the chetniks to return to where they set off on their night  adventure. The town is quiet this morning, but one must not  forget to remain cautious.    The Ilijas front, which has been simmering with chetnik  attacks for several days, was subjected to a fierce artillery  attack during which more than 100 shells landed on [word  indistinct] Brdo, [words indistinct] and other places in the  free territory. The chetniks also carried out attacks from  artillery and armored mechanized weapons from their position in  Nisici, (?Buljetovac), Medojevici, Nabozici, (?Pudraz), and  Duboki Potok. There are dozens of these weapons in this region.  They are mainly inside the Sarajevo 20 km zone. [passage  omitted]</p>

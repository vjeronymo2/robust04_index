			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Citicorp president resigns WALL Steet was stunned last night at the unexpected resignation of Mr Richard Braddock, president of Citicorp, the leading US bank that has been struggling to bolster its capital. An hour later, the bank also revealed it expects Dollars 870m (Pounds 513m) of third-quarter write-offs in its consumer division. Citicorp, which expects to earn between eight and 13 cents per share in the third quarter, said it would take a Dollars 65m pre-tax restructuring charge. Citicorp's brief official statement said Mr Braddock's departure was effective immediately. 'Mr Braddock chose to resign after concluding that his best contribution to the recovery of Citicorp's momentum has been realised and, accordingly, he wants to pursue new career opportunities,' Citicorp said. Wall Street was especially surprised at the resignation as 50-year-old Mr Braddock is a close friend and main aide-de-camp of Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman. Mr Reed and Mr Braddock have been seen as the joint stewards of the bank's efforts to recover from its past loan losses and commercial property problems. Mr Reed does not plan to appoint a successor. 'The office of Citicorp president will not be filled,' said Mr John Morris, bank spokesman. His responsibilities will be be taken up by other senior managers. Mr Braddock, who made his name at Citicorp as Mr Reed's main partner in the drive to develop retail banking in the 1980s, was named to the president's position in January 1990. Mr Reed had been criticised for having left the job vacant since 1985, when he became chairman and chief executive. Mr James McDermott, president of bank analysts Keefe Bruyette and Wood, said: 'It's a shocker. The press release reads like pabulum and there must be something behind it that we don't know. I just don't get it.' Mr George Salem, banking analyst at Prudential Securities, speculated that Mr Braddock's departure might have been related to pressure from US bank regulators. Last summer it was revealed that Citicorp had bowed to pressure from bank regulators and had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency to accept closer oversight by bank examiners. Mr Salem said he considered it ironic that the Citicorp president should be leaving 'because Braddock was a stronger manager than Reed'.</p>

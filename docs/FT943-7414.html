			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper under renewed pressure Copper prices came under renewed pressure at the London Metal Exchange yesterday after last week's failure to break overhead resistance. The three months delivery price, which last Thursday had briefly flirted with levels above Dollars 2,430 a tonne, closed yesterday's late afternoon ring trading session at Dollars 2,392 a tonne, down Dollars 15.50 from Friday. And the selling continued in after hours trading, when the price broke through resistance around Dollars 2,390 to touch Dollars 2,374, its lowest since August 4. Many traders believe the copper market will have to settle into a lower trading level until the end of the northern hemisphere summer, when reduced industrial activity keeps demand for the metal low. They will be watching today's LME warehouse stocks report for some indication a resumption of physical activity; after a long decline stocks began rising at the start of this month, since which they have gone up 4.5 per cent. Other LME markets held relatively steady. Notable among these was aluminium, which closed at Dollars 1,487 a tonne, down just Dollars 2.50 on the day, despite disappointment with the latest set of production figures from the International Primary Aluminium Institute Institute. Traders had been hoping that the figures, for July, would show that multilaterally agreed output cuts were still eating into stocks of the metal, which remain excessively high. But at 38,000 tonnes a day July production was unchanged from June (though 2,100 below July, 1993). 'One month's figure does not mean cutbacks have finished,' one analyst told Reuters, 'but we will have to watch the situation closely.' Aluminium market watchers have been warning that current price levels - 30 per cent up from the end of last year - could discourage some producers from curbing output.</p>

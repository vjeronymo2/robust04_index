			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Attack on Zulu march leaves 18 dead Gunmen opened fire on several thousand Zulus marching in central Johannesburg yesterday, turning the South African commercial capital into a bloodbath, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Police said 18 people, including two policemen, were killed and up to 25 wounded in the attack. Mr Carl Niehaus, African National Congress spokesman, said ANC security guards had fired at 'gunmen' to disperse them as the Zulus marched past the ANC headquarters at Shell House in a protest against next month's all-race elections. 'Several gunmen tried to gain access to the building,' he said. The ANC security guards fired warning shots into the air before shooting to disperse the crowd, he added. Police sealed off the building. Mr Thabo Mbeki, ANC chairman, later said the government might have to declare a state of emergency to ensure South Africa's first all-race elections went ahead next month.</p>

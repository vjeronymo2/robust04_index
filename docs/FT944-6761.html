			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The German bond market put on a show of strength last week after the more favourable inflation figures and lower than expected money supply growth. But some economists reckon this upturn was misplaced. 'We can detect precious little in the recent data that could serve as a justification of the bond market rally these last days,' said Mr Adolf Rosenstock at the Industrial Bank of Japan's Frankfurt office. 'We interpret it instead as a spill-over from the rally in the US bond market, which we consider a bear market still.' It came as no surprise that the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged on Thursday. The bank is waiting for a more marked slowdown in M3 growth and inflation and stronger evidence of wage moderation before deciding whether to opt for a final discount and Lombard rate cut in the present economic cycle. 'The Bundesbank could have some reason to cut rates,' reckons Mr Norbert Braem of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Key interest rates have not reached the lows seen in previous cycles. 'The Bundesbank will be ready to support the economy to some extent,' he added. There is no reason for this now, he says, but there could be in 1995 if economic recovery stalls because of increased D-Mark strength or sluggish private consumption.</p>

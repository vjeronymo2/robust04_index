			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAS AND CHINAS AT THE HUNTINGTON  </P> <P> This is the second spring for the remodeled rose garden at the Huntington  Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, and the flowering  is so profuse that one cannot tell the old from the new. Indeed, Ann Christoph,  who did the plans, has handled the space so deftly that the inherent  aberrations add to the charm.  </P> <P> "All are at different angles," she commented, talking about the rose garden  itself and the surrounding Shakespeare Garden, the former residence of Henry E.  Huntington that now serves as art gallery, the rose arbor and the patio  restaurant that was Huntington's pool and billiard room. The problem started  when Huntington planted the rose garden before he built his home, then changed  the house plans to preserve two stately oak trees, skewing the intended  alignments. "My problem was to preserve the gracious and semiformal design  without making it look like an obvious mistake," Christoph added.  </P> <P> The rose garden was planted in January of 1908, featuring large blocks of  color, with no more than 200 varieties, most of them common and popular,  according to Clair Martin III, curator of roses. Now there are more than 1,700  different types, including one of the world's greatest collections of the Tea  and China roses that reached Europe from China at the beginning of the 19th  Century, the first roses that flower repeatedly.  </P> <P> The Huntington has a special Mother Lode collection of Teas and Chinas. "I go  periodically to the old cemeteries in the Gold Rush country of California to  get cuttings," Martin said, smiling at the thought of himself, a tall and  conspicuous horticulturist, armed with pruning shears, working his way past old  gravestones. In this way, he harvests some of the 2,000 China and Tea cultivars  that were transported around the Horn from England and the East Coast to  California from 1850 to 1900.  </P> <P> Near the China and Tea roses are the old garden roses -- Martin calls them  "O.G.R.'s." Some date to the beginnings of history. But they bloom just once a  year. Crossing the "O.G.R.'s" with the Chinas and the Teas created the modern  roses that bloom in California from April until Christmas.  </P> <P> "Gardens like this, and Exposition Park and Descanso have great value besides  being beautiful and quiet places," Martin commented. "Visitors can see how the  different roses grow, actually in the ground, and under different conditions,  before they buy them."  </P> <P> The Huntington Gardens are engaged in the future of roses as one of 30 test  centers for the annual selection of All America Roses and with a display of all  the recent All America selections. The affection for the past, however, is  evident in Martin's special pride with a huge new bed planted to honor the  genius of David Austin, an English hybridizer who has developed 60 different  cultivars with the fragrance, soft colors and shapes of the roses of old, all  with names drawn from English literature and history. "He loves Shakespeare and  Chaucer, which ties in nicely with our library," Martin said, leaning over to  sniff a creamy pink named Lordly Oberone, and another called Chaucer.  "Unbelievable," he said. And they were.  </P></p>

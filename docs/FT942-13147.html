			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (1): The revolution is about to begin - Although millions of people use computers, new advances in technology mean that the real computer revolution is only now about to start / Comment The infrastructure of information technology is changing. The traditional models of computing - either terminals controlled by a central computer or stand-alone desktop personal computers - are giving way to a single model of distributed power. This year's Financial Times A to Z of Computing carries the theme of this transition - to what some call the age of the 'network as the computer.' Powerful desktop computers based on new chips - such as the Pentium and the PowerPC - make it possible to provide almost every user with the local power they need. Multi-tasking operating systems like Windows NT, Unix and OS/2 offer access to remote, shared resources such as printers and databases. Once plugged into the emerging 'information highways,' the desktop computer becomes a 'window' on the IT world. The emerging new infrastructure promises to open the door to many new applications. Intelligent agent software which can scan a network of databases, full-motion video, which can bring TV to the desktop computer, and neural networks which can unravel complex data input, promise to extend the boundaries of IT. But while the new infrastructure makes many novel applications possible, it also creates a new set of problems. Distributing computer power is not enough. IT must also distribute functionality. This demands different approaches to building IT systems and the software which makes them work. Most important of all, IT systems must be tied closely to business needs. Computer users are no longer satisfied with expensive systems which only bring limited benefits. They want systems that are adaptable and can cope with changes in the way their business is organised and administered. New techniques such as business process re-engineering and workgroup computing are expected to make it easier to build enterprise-wide applications and deliver genuine benefits. When combined with software engineering tools and object-oriented design, these new analysis techniques should make it possible to create flexible applications which can change with the business. But it is not only big business which will gain from the new IT infrastructure. PC technology is increasingly finding a place in the home - either to support 'teleworking' in a home office or as a domestic aid for 'teleshopping,' managing personal finances and entertainment. Laptop computers plugged into the 'information highway' will extend computing to every corner of our lives. The move to the new infrastructure will not be without pain, of course. Those who hold on to the past will find it increasingly difficult to find a market for their skills. But there are some ideas from the past which will survive and help to solve some of the technical problems created by the new infrastructure. The valuable lessons learned in the mainframe era - particularly those associated with managing transaction traffic and data storage or methods for controlling software - offer proven solutions and should not be ignored. 'After 40 years of constant change, glowing predictions and never-ending complexity, computers are finally being used by millions of people worldwide every day. In spite of this, the computer revolution is only now about to begin,' says Mr David Vaskevitch, director of enterprise computing at Microsoft, in his recently-published book Client/Server Strategies. He is right. The computer revolution he predicts promises to be one of the most exciting technological changes in human history. This year's Financial Times A to Z of Computing is your guide to this change.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / No sign of upturn in pay settlements There is still no sign of an upturn in pay settlements, with the median settlement at 2 per cent in the three months to the end of October, the latest pay bulletin from Industrial Relations Services shows, David Goodhart writes. The independent research organisation says that the 2 per cent figure is 0.2 points down from the median figure for the three months to the end of September. One sector where pay appears to be rising slightly faster is building societies. Recent rises have been significantly above inflation with a minimum pay-bill cost of 2.5 per cent. The Yorkshire Building Society was the most generous with an annualised increase of 4.6 per cent. IRS says the average pay rise for the hotel and catering industry as a whole this year was 1.6 per cent. Nearly one in three of the sample of 32 employers implemented a pay freeze this year.

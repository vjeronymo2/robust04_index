			<p>CSO     [Text] Frankfurt--Over the period 1989-1996 the Joint  European Submicron Silicon Program, JESSI for short, will  receive total funding of 3 billion ECU. Where JESSI has been  employed so far the results have been top-rank. This is the  opinion recently expressed by JESSI's chief executive, Hans  Meyer, at a meeting of the Technical-Literary Society (TELI) in  Munich. He said that some partial projects have led to  technology transfer between partner companies during the last  few months.    Meyer explained the knowledge and the advances that had been  achieved with JESSI so far: in the new generations of MOS  transistors, tunnel effects can arise at the submicrometer level  which reduce the chip's performance. These can now be combatted  with two proven production steps, namely the nitride-gate-oxide  process and the Large Angle Tilted Implanted Drain (LATID)  process.    A further innovation involves the transfer of circuitry  structures onto the chip by optical lithography. In  wafer-stepper tools the demands for precision grow with  increased wafer size. As JESSI researches have shown, even the  available steppers can operate with an accuracy of 0.5  micrometers. In this case wave lengths of 365 nanometers are  being used. With even shorter wave lengths, an accuracy of 0.1  micrometers is said to be attainable.    Progress in development is also being reported for storage  chips of the EPROM type (Erasable Programmable Memory). As has  already been reported, JESSI distributed the first blueprints  for a 16-megabit EPROM to partner companies. They were produced  using 0.6 micrometer technology.    JESSI was created by the European Research Coordinating  Agency (EUREKA) to work jointly on basic technologies for  electronic chips and chip production. At the moment 185  institutes and companies are involved, participating in 71  individual projects.    9337</p>

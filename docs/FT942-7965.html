			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): British Airways faces City concerns - Other companies British Airways' tradition of near break-even fourth-quarter results has left analysts forecasting full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 300m, against Pounds 185m. However, the tone of today's statement may be more important than the headline profit. The stock has been weak since lower-than-expected growth in traffic in April, and there are concerns about BA's associate USAir. Thorn EMI: The music, rentals and electronics group, reports full-year results tomorrow, with pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 330m-Pounds 340m, compared with Pounds 286.3m - although that figure is expected to be adjusted. Attention will focus on the state of the UK consumer market. Marks and Spencer: Tomorrow's annual results presentation should confirm M&amp;S as the UK's most profitable retailer, with an increase of more than 17 per cent in full-year pre-tax figures to about Pounds 865m. Analysts expect gross margins to have been held and further cost savings to have led to an increase of a percentage point or more in the net margin. Argyll: Tough conditions in the grocery market and new depreciation policies are likely to be reflected on Wednesday in a fall in full-year pre-tax profits at the UK's third largest grocery retailer. The consensus among analysts is for about Pounds 365m, down from Pounds 417m after a new Pounds 40m depreciation charge. Land Securities: The extent of the recovery in commercial property values will be underlined on Wednesday when the UK's largest quoted property company reports its final results. After three years of steeply falling net asset values, the company's nav is expected to have rise from 504p per share to 630p-660p. Pre-tax profits are likely to remain static at around Pounds 233m. Cable &amp; Wireless: Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1bn for the UK telecoms group, about 27 per cent up on the previous year's (Pounds 824m). However, better-than-expected results announced last Thursday at Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest business, may make that view somewhat pessimistic.</p>

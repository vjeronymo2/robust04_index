			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Slovak and Czech newspapers on 19 and  21 March publish a number of items dealing with the "political  background" to recent "purges" in the management of the East  Slovak Ironworks [VSZ], Slovakia's largest company, and the  suspicious circumstances of the sale of a major package of VSZ  shares by Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet shortly before it was  dismissed on 14 March. According to a report in Bratislava  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 14 March on page 5, VSZ is "the  flagship of Slovak industry," which employs 27,000 people,  exports 80 percent of its annual turnover of over $1 billion,  and generates 25 percent of Slovakia's hard-currency earnings.    Prague DENNI TELEGRAF in Czech on 21 March on page 5 carries  a 1,000-word article by Peter Schutz, the newspaper's Kosice  correspondent, entitled "Privatization in the Style of Vladimir  Meciar: I Scratch Your Back, You Scratch Mine." The article  deals with the decision made by the Slovak Government on 11  March at night, a few hours after the Slovak parliament passed  the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar, to sell 1.5  million VSZ shares, 9.52 percent of the total, to "VSZ Manager  Ltd.," a company established by the ironworks' recently  installed new management. According to Schutz, the package has  been sold for 200 Slovak korunas [Sk] per share, although the  shares' nominal value is Sk1,000 and their market value (that  is, the price at which they are currently being traded on the  Bratislava Stock Exchange) Sk500.    Commenting on the decision, Schutz says: "What is involved  is  a transparent and simple `I scratch your back, you scratch mine'  system. VSZ Manager Ltd. was entered in the company register at  a municipal district court in Kosice on Friday, 11 March--that  is, on the day when the no-confidence vote in the government was  passed. The decision on the transaction was made Friday night.  The most interesting thing about the transaction is that  participants in VSZ Manager Ltd., whose capital stock is  Sk100,000, are five members of the VSZ Board of Directors, who  had been installed in their posts by a decision of the National  Property Fund [FNM] Supervisory Board at the end of December  1993. The FNM Supervisory Board was chaired at that time by  Finance Minister Julius Toth." As Schutz goes on to say, while  it was chaired by Julius Toth, the FNM Supervisory Board also  convened an extraordinary general meeting of VSZ shareholders.  This meeting, which was held on 17 March, elected Julius Toth to  be chairman of the VSZ Supervisory Board. "But this is not all,"  Schutz says in conclusion: "The entire transaction was made  possible by Banka Slovakia, whose capital is covered fully by  FNM property, in the form of a credit extended to Priemyselna  Banka [Industrial Bank] in Kosice. Priemyselna Banka promptly  granted a loan to VSZ Manager Ltd. so that it could pay the  first 15 percent installment. It will no longer come as a  surprise that, on Thursday [17 March], Julius Toth was elected  deputy chairman of the Priemyselna Banka Board of Directors."    Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 19 March on page 1  carries a 600-word interview with Zsolt Komlosi, a member of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Privatization  Committee, by Alena Gottweisova, entitled "The FNM Damaged  Itself." In the interview, the place and date of which are not  given, Komlosi discusses the circumstances of the sale of 9.53  percent of VSZ shares to five members of the VSZ top management.  Komlosi confirms that the transaction was made possible by a  loan provided by Banka Slovakia, whose financial resources come  from the FNM, to Priemyselna Banka in Kosice, which, in turn,  lent the money to the five members of the VSZ management. He  also confirms that Priemyselna Banka "is linked to the former  minister of finance." According to Komlosi, through this  transaction, the FNM "caused itself damage of Sk1 billion,"  which is the difference between the price at which the VSZ  shares were sold to the managers and the price they would fetch  on the stock exchange.    Komlosi also points out that the capital stock of VSZ  Manager  Ltd. represents only Sk100,000 (with each of the five partners  contributing Sk20,000) and wonders "how a limited liability  company that is accountable for sums up to Sk100,000 can realize  in only five days a transaction through which it acquires Sk1  billion or property to this value." He announces that, on  Tuesday, 22 March, the NRSR Privatization Committee "will start  reexamining the documentation of privatization projects at the  FNM."    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 21 March on pages 1 and 2  carries  a 1,300-word "eb"-signed report entitled "Purges in VSZ, but Not  Only in VSZ, Had a Political Background." The report cites a  statement issued by four former members of the VSZ Board of  Directors--Zoltan Berghauer, Dionyz Kunder, Stanislav Polak, and  Marian Sarissky--who were dismissed in December 1993. In the  statement, the four managers explain their decision to lodge a  complaint against what they regard as their "unlawful  dismissal." The complaint was lodged with the Kosice Regional  Court on 17 March. The four managers' statement is also the  subject of a 1,000-word "er"-signed report entitled "What Was  Going On Behind the Metallurgical Curtain," in Bratislava PRAVDA  in Slovak on 21 March on pages 1 and 2.    In the first part of their statement, the four managers  discuss the economic results achieved by the VSZ under their  management. They point out that, even though the company set  aside Sk800 million as a "strategic reserve" and Sk124 million  as a "bad debt reserve" in 1993, it exceeded the projected  pretax profit for that year by 26 percent. They note that the  value of VSZ assets went up from Sk32 to Sk46.8 billion, that  the price of VSZ shares increased by 240 percent, that the  number of VSZ employees did not decline, despite the high  average monthly wages of Sk9,500, and that a dividend was  expected to be paid to shareholders. Therefore, they express  their conviction that "the personnel purges" of December 1993  did not have economic motives but "a political background."    The managers' statement goes on to say that, shortly after  the Kosice mayoral elections in the fall of 1992, in which the  candidate of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] did  not win, "our former colleague Julius Toth, who was then  minister of finance, conveyed to us the great dissatisfaction of  the HZDS's leading representatives with the VSZ management" and  "reproached the VSZ top management for having done little or  nothing for the HZDS candidate to get elected." Toth's  criticism reportedly culminated in the proposal that Zoltan  Berghauer, then chairman of the VSZ Board of Directors, dismiss  Marian Sarissky and Dionyz Kunder from the Board of Directors  "because Sarissky had signed a statement of the Forum of Slovak  Intelligentsia and Kunder was a sympathizer of the Christian  Democratic Movement." According to the four managers'  statement, Berghauer "rejected Toth's demands as unfounded and  unprecedented." In conclusion, the managers say: "We suppose  that this rejection prompted Julius Toth to seek other forms and  instruments to bring about changes in the VSZ Board of  Directors, which he implemented through certain members of the  VSZ Supervisory Board and the FNM. Not just two, but four  members of the Board of Directors were recalled in this way,  this time without citing any reasons or objections."</p>

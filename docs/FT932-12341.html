			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez takesa gamble with the peseta - Spain's looming election is putting its currency under new pressure IT WOULD be cruel to suggest that the Bank of Spain has been so stoutly defending the peseta over the past week because there is a general election on June 6. But it is hard to find anyone in Madrid who believes the bank's support of the peseta since late last week has been anything but political. The Socialist government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez is going to lose its parliamentary majority on June 6, but it boasts so often of its commitment to a stable peseta that a devaluation before then would be a political disaster. The central bank has made great efforts to stave off a probable - most Spanish businessmen would say desirable - third devaluation in six months until after the poll. Traders believe that, unusually, the bank has been selling D-Marks forward for pesetas and that the official foreign exchange reserves of about Dollars 45bn (Pounds 29.2bn) now vastly overstate the true figure. Minus the forward commitments, some estimates put the bank's foreign exchange reserves below Dollars 20bn. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, has said any defence of the currency which drove reserves below Dollars 30bn would be too costly. The bank will not comment, but it is clear that Mr Gonzalez' decision to bring the election forward by five months has changed official arithmetic. Victory is suddenly priceless. If the bank is intervening forward, it is at least selling its D-Marks at a profit as the peseta slides but, if the currency is devalued, the pesetas the bank is committed to buy at current prices in the futures markets could be expensive. But for the government, the decision to fight off speculative attacks is risky. A devaluation would be a very public humiliation. Mr Gonzalez added to the turmoil of last week by conceding that the Socialists would not win outright. He foresaw a weak government and new elections in 1994. Spain is already in recession and will not be firmly governed for, perhaps, more than a year. What does that make the peseta worth? Pta74 to the D-Mark where the Bank of Spain has decided to draw its line in the sand? Or Pta78-Pta80, where it might have a positive effect on exports? Senior officials are approaching the weekend with some trepidation as Saturdays are when devaluations usually take place and the Thursday and Friday can boil with expectation. It could all begin again today, though the currency recovered yesterday after the Bundesbank cut its repo rate. By late afternoon the peseta was trading at between Pta73 and Pta73.30 to the D-Mark after having fallen below Pta74 for a while on Tuesday. So far Spain's defence has led to short-term interest rates shooting up from about 13 per cent to 18 per cent and were rising again late yesterday from close to 15 per cent overnight to about 16 per cent. But there is only so much the heavily indebted Spanish can do to interest rates without ruining the government bond market, so they have also been urgently lobbying their friends. Mr Gonzalez flew to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Austrian retreat three weeks ago, knowing that he was about to gamble on an early election and that the peseta would suffer as a result. One effect became clear last week when the Bundesbank led five other European central banks in a massive defence of the peseta. Last Tuesday the Bundesbank again stood up for the Spanish, saying it saw no reason for a devaluation. Despite the relief yesterday, analysts believe the markets will return to bet hard against that advice, particularly as opinion polls show Mr Gonzalez' conservative opponents, the Partido Popular (PP), slightly ahead. There is little doubt the PP would be happy with a devaluation. In fact, PP supporters frequently suggest they would not be too upset if Spain left the ERM altogether. Mr Gonzalez, who normally has no equal as a political campaigner in Spain, has to turn his full attention to the campaign. But even should he begin to claw back the PP lead in the next few weeks, he is going to have to take on the money markets as well.</p>

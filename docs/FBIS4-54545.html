			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["G.Z."-signed interview with Zoltan Kiraly, chairman of the </F> Hungarian Social Democratic Party; place and date not given:  "We Speak of Accepting Government Obligations More Emphatically  Than Anyone Else"]    [Text] Our elections series interviews the leaders of  parties that have presented a national list on their programs  and ideas. Today, we interview Zoltan Kiraly, head of the list  of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party [MSZDP].    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Perhaps one of the clearest characteristics  of the MSZDP program is the extending of the government's role  and responsibility to welfare areas. With the approach of the  elections, many big parties are also trying to obtain votes by  promising more social care.    [Kiraly] Indeed, social democratic values are also present  in the programs of almost every political party. Even the major  political forces in Hungary cannot avoid speaking against  poverty, the steady deterioration of the real value of pensions,  and unemployment. However, I do not see anything bad in this.  I think that the more people speak of social democratic values,  equal chances and justice, the more can be implemented.  However, all these values appear in the MSZDP program much more  markedly. In the struggle against unemployment, we would like  to implement a policy of state investment protection that does  not only rely on the development of market requirements and the  good intentions of the entrepreneurs in creating new jobs. This  policy also tries to create jobs by means of large-scale state  investment. Our program speaks more markedly than any other  about government responsibility to maintain the real value of  basic pensions by adjusting them to inflation and providing  state guarantees. We believe that education should be free of  charge, from elementary school to college and university  education. It is the obligation of the state to provide the  fullest possible equality of chances in this area.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] How would the MSZDP find funds for all this?    [Kiraly] The spreading of the welfare network requires much  greater efforts and financial resources than many people  thought. It has become clear now that the present government  policy can no longer continue, namely increasing value added  tax, income tax, and social security payments. We firmly claim,  and we are not alone in this, that a review of Hungary's debt  repayment has become inevitable. Negotiations must be initiated  with the World Bank, the IMF, and representatives of governments  affected by our debts. We succeeded in getting some kind of a  debt repayment delay at the end of the 1980's.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] You repeatedly criticized this government's  privatization efforts. Actually, do you have reservations about  the allegedly mistaken privatization process, or is the  privatization itself unacceptable for the Social Democrats?    [Kiraly] There are considerable differences between our  program and those of other parties regarding the change of  property. We are interested in a broad change of property. In  our view, this process has a moral part and also one that points  to the future, one that provides the foundations of a bourgeois  society. Privatization cannot be limited to even 1 million  citizens. Privatization should affect broader social strata.  Millions of employees and pensioners would like to get to at  least 60 percent of the state property in one way or another,  and the remaining 40 percent could go to local government  bodies, universities, and colleges. It is possible to find a  way to assert the principles of fairness and justice.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The coming elections will have a major  effect on the future of social democracy in Hungary.    [Kiraly] If we can make it into Parliament in any form, we  are already on the first step on the road leading there. I am  convinced that our presence in Parliament will provide a stable  point for the MSZDP in the political arena on which the party  can rely. In the four years ahead of us, it is possible to lay  the foundations for this party to have a chance of governing  since the 1988 elections.</p>

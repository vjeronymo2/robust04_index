			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Letter: High cost of compliance Sir, Another blow to the ideal of playing cricket on level European playing fields. The announcement by Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC's new internal market commissioner ('Brussels truce for breach of EC single market rules', January 22), that the Commission will go softly-softly on enforcing single market directives once again has the law makers playing into the hands of the law breakers. We all know that complying with the rules costs money, so those of us who take steps to comply are immediately placed at a competitive disadvantage against those who don't. How many more UK jobs will be lost as a consequence of our efforts to be good Europeans, while others appear to continue to 'do their own thing'? David Lowe, 1 Ostlers View, Billingshurst, West Sussex RH14 9LU</p>

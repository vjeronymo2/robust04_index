			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT ADMITS KILLING NEWTON, POLICE REPORT  </P> <P> A man arrested Tuesday night during an unrelated traffic stop has admitted  shooting Black Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton to death during an argument  over cocaine, police said Friday night.  </P> <P> Investigators said Tyrone Robinson, 25, who has an extensive criminal record  that includes a robbery conviction in 1985, killed Newton early Tuesday in an  effort to advance his position in the Black Guerrilla Family, a narcotics  distribution gang. According to police, Newton had "crossed" the gang several  times in the past.  </P> <P> Robinson, Police Sgt. Dan Mercado said, "wanted to be a high-mucky-muck."  </P> <P> "He was a foot soldier, and he wanted to be a shot caller. He figured we  already knew. We felt we had him and he knew it," Mercado said.  </P> <P> Detectives said Robinson told them that he shot Newton in self-defense when the  two met by chance on the street. Robinson told detectives that Newton demanded  free cocaine, and when Robinson refused, Newton threatened him with a gun.  </P> <P> However, police questioned several aspects of the story, saying there was no  evidence that Newton had a gun at the time of the encounter.  </P> <P> Robinson said he and Newton had met earlier in the evening at a "crack" house  where cocaine was being dispensed.  </P> <P> Mercado told reporters that the gun believed used to shoot Newton -- a  9-millimeter pistol -- has been recovered at the rear of a house "associated  with Robinson." Ballistics tests are scheduled to see if, in fact, the gun was  used in the killing.  </P> <P> Robinson and two other ex-convicts -- Mark White and Rodney Jackson -- were  stopped in Oakland on suspicion of running a red light about 14 hours after the  murder. The stop was made near where Newton died.  </P> <P> Police said that after the stop, the three men "got cute" with the officers,  who then discovered two guns in the vehicle. The three were booked on suspicion  of being ex-convicts in possession of firearms.  </P> <P> Oakland Police Sgt. Mike Sitterud said Friday that there is "no indication at  all" that White and Jackson, who were arraigned Friday on the gun-possession  charges, were involved in Newton's death.  </P> <P> Police said Robinson, an Oakland resident, admitted the killing prior to his  scheduled arraignment Friday on the weapons charge, and the arraignment was  postponed until Tuesday. As a result of his statement that he killed Newton,  Robinson was rebooked Friday night on suspicion of murder.  </P> <P> Newton, 47, a leading and controversial figure in the Black Power movement of  the 1960s, was shot in the head and left to die on an Oakland street corner  near where he and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Views  </P> <P> While some, such as his attorney, Charles Garry, said they saw him as a leader  in the fight for "humanity, equality of the races (and) the dignity of black  Americans," others, such as Alameda County Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom  Orloff, saw him simply as a criminal "who played no positive role in the  community."  </P> <P> Newton's encounters with the law began in 1964, when he was convicted of felony  assault with a knife.  </P> <P> He was convicted in 1968 of the murder of an Oakland police officer during a  bloody gun battle that erupted in 1967 during a routine traffic stop. The  conviction was later overturned, and a second trial ended with a hung jury.  </P> <P> He was accused of the 1974 murder of a prostitute, but the trial ended with a  hung jury. Another 1974 charge involving the pistol-whipping of a tailor was  dropped.  </P> <P> In 1982, Newton was accused of embezzling $600,000 from a Panther-run  elementary school. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to stealing $15,000 in  state aid to the school and was sentenced to six months in jail.  </P> <P> He had been sentenced earlier this year to 90 days in San Quentin Prison for  possessing drug paraphernalia, which was a violation of his parole in an  earlier case.  </P> <P> Several weapons charges over the years resulted in three convictions for which  he served various amounts of jail time.  </P></p>

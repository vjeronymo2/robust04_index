			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Polls apart - German agencies underestimated the differences between east and west in recent elections Make it simple. Make it direct. And tap into issues with which people can identify. This was the message Dominique Kahane, a director of the Trialon advertising agency, used for a highly successful federal election campaign in eastern Germany. Staff at Trialon, which represented the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to east Germany's former communist party, believed they had a considerable advantage over its competitors from among Germany's other established political parties. 'We are all easterners,' says Kahane. 'Our office is in east Berlin. Some of us grew up with the candidates. We knew the day-to-day problems the easterners have been having since unification.' Instead of focusing on general issues, Trialon homed in on unemployment and housing issues which preoccupy most east Germans. 'The success of our campaign is in the result,' says Kahane. The PDS polled more than 22 per cent of the vote throughout eastern Germany. 'If anyone wants to come to eastern Germany and try to market a product or a party, you have to do your homework,' Kahane adds. Germany's Free Democrats and Bundnis 90/Greens may be regretting that they did not take to the streets. Indeed, both parties are slowly coming to terms with the disastrous results inflicted on them in eastern Germany. The FDP failed in eastern Germany to gain 5 per cent of the vote in the last federal elections. And along with the Greens, it failed to get represented in the eastern state parliaments of Thuringia and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - neither could muster enough support to win 5 per cent of the vote, the minimum to enter these parliaments. 'If we want to do better in future, we will have to adopt a completely new strategy,' says Wulf Oehme, the FDP's party manager in Berlin. The lesson drawn by the FDP and other political parties during the federal election campaign is that east Germany is different - the results confirm this. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's victorious Christian Democrats (along with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union) gained 38.5 per cent of the vote in the east compared with 42.2 per cent in the west; the opposition Social Democrats 31.9 per cent and 37.6 per cent respectively; the FDP 4 per cent and 7.7 per cent; and the Greens 5.7 per cent in the east and 7.8 per cent in the west. But the question is what kind of lessons the FDP and other parties have actually learned from the voting trends among east Germans. 'During the campaign, we had made no distinctions between east and west,' says Oehme. 'But we soon found out that several of the party organisations in the east say they would not even put up the same posters, even if they included Klaus Kinkel (leader of the FDP).' The FDP (which used Ogilvy &amp; Mather) also soon learned that its slogans and posters which tended to concentrate on Leistungsfahigkeit, or efficiency, meant nothing to the easterners. 'There is, as yet, no strong entrepreneurial middle-class elite in eastern Germany. Also, if we used slogans extolling libertarian values, which is also the basis of our support in the west, we found out that these values had little relevance for the easterners,' says Oehme. The SPD also tried not to make any distinction in its election campaign between east and west Germany. But Frank Stauss from Butter, the SPD's advertising agency, says the party sometimes did focus on specific east German themes. One of these included property, a controversial issue in the east because former owners have been allowed to return and reclaim land which had either been confiscated by the Nazis or expropriated by the communists. 'We found an east German family and used them in our posters in the east. The slogan we used was 'What is ours, remains ours',' explains Stauss. 'The easterners could identify with that.' Throughout the campaign, the SPD discovered other differences between the two Germanys. 'In west Germany those who come to the market place to hear a politician come because they support that party. In east Germany we found out that the same people came to the CDU and SPD rallies to find out more. You just cannot assume you have your supporters at each rally.' Also in the east the SPD could take out a page of advertising spelling out policies in detail. 'The easterners read more and want to know more than in the west,' says Stauss. 'Anyone coming into east Germany should know that there is still an insatiable appetite for information.' Kohl's CDU, however, refused to make any differences between east and west. 'Our strategy had two main aims,' explains Elke Tonscheidt, a CDU official involved in the campaign. 'The first strategy was to regard Germany as one country. So we kept the same slogans throughout. The second strategy was the Chancellor himself. It was his personality we were selling both in east and west Germany. We never deviated from that.' All parties concede that personalities mattered during the campaign, but they also agree that knowledge about local or regional conditions proved crucial. 'Despite five years of German unification, no marketing agency should take anything for granted in the east. The differences are narrowing. But there's a long way to go yet before both Germanys are really united,' says Kahane.</p>

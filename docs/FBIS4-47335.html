Tikhova; UDC 621.373.826]    [Abstract] One of the main conclusions of published  discussions of optical reconstruction of holograms is that it is  impossible to achieve correspondence between the lengthwise and  crosswise scales of transformation of the field. This fact is a  serious obstacle in analyzing antennas' directional patterns  with optical information processing equipment to reconstruct  microwave holograms. The optical reconstruction of microwave  holograms in the absence of constraints on coaxiality of the  optical transparent and image has been considered in a  mathematical analysis. The radiation spectrum has been  calculated as a function of the reference wave's angle of  incidence, and the possibility of undistorted modeling of the  directional pattern of a microwave antenna based on its hologram  in the Fresnel region zone has been indicated for the  one-dimensional case. An analogous consideration of a  two-dimensional hologram confirmed the violation of the equality  of the scales of transformation in the plane of the image and,  accordingly, in spectral frequencies. Scale correspondence may  be achieved only in a single cross section of the directional  pattern, which must be taken into consideration when  measurements are taken. Tables 6 (Russian).</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Beefy Constructions: Known for the delicacy of her paper and stick forms, the  newest constructions of Ann Page come as something of a shock. Beefier, less  kite-like, almost tuberous, at times they recall the pod shapes of Magdalena  Abakanowicz.  </P> <P> Fleshiness makes for intriguing, disturbing objects rife with bodily  associations that seem to be mutating to some other kind of life form.  </P> <P> Like embryos, these forms develop physically, making the artist's chain of  thought tangible and leading toward increasingly solid organic masses. Folding,  unfolding, cutting, numbering, and tying off creates solids that suggest  molecular models as well as fetal forms.  </P> <P> Page disconcertingly nails down those associations in pieces like "Dog-leg  Left" and "Medley (Alliteration V)," two wall-mounted sculptures festooned with  bulbous wads of bound cloth. Part pupa, part side of beef they may be the end  of the evolutionary chain hinted at in the many layered installation ". . . the  'success' of previous flights." But the way these new pieces flip back and  forth between life and death, evolution and abortion, they offer no easy -- or  even comfortable -- answers.

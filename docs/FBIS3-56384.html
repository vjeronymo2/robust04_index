			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has drawn  attention to the danger presented by the political movement  headed by the leader of the Liberal Democrats Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy.    At a news conference in Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow Friday  [14 January], Kravchuk recognized that the deputy to the State  Duma Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been legitimately elected by  Russian people, but he called him a dangerous phenomenon from  the point of view of the concept he declares.    The Ukrainian President said that the difference should be  seen between the declarations of ideas and their implementation.  He called on the Russian and Ukrainian Democrats to unite to  nip in the bud the political movement led by Zhirinovskiy, even  though the movement is already represented in parliament.    This movement is dangerous for everybody, not solely for  Ukraine, said Kravchuk. There is no need to think that only  Ukraine will be the victim of nationalism if it wins in Russia,  he said.</p>

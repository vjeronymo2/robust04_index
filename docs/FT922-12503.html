			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Serbs ignore pleas over Bosnian truce FRESH fighting erupted in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, as Serbia vowed not to cave into foreign pressure to respect the latest ceasefire in the newly independent former Yugoslav republic, Clashes were reported in four strategic towns along Bosnia's northern frontier with Croatia, in an apparent effort by Serbs to establish a corridor linking Bosanska Krajina, the large Serb enclave in western Bosnia, with Serbia. The fighting continued despite warnings from the US and the European Community to Serbia and the Serbian-dominated federal army to observe a ceasefire. Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, the Serbian foreign minister, played down the significance of the mounting international criticism, and said it was not an 'ultimatum'. Mr Radoman Bozovic, prime minister of Serbia, said: 'Serbia will not bow to an economic blockade. We are not ready to submit to pressures which are at the expense of Serbian dignity and economic sovereignty.' Gun battles and explosions shook Sarajevo only hours after Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, left the Bosnian capital, saying: 'I can't say I'm an optimist in this situation.' Battles in Bosnia have left more than 100 people dead and 170,000 homeless. Most main roads have been cut, causing shortages of food and medical supplies in many towns.</p>

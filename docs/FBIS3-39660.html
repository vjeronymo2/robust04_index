			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed SDC/JLV: "Yeltsin Puts Pressure on UN </F> Security Council Members"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Athens, 18 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister  Willy Claes confirmed on Thursday evening [17 February] in  Athens that the Russian President Boris Yeltsin had sent a  letter to those countries in the UN Security Council with troops  in Bosnia. In the letter, he stated that the "ultimatum set by  NATO is illegal" and "that a new resolution must be adopted in  the UN Security Council."    If Russia did not obtain a satisfactory response on this  point, then "we cannot be held responsible for the possible  consequences arising from NATO air strikes against the Bosnian  Serbs," the Russian president continued.    Yeltsin sent this letter to the French, British and Spanish  Governments.    Claes said Yeltsin regretted "not having been sufficiently  informed of the actions concerning Bosnia, and recalls that the  ultimatum set by NATO is not covered by resolutions voted by the  UN Security Council."    The Russian foreign minister had declared, however, that  "air  strikes could be justified as a final resort."    Russian opposition to air strikes is certainly not new, but  it is the first time the Russian president, who generally is  moderate in his relations with the West, has adopted such a  stiff tone.    In reaction to Yeltsin's letter, Claes recalled that the  existing resolutions (836 and 844) "do constitute an adequate  legal basis for air strikes." "Therefore a new UN Security  Council resolution is not necessary," the Belgian minister added.    "It makes no sense to claim that we want to minimalize  Russia's role in the Bosnia question. On the contrary, the  Europe Union [EU] wants Russia and the United States to play a  more active role in seeking peace in Bosnia," Claes added.    Finally the Belgian minister said he was "optimistic" about  a  peaceful conclusion to the Sarajevo crisis after the Russian  announcement of an agreement on the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb  heavy weapons.    On Friday Claes will participate with his Greek and German  colleagues in a meeting of the European "troika" -- the  outgoing, current and future EU presidencies -- with the Russian  Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev.</p>

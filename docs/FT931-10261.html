			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Charter Consolidated disposes of stake in Johnson Matthey CHARTER CONSOLIDATED, the UK industrial group, yesterday achieved its long-held ambition to dispose of its 38.3 per cent shareholding in Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. Charter will collect about Pounds 342m from the sale. A large part of the Charter holding, representing 20 per cent of JM, is to be bought for Pounds 187.8m or 490p for each JM share by a new company jointly set up by Minorco, the Luxembourg investment company, and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Corporation, the South African mining group. All four are perceived to be part of an international 'family' of companies influenced or controlled by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. The rest of the JM shares were placed with a wide range of institutions in London yesterday for Pounds 154.6m or 456p a share by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. After the announcement JM shares fell by 19p to close at 473p while Charter's ended 28p down at 656p. Analysts suggested there was some disappointment that Charter's disposal had not sparked a bid for JM and that the platinum marketing company once again would be virtually bid-proof. It was widely expected that Charter would use most of the cash raised to buy Minorco's 35.7 per cent stake in Charter and thus disentangle itself completely from the Anglo web Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, said a buy-back was one option. It had been established there would be no adverse tax implications from this. However, no formal approach had been made to Minorco and any deal would depend on Minorco's willingness to sell, and the price. Analysts suggested that, with the removal of JM from Charter's portfolio, there seemed to be no good reason for Minorco, which is 60 per cent-owned by Anglo and its sister company De Beers, to retain its stake. Minorco is paying Pounds 90.6m cash to Charter on completion but JCI will pay in two equal tranches of Pounds 48.61m. In the negotiations Hambros advised Charter; S G Warburg advised Minorco; Standard Merchant advised JCI; and Baring Brothers advised JM. Lex, Page 18 Background, Page 20</p>

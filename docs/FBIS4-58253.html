			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F> 'Imanu'el Rosen, in the studio -- live]    [Excerpt] [Rosen] Although we all have short memories, I  remember that at the end of the 1980's, when you served as the  Foreign Ministry's political director general, you suggested  that we hold a dialogue and contacts with Mandela and the ANC.  Then Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was very mad at you for  this.    [Beilin] Well, yes, but he has changed his mind since.  Also, there were sanctions against South Africa, and Israel was  not too enthusiastic about taking steps against South Africa.  Eventually, in March 1987 we joined the international club that  imposed the sanctions, and I was very happy with this. I  believe this is one of the reasons that today we are able to  hold a dialogue, as we do, with Nelson Mandela, who was then  still in prison, and with the ANC.    [Rosen] Do you believe that over the past two or three years  we corrected the mistakes made over the past decades?    [Beilin] I believe so because up to 1987, Israel was, in  fact, the only country to openly admit that it disregarded the  sanctions the United Nations imposed on South Africa in 1977.  This created a very negative sentiment against Israel among the  black South Africans. They seriously supported the  Palestinians, hence, their unbalanced attitude toward the PLO  all these years. It was very difficult for us to make the  change, and I cannot say that today they are completely balanced  and that we will continue our passionate love affair with South  Africa. The new regime will certainly be different from the  previous, very pro-Israel, white regime.    [Rosen] We had very good defense relations. Was this  eliminated?    [Beilin] In 1987 we decided not to renew defense contracts.  That meant that existing contracts which still were in effect  were followed through to the date set for their termination. No  new contracts were signed. Therefore, the defense relations  between us have completely decayed.    [Rosen] Are there other areas of cooperation which will  continue? Are there contacts now with Mandela's men on this?    [Beilin] Primarily, there is trade between the two  countries. We import coal and other raw materials, and we export  there. We naturally have very close ties with the Jewish  community there. Also, there are contacts, established about a  year ago or so, with the ANC, which is a very broad coalition,  and with Mandela. He was due to visit Israel some time ago, and  he postponed it and will probably visit here in the future.  Hence, certainly we have the beginning of a very interesting  dialogue, which carries many opportunities, with the new South  African leadership.    [Rosen] Is there a possibility of an Israeli-South African  cooperation regarding black Africa in general?    [Beilin] We have asked ourselves this very question, though  I doubt it is possible. There is a big question: What kind of  country will South African become? So far, it has been a  Western country with a black population that could not even  vote. Today, it will be very different. Will it become another  Third World country with the symptoms of such countries,  including the big disappointment with past African leaders; or  will it be a very different country, which uses the enormous  wealth at its disposal? There is a chance the latter will be the  case, but I find it hard to believe it will have the time or the  ability to even consider cooperating with a country such as  Israel in other Third World countries or black Africa. We will  continue our efforts in Africa. We are in the midst of a very  intensive campaign of economic cooperation with African  countries. If the new South African regime would be willing to  cooperate with us, we would certainly welcome this. I, however,  doubt this is a realistic option at this time. [passage omitted]</p>

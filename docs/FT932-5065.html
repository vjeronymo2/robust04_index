			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Markets: Dealers obsessed with simple little number - Wall Street SOMETIMES, as every well-dressed woman knows, a plain black dress outshines the most glamorous couture. So it was with Wall Street this week. A multi-billion dollar alliance between British Telecom and MCI, the second largest long-distance telephone company in the US, and a record-breaking flotation failed to divert investors from one simple concern: inflation. Having spurted to an all-time closing high 10 days ago, the US stock market hung on to these levels for the first couple of days after the Memorial Day weekend. But it failed to push ahead to new highs, and the closing levels on Tuesday and Wednesday fell slightly shy of 3554.83-mark which the Dow Jones Industrial Average had reached on the previous Thursday. Moreover, by the latter half of the week, traders were obsessed with the employment data due to be released on Friday morning. In the event, they had good reason to be worried. The May employment report showed a rise 209,000 of in non-farm payrolls last month - considerably more than the 155,000 which many analysts had predicted. The unemployment rate fell by one-tenth of a percentage point, from 7 to 6.9 per cent. Most forecasts had suggested that it would stay unchanged. On the one hand, the surprisingly strong numbers seemed to alleviate some of the recent concerns about the strength of the US economy's recovery. But from the viewpoint of both the equity and bond markets, they also reinforced the notion that inflation may have crept back into the system - in turn, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will seek to raise interest rates. Long-dated government securities slipped on news of the jobs data, bond yields rose, and shares prices eased back. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recovered slightly to end up 0.27 at 3,545.14. Perhaps the best description of Wall Street's current mood came from the pundit who likened it to a tug-of-war. At one end of the rope are the bulls, who see an economy rebounding but with enough lingering weakness to hold inflation at bay. At the other are the bears, who see rising prices and interest rates at every turn. Last week was a small victory for the latter. Amid these 'big issues', few stocks grabbed much of the spotlight. The notable exception was in the telecommunications sector where repercussions from the BT-MCI link-up were widespread. Essentially, the deal involves BT investing Dollars 4.3bn for a 20 per cent stake in MCI, and the two companies in setting up a Dollars 1bn-plus joint venture. This enterprise, in which BT will hold the majority stake, plans to concentrate on fast-growing demand from multinationals for international voice and data transmission services. As such, it represents a direct challenge to efforts by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to corner this type of international custom. BT will invest its money in MCI in two tranches, and the deal will not be completed until 1994. Still, with BT prepared to pay an average Dollars 64 per MCI share, the US company's stock rose sharply and hung on to some of those gains. MCI shares, which had closed at Dollars 52 ahead of the deal's announcement, were trading at more than Dollars 54 on Friday morning. By contrast, A T &amp; T, which also announced last week that it was linking up with Viacom to test a new video-on-demand technology, dipped immediately but quickly recovered. They ended the week little changed. BT's American Depositary Receipts were the loser, shedding about Dollars 4 to end the week at Dollars 64 1/4 . The other important event of the week was the flotation of a 20 per cent stake in Allstate, the second largest writer of home and car insurance policies in the US after State Farm. It was wholly-owned by Sears, Roebuck. But Sears has pledged to concentrate on its core retailing interest - and the flotation of a minority interest in Allstate is part of this strategy. Late on Thursday, the Allstate issue was priced at Dollars 27 a share, at the upper end of the indicated range and ensuring proceeds of over Dollars 2.1bn. This made the sale the biggest 'initial public offering' ever seen in the US, easily outstripping Conrail's Dollars 1.64bn share sale in 1987. By the end of the week, moreover, Allstate's underwriters and its new-found investors had every reason to smile: the insurers shares had moved to a healthy premium, at Dollars 28 7/8 . Meanwhile, BT was not the only transatlantic stock to win some attention. Investors indulged a flurry of 'dividend-stripping' at Hanson, causing the UK conglomerate's ADR to become the most-actively traded issue on the Big Board on Wednesday. This time, however, there was no multi-billion deal to underpin the interest, and the ADR price remained unchanged.  --------------------------------- Monday      Closed Tuesday     3552.34  +  24.91 Wednesday   3553.45  +  1.11 Thursday    3544.87  -  8.58 Friday      3545.14  +  0.27  ---------------------------------</p>

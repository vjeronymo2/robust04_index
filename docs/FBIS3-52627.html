			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First installment of a two-part unattributed commentary: </F> "In the Margin of the President's Remarks"]    [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani remarks to students of  Martyr Beheshti University in which he criticized the stance of  the mass media on economic issues and especially commented on  the reasons behind the rise in foreign exchange rates. These  remarks make it necessary to give the following explanations.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said about foreign debts: "It is true  that in the current year we have been unable to repay some of  our foreign debts. But the media are wrong in reporting that  these debts are high."    Of course, it is a source of pleasure that the president, as  the highest ranking executive official of the country, has, at  any rate, accepted the fact that we have not been able to repay  our foreign debts on the due date in the current year. When the  country's high-ranking officials have correct information on  this issue but do not place this information at the disposal of  the people and the mass media, then rumors start. There is no  doubt that under such conditions each person refers to one  figure or another. But we know that the total amount of our  foreign debt is somewhere near $28 billion, of which $10 billion  are for goods that we have committed ourselves to purchase but  which have not yet been delivered. If the government wants to,  it can cancel these orders and not add to the $18 billion of  debts that we already have and out of which $8 billion had to be  repaid by the government this year. If this problem is not  solved, this figure will increase in the coming years. These  are figures and information that the press has been able to  gather from here and there.    But what is Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticizing? Does he  believe that the press should not tell the truth? Or is he  criticizing the fact that the figures were published? Does he  believe that these figures are incorrect? Then why do the  officials not come out and state the true figures to the press?  Naturally, the best way to prevent incorrect reporting is  through a realistic approach by the officials.    The president also said: "If there are pressures as far as  the repayment of debts is concerned, it is because our creditors  are not our friends and the plans that they have drawn up are  such that they have not given us enough time for repayment."    This statement in itself shows that Iran should have been  more careful about which country it received loans from.  Frankly speaking, what need was there for us to get loans for  our reconstruction and economic development from countries or  companies that are not our friends? Does this mean that we have  asked for loans and assistance from our enemies? How can this  be justified? What need is there for us to carry out  transactions with someone who is not our friend? But we deal  with countries like Japan, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and  other countries that Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government has  repeatedly described as friends of the Islamic Republic and he  has called for the expansion of relations with them. However,  when the press questioned the quality and the quantity of our  relations with these countries, our officials described these  efforts by the press as a type of obstructionism in Iran's  foreign relations and told us that we cannot avoid relations  with a country that wants to be our friend and that the press  should not resort to such obstructionism. Then how is it that  these countries were our friends then and have now become our  enemies and are obstructing matters? Is it not that we resorted  to an unrestrained expansion of relations with these countries  without taking true conditions into consideration? Is it not  that we set foot on a wrong path without carrying out the  necessary calculations?    The other point is that it has been repeatedly stated that  foreign loans and investments were in economic and fundamental  fields that promised immediate returns that would ensure the  rapid repayment of these loans. But this has not happened. Was  this because of wrong policies? Is it correct for us to receive  a loan from the World Bank and build the huge building of the  Central Bank and other such projects instead of using it for  profitable fields such as agriculture and so on? Naturally,  when a foreign loan is taken out for the Central Bank, it will  not have any economic returns and cannot ensure an income with  which we can repay a loan when it expires. Is it correct for us  to allocate World Bank loans to development projects and then  face a difficulty in repaying them?    Basically, why do we expect the repayment time for our debts  to expire and the creditor not to request payment, and then--if  he expresses lack of confidence in us--to think that he is our  enemy? This is an irrational expectation. We should plan so as  to avoid difficulties when it comes to meeting our commitments.    If from the very beginning we had foreseen all these  conditions, it would have been better for us not to seek loans  at all. It would have been better if the reconstruction of  Rudbar and Manjil had been completed a year late, if the huge  Central Bank building had not been constructed, and if the plan  for the surface waters of Tehran and its suburbs had not been  completed rather than for us to pawn our country's prestige for  such development projects.    Stating these points is not critical or antagonistic. It is  only a realistic belief that the people should be informed about  such issues, that the officials should be broad-minded enough to  realize that the press is reflecting problems in an unbiased  manner, and to compile programs to solve these problems.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA FEELS THE PRESSURE AND LOSES  </P> <P> With 15:20 left in Wednesday night's first-round game of NCAA West Regional  women's basketball tournament, UCLA seemed to have everything under control.  DeDe Mosman's three-point shot had given the Bruins a 53-37 lead against No. 22  Arkansas.  </P> <P> But Arkansas countered with a full-court press that started a 20-5 run and  eventually led to a 90-80 Arkansas victory in overtime.  </P> <P> "We just didn't handle the full-court pressure," UCLA Coach Billie Moore said.  "We had a couple of players playing out of position with the injury to our  point guard (Nicole Anderson). I was hoping they wouldn't exploit that, but  they did."  </P> <P> UCLA, making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1985, ends the season  with a 17-12 record. Arkansas (23-4) advances to a second-round game at Georgia  on Sunday.  </P> <P> Arkansas appeared to have it won in regulation when Christi Willson made both  ends of a one-and-one with seven seconds left to give the Razorbacks a 75-72  lead. But the Bruins' Rachelle Roulier hit a desperation 28-footer at :01 to  tie the game at 75-75 and force overtime.  </P> <P> UCLA's Sheri Bouldin scored the first point in overtime on a free throw, but  Arkansas countered with a field goal by Blair Savage and UCLA never led again.  </P> <P> Rehema Stephens, a 5-foot-11 sophomore guard from Oakland, led UCLA with 16  points. Sandra VanEmbricqs, Mosman and Bouldin added 13 points each.  Van-Embricqs and Bouldin grabbed 10 rebounds each.  </P> <P> Delmonica DeHorney and Amber Nicholas had 22 points for Arkansas.  </P></p>

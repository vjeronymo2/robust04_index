			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 22 (AFP) -- EC ministers debating  plans to admit four states to the European Community reached a  partial accord on agricultural subsidies early Tuesday [22  February], Community sources reported here.    European affairs ministers agreed in principle that  long-term  subsidies for certain troubled agricultural sectors could remain  in place in the four candidate countries, Austria, Finland,  Norway and Sweden.    The accord was to be presented later Tuesday to foreign  ministers from the four states.    The ministers also accepted a proposal from the EC Executive  Commission to consider the northern regions of the three Nordic  states -- located above the 62nd parallel -- as agricultural  mountain zones, a diplomatic source reported.    These regions, where summer lasts only several weeks, meet  special EC criteria on reduced fertility and productivity.    In another move the ministers reached common ground on  production quotas covering sugar, milk and milk products for  each of the four candidates.    They accepted a proposal from Finland that will allow  Finnish  mink breeders to continue feeding their animals with herring,  despite the fact that under EC regulations herring are only to  be consumed by humans.    In addition Finnish legislation governing holiday residences  reserved for Finns can be maintained as can the autonomous  status of the Swedish-speaking island of Aaland.    But the ministers meeting here made virtually no progress on  fishing questions, apart from reaching an agreement in principle  on access to EC and Nordic waters.    Regional aid, the possible establishment of specific  criteria  for the four candidates and their budgetary contributions were  to be debated further on Tuesday.</p>

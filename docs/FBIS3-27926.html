			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has expressed regret  over tendencies of the Sabah United Party, PBS, State Government  to use sentiments to cover up economic and development problems  in its bid to retain power in the state. He said PBS leaders  were willing to do anything to ensure their continued  administration in the state, including the use of sentiments and  creating hatred toward the federal government. The prime  minister was addressing a dinner function organized by the Sabah  Bumiputera [Indigenous]-Chinese chambers of commerce and  industry in Kota Kinabalu last night.    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir clarified that the political  stability  and peace was the main factor for the rapid economic development  in the country, which is able to maintain a growth rate of eight  percent for six consecutive years. However, according to him,  this was the national average per se. States like Pahang,  Johor, and Melaka have achieved a 13-percent growth rate, while  Sabah has recorded the lowest growth rate -- just a mere four  percent. The prime minister explained that the federal  government has no ill intention toward the people of Sabah and  the federal government will assist a state toward development  for the benefit of all the people in that state.</p>

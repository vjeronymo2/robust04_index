			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / RAF to pay woman Pounds 172,912 An industrial tribunal in Leeds yesterday made a record-breaking award of Pounds 172,912 to Mrs Nichola Cannock, a mother of three who was dismissed from the Royal Air Force nine years ago for becoming pregnant, Robert Taylor writes. This is the highest amount won by a woman from the armed services in a sex discrimination case. Mrs Cannock's counsel told the tribunal hearing that the case was 'highly unusual' because she had impressive engineering qualifications. She worked 12-hour shifts helping to prepare and maintain Victor Tanker planes flying from RAF Marsham to serve in the Falklands war. The Ministry of Defence agreed that Mrs Cannock should receive compensation for her dismissal, which it said had breached the sex discrimination laws. But it proposed only just over Pounds 12,000. Last month Mrs Deborah Miller, who used to serve in the RAF, won Pounds 33,000 at an industrial tribunal for losing her job because of pregnancy.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Pearson turns its spotlight on the media: The reasons behind the UK group's decision to dispose of its china and oil interests Pearson at last came out yesterday and finally admitted in public what has long been whispered in private - that it is a media, information and entertainment group. Its metamorphosis has been spread over a decade, but it was only yesterday that the tadpole finally turned into a frog with the announcement that it had decided to demerge Royal Doulton, the fine china company, and sell a majority stake in Camco, its oil services division. 'Shareholders increasingly view Pearson as a media company and value it as such. While fine china and oil services are attractive investments in their own right, they do not add value to investors looking for exposure to the media sector,' Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday. The one exception to the new focus on the media will be Lazard Partners, Pearson's associated merchant bank. 'Marvellous cash flow and extremely good advice. We are very happy with it,' said Lord Blakenham. The changes over the past decade may have been gradual but they have been fundamental. In recent months they have intensified with the acquisition of Thames Television. In the early 1980s Pearson's interests ranged from Fairey, the engineering group, through oil companies to Chateau Latour, the leading French vineyard. Media interests, such as the Financial Times, Penguin and the Economist accounted for a third of capital employed. By the end of last year, two thirds of the Pounds 2.1bn capital employed was accounted for by media and entertainment, boosted by the addition of companies such as Addison-Wesley, the US educational publisher; Les Echos, the French financial daily; and a 17 per cent stake in British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture. 'Our distinctive strengths include the ownership and exploitation of brands, imprints and intellectual property rights,' said Lord Blakenham. Unfortunately yesterday's announcement came the day after Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation beat Pearson to control of a large media prize, the Hong Kong-based Star TV satellite system which broadcasts to 38 Asian countries. 'They managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. If they had put money on the table in the first week they would have had it,' said one of those involved in the negotiations. Pearson had been negotiating for a month with Star TV, owned by Mr Li Ka-Shing and his family and Hutchison Whampoa, also controlled by Mr Li. The UK group was unwilling to accede to Mr Li's insistence on a public offering for the company. It wanted him to remain a minority shareholder until after 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese ownership. Goldman Sachs, the merchant bank representing Mr Li orchestrated an auction. Mr Murdoch had earlier made an offer and walked away from the venture, which claims 65m viewers in 15m Asian homes. He was persuaded to come back less than two weeks ago. He interrupted Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, on the first day of a holiday in Australia and dispatched him to Hong Kong. Mr Chisholm stayed until the deal was complete. Mr Murdoch agreed the Dollars 525m shares and cash deal for 63.4 per cent of Star on Thursday. On Sunday Pearson, which offered a considerably higher price than Mr Murdoch as long as Mr Li stayed in, was still negotiating in Hong Kong in good faith. Lord Blakenham yesterday put a brave face and would only say that Pearson would have been interested in Star under the right terms and conditions. One Pearson executive said: 'We are not Rupert Murdoch. He came within half an hour of going bust. We don't bet the shop and are happy to stand on our record.' Analysts yesterday supported the principle of Pearson's strategy, but expressed surprise at the 'bottom of the cycle' timing of the demerger of Royal Doulton and disposal of Camco. In 1992 Royal Doulton and Camco accounted for 30 per cent of Pearson's Pounds 1.6bn sales and about 7 per cent of the group's Pounds 156m operating profit. Royal Doulton, which Pearson has owned for just over 20 years, made a operating profit of Pounds 10.7m last year on sales of Pounds 200.9m. It will be demerged from Pearson probably before the end of this year and will have a separate Stock Exchange listing. Pearson shareholders will be given the Royal Doulton shares if they agree to the demerger. Although Royal Doulton, whose brands include Royal Crown Derby, Minton and Royal Albert, has been hit by the recession, it has performed well in its sector. Pearson decided that the best way to get maximum value for Camco, a US company which makes everything from rock drilling bits to testing equipment for oil and gas wells, was to go for a public offering in New York. A majority will be offered, probably in the first half of 1994. Pearson will hold on to the remaining stake for a limited period. Camco had operating profits of Pounds 500,000 last year on sales of Pounds 289.8m. In a final irony yesterday, Mr Murdoch - still on 'holiday' on his new yacht Morning Glory - spotted that the Pearson announcement had driven up the share price. He got rid of 16.5m Pearson shares through Goldman Sachs at 464p - about Pounds 76m in all. It was the last remnant unencumbered by convertible agreements of a loss-making stake in the group that peaked at 20.57 per cent in Jan 1988. The opportunistic move will help to pay for his acquisition of Star TV.</p>

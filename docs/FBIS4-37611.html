			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Hayim </F> Zissowitz; place and date not given]    [Text] [Zissowitz] Let me first ask you about the Syrian  issue. Does the fear of an imminent war -- within three to seven  years, as the prime minister put it -- justify or call for  greater political compromises on Israel's part with regard to  the Golan Heights?    [Peres] I do not think that was what the prime minister  meant. We make compromises not out of fear of war but because we  want to attain peace.    [Zissowitz] The prime minister's remarks sound like an  attempt to prepare the people for a compromise on the Golan  Heights.    [Peres] Yes, that definitely must be done. We began talking  about a compromise on the Golan Heights at the Labor convention  on the eve of the last Knesset elections. We did not conceal  our position. We stated it loud and clear, and there is no  reason to change those positions.    [Zissowitz] Does the fear of war determine or influence the  positions presented by Israel in the negotiations and the pace  at which it would like the negotiations to proceed?    [Peres] I do not think so. I think that what influences  them is the desire to reach genuine peace for both sides. Three  situations are possible: war, peace, and no war and no peace,  which is the current one. The current situation exacts a heavy  toll -- first and foremost: a frenzied arms race. Some people  estimate that the Middle East spent $1 trillion on arms during  the last decade. This is really scandalous. This deprived  children of food and youths of education. What for? In  addition, there is suspiciousness, kidnappings, exchanges of  fire. Although this does not directly apply to the  Syrian-Israeli border, such a phenomenon exists in Lebanon,  where the Syrians have a say in a variety of issues.    [Zissowitz] You said we recently presented interesting  proposals to the Syrians. Could you elaborate on those  proposals?    [Peres] No, I am afraid I cannot.    [Zissowitz] Could you at least tell us through which channel  these proposals were relayed, seeing that the Washington talks  have not resumed?    [Peres] It is a very specific channel. We submitted our  views on the way to attain an arrangement with the Syrians to  the Americans. I would like to reiterate that this arrangement  consists of three interrelated and parallel issues: security,  peace, and withdrawal. There can be no arrangement with the  Syrians based on their demand that we first answer one question  and then proceed to discuss other issues. They want us to first  answer the question about a total withdrawal from the Golan  Heights and then to proceed to discuss other issues. That is  totally inconceivable!    [Zissowitz] Is interesting proposals your description or  that of the Syrians?    [Peres] It is my description. I do not speak for the  Syrians.    [Zissowitz] Has there been any response on their part?    [Peres] There has been no response conducive to a  breakthrough. I think the Syrians want to pursue the  negotiations, but their response has not been enough to enable  us to launch real negotiations. We keep talking about the  nature of the negotiations. After all, how can one normalize  relations without normalizing the negotiations? Let us tell it  like it is: In this day and age, negotiations are public.  Today every citizen is a diplomat, and rightly so. He listens  to the radio, watches television, analyzes what he hears, and  wants to be sure. We are the representatives of the people. We  are not a small ruling clique, as is the case in other places.    [Zissowitz] Are there any secret contacts with the Syrians?    [Peres] No, and I am sorry about that. This element is also  missing. With regard to all the talk about credibility or about  keeping the situation obscure: In all peace negotiations, there  is a part that is covert and shrouded in mystery. It cannot be  otherwise. All the initial positions cannot be revealed  publicly.    [Zissowitz] Has Israel proposed to the Syrians, via the  Americans, to hold a secret meeting between the prime minister  and President al-Asad?    [Peres] I do not know about a secret meeting. After all, we  say publicly and openly that we are prepared to hold a meeting  at any level whatsoever, from the level of the president and the  prime minister through the cabinet level; there must be a  diversity of levels. Let me say this humorously: In the end,  it is only the political level that is entitled to make  mistakes. Peace cannot be attained without committing so-called  mistakes -- that is, without raising new and creative ideas,  without trying to look for ways to overcome various obstacles.  Having taken part in the negotiations with the Palestinians,  let me tell you that this means endless days and nights of  working on different ideas, of confrontations, and of ups and  downs. This is the way it is. This is the nature of  negotiations, considering that we start out with very deep  differences, with long-standing mistrust, with a suspiciousness  that has almost become second nature, and with a great deal of  skepticism on both sides as to whether genuine peace and a  different type of relations can be attained. As far as I am  concerned, I have no doubt that there is no alternative to  peace, neither for the Syrians nor for us.    [Zissowitz] The government today marks two years in power.  Could you estimate whether the signing of a peace treaty with  Jordan or with Syria can be expected next year?    [Peres] Look, I cannot make any prophecies. At best, I can  predict 50 percent of the story. I can reasonably assume that  this is definitely possible, but I cannot say that with  certainty. It is very hard to decipher what really happens in  Syria or what goes on in the Syrian president's mind and heart,  and it is even more difficult to guess or make predictions.    [Zissowitz] Is a meeting with King Husayn or a visit to  Israel and Jerusalem expected to take place soon?    [Peres] I very much hope so. There are hardly any problems  between us and Jordan that cannot be resolved. In my opinion,  Jordan and Israel are wasting time and money for no reason. We  could have made the economies of both countries prosperous and  turned our border into a blossoming area.    [Zissowitz] Well, let us look inward. After two years in  power, what do you consider the government's most stinging  failure?    [Peres] I do not think there has been any stinging failure.  Let me say it fair and square. Here we have an exceptional  combination of three things: a peace process, continued  immigration to Israel, and continued economic growth. This is  an exceptionally strong combination. Forget the blaring  headlines and empty talk.    [Zissowitz] Nothing has failed?    [Peres] That would be an exaggeration. There have certainly  been failures, which is only natural. I am talking about the  really big things. Paradoxically enough, I think today the  Jewish people is experiencing one of its peaks, perhaps one of  the highest in its history. On the other hand, it is facing  great dangers. My God! At the peak of our strength, we are  being threatened by dangers unprecedented in our history.  Incidentally, these are more of a spiritual than of a physical  nature. Our problem is the survival of our people and our  Jewish identity in the face of assimilation and our shrinking  numbers. I would even go so far as to say that while the Jewish  state is experiencing spring, the Jewish people is experiencing  autumn.    [Zissowitz] Thank you very much, sir.    [Peres] You are welcome.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PHOENIX HOUSE ASKS EXTENSION ON HEARING; FOES SCRAMBLE  </P> <P> An organization that three weeks ago abandoned plans to put a drug-treatment  center in Lake View Terrace has asked for a month's extension of the time  before a city hearing on the project, suggesting to opponents that it may still  be alive.  </P> <P> In Lake View Terrace, opponents of the Nancy Reagan Center reacted with alarm  Friday to news of the request by Phoenix House, which will be heard Tuesday by  the city Board of Zoning Appeals. They said it could mean that, like the  mythical phoenix, plans for the center are rising from their ashes.  </P> <P> "The perception community people will have, whether it's true or not, is that  they've changed their minds and will be continuing with the site," said Lewis  Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn.  </P> <P> A Phoenix House vice president insisted Friday that the New York-based  organization has not changed its mind about relinquishing its option to buy the  former Lake View Medical Center, which had filed for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> It dropped the plan to convert the hospital into a 210-bed treatment and  research center after ex-First Lady Nancy Reagan withdrew her support, citing  community opposition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Analyze Legal Obligations'  </P> <P> Larraine Mohr, Phoenix House vice president, said when asked about the  postponement request: "We need time to verify and analyze what our legal  obligations are with respect to the application on that site."  </P> <P> The hearing, still officially scheduled, is on a zoning administrator's ruling  in favor of Phoenix House.  </P> <P> Mohr said attorneys and Phoenix House officials need to review obligations  related to fund-raising for the center, which brought in at least $5 million  from several celebrity-studded events.  </P> <P> A Phoenix House spokesman said the group hoped to find another Los Angeles  location acceptable to Reagan where the money could be used instead.  </P> <P> Within days of Reagan's announcement, Phoenix House notified the bankruptcy  court-appointed trustee of its intent to cancel the option, for which it has  paid more than $300,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Here We Go Again'  </P> <P> Eileen Barry, recording secretary for the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn.,  spent Friday afternoon notifying association members about Tuesday's extension  hearing.  </P> <P> "I've been calling a lot of people and they've all said, 'Oh, my God, here we  go again,' " Barry said. "We're all just so tired of dealing with this."  </P> <P> Neighbors say the center would attract drugs and crime and lower their property  values. They were so pleased with Reagan's announcement that they held two  large victory parties.  </P></p>

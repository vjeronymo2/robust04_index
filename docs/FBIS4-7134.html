			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- The second anniversary  of the publication of the Pyongyang declaration "Let Us Defend  and Advance the Cause of Socialism" was observed in Peru and  Russia.    The declaration was adopted in April 1992 by leaders and  representatives of political parties advocating socialism who  came to Pyongyang to celebrate the 80th birthday of the great  leader President Kim Il-song.    Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, chairman of the People's Front of  Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, made a speech at a  meeting held at the front on April 13.    He said it is only two years since the adoption of the  Pyongyang declaration, but more than 200 parties have signed it  and its vitality is growing day by day.    "The Pyongyang declaration, which clarified the superiority  of socialism to capitalism, the inevitability of the victory of  socialism and the tasks and ways of defending and advancing  socialism, has served as a weapon for the socialists in their  struggle," he said, adding that his front which also signed the  declaration would resolutely fight to defend and advance the  cause of socialism.    In his speech at a meeting with representatives of Russian  political parties held in Moscow April 20, V.I. Anpilov,  secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist  Workers' Party, said "the Pyongyang declaration is the hope of  our cause and the beacon of socialism for the communists." "In  the struggle for socialism," he continued, "the Workers' Party  of Korea and its leaders Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim  Chong-il show an example."    A.A. Rapin, secretary of the Central Committee of the  All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, in his speech said the  Pyongyang declaration opened a new high stage in the development  of the international communist movement and the working-class  movement. "This declaration will be recorded in history along  with the `communist manifesto'," he said.</p>

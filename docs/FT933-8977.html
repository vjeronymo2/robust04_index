			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fresh capital to ensure growth - Future tax uncertainties prompt 'one-off' move COMMERCIAL UNION is gearing up for further expansion after rapid growth in the first six months. Following its rights issue earlier this year, the company aims to earmark some Pounds 100m cash it expects to raise from the enhanced scrip dividend, announced yesterday, to support these efforts. Premium income in the half year to June 30 grew by 28 per cent to Pounds 3.04bn. Much of the growth was concentrated in the UK where premiums from general insurance rose by an underlying rate of 20 per cent to Pounds 895.9m. Mr Peter Foster, general manager (finance), said the scrip dividend would enable CU to 'retain additional capital, allowing growth of both life and non-life business in the UK, and life business overseas.' Fresh capital was particularly needed to support new overseas life insurance ventures especially in southern Europe. These are capital intensive and impose new business strain. CU is keen to increase its share of the life market in order to balance its exposure to more volatile general lines. Sales of new life annual premiums in the UK increased by 12 per cent, reflecting increased sales of mortgage related and pensions busi- ness. CU, however, is also confident about prospects for the general insurance market, especially in the UK where the company is expecting a prolonged period of profitabil- ity. Mr John Carter, the general manager who takes over as chief executive next year, said that scarcity of capital and falling returns from investment was forcing companies to aim to achieve profits on their underwriting operations and was leading to a general improvement in underwriting discipline. We expect a 'better and longer peak to the underwriting cycle' and a period of 'underwriting profits'.</p>

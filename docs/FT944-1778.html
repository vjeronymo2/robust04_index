			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Leadership of ANC admits party disarray The top leadership of the African National Con-gress has ack-nowledged that the party is in organisational disarray and was unprepared for the demands of becoming the dominant partner in South Africa's government of national unity. In his official report to the ANC's triennial conference in Bloemfontein yesterday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said the party had not sufficiently prepared itself for dealing with the bureaucratic tasks of government. As a result, the slow flow of new legislation, combined with ineffective policy implementation by a recalcitrant bureaucracy, had delayed delivery on the party's election promises. In a well-received address to 3,000 ANC delegates from around the country, Mr Ramaphosa also admitted that the party's paid-up membership had dropped off sharply following the April election, and that unmet debts incurred during the election campaign had led to the use of fewer full-time party officers. However, he said he expected the conference to agree on a new membership structure to help combat this as well as cutting the excessive workload for top party officials. The admissions are an acknowledgement by the ANC of some grassroots dissatisfaction with the slow pace of change since it came to power following the country's April elections. Still, the conference seems likely to accept a proposed strategy document presented yesterday by deputy President Thabo Mbeki, which puts forward a generally moderate political line and calls for a national consensus on economic policy centred around opening the South African market to increased trade and capital flows to boost local investment and productivity. However the wide-ranging document notes that, while the ANC needs to improve its standing among whites, its primary focus should be the needs of the country's black community. It also says that the bureaucracy, army and police force should be rapidly transformed to make them more representative in terms of both race and gender and more accountable to government. Both Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Mbeki's speeches followed the line set in President Nelson Mandela's opening address to the five-day conference on Saturday, when he admitted that the pace of change had been slow, but insisted there were no short-term solutions to the entrenched problems South Africa faces. 'Ours is not a programme of quick handouts but one for serious and lasting transformation,' he said. Mr Mandela also went out of his way to defend the ANC's commitment to fiscal discipline and economic reform against radicals calling for faster change. He insisted that such policies were 'neither luxuries nor requirements foreign to the ANC's own policies', stressing that they represented the best way of achieving sustainable growth. In this light, Mr Mandela said that given the difficulties of governance and delivery, the ANC should make more of an effort to explain to people the reasons behind unpopular decisions. 'This is the best antidote to attempts by opportunists of all hues to gain popularity on the basis of radical-sounding but impractical propositions,' he said. The president reiterated that one of the main obstacles facing the government's economic programme was the preponderance of economic power in white hands. This, he said, led to 'attempts to discourage new entrants and foreign investors because the cartels overcharging society fear competition'.</p>

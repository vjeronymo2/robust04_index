			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Amstrad With a buy-out bid all but on the table, Mr Alan Sugar certainly has no incentive to paint a rosy picture of trading conditions at Amstrad. Even so, shareholders may have found yesterday's decision to pass the final dividend hard to swallow - all the more so in the light of confirmation that the group holds net cash balances of some 20p a share. One might reflect whether a company on the receiving end of a hostile bid would behave in the same ungenerous manner. Admittedly the cash position will deteriorate in the run-up to Christmas as stocks are built. But with sales of just 63p a share last year generated from net assets of 46p a share, Amstrad still looks heavily over-capitalised. Surely some of this surplus could be distributed to shareholders. As for yesterday's full year figures, they are of scant help in predicting the trading outlook or assessing the offer. With inventories cleared of older products, Amstrad may now be able to rebuild margins. Yet there are signs of tougher conditions in areas such as satellite dishes which have hitherto been trading profitably. In the meantime the shares are trading at a discount to both asset value and the likely 30p bid price. The market holds out little hope of extracting improved terms.</p>

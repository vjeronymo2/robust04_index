			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: From drinks to the driving seat - The challenge facing Grand Metropolitan's new chief executive GRAND Metropolitan's restless management culture yesterday produced another surprise for its shareholders as Mr Ian Martin, group managing director, and long viewed as heir-apparent to Sir Allen Sheppard, withdrew from his post to become a non-executive deputy chairman. Mr George Bull, present head of GrandMet's food operations but the former driving force behind the development of IDV, its drinks division, becomes the group's chief executive. Sir Allen, having split his combined role, will continue as full-time chairman until his retirement in 1996. The GrandMet board, whose non-executive members include Mr Richard Giordano, chairman of BOC, Sir John Harvey-Jones, former chairman of ICI, Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways and Mr David Simon, of British Petroleum, was unanimous in its choice of Mr Bull. Sir Allen said yesterday: 'We had a high quality problem. The two men are outstanding world-class executives.' Mr Martin, 58, masterminded GrandMet's Dollars 5.8bn acquisition of the US Pillsbury group, which included Green Giant and Burger King, in 1988. A tough-minded Scot who came up through GrandMet's former brewing and hotels operations, he stayed in the US to restructure Pillsbury before returning to the UK as group managing director in early 1992. His period in the post has been marked by a quieter style of management than that which prevailed when GrandMet repositioned its portfolio of businesses in the late 1980s. Mr Bull, 57, more relaxed and urbane in manner, joined IDV in 1961, 11 years before it was taken over by GrandMet. A skilled marketer, he became chief executive of the division in 1984. He was closely involved in the acquisition of Heublein in the US three years later, and led the development of IDV into one of the world's largest drinks businesses. With established brands such as J&amp;B Scotch whisky and Smirnoff vodka and a reputation for new product development, IDV now contributes more than half the group's profits. In June last year, Mr Bull was switched across the group to head its food operations, where growth was being hit by trading conditions in the US. Sir Allen made a point then of stressing Mr Bull's international marketing skills - and by all accounts it was his marketing background and wider experience of international markets that swung the board's votes. Brand management and marketing are fundamental to GrandMet's business strategy. Its intention is to be an international drinks, food and retailing business. Its prospects of achieving that goal depend on its ability to position and grow its brands. Mr Bull said yesterday: 'I see it as my role to lead GrandMet closer to its markets, closer to its customers. That will be vital to its long-term growth.' His record at IDV reassures the City. 'IDV has been a powerhouse of profit growth and cash generation,' says Mr David Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson. That position now has to be defended, he says, as recession affects many of IDV's world markets. After Guinness's setbacks this week, the market has already begun to revise its forecasts of IDV's profits. However, IDV's market position, despite an over-dependence on the US and Europe, has been generating good organic growth, and it has recently made a number of acquisitions - such as Cinzano and Metaxa - that should buttress profits. The greater challenge for Mr Bull lies in the group's food operations. The acquisition of Pillsbury was a critical step in GrandMet's ambition to become a global branded food business. It gave the group a strong position in the US and a product range with potential for international development. The acquisition has provided reasonable returns; and the US operations are now recovering from the effects on Green Giant of depressed trading and a succession of harvests that produced a glut of vegetables. However, expansion of the Pillsbury food brands into Europe and the rest of the world has been more uncertain and slower than expected. In the global food industry, the group languishes at number 12 - well short of its ambitions. Two former Pillsbury brands - Haagen-Dazs ice-cream and Burger King - have gone from strength to strength. Burger King, once regarded as a potential disaster area, now outshines by far GrandMet's other retailing interests. The Pearle eye-care chain, now recovering after three years of losses, appears to fit no more comfortably into its strategy than do its UK pubs in the Chef &amp; Brewer chain and the Inntrepreneur joint venture. All three are expected to be sold as soon as possible. With debt of about Pounds 3bn, the group needs to accelerate cash generation if it is to support the growth of its brands with further acquisitions. No one will be more eager to promote such a policy than Mr David Nash, group finance director, who will now become chairman and chief executive of the food and international retailing operations.</p>

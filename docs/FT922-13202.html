			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Three-way contest for helicopter deal THE UK'S General Electric Company is set to confront British Aerospace and Westland in a Pounds 2bn contest to manage the supply of anti-tank attack helicopters for the British army. The three companies are expected to compete for selection as prime contractor, with each proposing a different foreign helicopter. GEC is believed to have been negotiating a pact with Bell Helicopter Textron of the US to put forward the latest version of the US manufacturer's SuperCobra helicopter as a surprise third British-led entry in the contest. BAe has already reached a preliminary agreement with the French-German Eurocopter consortium for the planned Tiger helicopter, with BAe poised to take the lead role in a UK contract. Eurocopter is a joint venture between France's state-controlled Aerospatiale and MBB, part of the Daimler-Benz group. Favourite for the contract, however, is the US AH-64 Apache, which Westland proposes to assemble in the UK under an agreement with the helicopter's manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas. Westland is Britain's only helicopter maker. Tenders were due to be formally invited this spring but the Ministry of Defence has put this off until October. The Conservative election victory is expected to reinforce the MoD's determination to hold a competition, in spite of pressure from army commanders to proceed with an early order for the Apache. GEC would not comment on the possibility of a joint bid with Bell. But Mr David Fletcher, managing director of its defence arm GEC-Marconi, has made no secret of the company's continuing ambitions to secure a foothold in the helicopter business. Last year, GEC failed in a joint bid with BAe to take responsibility for a Pounds 1.5bn contract to supply the EH101 Merlin anti-submarine helicopter to the Royal Navy. The helicopter is made by Westland in collaboration with Agusta of Italy, but GEC supplies a number of key systems. That contract was awarded to IBM, the US computer group, in association with Westland. Just emerging from an order slump, Westland initially tried to play a double game in the attack-helicopter contest by reaching collaboration agreements with both McDonnell Douglas and Eurocopter. But last year it let its option with the Franco-German group lapse. The MoD aims to receive bids next spring and place a contract in mid-1994.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Mar. 3 (YONHAP) -- Vice Unification Minister  Song Yong-tae, who represented the South at Thursday's  South-North contact at Panmunjom, said later in the day he could  not predict the prospects of future South-North talks.    "At the moment, I cannot be optimistic or pessimistic about  the future of the contact," Song said upon return to Seoul from  the truce village.    While explaining about the talks he just had with the North  before a group of reporters, Song said North Korea unreasonably  raised two new issues in addition to their oft-repeated demands  for the suspension of "nuclear war games" and the South's  renouncement of its international cooperative system over the  nuclear question.    The vice minister said it is ridiculous for North Korea to  dispute the issue of purely defensive Patriot missiles while  they themselves test-fired "Nodong-1" missiles.    President Kim Yong-sam's remarks which North Korea disputed  were a justifiable statement under the then circumstances.    "North Korea seems trying to engineer the projected exchange  of special envoys in a direction favorable to them while  delaying the talks on the strength of their new demands," he  said.    Song said that it seems at the moment North Korea is less  interested in the exchange of special envoys.    But, there may be a last-minute aboutface on the part of  North Korea as they are well aware that the third-round  U.S.-North Korea high-level talks could take place on March 21  only after special envoys were exchanged between the two Koreas,  Song said.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Russian submarine sale to N Korea to be probed Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday launched an investigation into allegations that a small Tokyo-based company had arranged the sale of 12 Russian attack submarines to North Korea, write Paul Abrahams in Tokyo and John Burton in Seoul. The ministry said the Japanese embassy in Moscow had asked the Russian government for an explanation of the sale. It has also approached a Tokyo-based group, understood to be Toen Trading Company, about the transaction. The Russian authorities had explained the submarines were obsolete, having been built in the 1960s, and were being sold as scrap, said the ministry. Russia said the contract for the 12 diesel-powered Foxtrot-class submarines required that Russian officials supervise dismantling of the vessels, which are being delivered without weapons or important core components. Only one submarine had so far been towed from the Russian Pacific Fleet's base in Vladivostok to North Korea, according to the Russians. There would be no legal problems for Toen if it had sold the submarines as scrap, but if not, the group could be prosecuted under the foreign exchange and foreign trade law, Miti said . South Korea expressed concern this week that Russia had broken a 1992 pledge not to supply military equipment to North Korea after Japanese newspapers reported that Pyongyang had purchased the decommissioned Russian submarines through a small Japanese trading house. Some analysts believe North Korea may try to cannibalise the submarines for spare parts to keep in service its fleet of 25 ageing Whiskey- and Romeo-class submarines, which are approaching the end of their operational life. But South Korea was told by the US military that there was only a slim chance that North Korea could recover parts for use in its other submarines. South Korea is worried that operational deployment of the submarines would negate its efforts to establish parity with the North's submarine fleet. South Korea's first submarine, a modern German-designed Type 209-class vessel, entered service last year.</p>

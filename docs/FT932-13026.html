			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / UK warns US against bilateral trade accords THE BRITISH government yesterday warned the Clinton administration in the US that it would endanger the future of the free trade system if it were to press for bilateral agreements to guarantee shares of foreign markets in specific products. Mr Neil Hamilton, UK trade minister, delivered the warning during a meeting in Tokyo with Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. They were in Tokyo at a meeting of trade and industry ministers from eastern Europe and the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries to plan assistance for industrial restructuring in eastern Europe. Mr Hamilton said he told Mr Brown the UK was opposed to 'the balkanisation of trade by bilateral agreements'. The minister added: 'It is clearly unhelpful to the Gatt world trade talks if countries as powerful as the US and Japan go off and negotiate bilateral agreements. It sets a very bad precedent which might encourage others to follow suit.' The British concerns were raised by recent statements from the US administration that it will seek trade agreements with Japan which would deliver measurable progress in opening Japanese markets. The US and Japan are due to finalise plans for a revised framework for their trade relations in talks over the next three months. The US is widely expected to press for agreements to deliver a specific share of the Japanese market in key products such as supercomputers. Mr Hamilton said: 'Mr Brown was at pains to say that the US was not seeking Y per cent of X market - if that is the US policy, we are happy to support such a view.' He said US irritation with the closed character of parts of the Japanese market was understandable, but should not lead to responses which would set bad precedents for the international trading system.</p>

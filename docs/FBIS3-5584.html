Built by the  Indonesian Army, it is home to 550 people who formerly carved  out a subsistence life in the mountains. The village is part of  the army's attempts to win the hearts and minds of the East  Timorese. It features electricity, safe drinking water, a  health centre, school, church, and satellite television, foreign  and local. But despite such efforts to upgrade their living  conditions, the East Timorese remain far from happy about  Indonesian rule.    "It will take a generation to integrate with Indonesia,"  says  Marcus Wanandi, an Indonesian Jesuit priest who heads East  Timor's largest school and the scion of a well-known Sumatera  family.    Indonesia's development spending in the province since it  took over in 1975 from Portugal has borne some fruit; literacy  has doubled from only 22 percent in 1980 to 44 percent in 1990.  From a low of 61 schools under Portuguese rule, there are now  more than 1,000. But 45 percent of the workforce are unemployed  or underemployed and skilled people must migrate to find jobs.  Much-needed investment from the rest of Indonesia is stymied by  the perceived security problem and from outside because of East  Timor's disputed status. The United Nations does not recognise  Indonesia's takeover of the territory in 1975 after Portugal,  the colonial power, left in a hurry.    An even more fundamental problem blocking both development  and successful integration into Indonesia is what the East  Timorese see as Indonesia's failure to understand East Timor's  culture. "Life for us did not begin in 1975," said Florentini  Sarmento, head of Dili's largest grassroots aid organisation.  "We have a different identity and a long history. East  Timorese feel deeply misunderstood and mistreated by Indonesia."    Bridging the cultural gap is not made any easier by the loss  of virtually the entire Timorese educated elite, now resident  overseas, mainly in Portugal and Australia. Senior Indonesians  from other areas may find it difficult to believe that the poor  who remain behind are anything more than an extremely backward  native ethnic group similar to the many others found in the  archipelago. [passage omitted]    There are now hints, however, that Indonesia is coming to a  realisation after almost 20 years that the approach used so far  in trying to integrate East Timor is not very successful. At  the same time, some formerly hardline Timorese an also willing  to explore ways of moving forward. The recent discovery of oil  offshore in the Timor Gap area could spur efforts to improve the  political climate as it holds out the promise of higher economic  growth. [passage omitted] But the development of East Timor will  need to take into account cultural differences far more than is  normal in Indonesia if it is to be successful. These need not,  however, be a barrier. Indeed, to a foreign tourist, Timor's  cultural differences would be seen a an asset, not a burden.    If the East Timorese were treated as a potential asset and  as  partners in their own development, it is far more likely that  they would appreciate Indonesia's efforts on their behalf. If  not, their cultural pride could create major problems for  Indonesia for some time to come.</p>

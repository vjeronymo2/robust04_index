			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Boost for hopes of US recovery HOPES of an early US economic recovery were boosted yesterday by an unexpected surge in the purchasing managers' index - a closely followed barometer of industrial health. The index rose 5 percentage points to 52.4 per cent, breaking above the 50 per cent level for the first time since November. Analysts had expected a reading of about 48 per cent. A level of 50 per cent or higher indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding. Last year gains in the purchasing managers' index correctly anticipated a strengthening of economic activity during the summer. The rise followed Friday's report that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter of last year, the third small quarterly gain. On Wall Street, the jump in the index was seen as reducing the chance of another cut in interest rates. Bond prices fell sharply on the announcement, depressing sentiment in the stockmarket. Mr Robert Bretz, for the National Association of Purchasing Management, said the economy had regained most of the momentum lost since last autumn. The index was below last September's peak of 54.3 per cent but stronger than early last summer, when the economy began to grow modestly. Most sub-components of the index showed sharp gains. The production index rose to 58.6 per cent compared with 50.6 per cent in January. The new orders index rose to 57.5 per cent compared with 50.3 per cent. The figures are based on a survey of managers at 300 companies. Separate figures showed a 1.3 per cent rise in construction spending in January, the first gain since October. The longer-term trend remained weak, with spending down 1 per cent on the same period last year. The Commerce Department said personal income fell 0.1 per cent in January, after rising sharply in December. In real terms, disposable income fell 0.2 per cent. Consumption spending was weak, rising 0.1 per cent in real terms in January after a 0.3 per cent gain the previous month. The weakness reflects a dive in consumer confidence to its lowest level for 17 years.</p>

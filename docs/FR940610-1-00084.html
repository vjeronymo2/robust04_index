			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This analysis shows that the impact of the school lunch proposed rule on the major commodity markets and related farm programs would be minimal. Commodity prices, producer marketings and receipts, and farm program outlays under any of the scenarios would not vary significantly from the levels projected in the USDA 10-year Baseline Projections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule's limited impact reflects several factors including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The share of commodities used in the school lunch program is typically quite small compared to total U.S. disappearance. Hence changes in school lunch offerings have to be very large before they affect the commercial market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For the first scenario, changes in school lunch menus were designed both to meet the nutritional guidelines and to minimize changes in children's food choices. While this was done to reflect children's taste/preference, it has a moderating effect on changes in the commodity composition of school lunches as well as a minimum change in food service offerings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The second and third scenarios demonstrate that there is considerable potential for substitutions within food groups (e.g., shifting from conventional to healthier products in the same food group) and for changing food preparation techniques to improve nutritional value (e.g., shifting from fried to roasted chicken). The modified menus took advantage of these options. Changes in food preparation techniques and use of healthier products in the same food group would minimize agricultural impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual commodity market impacts of scenarios one and two are described in greater detail below. These should be interpreted with the understanding that scenario three shows that it is possible to achieve the dietary, food cost and milk requirements with no change in commodity markets other than butter. The information presented reflects estimates of market impacts under full implementation of the proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Dairy Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The impacts of the proposed rule differ across the fluid milk, butter, and cheese components of the dairy sector. The modified menus hold milk offerings constant but reduce cheese and eliminate butter. Hence, the major impacts would be in the processed product markets rather than the fluid market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> School lunch use of butter is eliminated in the three scenarios; the modified menus would annually displace 50&hyph;55 million pounds of butter in a 1.0 billion pound U.S. market. The dairy program activity expected under the baseline projections would keep the impact of this decline on producer prices, incomes, and government farm programs minimal. Virtually all of the displaced butter is donated by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) from stocks acquired as part of its price support operations; purchases occur at the levels needed to support manufacturing milk prices at legislated levels and minimize stock holding. The school lunch volume is small enough compared to total CCC purchases and other disposal programs that the butter in question would continue to be acquired under the proposed rule but be donated to other institutions or sold concessionally or donated abroad. Hence, butter impacts would ultimately be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of the proposed rule on the cheese market could be more pronounced but still limited. This is because the volume differences in the use of cheese between the baseline and the scenarios one and two is larger and most of the cheese used in the school lunch program is bought on the open market rather than donated from CCC stocks. But the annual 80&hyph;90 million pound decline in cheese disappearance associated with these scenarios would account for less than a 1 percent drop in U.S. cheese disappearance. This would lower farm milk prices 7 to 8 cents per hundredweight causing a decline in production and lower farm revenues from milk by $150-$200 million annually (from a 1990&hyph;93 base of $19.5 billion). CCC dairy program costs would increase by an estimated $20 to $25 million annually. Hence, even for cheese, the impacts on the dairy sector and the budget would be relatively small. As scenario two demonstrates for chicken, a more pronounced shift towards use of lower fat cheese or other lower fat items in schools could further moderate these impacts. Under scenario 3 there would be no reduction in cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Meat Sector Impacts: Broilers and Turkeys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The impact of the proposed school lunch rule on the broiler market is expected to be modest under the first and second scenarios. Broiler offerings in the school lunch program would decline 120 million pounds under the first scenario and increase 38 million pounds under the second. The current school lunch use of 245 million pounds is a small share of the total U.S. market of 19.9 billion pounds. Hence, a 120 million pound reduction would lower broiler prices 1.8 percent and reduce farm revenues by 1.2 percent. The second scenario uses chicken as an example of how a large shift towards low-fat preparation (e.g., from fried to broiled) could moderate shifts in commodity usage. If purchases are increased by 38 million pounds as provided for under the second scenario, broiler prices would increase 0.4 percent and revenues rise by 0.2 percent. There are no direct government programs for the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of the proposed rule on the turkey market is expected to be modest under scenarios 1 and 2. Total use of turkey meat would decline 52 million pounds under one scenario and increase 16 million pounds under the other. The current school lunch use of 105 million pounds is a small share of the total U.S. market of 4.6 billion pounds. Hence, turkey prices would decrease 2 percent under the first scenario and increase 0.5 percent under the second. Producer revenues decrease by $36 million under the first scenario and increase $4 million under the second scenario_less than 0.01 percent in either case. There are no direct government programs for the turkey industry. Again, under scenario 3 there would be no change in either broilers or turkey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Meat Sector Impacts: Beef and Pork  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The impact of the proposed rule on the beef market is expected to be minimal under the first and second scenarios. School lunch offerings of beef would decline 100&hyph;126 million pounds from 485 million pounds currently, in a total U.S. market of 24 billion pounds. This school lunch decline would reduce the farm level market price for beef by less than 1 percent and result in a 0.5 percent reduction in beef producers' revenues. A slightly larger reduction (126 million pounds) in beef offerings under the second scenario would result in approximately the same reduction in wholesale beef prices and farm revenues. There are no direct government programs related to the beef industry; hence, the changes likely under the proposed rule have no direct federal budget implications. As scenario two demonstrates for chicken, a more pronounced shift towards the use of lower-fat beef, lower-fat beef preparation, or other lower-fat items in schools could further moderate impacts. Under scenario 3 there would be no impact at all.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

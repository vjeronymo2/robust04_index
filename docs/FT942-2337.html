			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: In banks' interests not to offer dual role to accountants Sir, I read with interest Mr John Jackson's letter 'Concerned by banking practice' (June 16). This bank has for some time pursued a policy of not appointing investigating accountants as receivers if, as a result of their investigation, they recommend receivership. This has certainly reassured customers that the accountancy investigation is in their best interest, and has led to a reduction in the number of recommendations to pursue this course. It is not always possible to do this because, for example, there are occasions when we are part of a lending syndicate, but in almost every case we do divide the roles with only a tiny number of exceptions. Our intention is to appoint a receiver only if there is no alternative course of action, and this is supported by the reduction in the number of receivers which we have appointed, down to 150 during 1993 compared with 420 in 1992. I support Mr Jackson's suggestion that the Institute of Chartered Accountants should consider its policy on this matter.

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UN human rights 'sham' THE HEAD of Amnesty International said yesterday that the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights had been a flop and called the first half of the meeting 'a week of shame', Reuter reports from Vienna. 'This is a total flop, a sham and a week of shame,' said Mr Pierre Sane of Senegal, the secretary general of the London-based human rights organisation. 'While delegates were talking people were being killed, tortured, executed or threatened all over the world.' Mr Sane's assessment was disputed by many official delegates at the conference of more than 160 UN member states.</p>

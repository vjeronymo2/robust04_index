			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today launched an  outspoken attack on America's refusal to give full support to  plans to boost United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia.    In a speech in New York, he said Britain could not  understand  why the United States did not back plans to send an extra 8,250  troops and instead approved an increase of just 3,500.    "We must not put ourselves in the situation where we lack  the  tools to carry out the job," he told the Carnegie Council for  Ethics and International Affairs.    He urged the United States to back the full increase when  the  proposal returned to the UN Security Council and "to throw their  full weight behind the peace process."    Mr Rifkind will intensify his campaign when he meets U.S.  Defence Secretary William Perry in Washington tomorrow. He will  attempt to persuade him to support the full deployments of extra  peacekeepers and to send American ground troops for the first  time.    Britain believes a substantial U.S. force of ground troops  is  vital if peace is to be restored successfully across Bosnia.    In his speech, Mr Rifkind made clear that the UN would  maintain its impartiality in Bosnia. He said air strikes could  be launched against any of the warring factions if they were  putting UN forces under threat and if a request for air support  came from the UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose.  But he warned it was important to weigh up the consequences of  future air strikes.    "We must think where this kind of activity is likely to lead  us and be prepared to manage our future responses so that we get  where we want to go," he said.</p>

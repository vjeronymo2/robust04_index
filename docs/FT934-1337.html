			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Employers upbeat on jobs Employers, particularly in the building industry, are more optimistic about job creation than at any time since the first quarter of 1990, the Manpower survey of employment prospects for the first quarter of 1994 shows. The optimism of the first employment survey since the Budget - based on responses from 2,000 employers - is at odds with continuing employee pessimism about redundancy. The survey shows 18 per cent of employers forecasting job increases and 21 per cent job losses, producing a net balance of minus three. That result is significantly more optimistic than the balance of minus 16 in the first quarter of this year. Southern England and London appear to be experiencing the biggest turnaround. In the first quarter of this year London had a negative balance of minus 19, which is far worse than the national average, but it is now on the national average at minus three. The south is forecasting a positive balance of 11 compared with a negative balance of 12 for the first quarter of 1993, a swing of 23 percentage points. Nine of 12 regions continue to be pessimistic, with north-west England one of the most pessimistic on minus 20. Manufacturing had a balance of plus five. The service sector has seen a decline in confidence compared with the last quarter of last year and stands at minus 8. The public sector is the most pessimistic on minus 12. Banking has recovered to a negative balance of minus 4 compared with minus 36 for the first quarter of this year but energy and water remain job-shedders with a negative balance of minus 24. The most optimistic sector is private building, with a positive balance of 20.</p>

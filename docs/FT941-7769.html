			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: AIB turns in IPounds 196m after IPounds 97m charge Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's main clearing bank, reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 195.9m (Pounds 188m) for 1993, compared with a restated IPounds 175.8m for the nine months to the end of 1992. This was after an exceptional charge of IPounds 96.7m representing the present value of AIB's ongoing liabilities of IPounds 14.3m per annum, relating to the collapse of insurance subsidiary Icarom, in 1985. In previous years, this has been included as an annual charge, but as the legal disputes were finally settled last year, the group has now decided to incorporate the liability as an exceptional charge. The main sources of profit growth were a reduction in bad debt provisions to IPounds 134.6m (1.1 per cent of the loan book), an increase to IPounds 410m in income from non-core activities such as mortgage lending, life assurance, securities trading and activities in its capital markets divisions, and a strong contribution of IPounds 115.5m from the group's US subsidiary. Two-thirds of the pre-tax profits are now earned outside Ireland. Net interest income on the group's core banking activities grew by 6.9 per cent to IPounds 829.6m, which is equivalent to a 3.4 per cent increase on a constant currency basis. The group's UK operations returned to profit in 1993 and in Ireland core deposits grew 19 per cent. Loan demand however fell in all markets. There was a small improvement in net interest margins. Reported earnings per share were 20.2p, but when adjusted for items from continuing operations amounted to 26.8p. A final dividend of 5.65p is recommended, for a total of 9.75p, an increase of 12.1 per cent on 1992 on an annualised basis. Before the exceptional item, this gives a dividend cover of 2.7. COMMENT The substantial drop in interest rates and an improving economic outlook in all of AIB's markets provides a sound basis for continuing improvement in 1994. The group has finally turned around its loss-making UK division, and the strong performance of the US subsidiary points to future expansion overseas. Having finally cleared up the financial consequences of its disastrous foray into the insurance market in the 1980s, and taken an exceptional charge now to cover future liabilities, the group's accounts can now show a clearer picture of underlying performance. Market analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits for 1994 of about IPounds 340m, earnings of 29.6p and dividend growth of 10 per cent.</p>

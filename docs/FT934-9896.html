			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Chile overshoots inflation target THE CHILEAN government has strongly denied suggestions that it is losing the battle against inflation after a 2.6 per cent jump in prices last month, the biggest in two years. The sharp rise - dubbed the 'pumpkin' because of the Finance Ministry's insistence that seasonal factors, such as high prices for certain fruit and vegetables, are to blame - brings accumulated inflation for the first 10 months to 11.9 per cent. The government is now certain to overshoot its revised 1993 inflation target of 12 per cent. Its original intention was to bring the rate down to 11 per cent from 12.7 per cent last year. Its failure to smother inflation in 1993 also raises questions about next year's target of 10 per cent. Mr Roberto Zahler, governor of the independent central bank, called October's rise 'unsatisfactory' and urged the government to moderate public spending. In particular he criticised the 15 per cent pay rise to 450,000 public sector workers. Mr Jose Pablo Arellano, budget director, rejected the governor's arguments. All government spending, including the public sector pay rise, had been fully financed from existing resources, he said.</p>

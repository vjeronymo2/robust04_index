			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] French Ambassador Jean-Francois Lionnet stated last  night on national television that France is not backing the  Tuareg rebellion in Niger. He dismissed widespread allegations  in Niger that France was supporting the Tuareg rebellion and  stressed that there were no specific facts to substantiate the  accusations, which he described as inconsistent. He explained  that France has only assumed a mediation role in this matter.  France has always condemned and will continue to condemn the  deadly attacks perpetrated by the rebels, the French envoy  added, and concluded that France will assist Niger during these  trying times.</p>

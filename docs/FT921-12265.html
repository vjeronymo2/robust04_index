			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chemicals group puts its house in order - A look at plans to restructure Akzo into a more cohesive unit MR Aarnout Loudon, the chairman of Akzo, has embarked this month on the final and probably the most radical phase of his five-year-old mission to foster greater unity at the Dutch chemicals group. In many ways, his plan for a 'drastic' reorganisation of Akzo's structure, unveiled in a message to staff on January 8, also marks the effective completion of the merger which created the company 23 years ago. As part of the reorganisation, scheduled to be completed by the end of May 1993, Akzo is to scrap the layer of management which separates its headquarters in Arnhem from its 40 business units. The company, which had turnover of Fl 17.25bn (Dollars 9.6bn) and net profit before extraordinary items of Fl 716m in 1990, is active in fields ranging from fibres, coatings and pharmaceuticals to speciality chemicals, basic chemicals and salt. The restructuring will be accomplished by merging Akzo's headquarters staff with the staff of its five divisions. The divisions will then be eliminated, ensuring that the company's 40 business units, to be grouped in four new product-group 'clusters' - chemicals, fibres, coatings and pharmaceuticals - will report directly to a revamped management board. Up to 1,000 jobs could be affected by the decision to move divisional staff from around the Netherlands and neighbouring Germany to Arnhem. The reshuffle comes on top of thousands of job losses resulting from Akzo's continuing cost-cutting programme, particularly in its fibre businesses. The company has a total workforce of 64,000. Mr Loudon, 55, who joined Akzo in 1969, the year of the merger, and later became its chairman in 1982, said the company's existing structure had proved to be inefficient. 'It led to communication lines which were far too long, to the risk of misunderstandings, and to the slow execution of decisions,' he said. Until 1987, Akzo was a loose federation of independent-minded divisions, a legacy of the merger which brought together AKU, an international, Dutch-based fibres group, and KZO, a wide-ranging domestic chemicals, pharmaceuticals and salt concern. Soon after the merger, Akzo was plunged into the fibres crisis of the 1970s, preventing the newly-formed group from coming to grips with the inefficiencies of its corporate structure. Then, under Mr Loudon in the early to mid-1980s, Akzo made a series of big acquisitions, many of them in the US, leaving little time for internal matters. Since 1987, however, Akzo has tried to concentrate foremost on putting its own house in order. An internal and external 'corporate identity' campaign was launched, an exercise which included the fashioning of a new logo - a stylised figure of a man holding his arms outstretched above the company's name. Once-proud names of group subsidiaries, such as Enka in the field of fibres and Sikkens in paints, were replaced by the Akzo name as part of efforts to create a single corporate culture. Mr Loudon said his latest reorganisation, which follows the decision in 1989 to introduce dozens of business units within the divisions, is bound to enhance profitability at Akzo, though he said it was impossible to quantify the improvement in terms of bottom-line results. He denied that the organisational shake-up was a response to a downturn in Akzo's results in 1990 and 1991. 'Our motivation is the desire to shorten the lines of communication with our business units and is entirely unrelated to developments in the chemicals industry in 1991,' he said. Figures for 1991 are scheduled to be released on February 26. Mr Loudon's speech to staff was well-received on the Amsterdam bourse, where Akzo's shares have risen by nearly 8.5 per cent since January 8 to around Fl 138.00, outstripping the market's gain of roughly 6 per cent over the same period. The buoyancy of Akzo's shares is partly the result of expectations that the company stands to benefit from an upturn in the US economy and a firmer dollar. Another factor, however, was Mr Loudon's simultaneous announcement that Akzo planned to divest more of its weakest operations and that it might seek partnerships for some other activities which have reasonably strong, or potentially strong, market positions. Akzo has said an analysis of its weaknesses and strengths showed that its strongest business units, such as pharmaceuticals and chlor-alkali products, generated 80 per cent of operating profit on just 45 per cent of turnover. The middle range of activities, encompassing industrial fibres, among others, accounted for 25 per cent of operating profit and 40 per cent of turnover. However, the weakest of Akzo's businesses, accounting for 15 per cent of turnover, were persistently loss-making on balance. So far, Mr Loudon said, half of this category had already been removed from Akzo's books, through plant closures, outright divestments - such as the sale of the group's majority stake in Spanish fibre company La Seda de Barcelona - or through an exchange of assets with fellow Dutch chemicals group DSM. In mid-1991, Akzo agreed to swap its engineering plastics activities for DSM's powder coatings business. Since late 1989, Akzo has pursued a more restrained acquisitions policy compared with the mid-1980s, and this will continue. 'But, of course, things are never black-and -white, for either a company or for a person,' Mr Loudon said. 'If a strategic acquisition comes our way, we will look at it very seriously.' Recent examples of strategic takeovers are Akzo's purchase of a US tyre yarn plant from Goodyear and its acquisition of Macpherson, a leading UK paint manufacturer. On the whole, however, Akzo's attention for the next couple of years will clearly be focused not on takeovers but on reshaping its internal structure, a project which is likely to be Akzo's last big overhaul for the rest of the 1990s. The reorganisation will also be Mr Loudon's last. Due to retire by 1998, he has made clear that he will probably leave earlier, but not before Akzo has finally been reshaped into a more cohesive unit.</p>

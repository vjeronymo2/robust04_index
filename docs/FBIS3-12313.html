			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By an unidentified JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Nearly 4,000 people marched through the heart  of Amman Sunday [27 February] rejecting the 28-month-old Middle  East peace process and calling for the downfall of Palestine  Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.    The peaceful protest was called to express condemnation of  Friday's massacre of more than 60 Palestinians by one or more  Jewish settlers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Israeli-occupied  West Bank town of Hebron.    But it turned to a highly politicised event to register what  Islamist and leftist politicians as well as union leaders  asserted was a popular rejection of any negotiated peace with  Israel.    "No to peace, yes to holy war," shouted the protesters, who  began their march from the central bus station at al-'Abdali and  dispersed at the al-Hashimiyah square in downtown Amman after  brief speeches by leaders of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) and  leftist organisations as well as heads of professional  associations.    The speakers severely assailed Mr. 'Arafat and his  peacemaking strategy with Israel and demanded that all Arab  parties, including Jordan and the PLO, withdraw immediately from  the peace talks.    Police kept a tight watch over the marchers, who included  around 200 veiled women, but did not interfere. No violent  incidents were reported.    Banners wielded by the protesters, some of them masked and  others holding aloft the Holy Koran, denounced the massacre and  said: "No to surrender, no to negotiations," "Revenge,  revenge," "armed struggle is our only choice," and "no for  self-rule."    The marchers condemned Mr. 'Arafat for accepting the Sept.  13  autonomy agreement with Israel and demanded that he be ousted  from the chairmanship of the PLO.    "Yes to the PLO, no to 'Arafat," said the protesters.    Addressing the PLO chairman, they chanted: "Your day of  judgement is coming."    It was the latest rally to be held in Amman following the  Hebron massacre, and was higher in political intensity than any  other demonstration held since Friday, save another hardline  protest march held in the al-Baq'ah camp Saturday.    Earlier Sunday, a group of about 150 school students marched  through the Jabal al-Husayn refugee camp to condemn the mosque  massacre and vowing revenge.    The centrist al-Mustaqbal party, led by Sulayman 'Arar,  issued a statement on Sunday describing the Hebron killings as  "a Ramadan gift by the Zionists to the Muslim and Arab people."    The massacre should serve as a reminder to those who are  engaged in peace talks with Israel that "there cannot be peace  and security in the region as the racist state (Israel) exists  among them."    "Retribution in kind, not condemnation and statements, is  the  answer to this crime and other crimes committed by the Zionists  against the Palestinians and Arabs... starting with (the 1948)  Dayr Yasin massacre and (the 1982 killings at) Sabra and  Shatilla and the (1968) burning of al-Aqsa Mosque," said the  statement.    Jordan is observing a three-day national mourning that ends  Tuesday for the victims of the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque  and the government is also raising funds to help the families of  those killed and wounded in the attack.</p>

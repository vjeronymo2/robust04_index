			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Leo Wieland: "Clinton's First Apprentice </F> Year"]    [Text] New bumperstickers can be seen in the United States  marking the anniversary of Clinton's first year in office. They  read: "Don't blame me -- I voted for Bush." However, this  criticism is not representative. Most Americans do not regret  the change. This applies both to those 43 percent who voted for  Clinton and to some who prefered Bush or Perot. On his first  anniversary, opinion pollsters affirm to the President, whose  popularity dropped to an unprecedented low for newcomers in the  middle of last year, that some 60 percent are now satisfied  again with his performance. It was the same percentage that had  expressed their advance confidence when Clinton first took  office.    That Clinton is seen as a man on whom people can pin their  hopes has something to do with his personality. His engaging  manners blend with the stylistic elements of a Kennedy and the  communicative talent of a Reagan. At home, he is seen as a  pragmatic worker who is ready to make compromises. Abroad, he  is self-assured and presentable, which could be seen in his  recent trip to Europe. One can hardly criticize anything about  the form; if anything, one can find fault with the political  substance, which sometimes appears to be lacking body. Clinton,  who presented his administration as a clean prototype of a "new  ethic," is nevertheless being followed like a shadow by the  "question of character." The damage caused by old stories of  women and business deals in Arkansas is still limited. The  voters, who had heard about it, gave him a kind of absolution in  the polls in November 1992. If the "revelations" that are still  to be expected remain confined to his term as governor -- and do  not extend to his time in the White House -- he will probably  get out of it without much harm. However, since in the view of  the U.S. media, presidents do not have a private life and have a  transparent past, Clinton has to be watchful regarding  everything that might look like an attempt to cover something up.    The slow, albeit meanwhile recognizable, upswing is  Clinton's  most valuable political asset. Strictly speaking, the recovery  may have more to do with Bush's careful laissez-faire and the  responsible and flexible attitude of the U.S. Treasury than with  Clinton. Still, he is profiting from it. Inflation and  interest rates are low. Unemployment has decreased to 6.4  percent. In the last quarter of 1993, the growth rate was over  5 percent. The industry and the consumers are optimistic. Only  national debts and the budget deficit remain at such a high  level that any increase in funds has to be ruled out both for  domestic policy programs and foreign aid.    However, as an "activistic" government head, Clinton is  exposed to this very temptation. In sharp contrast to the  eighties, when Reagan, a Republican, denounced a costly,  overinflated bureaucracy as "part of the problem but not of the  solution," Democrat Clinton personifies the belief in the "good  administration." His course corrections range from tax to  family policy. They include courageous laws (firearms control,  social work for scholarships) and controversial initiatives  (admitting homosexuals into the Army, abortion at public  expense). Yet, the three most ambitious projects -- health,  welfare, and education reform -- are emerging only gradually.  At the same time, doubts are rising whether these projects can  be financed, particularly as far as the promised national health  insurance is concerned.    In foreign policy, Clinton can, at best, present a mixed  balance. Here his first year often was an irritating tightrope  walk between realpolitik and appeasement. Hesitation in the  face of conflicts and the tendency to pursue the path of least  resistance manifested themselves in many ways: in Bosnia,  Somalia, and Haiti, NATO turning down the Central Europeans out  of consideration for Russia, and the treatment of the "nuclear  communists" in North Korea. Empty threats and the obvious  resolution not to interfere in alien conflicts cannot have won  him much respect from despots of the likes of Milosevic or  Cedras.    On the credit side, Clinton can point to achievements in the  one sphere he is interested in and that affects the U.S. pocket:  foreign trade. Here, the acronyms NAFTA (North American Free  Trade Association), GATT, and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic  Cooperation) stand for his most impressive success. In the  Middle East, however, where the superpower sees its "vital  interests" affected because of Israel and the oil reserves,  Clinton's mediating activities -- from the handshake with  'Arafat to his meeting with Al-Asad -- are proof of a  respectable commitment.    The lessons Clinton learned from his first 12 months include  the understanding that he can in no way keep out of foreign  affairs, and, like a "laser beam," focus exclusively on national  economy. Despite credible assertions of partnership, neither his  leadership power nor his determination to lead have so far been  sufficiently tested. In an unusual way, Clinton has turned out  to be a new generation American. More than all of his  predecessors since World War II, he has no problem with leaving  Europe and other faraway regions more to themselves.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Deal primes village for a moving experience INHABITANTS of Arkwright village in Derbyshire have moved closer to a new future, with different homes, following the award by British Coal of a Pounds 60m opencast mining contract. The corporation plans to use some of the money it will make from the coal, to be mined at a nearby site under contract by RJB Mining, to relocate the 300 residents to a new village a quarter of a mile from the existing one. Villagers will exchange their back-to-back houses in the traditional mining village for new homes with market values of up to Pounds 60,000. British Coal will also provide community centre facilities. The rebuilding of Arkwright follows occasional escapes of methane gas from the nearby disused drift mine. At times residents have been forced to leave their homes. RJB Mining expects to recover about 3.5m tonnes of coal from the site near Staveley. The contract, the company's tenth for British Coal for an opencast mine, will run for nine years. The company said the contract would utilise equipment at present used in a contract at Tinsley, South Yorkshire. RJB added that when it had finished the extraction of coal it would restore the land for agricultural use.</p>

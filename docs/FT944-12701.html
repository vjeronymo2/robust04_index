			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Inflation fears boost rate rise expectation Further signs of UK inflationary pressures increased speculation yesterday that Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will argue for a base rate rise when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, tomorrow. Expectations of a rate rise helped sterling climb against the dollar and the D-Mark, with the pound reaching its highest level, on a trade-weighted basis, since the beginning of March. Two economic indicators published yesterday - the narrow measure of money supply (M0) and the purchasing managers' index - led to increased concern about inflation. M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 7.3 per cent in the 12 months to October, its fastest annual rate since January 1989, while a survey of purchasing managers found 50.4 per cent paid higher prices for their manufacturing purchases in October. Developments in both measures have been cited by the Bank of England as cause for concern. In the minutes of the September 7 meeting between Mr George and Mr Clark, which decided to increase base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent, Mr George cited the purchasing managers survey as an argument for increasing rates. The prices component of the purchasing managers' index rose in October. M0's growth rate has stayed above the government's monitoring range of 0-4 per cent. In its August inflation report, the Bank of England noted that 'if M0 growth remains at its present rate throughout the rest of the year, concerns over future inflation would increase'. M0 growth has accelerated from the 6.5 per cent level cited by that report. However, Mr George has argued recently that bond markets are overestimating the potential for a rise in inflation. 'There are relatively few immediate signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly,' he said last week. The bank's latest inflation report will be published today.

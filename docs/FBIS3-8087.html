			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Franjo Tudjman on the </F> Washington agreement between Croats and Muslims in Zagreb on 3  March -- live or recorded]    [Text] To Croatian people at  home and abroad, to all citizens of Croatia: The day before  yesterday, 1 March, a preliminary agreement was signed in  Washington between representatives of the Croat and the Bosnian  Muslim people regarding the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina  along federal lines -- as a community of inherently sovereign  people in the Federal Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina and on its  entering a coalition with Croatia. Given its content and the  circumstances in which it was created, this agreement is of  far-reaching and also crucial and historical importance. The  agreement was reached under the aegis of the United States and  with the consent of leading European countries. For this  reason, this agreement first of all means a radical change in  their attitude to the settlement of the crisis on former  Yugoslav soil.    The most important international factors -- led by the  United  States -- have finally come to the conclusion that one has to  take resolute steps in order to end the three-year crisis, which  began with the aggression of the Yugo-communist army and Serbia  against Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and end the  war in Bosnia which has caused one of the biggest tragedies of  our time and is threatening to spread the catastrophe of war  worldwide.    These were and still are the reasons for which the state  policy of democratic Croatia will stand by its orientation  toward achieving and protecting vital national interests in  accordance with international circumstances.    By adhering to principles and through our consistent policy  in this respect, Croatia gradually gained favor with those who  were not partial to its sovereignty and independent policy and  finally obtained full guarantees from the most responsible  international factors for the security of its state and the  future of the Croatian people.    Croatia increasingly won the trust of the world democratic  public and responsible statesmen starting with a recommendation  that the Croatian people should take part in a referendum for  the retention of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the urgent establishment of  diplomatic relations with the government in Sarajevo, and the  urging and accepting of proposals for the settlement of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina along cantonal, provincial and  finally confederal lines in the form of a union of republics.  This was rejected both by the Serb and the Muslim sides until  the agreement was signed in Washington.    The implementation of the agreement signed in Washington by  Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic,  Prime Minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina Haris Silajdzic, and  Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council of the  Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, is in the interest of the  Croatian and Bosnian Muslim nations, as well as the  international community.    An end to the war between the Muslim and Croat nations in  Bosnia is of paramount importance for us. That conflict has  caused great loss in human life and material destruction to the  Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and brings the threat of  international sanctions upon Croatia because of the assistance  lent to them [Bosnian Croats], first in the defense against the  Serb aggression, and then in their struggle against the threat  of the Muslim extremist forces.    The agreement between the Croatian and Muslim sides also  sets  conditions for reaching an agreement with the Serb side and for  defining borders acceptable to all three nations within Bosnia-  Herzegovina. However, international factors must persist in  seeking a sensible overall solution in order to create  preconditions for normal neighborly relations between the new  Croatian-Bosnian confederal union on the one side and Serbia,  that is, Yugoslavia on the other side; all the more so because  this [agreement] determines a new long-term fault-line between  international powers which have for centuries been opposing and  fighting each other in this critical region of different  civilizations.    All national and political entities which are in any way  participating in solving the extremely complex Bosnian problem  should -- in the interests of European and global peace -- do  everything they can in order to reach an accord between the  three warring nations and their mother-countries, but also with  the main world factors -- the United Nations, the European  Union, the United States, and the Russian Federation, in order  to create preconditions for the stability of a new international  order in this part of Europe, precisely because its birth has  caused unimaginable war atrocities and threats of conflict  between civilizations.    The implementation of the Washington agreement will secure  the survival and future of the Croat people not only within the  borders of the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna, established in  the war of defense, but throughout the territory of Bosnia,  which will not be allocated to the separate Serb Republic.  Furthermore, the agreement guarantees Croats full national  sovereignty in the Croat cantons -- probably to be called  grand-counties [velezupe] in Croatian -- which will form a Croat  council as a separate representative body of the Croat  community, as well as full parity and complete equality in  overall state affairs of the Federal Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    All of this will have additional guarantees in the  recognition of dual citizenship, i.e., Croatian citizenship  too, for every member of the Croatian people from Bosnia as well  as in the confederal union between Croatia and the Federal  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This confederal union will be  based on shared interests in developing comprehensive relations  in all spheres, particularly in international and defense  policies, the economy, science, and culture.    The establishment of a joint command of defense forces is  envisaged, as well as a customs and monetary union within the  framework of a common market. A permanent confederal council  [konfederalno vijece] will be formed with a view to coordinating  joint policy and activity.    The materialization of the envisaged federation between the  Croatian and the Bosnian Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  its confederation with Croatia implies creating needed  political, constitutional, and legal foundations.    The Croats ought to understand that such a solution is  historically necessary and purposeful for the survival of  Croatiandom in Bosnia and the protection of the Croatian state's  strategic interests. The alliance with the Croats secures the  survival of the Bosnian Muslims in these lands, as well as links  with western civilization and democratic countries.    The effective implementation of the agreement on both unions  [federation and confederation], something that is in the vital  interest of both peoples as well as of the democratic Western  world, can only be opposed by advocates of narrow-minded  nationalism and extremist-fundamentalist views.    Unlike such exceptions, the vast majority of Croats and  Bosnians -- not just those Muslims who have hitherto declared  themselves as Croats -- will wholeheartedly start building the  shared future.    Referring to all the above, I find it necessary to emphasize  that the Croatian-Bosnian-Muslim union is not aimed against the  Serbs. Nor is it being created in order to continue the war. It  is being created to secure peace without delay.    Croatia will remain committed to peaceful, political  solutions to all contested issues, including the normalization  of Serbian- Croatian relations on the basis of mutual  recognition, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. In order  to achieve this, Serbia and Yugoslavia ought to stop supporting  the further occupation of Croatian territories by arming  [Krajina], introducing a shared currency, and suchlike.    It is high time for Krajina's Serbs to draw their  conclusions  about the futility of continuing their resistance to being  integrated into Croatia's constitutional and legal order,  because their further out-maneuverings of UN Security Council  resolutions will no longer be tolerated either from the point of  view of Croatian interests or from the point of view of  international interests.    Croatia guarantees to them all human, civil and ethnic  rights, but it cannot tolerate any delay in the return of its  refugees, the reintegration of its state territory, and the  establishment of normal conditions for its further economic and  cultural development.    Dear Croats at home and abroad, the citizens of Croatia, by  signing the agreement in Washington, we took a big step along  the difficult path to secure the future of the Croatian nation,  and the stability and prosperity of the Croatian state. On our  part, we will do everything to complete the agreement as soon as  possible in the constitutional and legal sense, and to implement  it.    During the talks which our foreign minister and I personally  held with representatives of many foreign countries -- and on  the day the agreement was signed even with U.S. President  Clinton -- we received assurances from the most senior statesmen  and world factors that Croatia would be given support in solving  all its vital and burning problems. Everyone promised us  diverse and resolute assistance in the process of integrating  the areas under the protection of the peace forces into the  overall life in Croatia. We were promised assistance for  reconstruction. World and all international financial  institutions will be free to offer us loans and to finance  various economic investment programs, which have so far been  denied to us. The door to European integration will be opened  to us, as well as admission into NATO's Partnership for Peace  protection system.    All this confirms that major international factors today  consider Croatia an important, even one of the crucial, elements  for establishing peace and international order in this part of  Europe. All this leads us to believe that we have come close to  the ending of the war and the beginning of a new period in the  building of the sovereign democratic state of Croatia.    The new conditions will allow us to dedicate all our  potential to the economic recovery and cultural development of  our homeland. The preliminary Washington agreement has  therefore created preconditions for a political solution to the  crisis, for an end to the destruction of war, killing and  persecution of people, and for their return to normal life.  Briefly, it heralds peace.    All this confirms the correctness and usefulness of our  consistent state policy, the paramount goal of which has always  been to secure the freedom of the Croatian people and the  sovereignty of Croatia with as few victims as possible. We have  strengthened the democratic system and international standing of  the Croatian state guided by our own judgment, maturity and  support of the vast majority of the Croatian people and all  citizens of Croatia. We can be proud of the results we have  achieved and new possibilities which have opened up for us, but  we should also be aware of the responsibilities and the  seriousness of the tasks ahead of us in new, more favorable  international conditions.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: TWA presents plan to emerge from bankruptcy TRANS World Airlines (TWA), the bankrupt and debt-laden US carrier, yesterday presented its long-awaited reorganisation plan, in which it informed a Delaware court it hoped to emerge from bankruptcy this spring. The plan - presented jointly by the airline and the official unsecured creditors' committee - provides for the elimination of about Dollars 4bn in total claims against TWA. It also calls for the distribution of new TWA common and preferred stock to the airline's creditors and employees and the issuance of new debt securities. Under the plan TWA's creditors would receive cash and new debt and equity securities. TWA employees would end up owning 45 per cent of the common stock of the reorganised airline; the employees have agreed about Dollars 660m of wage and benefit cuts over a three-year period. The remaining 55 per cent of common stock, as well as 100 per cent of preferred stock and new debt securities, would be distributed to various unsecured creditors. Mr Glenn Zander and Mr Robin Wilson, TWA's co-chief executives, said the new plan set the stage for the airline to emerge from bankruptcy ahead of the peak summer travel season. They claimed it established the framework of a sound debt and capital structure under which TWA could return to profitability. Mr Charles MacDonald, chairman of the creditors' committee, called the plan 'a watershed event' and said that while negotiations would continue the filing of the plan meant the major elements had now won general acceptance. The next step is expected to be a court hearing on TWA's statement, to be held soon. The plan cannot become effective without further bankruptcy court proceedings and acceptance by TWA creditors. The plan's strategy includes shrinking TWA operations to eliminate unprofitable routes and reconfiguring the aircraft fleet; using a lower cost structure based on renegotiated aircraft leases and cutting wages and benefits by 15 per cent.</p>

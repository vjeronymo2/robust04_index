			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Revived convertible gilt faces the acid test - Capital &amp; Credit On Wednesday, the Bank of England will auction a new convertible government bond, the first since 1987. The revival of this special breed of gilt has proved to be controversial. Welcomed by some, it has had a frosty reception from others, who are frustrated by what they see as the government's persistent refusal to turn to conventional long-dated gilts for its funding needs. A convertible gilt is a short-dated bond which can be exchanged for a specified long-dated gilt at a fixed price some time in the future. The conversion dates occur at six-monthly intervals and the terms worsen slightly at each date. The convertible gilts auctioned by the Bank of England on Wednesday, worth a total of Pounds 2bn, will have a coupon of 7.0 per cent, coming to maturity in August 1997. Investors will be able to convert it into 9.0 per cent 2012 bonds, for the first time on August 6. The attraction of such an investment vehicle for lenders is that it allows them to participate in more than one area of the gilt market. It therefore provides a useful hedge when yields, particularly at the long end, are volatile. If, for example, yields fall, then investors may exercise their option of converting to the longer bond and so benefit from the rising market; if on the other hand yields rise, they will be protected by only being exposed to the fall in value of the short-dated bond. This special property of the new gilt may be particularly attractive to investors now, given the recent financial market turbulence. Institutions may be worried about committing themselves to long gilts but are also afraid of missing out if bond markets do recover sharply once the threat of further rises in US interest rates has receded. The appeal for the borrower, in this case the government, is that it does not have to commit itself to the high yields currently being seen on long-dated gilts. Issuing a bond at such yields would cost the government more in terms of interest payments than a short-dated gilt. Bond markets have been extremely volatile since February, when the US Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in a pre-emptive strike on inflation. Investors took fright, sensing a turning point in world rates, and bond prices plummeted. The UK market has been one of the worst affected: gilts yields have climbed 1 1/2 percentage points since February. But the Bank of England believes the bond market reaction has been exaggerated. It is much more optimistic about inflation and prefers to wait until long-term yields come down before issuing long-dated gilts. Some investors, however, doubt whether funding at the short-end still has many advantages over selling long-dated bonds and they think such a policy may in fact be damaging to the government's funding programme. 'The Bank's policy is distorting the yield curve,' according to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at American bank Salomon Brothers. Analysts complain that yields on short-dated gilts have been pushed up so much and the yield curve has flattened to such an extent under the sheer weight of the Bank's own funding that it is no longer making any clear cost savings by issuing short-dated rather than long-dated bonds. They also say that the Bank's policy adds to the uncertainty that an investor faces, which acts as a deterrent at the margin. 'Investors already have to predict inflation and interest rates. If on top of that they have to guess funding policy as well, they may just go and buy French bonds,' said Mr Saunders. Last year banks, building societies and overseas investors were keen to buy short-dated gilts. But this year many of them have turned to fixed-rate mortgages, which in terms of exposure to long-term interest rates are similar to a short-dated bond. Yet despite the decline in demand, the Bank has persisted with its tactic of funding at the short end. Gilts, analysts say, are falling into a vacuum. But officials say this type of funding suits the government's borrowing needs; issuing longer-dated bonds would simply commit the government to paying higher yields and would be too expensive. They say, and some City analysts agree, that there will be more than enough demand for the new convertible bond, particularly among domestic banks, building societies and domestic fund management institutions. But the new convertible issue may be a sign that the Bank of England is beginning to find it difficult to attract demand for short-dated gilts. Perhaps the biggest problem the new issue will face is the difficulty investors may have in deciding on a price. When details of the auction were announced last week, they were greeted with stunned silence as analysts tried to make sense of it. 'There is no other stock like it in the market,' analysts complained. Whether the new gilt will find favour with the market will become apparent on Wednesday, although the debate it has provoked may not end there.</p>

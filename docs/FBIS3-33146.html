			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections,  scheduled for 8 May 1994:    The last-minute presidential bid of Carlos Lleras de la  Fuente, a former Constituent Assembly member, has prompted  divisions within the Liberal Party (PL), which will elect its  official candidate on 13 March. Lleras is considered to be an  independent politician removed from the influences of the party  power brokers.    Although most PL presidential hopefuls accepted Lleras' bid,  David Turbay has threatened not to participate in the PL  election if Lleras is given special treatment because he is the  son of former President Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Turbay said:  "We cannot be divided up as mortals and gods. The mortals would  be those of us who obey the rules and respect the laws, and the  gods would be those who seek their own rules whenever they need  to."    PL presidential hopefuls Ernesto Samper, Humberto de la  Calle, and Carlos Lemos appeared to favor Lleras' presidential  bid. De la Calle said it was a good proposal to fight "against  the PL party machinery." Samper said Lleras' participation  could give new dynamics to the campaign. (Madrid EFE in Spanish  1834 GMT 15 Feb 94)    Carlos Lleras de la Fuente has said his presidential bid was  inspired by civic and private sector organizations that  encouraged him to become a PL presidential hopeful. When Lleras  was questioned whether he had discussed the decision with his  father -- the former president -- Lleras said: "No I have not."  Lleras said mechanisms are being set up to oppose his  candidacy, such as the argument about new voting lists having to  be printed. He noted: "It has even been suggested that I run  under an independent movement, outside the elections. This does  not appear to be the most convenient decision given the nation's  current situation." (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network  in Spanish 1200 GMT 14 Feb 94)    PL presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper Pizano was seen  campaigning in Caldas and several cities of middle Magdalena.  Samper said that one of his government's goals is to return life  to the Magdalena River, indicating that he would not hesitate to  help the peasants and that he would return the Agrarian Bank to  the farmers.    Meanwhile Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party hopeful, asked  the government for necessary guarantees for the elections.  Pastrana also sent a message of solidarity to the Boyaca  political leaders who are being held hostage, and he expressed  hopes for a speedy and safe release of the kidnap victims.    In Santa Marta, PL presidential hopeful Carlos Lemos said  that given that women in general are honest and therefore more  difficult to bribe, one must take advantage of this virtue by  appointing them to important posts in public administration to  create a climate of honesty in the nation.    Over the weekend, Humberto de la Calle, PL presidential  hopeful, said that a large majority of Colombians should have  access to education because a lack of education is the root of  many problems in the nation.

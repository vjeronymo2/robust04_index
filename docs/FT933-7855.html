			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Review of bus industry demanded A FULL review of the bus industry was called for yesterday by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after it found another local bus company guilty of anti-competitive behaviour designed to force a competitor out of the market. There have been a number of instances of bus companies attempting to squeeze rivals out of the market since deregulation. Most recently, in June the commission found Southdown Motor Services guilty of trying to force a rival off routes in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, by pitching fares at an uneconomic level. Responding to the commission's report on bus services in mid and west Kent, Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the government was not yet convinced of the need for a wide-scale review. But he said it would consider the commission's suggestions for tightening the application of competition law to the bus industry. The commission said the introduction by Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services of additional bus services timed immediately before those of a competitor was designed to force the competitor's withdrawal from the routes. This behaviour, together with the use of selective fare reductions on journeys immediately in front of a competitor's and other actions were practices which operated, or were likely to operate, against the public interest, the commission said. The commission also examined M&amp;D's operation of the Chatham bus station and found the terms on which it offered access to other bus companies unreasonable, denying passengers a choice of services from the station. Mr Hamilton said he had asked the director-general of fair trading to seek undertakings within three months from M&amp;D that it would address the commission's complaints.</p>

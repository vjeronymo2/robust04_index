			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> A WALKING TIME BOMB GOES OFF  </P> <P> Michael Robert Pacewitz, the Fullerton man accused of fatally stabbing a  3-year-old girl, made attempts in recent months -- however confused -- to drive  away the demons that accompanied him in his young life. The interview he gave  with reporters last week and the picture of him that has emerged from those who  knew him suggest that he had been a walking time bomb for a long time. His  behavior in recent weeks became outrageous. Yet he was unable to get help, even  though he had reached for it; and though some saw his problems and tried to  assist, they couldn't make a difference. What a disturbing story this is of  someone's free fall through the safety net of society.  </P> <P> That the suspect ever was left in the role of baby-sitter for two children on  March 3 is, by itself, an incredible tale. He told interviewers a story that  realizes the darkest fears of parents: that he thought for three hours about  killing Marcelline Onick while she slept in her room. But even before a series  of parental handoffs left him in charge of two children for a night, he had  been sending distress signals over a period of years.  </P> <P> Pacewitz grew up on the fringe, moving from trailer park to cheap motel, and  dropped out of school several times. In 1988, he was treated in a Ventura  County psychiatric clinic but developed a drug problem. His association with a  church group in Fullerton a year ago was another try at redemption, but it  ended badly when he quit his job and reverted to drugs. Then his life  completely unraveled: He allegedly stabbed his mother and her boyfriend, went  to two facilities looking for help, then left before getting it. All before a  3-year-old died in bed.  </P> <P> His attempts at finding equilibrium may have been pitiful, but the bottom line  is that Pacewitz didn't get the help he cried out for. It's early to say where  the blame lies, but this much is clear now: Here's somebody who never should  have fallen through the cracks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: KIM BASINGER SWINGS FROM 'BATMAN' TO 'ENEMY'  </P> <P> "NEVER GIVE UP; and never under any circumstances, no matter what, never face  the facts," said Ruth Gordon, the heroine of "Harold and Maude."  </P> <P> KIM BASINGER, who made Michael Keaton's blood boil in "Batman," has been signed  for her first film since the release of that mega-hit (now out on cassette and  reaping millions more for Warners). Kim will star in Leonard Goldberg's  production, "Sleeping With the Enemy," described as "a contemporary sexual  thriller." This will be Goldberg's first independent production since leaving  his position as president of 20th Century Fox Film Corp.  </P> <P> Kim's leading man has yet to be cast, but the sexy actress will have firm  support behind the camera. The screenplay for "Sleeping With the Enemy" has  been written by Ron Bass, last year's Oscar winner for "Rainman." The director  will be Joe Rubin, whose most recent effort was "True Believers." Shooting  begins March 1, with Goldberg's alma mater, Fox, releasing in the fall of 1990.  </P> <P> THE LATE John Lennon, like Marilyn and Elvis, is perennially hot copy; there's  a reading public that snaps up everything on him. This is one reason why  Lennon's son, Julian, is shopping around a book he's writing on his father.  Although father and son were not particularly close until near the end of  John's life, the book will nevertheless deal with their relationship, such as  it was. So far, Julian hasn't found a publisher willing to go with it.  </P> <P> FANS OF Michael J. Fox will not be disappointed by his performance in the  eagerly awaited "Back to the Future II," opening today.  </P> <P> Fox throws himself energetically into the reprise of his Marty McFly role. He  is still boyish and appealing. Admirers of the first film, however, might be in  for a letdown. Much of the charm of the original has vanished; this "Future" is  violent, mean-spirited, strained and, under the direction of Bob Zemeckis,  occasionally incoherent. Christopher Lloyd, so funny the first time around as  the daffy scientist, is here simply annoying.  </P> <P> Given the result, not only was this sequel unnecessary, but the third  installment, filmed at the same time and due for release next summer, seems  nothing more than an obvious attempt to squeeze every last drop and every  possible dollar from a movie (and an audience) that deserves a lot better.  </P> <P> MOVIE STAR and expectant father Arnold Schwarzenegger has moved into the  ionosphere of high-salaried actors. Arnold will collect $10 million, plus a  percentage of the profits, from his next film, "Total Recall." But please,  don't mention this to Meryl Streep. The great actress spouted off rather  profanely to Premiere magazine on the unequal salaries of men and women  superstars in Hollywood. Meryl's not starving, but fair is fair. Still, men  always make more money than women in Hollywood, and in most other places.  </P> <P> BALTHAZAR GETTY, the handsome 14-year-old son of John Paul Getty III, has  landed a key role in Martin Poll's new movie, "Home Grown," playing Kate  Capshaw's son. Young Balthazar was discovered a couple of years ago in a  Bel-Air prep school and cast in the remake of "Lord of the Flies." Martin Poll  says Getty is "a terrific talent who'll go far in films."  </P></p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / 'Rat-catchers' rattle the establishment: Increasing concern as the right gains ground in Hamburg's city elections 'DON'T LET the brown rat-catchers into the Rathaus,' Hamburg's popular Morgenpost newspaper shouted in its front-page headline yesterday. 'They want to take our taxes.' It was quoting a colourful image coined by Mr Henning Voscherau, the city mayor. The rat-catchers are the extreme right-wing parties seeking to mobilise the growing fears of German citizens over immigration, law and order, a European currency, and the rising costs of unification. Nazi brownshirts once exploited the same sort of xenophobia. The Rathaus is Hamburg's city hall, the seat of the city parliament, which is up for election tomorrow with the result still wide open. All the main political parties look set to lose support. As for the literary context, it is a reference to that famous rat-catcher of Hamlin, the pied piper, who enticed the town's children to a never-never land with his magical music. After weeks of trying to ignore the menace of a right-wing extremist vote in the election, the German media are finally taking the threat seriously. And the prospect of either or both of Germany's radical right-wing parties - the Republicans or the German People's Union (DVU) - winning a handful of seats in the parliament has got the entire political establishment rattled. Hamburg is seen as setting the trend for no fewer than 19 national, state and local elections in the next year. The police are preparing for violent clashes tomorrow night, with extreme left-wing, anti-fascist groups organising a rally at the central station, just when the two right-wing leaders - Mr Fritz Schonhuber of the Republicans and Mr Erich Frey, the millionaire publisher behind the DVU - will be turning up in the Rathaus square. Whether they win seats or not, they seem certain of close attention. The city of Hamburg, based on its great international port, was a centre of anti-Nazism even at the height of Hitler's power. His party never won a democratic majority there when it swept the rest of the country in the 1930s. For Mr Voscherau, the Social Democrat mayor seeking re-election, his highest priority is no longer winning an absolute majority for his SPD, but stopping the right-wingers from gaining the 4 per cent they need to creep into the Rat-haus. 'I beg all the citizens of Hamburg to go to the polls on Sunday and decide democratically,' he urged a sad little rally in the rain on Thursday night on the banks of Hamburg's Alster Lake. 'Don't follow the rat-catchers of the right.' Perhaps it was the weather rather than the political mood which kept the numbers down, but Mr Voscherau's party seems certain to lose its absolute majority for only the third time in 46 years, in the face of growing political apathy and cynicism in the electorate at large. At the same time, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)  -the ruling party in Bonn but the opposition in Hamburg - looks to be in an even worse state. Mr Kohl pulled in an invited audience of 2,500 at the Hamburg International Trade Centre for his rally on Thursday night, but his speech was lacklustre and low-key, and the party seems to accept that it is condemned to a poor second place. The last opinion poll by the Infas opinion research institute put the SPD on 40 per cent, compared with 48 per cent at city elections two years ago, and the CDU down to 31 per cent from 35 per cent. The other main Bonn party, the minority Free Democrats (FDP) in the ruling coalition, is on only 4 per cent, and may win no seats at all. Only the Greens look set to make big gains, in what is both a protest vote and an indication that they are now seen as part of the political establishment: they are up in the polls from 7.2 to 11 per cent. As for the right-wingers, both parties are bumping along at 4 per cent support, together with the Statt Partei - a citizens' alliance without programme or policy except a rejection of the party establishments. What is most worrying for all the main parties, however, is the level of those who don't know or won't say: 25 per cent have not yet decided, and 17 per cent refuse to say whom they would support. The latter could well be tempted by the far right. 'There is a popular anger about, which we absolutely have to tackle before the federal elections next year,' Mr Voscherau says. 'We need more social justice, straight-talking, morality and decency from the political parties . . . we need to take radical action to ensure the protection of life and limb, of property and the sense of security of the small people in society. 'It is that anger which is giving the right-wingers the feeling that they are getting the upper hand.' But as for Mr Voscherau's unfortunate image of the rat-catcher, he seems to have forgotten that it was the incompetence and miserliness of the Hamlin town council which caused the pied piper to play a different tune.</p>

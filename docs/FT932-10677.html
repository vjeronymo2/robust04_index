			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP's shares rise as first quarter pleases City BRITISH Petroleum surprised the City in reporting better-than-expected first quarter profits of Pounds 231m - before exceptional items - on a replacement cost basis, compared with Pounds 73m. The shares rose 10p to 306p. Mr David Simon, chief executive, said the improvement in profits for the three months to March 31 had largely been a result of 'self help'. He said trading conditions had been tough and although BP had maintained sales, margins were lower. BP's cost-cutting exercise generated surplus cashflow of Pounds 600m in the first quarter, allowing the company to pay down debt and reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 99 per cent at the end of last year to 94 per cent. Mr Simon said the company had paid off Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.16bn) of debt since the middle of last year, leaving a burden of Dollars 14.5bn. He warned, however, that cashflow in the second quarter would be adversely affected by Dollars 630m tax due to the Alaskan government and lower divestment proceeds, although refining margins had recently improved. A decline in the oil price and a drop in refining margins had led to a downturn of Dollars 150m in income, Mr Simon pointed out. However, that had been more than offset by lower costs and an improvement in the dollar-sterling rate. While BP's sales of refined products were up by 6 per cent in the first quarter and gas sales rose by 2 per cent, refining margins fell 50 cents in Europe and 30 cents in the US. 'These results are quite good, because BP is moving to a perfectly respectable level of earnings when the environment is not improving at all, in fact it is deteriorating,' said Mr Nick Antill, analyst at Hoare Govett, the stockbroker. The company's overall replacement cost profit - which strips out gains and losses from oil stocks - was up from Pounds 200m in the final quarter last year. The contribution to operating profit from exploration and production held steady from the fourth quarter at Pounds 516m, against Pounds 515m, in spite of a Dollars 1.50 a barrel drop in the oil price. A year ago the contribution was Pounds 414m. Refining and marketing achieved profits of Pounds 124m (Pounds 36m), up from Pounds 117m in the fourth quarter. Chemicals showed a loss of Pounds 14m against loses of Pounds 6m a year earlier and Pounds 22m in the fourth quarter. Earnings in the first quarter increased from 1.4p to 4.3p while the dividend is cut to 2.1p (4.2p). See Lex</p>

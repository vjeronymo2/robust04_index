			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Joint ventures may face tighter rules Joint ventures and associate companies will be subject to tighter reporting requirements under proposals published yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board. They should be defined as 'strategic alliances' and treated by the equity accounting method, the proposals recommend. The details are contained in a discussion document which could be turned into a more detailed draft standard by the middle of next year. They go beyond the existing requirements of companies legislation and SSAP1, the accounting standards of associated companies. Joint ventures are currently subject to varying forms of accounting. They can be 'proportionately consolidated', which means their financial details are included in a company's consolidated accounts line by line. Under the equity method, profits and assets are included in accounts on the basis of the proportion of total shares held in the venture. Associates - defined as investments in which a company has a participating interest and 'significant influence' - are already treated by the equity method, but the ASB is trying to clarify the position. The ASB also yesterday issued the final draft chapter of its 'statement of principles' on entities for which accounts must be prepared.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SAM FARMER;  </P> <P> GUIMARAES SUPPLIES HAMMER  </P> <P> The Pierce College men's volleyball team came within three points of sweeping  heavily favored Orange Coast in the junior college state championships Friday  at El Camino, before surrendering three consecutive games to lose.  </P> <P> Afterward, Pierce Coach Ken Stanley wasn't about to blame it on Rio.  </P> <P> Make that Rico from Rio.  </P> <P> Rico Guimaraes, a sophomore outside hitter, might be the Brahmas' most valuable  player. He was a foreign-exchange student at Hoover High, graduating in 1987.  </P> <P> "(Guimaraes) has got a good vertical jump and dynamite arm strength," said  Orange Coast Coach Bob Wetzel, who watched the rangy, 6-foot-5 Brazilian  force-feed the Pirates a team-high 30 kills.  </P> <P> Stanley says Guimaraes is the consummate athlete.  </P> <P> "In the 12 years I've been coaching at Pierce, he's probably in my top five  players," Stanley said. "You never have to worry about motivating him. I think  that's the true characteristic of a good athlete."  </P> <P> Guimaraes, an All-South Coast Conference selection, is interested in several  schools, including Long Beach State, Cal State Northridge, Hawaii and  Pepperdine.  </P> <P> In addition, three other Glendale players play for Pierce (18-3), runner-up to  Orange Coast in the SCC. Milton Hahn attended Hoover and Mark Grist and Tyler  Bates graduated from Glendale.  </P> <P> Bates, the starting setter, was also selected to the all-SCC team. "Bates is  far and away the best setter in the conference," Wetzel said.  </P> <P> Championship form: With just three returning players from last year's Southern  Section 4-A Division championship badminton team, Pat Rogerson predicted this  would be a rebuilding season for Glendale High.  </P> <P> Happily, Rogerson's prognosis was inaccurate. The Dynamiters finished second in  the Pacific League with a record of 11-4 and 7-2 in league play.  </P> <P> The final match of the regular season against league-champion Alhambra might  have been Glendale's most impressive. The contest lasted five hours, whereas  most matches last about 2 1/2 hours. Glendale won, 10-9.  </P> <P> "Right now the team looks in championship form," Rogerson said. "They've really  fought tooth and nail the whole way."  </P> <P> Glendale will be well-represented in the first round of the Southern Section  individual finals Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Twins Angela and Christian Armendariz will compete in the girls' doubles. Last  month in Colorado Springs, Colo., the two won their second consecutive national  title in girls' doubles for 18 and under. Christian and Jung Lee will play in  the mixed doubles division.  </P> <P> Lee and Eric Chu will compete in the boys' doubles.  </P> <P> Occidental bound: Jeff Huerta, an all-Riverside County linebacker from Rubidoux  High, recently announced his plans to enroll at Occidental College.  </P> <P> Huerta, who led the Falcons with 107 tackles (58 unassisted) in nine games, was  also named to the All-Citrus Belt League team.  </P> <P> Add Occidental: Al Luginbill, head coach at San Diego State, is the scheduled  keynote speaker the Occidental football coaches clinic May 20. Other lecturers  include assistants from NCAA Division I and II programs such as Navy, Cal, and  Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> The all-day clinic costs $17 and is intended for youth, high school and college  coaches.  </P></p>

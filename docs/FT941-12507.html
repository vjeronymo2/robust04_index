			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Everyday low prices Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of the supermarket group, has more reason than most to be grumpy about the market's reaction to the company's trading statement. Yesterday's 48p fall in Sainsbury's share price shaved about Pounds 165m from the value of his shareholding. While the Pounds 365m property write-off caught the eye, the poor trading figures were perhaps the more serious blow. Despite the company's repetitive 'essential for the essentials' marketing campaign, like-for-like sales have fallen. Admittedly, the company was up against a particularly strong performance in the previous year. But the notion that Sainsbury's underlying sales could actually be falling is a profound psychological shock to an already rattled market. The central question now is whether Sainsbury is right to think that there has been a one-off drop in margins as a result of renewed competition from Asda and Gateway and the arrival of discounters. The more frightening, and perhaps plausible, idea is that the expansion of stores in the last few years has entrenched a level of competition which will drive margins much lower. If that happens, the property write-downs which Sainsbury announced yesterday will not be enough. Sainsbury's statement also shows that not even the market leader is immune to competitive pressures. Given the way that these have forced Sainsbury to make price cuts and slow its opening programme, its claim that the new level of margins is sustainable looks distinctly suspect. Since Sainsbury only controls an eighth of a market with static demand and rising supply, market forces, rather than Sainsbury's management, are likely to dictate margins in the next few years. On that basis, the company's market yield is not sufficient defence against the bloodletting ahead.</p>

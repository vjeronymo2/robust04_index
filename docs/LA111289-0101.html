			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EX-JUDGE ESCAPES FROM PRISON IN FLORIDA  </P> <P> Paul Ottinger has vanished for the second time in three years. And again no one  has a clue where he is.  </P> <P> Once a respected lawyer and judge in Hagerstown, Md., Ottinger, 74, escaped  Nov. 3 from the minimum-security federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base in  Florida. He walked away from the prison, which has no walls, two hours before  he was to be paroled from federal custody.  </P> <P> The U.S. Marshals Service, which is in charge of the search, is baffled.  </P> <P> Ottinger was in prison for stealing thousands of dollars from clients, lying on  financial statements to banks, and forging checks and insurance papers. He was  to be transported back to Hagerstown over the weekend, and then turned over to  state prison officials.  </P> <P> What makes his disappearance so perplexing is that he might have been paroled  from state custody -- his last hurdle to freedom -- in the next month or two.  And he knew it.  </P> <P> Ottinger now faces an extra five years in federal prison for escape.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with the Baltimore Evening Sun last Monday, he talked  about what he might do as a free man.  </P> <P> He also railed against a system that, in his mind, had kept him in jail too  long and had not kept him informed about his transfer back to Maryland.  </P> <P> "The real key to this is that nobody cares," he said. "I'm just another  statistic lost in the backwoods of Florida."  </P> <P> Ottinger had one compelling reason for disappearing: He did not want to serve  time in state prison, even a short time. He once said that sentencing him to  state prison would be tantamount to signing his death warrant; he feared that  prisoners, especially those he had sentenced to life terms, would try to kill  him.  </P> <P> He was a Circuit Court judge in Washington County, Md., from 1971 to 1977.  </P> <P> Ottinger vanished, for the first time, in January, 1987. For years he had been  stealing money from the estates of Hagerstown residents, lying to banks about  his assets and borrowing money illegally, and settling lawsuits without his  clients' knowledge and then forging their names on the settlement checks.  </P> <P> He methodically planned his disappearance. He rented an old farmhouse in  Gettysburg, Pa., where he initially hid out for two weeks. The 5-foot-10-inch  judge dyed his white hair brown and lost nearly 40 pounds, dropping from 295 to  257.  </P> <P> And he assumed another name.  </P> <P> Three months after Ottinger fled Maryland, FBI agents arrested him in a small  apartment in York, Pa., where he was studying for a real estate exam.  </P> <P> He later pleaded guilty in federal court to mail fraud and defrauding a bank,  and was sentenced to 5 1/2 years in federal prison. Then he pleaded guilty in  state court to forgery and was sentenced to 8 1/2 years in state prison. The  sentences were to run concurrently.  </P> <P> In state and federal courts he was ordered to pay a total of nearly $320,000  restitution.  </P> <P> Ottinger told the Evening Sun last year that he had fled after his life fell  apart, that he had been drinking and gambling heavily, and that he had fallen  hopelessly in debt.  </P> <P> Ottinger was serving his federal sentence impeccably until two hours before his  scheduled parole. Fellow prisoners last saw him at 6 a.m. Friday when they were  called to breakfast. But at 8 a.m., when Ottinger was summoned to the  administration building, he was nowhere to be found.  </P> <P> He would have been driven by van to the Washington County jail in Hagerstown,  where officials would have turned him over to the Maryland Department of  Correction.  </P> <P> Ottinger would have been admitted to the state's  reception-diagnostic-classification center in Baltimore. According to Greg  Shipley, spokesman for the Department of Correction, Ottinger might have  remained at the center until his parole hearing.  </P> <P> Paul J. Davis, chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, said last week that  a hearing for Ottinger would have been scheduled in December or January. Davis  would not speculate on Ottinger's chances of being paroled.  </P></p>

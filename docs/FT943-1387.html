			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US link for Inchcape insurance offshoot Bain Hogg Group, the insurance broking group owned by Inchcape, the motors, marketing and services concern, is planning a strategic alliance with Acordia, the Indianapolis-based company which is the world's eighth largest insurance broker. The move follows Inchcape's takeover of Hogg Group earlier this year, which created the world's seventh biggest broker and signalled Inchcape's ambitions in the sector. Bain Hogg also said it had entered into talks to sell its brokerage operation, Bain Hogg Robinson, to Acordia. The alliance would allow the two groups to offer an improved international services to clients, drawing from both Bain's strength in Europe and east Asia and Acordia's position in the US. Acordia, a network of companies providing insurance broking, managed care administration and consulting services, had revenues of Dollars 258m (Pounds 163m) in 1993. Health insurance, including managed care services, accounted for 51 per cent of its gross revenues. Acordia has grown rapidly in recent years from its strongholds in the southern and mid-western states. It acquired American Business Insurance in 1993 and Seattle-based Pettit Morry earlier this year.</p>

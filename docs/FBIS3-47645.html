			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia has announced a new aid package to  Ethiopia, coinciding with the visit to the African country by  Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. The package totals Australian $6  million and will go toward refugee and relief activities to help  rebuilding the country after three decades of civil war and  drought.    Announcing the package in Australia, development assistance  minister, Gordon Bilney, described Ethiopia as one of the  world's poorest countries. In a statement, Mr. Bilney said that  while the Ethiopian Government had set medium-term goals of  rehabilitation and development, there were immediate needs for  food and health and farm assistance.    Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB [Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau] will spend most of  the new aid on buying and distributing Australian wheat through  the world food program. The remainder of the money will be  spent on an immunization program and construction of sustainable  rural water supply systems in the Tigre region to help prevent  health problems associated with poor water supplies.    Foreign Minister Evans is set to hold talks in Ethiopia with  goverment ministers and senior officials.</p>

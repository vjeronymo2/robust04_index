			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Management: The practice of equal pensions Equal pay for equal work, while easy to grasp in theory is elusive in practice. Applying the concept of equality to deferred pay - pensions - has proved so difficult that three years after a landmark ruling from the European Court of Justice employers are still unclear about how to make it work. That decision, handed down on May 17 1990 in the Barber case, concluded that employers may not offer one sex more generous pensions than are available to the other. It immediately forced examination of pension schemes which typically allowed women to retire on full pension at age 60, while forcing men to wait until 65. Today, an opinion from the Advocate General of the ECJ on a different case - which will be subject to a final ruling later this year - should provide further guidance for employers. In Britain, where 80 to 90 per cent of all occupational pension payments are made to men, employers have already responded to Barber by reducing even further the portion of the pension pot paid to women. Figures from the National Association of Pension Funds show that 85 per cent of all employers have equalised male and female retirement ages within their schemes and of these, 59 per cent have done so by raising women's ages to 65. 'The majority of employers have equalised at 65 because that is the cheapest option,' said Kevin Spring, partner at consulting actuaries Wyatt Company. However, the NAPF has found that most employers have been sensitive to the views of their female employees: 82 per cent of those raising the age allow current employees to retire earlier than that with no actuarial reduction in pension payments. Because workers typically lose 5 per cent of their pension for each year of early retirement, many employers have thus shielded their female employees from a swingeing 25 per cent reduction in their pension payments. But employers have not solved all their problems - either legal or managerial - by simply raising retirement ages. Thus attention is focused on another group of cases on which the Advocate General is expected to pronounce today. The central one comes from the UK where the pension scheme members and trustees of Coloroll, a UK home furnishings company now in liquidation, have asked the ECJ to resolve some outstanding questions. First, will employers be required to provide 'retrospection' in equalising benefits or will they just be liable for equal benefits from May 1990, the date of the Barber judgment? Also, in so-called money purchase schemes, where the pension consists of a single lump sum to be invested in the purchase of an annuity, must men and women be provided with equal sums? Moreover, in the equalisation process, can an employer legally worsen the pension terms for employees? 'The question is whether the nature of the pension promise is sufficiently contractual to require employers to stick to it,' said Mark Duke, principal at actuarial consultants Towers Perrin. Employers who have tried to shield women from the sudden effects of a change in pension age may find that the Advocate General will require them to do the same for men retiring after May 17 1990. Given the considerable expense employers could abandon their efforts to cushion the blow for women. Despite the material reduction in pension benefits for women post Barber, benefits consultants say there has been remarkably little flapping. One reason is that relatively few women are entitled to full occupational pensions anyway because their child care decisions typically give rise to interrupted work patterns. Indeed, most of the outcry has come from male-dominated trade unions who want a crack at the more generous pensions offered to women. Another reason, Spring says, is that fixed retirement ages are a fiction at many companies. Employers increasingly offer flexible retirement ages, allowing those who wish to go early the ability to do so with little or no reduction in pension and higher pensions for those staying on longer. Employers like flexibility because, among other things, they find an employee hanging on only for a pension to be a relatively unproductive worker. Employers with unhappy workers between the ages of 61 and 65 could well be advised to consider a scheme offering both men and women a graceful way out.</p>

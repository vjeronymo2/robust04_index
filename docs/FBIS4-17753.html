			<p>BFN     [Text] "Today we have the most corrupt government in the  history of Russia," chairman of the State Duma committee on  security Viktor Ilyukhin told a press conference on Tuesday (the  Communist party faction). [sentence as received] In his words,  "corruption is corroding the state apparatus." Ilyukhin  believes that the most corrupt body is the Goskomimushchestvo  (the State Property Committee), and that "the dock has long been  waiting for" its chairman, vice-premier Anatoliy Chubays.    Ilyukhin said that at the beginning of the '80s, specialists  estimate, 35 percent of stolen money was spent to bribe  officials, now -- 50 percent and more. In 1993 150 major  criminal organizations operated in Russia with more than 35,000  enterprises within their spheres of influence. 4,500 case of  bribery were registered.    Speaking about "financial subversion against Russia",  Ilyukhin said that in 1993 4,300 crimes were disclosed in the  banking system. All in all, 52,000 corruption-related crimes  were registered last year. Cases against 1,500 officials were  opened. In his opinion, "a totally criminalized economy may  develop" in Russia.    Ilyukhin also said that the security committee had prepared  a  draft law on fighting corruption. On May 11 it will be  submitted to a plenary session of the State Duma. He noted that  a new provision in the draft law is that a state official should  sign a document on his income, real estate and personal property  worth over 100 minimal salaries, bank deposits and securities,  financial obligations, including those abroad.    Referring to the Central Electoral Commission, Ilyukhin  accused Russia's Choice faction and Yabloko faction that during  the election campaign they used the money received from joint  ventures in violation of the Russian president's decree.    He said that Russia's Choice had received more than 300  million rubles from these joint ventures for holding the  election campaign, and Yabloko -- more than 30 million rubles.    Answering an Interfax question Ilyukhin said that at the  next  meeting the council of the State Duma will consider this issue  and will obviously put it on the agenda of a plenary meeting.  Ilyukhin believes that the legality of deputy mandates of the  above mentioned factions "should become a subject for  investigation by the mandate commission of the State Duma."</p>

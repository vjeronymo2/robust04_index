			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAe instructed not to notify EU - DTI says bid for VSEL affects UK's 'essential security interests' The UK government yesterday warned Brussels not to interfere in British Aerospace's agreed bid for VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has written to the European Commission stating that it would not be appropriate for Brussels to vet the merger under the EU Merger Regulation as the bid 'affects the UK's essential security interests'. Asserting rights under article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, which allows member states to take measures to protect their essential interests, the government has also written to BAe instructing it not to notify Brussels of the deal. Under EU merger rules, BAe and VSEL had until yesterday to pre-notify Brussels. Normally, failure to notify the Commission could result in the companies being fined up to 10 per cent of their turnover. Brussels sources said yesterday, however, that neither company would be in jeopardy if they were acting on the UK government's instructions. The government could have allowed them to notify the deal and then request the merger be dealt with by the UK competition authorities, arguing that issues of national security were involved. However, the government decided that the notification process itself, which involves companies supplying vast quantities of information about their finances, the structure of markets and research and development, would not have been in the national interest. The Commission's response is not expected until next week. But Mr Colin Overbury, former head of the EC Merger Task Force and a consultant to City lawyers Allen &amp; Overy, said Brussels had shown itself to be flexible where defence issues were involved. The crucial question would be whether other member states objected to the merger on grounds that it adversely affected their defence procurement or defence industries.</p>

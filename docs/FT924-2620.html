			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington maintains dividend despite 70% fall to Pounds 15m PILKINGTON'S share price rose yesterday, but the directors were given a rough ride when presenting the interim results to analysts. They questioned the maintenance of the dividend at 2.93p, given that it was paid entirely from reserves. There was little good news in the figures, which showed a 70 per cent drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 50.6m to Pounds 15.1m in the six months to September 30. This was is in spite of Pilkington taking an annual Pounds 150m of costs out of the business over the past three years, with a further Pounds 24m going in the first half. Group turnover of Pounds 1.2bn was slightly up when sales of discontinued operations were excluded. But operating profits of Pounds 46.7m compared with Pounds 89m, including Pounds 19.4m from discontinued operations, mainly the South African business. Investment income and associates contributed Pounds 8.4m, down from Pounds 14.2m. That left the interest charge of Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 48.6m), covered only 1.5 times. Exceptional items were Pounds 2.6m, against Pounds 4m, although they are likely to reach Pounds 10m for the full year. The group's tax charge of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 30.4m) was high because losses in the UK - of Pounds 8.3m at the operating level - could not be offset against tax paid on overseas profits of Pounds 56m. Advance corporation tax on the dividend could not be offset either. After minorities took Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 12.4m) there was a loss for shareholders of Pounds 6.3m (profit Pounds 7.8m) or 0.8p a share (earnings of 1p). The shares added 3p to 87p. Mr Roger Leverton, who became chief executive in July, said capacity utilisation was about 85 per cent. Variable costs of production were low. About 10 per cent of sales were of new, higher technology products introduced in the past five years, which earned much higher margins than standard products. Mr Leverton said he aimed to increase their contribution to 15 per cent of sales. Another aim was to continue to cut costs. Capital spending had totalled Pounds 1bn over the past three years, but this would be cut, working capital would be squeezed further and debt brought down. Operating profits from flat and safety glass fell to Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 52.3m). The decline in European profits from Pounds 32.7m to Pounds 17.2m and North American to Pounds 2m (Pounds 6.5m), was offset partly by a Pounds 6m rise from other areas to Pounds 19.1m. Visioncare, which includes Sola and the US contact lens business, had flat profits of Pounds 11.6m.</p>

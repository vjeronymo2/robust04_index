			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: MAKING HISTORY BEFORE IT HAPPENS  </P> <P> Television is history's microwave.  </P> <P> CBS is about to present "Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North,"  even though the extent of North's fall -- or even whether he has fallen -- has  not been determined.  </P> <P> North's trial in connection with the Iran-Contra scandal has just ended. But  the jury is not expected to have reached a verdict when this two-part docudrama  airs at 9 p.m. Sunday and Tuesday on Channels 2 and 8, starring David Keith as  the charismatic Marine lieutenant colonel who gained celebrity from the  Iran-Contra hearings and emerged a national hero or national disgrace,  depending on your point of view.  </P> <P> Four hours of "Guts and Glory" surely won't decide the issue for anyone, and  it's difficult finding a rationale for television -- a supposedly definitive  account of a work in progress -- with such a built-in contradiction.  </P> <P> Based on a book by Ben Bradlee Jr., "Guts and Glory" was completed before the  North trial and thus excludes, for example, recently renewed suspicions about  then-Vice President George Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair. Hence, it  also omits conflicts between the trial testimonies of North and former National  Security Council adviser Robert C. McFarlane, a key clash of Iran-Contra  accounts on which the North verdict may partially rest.  </P> <P> When last seen in "Guts and Glory," McFarlane (Paul Dooley) is leaving his  National Security Council post while lauding North for bringing "integrity" to  government. What a difference five years make.  </P> <P> Moreover, "Guts and Glory" also ends before the start of those 1987 televised  congressional hearings that introduced then-anonymous North to America and  helped build the Iran-Contra scandal into a melodrama every bit as mesmerizing  as "Dallas" or "Dynasty."  </P> <P> Polarized public reaction to those hearings and its diverse cast of characters  said as much about America and its values as Iran-Contra did about North.  </P> <P> Although ably acted and nicely staged, "Guts and Glory" is instant, short-order  history, a truncated perspective made minus the benefit of time and rushed on  the air by CBS for the May ratings sweeps.  </P> <P> The Oliver L. North at the center of director-writer-executive producer Mike  Robe's story is an ambitious, calculating political player and  ultraconservative ideologue. There are no shadings in North's character or  universe. He is guided by rigid views of patriotism and of right and wrong, and  also by an unswerving allegiance to his career that puts recurring severe  strains on his marriage.  </P> <P> As a character study of North, "Guts and Glory" is rather flat. It works best  as a generic study of power and its impact on those positioned to exert it.  "Arrogance of power" is a cliche that perfectly fits this shadowy milieu in  which the self-righteous appoint themselves to make American foreign policy.  </P> <P> As CIA Director William Casey (Barnard Hughes) tells his protege North here,  there are "no rules but one: Do what's right." Their version of "right."  </P> <P> We meet North as a Commie-bashing, flag-waving midshipman at the Naval Academy  with a strong personal code of honor and a meticulously detailed life plan that  includes switching to the Marines and finding "the right wife" to advance his  career. He chooses Betsy (Annette O'Toole).  </P> <P> A tour in Vietnam feeds North's contempt for anti-war protesters at home and  "the politicians" who won't let the U.S. fight to "win." In 1981, showing a  talent for ingratiating himself to those in a position to help him advance,  he's named a military aide with the NSC in the Administration of new President  Ronald Reagan (Bryan Clark). There he hires Fawn Hall (Amy Stock-Poynton) to  join him on "the cutting edge of history," passionately endorses Reagan's  support of the Contras fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government and begins  viewing CIA chief Casey as his mentor.  </P> <P> Later, North will help Casey circumvent the Boland Amendment that prohibited  U.S. intelligence agencies from providing money or military help to the  Contras. Plus we see the seeds of the alleged "missiles for hostages" deal with  Iran that went awry and evolved into a scheme to secretly divert Iran arms  sales profits to the Contras without the approval of Congress. We see the plan  endorsed by Casey, approved by then NSC chief John Poindexter (Peter Boyle) and  executed by North, all of them ends-justifies-the-means people.  </P> <P> Poindexter tells North that even Reagan didn't know about "the diversion." But  is Poindexter being truthful or merely protecting the President?  </P> <P> As for Bush, more than merely out of the "loop" here, he's out of the story.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, we get the cover-up, the damage control, the shredding and the  alleged scapegoating of North, all building toward those congressional hearings  that you won't see.  </P> <P> Bearing the crushing burden of playing a real-life character who has been  burned into the consciousness of America, Keith conveys the crusading passion  and commitment, but in no way the personal magnetism that has been attributed  to North.  </P> <P> You can envision strangers being swayed by the real North's sales pitches to  fund the Contras. You can envision legions of disciples following him, but not  Keith over the hill.  </P> <P> O'Toole is more convincing as the lesser-known Betsy North, whose outsider  status in her husband's life makes her a casualty in this scenario, along with  the North children.  </P> <P> Although a head shorter, Hughes is especially effective as the late Casey, who  wears the label of main malefactor here along with North, a label that will  stick at least for the time being. Dead men don't refute charges.  </P> <P> Ironically, the single character as central to this story as North, is not even  a real character. He's Aaron Sykes (Terry O'Quinn), identified as one of  North's NSC colleagues.  </P> <P> Although viewers have no way of knowing it, there is no Sykes. He's a  composite, Robe's interjection of a moral voice to rebut and repeatedly  question North's ethics, actions and priorities.  </P> <P> "What you guys tried to pull was nothing short of a secret government," Sykes  lectures North.  </P> <P> "A Marine does what it takes...," North responds.  </P> <P> TV docudrama, too, it seems.  </P></p>

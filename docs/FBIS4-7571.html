			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 31 -- Polish parliamentary delegation  visit to Romania that ended on Wednesday "should break the  political and economic deadlock in Polish-Romanian contacts,"  Senate Speaker Adam Struzik said on Thursday.    He added that during the talks of the delegation with  Romanian leading politicians, the Romanian side made it clear  that the contacts between the two countries have weakened  recently. Struzik hopes that after his forthcoming talks with  the Polish prime minister and the minister for foreign economic  relations the relations will be intensified.    According to Struzik, Romania can be Poland's good economic  partner.</p>

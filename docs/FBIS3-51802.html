A Yankee president must make everyone  happy. He must benefit the strong, and obtain the votes of the  weak; make concessions to senators and representatives who  defend opposing interests; always smile and give a good image of  a democratic man, which in many cases has nothing to do with his  political ideas. He must also adapt himself to the workings of  Washington, which has more than 200 years of experience and  tradition.    That situation explains why almost all U.S. presidents have  more success with foreign affairs than with domestic policies.  When they do not achieve even that, they are practically  banished, as in the case of Jimmy Carter, who is not even  invited to speak at Democratic Party conventions.    Another thing that could happen is what happened to George  Bush. Bush harvested victories in foreign policies, many of  which were not directly his own. We could mention the collapse  of the socialist bloc, the Panama invasion, the Gulf War, et  cetera, but despite all that, he was not reelected in the 1992  elections. The domestic economy played a dirty trick on him: The  country entered a recession and he lost. An almost unknown  Democratic governor from Arkansas named William Clinton took the  White House, which he has now occupied for approximately a year.    Clinton has not been the exception, and during his first  year  in office, achieved more success with foreign affairs than with  domestic policies. This is logical: The challenges that any U.S.  president today faces are greater inside the country than  abroad. On the foreign plane, Clinton has achieved the  Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty; ratification of the Free Trade  agreement; a favorable solution for the United States in the  Uruguay Round's General Accord on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]; and,  just recently, was able to get NATO to accept and control the  former members of the Warsaw Pact; the Ukraine to commit itself  to eliminating its nuclear weapons; Belarus to continue in that  process; and Syria agree to negotiate an effective peace  agreement with Israel.    All these achievements indicate a strong foreign policy that  benefits U.S. interests and Clinton's image. Nevertheless, his  popularity rating is very low. Could it be that the U.S. people  today realize that very few dare to contradict the wishes of the  empire and that the victories are really not so numerous as they  would like them to believe.    Clinton has acquired a budget from Congress that could  probably allow him to reduce the deficit with time, but he did  not obtain the $16 billion for the creation of new jobs at a  moment when there were more than 10 million people unemployed  and the economy barely showing symptoms of recovery. To obtain  approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico  and Canada, Clinton had to make concessions to several senators  and representatives. It is yet to be seen if he will obtain the  approval needed for his health care plan. What is even more  important is for Clinton to take the first steps toward  revitalizing the U.S. economy, which is in need of structural  change.    Personally, I wish no evil to President Clinton. He does not  seem to be a bad person, but as with every U.S. president, he  must play the game that the imperial "establishment" imposes,  whether he likes it or not. Clinton has not been the exception.  It appears from its attempts to discredit him, creating problems  by accusing him of being unfaithful to his wife and of shady  business deals in Arkansas, that the extreme right fears him.    His first year in office has therefore concluded with some  glories and some sorrows. So far, he has proven to be a capable  man within the system. What he does from this point on will  influence his chances for reelection in 1996. Only time will  tell.</p>

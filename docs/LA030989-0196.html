			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAND MET AGREES TO SELL PILLSBURY S&amp;A RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> Grand Metropolitan PLC, Pillsbury's new owner, sliced off another section of  the food and restaurant group Wednesday, agreeing to sell the S&amp;A  Restaurant Corp. to an investor group including top managers for $431 million.  </P> <P> S&amp;A was part of Pillsbury Co., acquired by Grand Met in January. Grand Met  has launched a program of cost cuts and asset sales as it attempts to make  Pillsbury more profitable.  </P> <P> Grand Met said in a statement that the investor group was led by DSJ/Inverness  &amp; Co. and the senior management of S&amp;A. Financing will be provided by  Citicorp's Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. and others.  </P> <P> In its first move to slim down Pillsbury, Grand Met cut the company's  Minneapolis headquarters staff by nearly a quarter with 550 layoffs earlier  this week. London-based Grand Met bought Pillsbury, one of the best-known U.S.  food and restaurant companies, for about $5.7 billion after a bitter struggle  that included repeated legal clashes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sold Together  </P> <P> S&amp;A, with Steak &amp; Ale and Bennigan's family restaurant chains, has a  total of 380 outlets. It had sales of $716 million in the fiscal year ended May  31, 1988, and operating income of $50 million.  </P> <P> Grand Met had previously stated that it would sell the S&amp;A restaurant  business to comply with laws in most states that prohibit a distiller from  owning retail liquor outlets or restaurants that serve alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> "We will invest the proceeds (from the sale) in the growth of Pillsbury Foods  and Burger King to enhance shareholders' investment in Grand Met's most  recently acquired U.S. operation," said Ian Martin, chief executive of Grand  Met's food operations.  </P> <P> Lawrence Adelman, food industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the two  chains had to be sold together because Bennigan's has been profitable while  Steak &amp; Ale has had less successful because Americans are consuming less  beef and many outlets are in Texas where the economy is weak.  </P></p>

The program of the summit is not fully prepared yet but the  Lithuanian President's Office said the meeting will start with  lunch at 1 p.m.    Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy  adviser, told the state-run ELTA news agency that the three  presidents intend to discuss priorities in the foreign policy of  the Baltic states. In Paleckis' words, cooperation between the  three Baltic nations, integration with Western Europe and  relations with neighboring countries will be the central issues  during the meeting.    The presidential adviser said the Baltic states are now able  to coordinate their positions much easier than a year ago.  Paleckis said the only slight disagreements concern free trade  agreements with the European Union [EU]. Lithuania and Latvia  intend to sign the so-called asymmetrical agreements which  restrict the import of some goods, while Estonia wants to  completely liberalize trade with the EU.</p>

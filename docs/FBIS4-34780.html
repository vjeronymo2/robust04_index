			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition Jamaica Labor Party [JLP] says its  response to the continued holding of by-elections in the absence  of meaningful electoral reforms will not always be intellectual  and passive. The threat comes from the Party's general  secretary, Dr. (Percival Broderick). A communique from Dr.  (Broderick) says the JLP finds Prime Minister Patterson's recent  statement most unacceptable [words indistinct] the holding of  eight parish council and constituency by-elections.    Dr. (Broderick) also says there has been a chorus of  pronouncements by the government criticizing the electronic  voting system, while an official response to the proposal has  been deferred. Only yesterday, the JLP's two representatives  walked out of a meeting of the electoral advisory committee. The  JLP walkout protested a report from the acting director of  elections that all was ready for the holding of a by-election in  southern St. Catherine to fill the vacancy created by the  resignation of Hugh Small.</p>

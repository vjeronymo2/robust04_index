			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Abbey National Abbey National managed to damp post-election spirits yesterday with its statement that both repossessions and arrears had been worse than it expected so far this year. The market's response in marking down Abbey shares by 3 per cent - and those of leading insurance companies even more sharply, on mortgage indemnity worries - still seems a touch overdone. Electoral uncertainty meant it was never likely that the first quarter would bring much comfort to the housing market. It will still take a month or two to determine the shape of any recovery, though the overhang of unsold properties means the best that can be expected is for some increase in volume at stable prices. That is hardly alarming news for the Abbey, though it does underline the limited scope for higher profits this year. Provisions now look likely to be little changed on last year's Pounds 155m. The likelihood of delay before the government cuts interest rates reduces the scope for a further widening of interest margins, while there is also not much room for the bank to increase profits on its treasury business, which proved a mainstay of 1991. Still, Abbey can easily afford the progressive dividend policy it promises, even if earnings will not rebound as sharply as those of the other clearers when recovery is finally established. Support for the shares may have been a touch over-enthusiastic since the election, but there is not much reason for them falling further.</p>

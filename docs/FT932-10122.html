			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Profit at BNF hit by Thorp delay BRITISH NUCLEAR Fuels' annual profits have fallen by at least Pounds 60m, partly because of the delay in starting its controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant, the company's newsletter reports. The pre-tax profit for the year to March 1993, which BNF expects to be less than Pounds 100m when finalised, has also been hit by the unplanned shutdown of the facilities for handling fuel from Magnox power stations for 48 days last year. Mr Neville Chamberlain, BNF chief executive, warned that the delay in starting Thorp, which BNF says is costing Pounds 2m a week, would also hit the current year's earnings. BNF had expected that Thorp, which has taken Pounds 2.8bn and nearly 10 years to build, would get an operating licence from the Department of the Environment in January. The complexity of the decision, and a public consultation which yielded 80,000 reponses, have led to delay, however. The department's lawyers have warned that the government may need to consider the economic case as well as the environmental and health factors, even though a more full evaluation could delay a decision further. BNF argues that no further assessment beyond the pollution inspectorate's report is necessary. Mr Chamberlain said recent leaks at Sellafield had no 'radiological significance' and posed no health risks, but added: 'We have a lot to do in educating the media, politicians and the public to help them understand these concepts.'</p>

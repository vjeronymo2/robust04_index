			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> FDA TO REVIEW AIDS TEST KITS  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration will consider applications for AIDS home test  kits that would enable people to send a small blood sample to a laboratory and  get the results by telephone, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> The agency has accepted one application and has sent letters to 30 other  companies that are developing test kits or have expressed interest in doing so,  said FDA spokesman Brad Stone.  </P> <P> Until now, the FDA has refused to accept home test kit applications because of  technical concerns, such as how well people could be instructed with written  material to draw their own blood and whether samples could be shipped safely  through the mail.  </P> <P> The agency also worried about how people using the tests would be counseled  about the disease.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No Regression Should Be Allowed in </F> Comprehensive Review of Regulations"]    [Text] Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations] issued a report asking for the relaxation of  government regulations for the distribution and transport  sectors. The statement represents the consensus reached among  its members, and is meant to be an appeal to the government's  Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters. Keidanren also  asked for deregulation to facilitate the effective use of  information and communications.    In the distribution sector, the report asked for the gradual  abolition of the Large Retail Store Law, easing of regulations  on retail licenses for liquor, and revamping the distribution  system of rice and grain. In the transport sector, it demanded  liberalization of fares under a set upper limit for passenger  transport by railway, bus and aircraft.    There is an upsurge of opinion seeking deregulation in the  business sector. This is probably because the businesses have  come to truly realize that although the economic recession has  hit bottom, there is still a glaring gap between demand and  supply; and to get on the track of recovery while undertaking  structural reform, it is necessary to grab the opportunity to  expand the market through deregulation.    With the enactment of the Administrative Procedures Law  scheduled for October, some businesses have come out and asked  for the "documentation of administrative guidance." This is  meant to enable businesses to monitor the ambiguous  administrative procedures and instructions of government offices  which do not have any legal basis. This can also be taken as a  manifestation of the business sector's initiative to open up new  markets.    Among the consumers, there is also a strong desire for  deregulation and clarification of rules. They have come to be  more concerned with eliminating the price gap between Japan and  foreign countries, and with possible ways to obtain high-quality  goods and services at a lower price. We would like the  government to seriously consider such pressure from the business  sector and consumers to relax government regulations as a "sign  of the times."    In its "Outline of External Economic Policy Reform,"  formulated recently as part of the efforts to bring about a  breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the  government pledged to work intensively on a radical review of  regulations. It cited the following sectors as major areas to  be considered: housing and land; information and  communications; import promotion, improvement of market access,  and distribution; and banking, securities and insurance.  Working groups for the first three sectors have been formed to  enable free discussions between experts and the concerned  ministries and agencies.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is also chairman of  the  Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters, serves  concurrently as chairman of the three working groups. According  to informed sources, with the resignation of Hosokawa, the  working groups now have a weakened sense of purpose. If this is  true, they will not be able to fulfill the government's pledge  to the people. This will be a betrayal of the people's high  hopes.    It is important to review government regulations  intensively.  The deregulation being considered in the three areas has the  potential of expanding domestic demand, promoting imports,  developing new businesses, and improving the people's quality of  life. Therefore, we hope the working groups will continue to  actively discuss effective measures in their own areas in  preparation for the formulation of another deregulation package  in June. Of course, followup on the measures already included  in the emergency economic package is also indispensable.    Another point which we would like to stress here is that the  basic thinking on deregulation upheld in the Outline of External  Economic Policy Reform -- that "the economy should be free in  principle, and regulated only in exceptional cases; and social  regulations should be limited to the minimum, in line with the  original policy goals"--should be sustained resolutely. Failure  to come up with a midterm program for deregulation under such a  philosophy will render what Hosokawa termed "Deregulation Year  One [Kisei Kanwa Gannen]" only a castle in the air.</p>

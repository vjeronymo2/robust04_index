Pay the Tax!"]    [Text] A year has elapsed since the adoption by the  Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers of the Decree "On Tax Rates for  Owners of Transport Means and Other Motor Vehicles and  Machines." However, quite a few questions are still coming into  our offices on this matter--from motor-vehicle owners and buffs,  as well as from the leading officials at enterpriss.    In this connection, the editors turned for the  necessary explanations to the Administration for the Application  of Tax Legislation under Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate.  Our interviewee was Valentina Barishpolets.    [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Have there been any changes in taxation  since the adoption of the above-mentioned Decree?    [Barishpolets] Yes. In particular, the Law "On the Ukrainian  State Budget for 1994" increased taxes levied on those juridical  persons who are owners of foreign-made transport means obtained  for SKV [freely convertable currency]. As of now, this tax  amounts to 2.4 times the minimum wage per horsepower. Other  amounts of the tax rates have remained unchanged.    [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Could you please tell us in greater detail  about the procedure for paying this tax.    [Barishpolets] Enterprises pay it annually during the first  six months of the year. Citizens, however, can pay this tax once  every two years, but not later than during the first six months  of the year in which the technical inspection is conducted. For  example, if a person has to have a technical inspection carried  out in 1994, he must present a tax receipt for the years 1993  and 1994 to the GAI [State Motor-Vehicle Inspectorate] organs. A  Person who did not pay this tax last year shall pay a tax for  two years (1993 and 1994); moreover, the amount of this tax is  determined on the basis of the minimum wage in force at the  moment the tax is paid.    [PRAVDA UKRAINY] And how is the tax computed?    [Barishpolets] Computations are carried out directly by  enterprises and organizations, based on accounting data  concerning the number of transport means owned as of 1 January  of the current year. No recomputation of the tax amount is to be  carried out in connection with the retirement or acquisition of  transport means during the course of the year in question.    Citizens who have acquired transport means during the second  six months of a particular year shall pay half the amount for  that year.    [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Let's say, for example, that a motor  vehicle  is not used for certain reasons (its owner is on a lengthy  business trip, there is a prolonged breakdown, etc.). What  happens then with regard to the tax?    [Barishpolets] If transport means are not used, the tax  is--nevertheless--still levied on their owners, based on general  principles.    [PRAVDA UKRAINY] To whom are tax privileges granted?    [Barishpolets] The following categories are exempt from  paying this tax:    --general-purpose automotive transport enterprises, but only  for transport means which are engaged in hauling passengers;    --institutions and organizations which are on the state  budget;    --Heroes of the Soviet Union, persons who have been awarded  the Order of Glory of Three Classes, disabled persons from the  Great Patriotic War, and other persons who also have such  privileges in connection with existing legislation;    --disabled persons having motor-scooters or motor vehicles  with manual controls;    --citizens relegated to Categories 1 and 2 of those persons  who have suffered as a consequence of the accident at the  Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Power Station], as well as citizens  relegated to Categories 3 and 4--prior to their being moved from  the zone of guaranteed voluntary resettlement and the zones of  intensified radiation ecological monitoring controls;    --citizens resettled from radiation-contaminated zones of  territories as a consequence of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl  AES to other population centers over the course of three years  after resettlement.    Enterprises, associations and organizations, kolkhozes and  sovkhozes situated in zones of guaranteed, voluntary  resettlement and zones of intensified radiation ecological  monitoring controls are exempt from taxation except for payments  and contributions to local budgets.    And one last point in this regard. Kolkhozes and sovkhozes  are exempt from taxation on fire engines, first-aid vehicles,  ambulances, and buses used to carry persons. But if the  kolkhozes and sovkhozes have been converted into joint-stock  companies, enterprises, and the like, they are obligated to pay  this tax, based on general principles.    [PRAVDA UKRAINY] Naturally, there are certain fines to be  imposed on persons who fail to pay this kind of tax, are there  not?    [Barishpolets] Of course. If an enterprise has concealed an  item subject to taxation or has reduced the sum-total of the  tax, it must pay into the budget the entire sum of that tax,  plus a penalty fine amounting to twice the amount of the  aforesaid sum.    For failing to submit an account of taxable items or  executing such an account with violations, as well as for  submitting in an insufficient or untimely manner computations or  other documents to the tax organs, an enterprise shall pay into  the budget an additional 50 percent of the necessary tax sums.    Service personnel guilty of these and other violations shall  be held administratively liable. For paying a tax late, a fine  shall be exacted amounting to 0.2 percent of the sum for each  day it is overdue.</p>

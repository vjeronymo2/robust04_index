			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Algerian Islamic party calls for resistance MOSLEM militants, accusing Algerian authorities of treason, appealed yesterday to the army and people to struggle and block the 'giant of power' which had robbed them of victory through the ballot box. The appeal from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was, however, couched in moderate terms and did not urge the people to take to the streets or start a general strike. In its first statement since President Chadli Bendjedid resigned on Saturday and the High Security Council scrapped a second round of general elections, set to put the fundamentalists in power, the FIS said: 'We call on veteran fighters, thinkers, religious leaders, senior army officers and soldiers, and sons of the martyrs, social organisations and all who love Algeria to take a stand against this giant of power.' The FIS said the authorities had betrayed God and the people in cancelling the elections. The FIS statement was issued after a secret leadership meeting in an Algiers suburb. Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, sent the army to guard key points. Algiers was calm yesterday. A few dozen tanks, deployed at key buildings and intersections over the weekend, remained in place, but the military otherwise kept a low profile. Religious leaders, meanwhile, sent out orders from the country's mosques warning militants to remain calm. France, Algeria's former ruler, appeared to signal relief yesterday that the army had prevented a fundamentalist victory through the ballot box. But French analysts warned that the 'constitutional coup' after Mr Chadli's resignation was a short-term expedient that could spark violence and discredit democracy and the army in the eyes of a frustrated younger generation. An ultra-cautious French Foreign Ministry statement omitted any mention of the suspension of democracy. Algeria now faces a constitutional vacuum because its constitution does not appear to have an answer to a situation in which the president has resigned and his normal interim replacement, the president of the National Assembly, is no longer in office. The National Assembly was officially dissolved on January 4, although the first news of this decision only came when Mr Chadli mentioned it in his resignation speech. Algerians appear not to expect any trouble from the FIS before Friday, when weekly prayers in the mosques might be followed by a show of force. The leaders of the FIS are confronted with a dilemma. If they fail to react to cancellation of the second round of the election the fundamentalist movement, especially if it is forced underground, may be taken over by its small extreme wing. On the other hand, they can have no doubt about the severity of a crack-down if they challenge the army.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Portillo lends his support to Thatcherite group's agenda A THATCHERITE group has enlisted the support of Mr Michael Portillo, the chief Treasury secretary, in setting out its alternative agenda in the run-up to the Tory party conference. Mr Portillo has contributed an article to Conservative Way Forward's quarterly magazine. The next issue is expected in time for next week's conference in Blackpool. The article is thought to steer clear of the current argument within the party over tax and spending. But further high-profile ministerial support for the group could undermine party managers' hopes that conference will provide the basis for a political revival at a time when prime minister John Major is under severe pressure to reassert his leadership credentials. It has already emerged that three ministers, including Mr Peter Lilley, Social Security Secretary, are to speak at conference meetings organised by Conservative Way Forward. The magazine's most recent issue in August contained a vigorous attack on Mr Major's leadership from Lord Parkinson, the Conservative Way Forward chairman. Mr Portillo's article is expected to focus on the long-term, setting out a Conservative agenda for the 1990s aimed at building on the last decade's achievements to further reduce the size of the public sector and empower individuals. Mr Major is expected to use the conference to force a show-down with right-wing rebels.</p>

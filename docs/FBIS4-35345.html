			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Sanaa AL-THAWRAH editorial of 30 May; from the </F> "News Follow-Ups" program]    [Text] In its editorial today, AL-THAWRAH comments on the  attempts to circumvent the Yemeni legitimacy and will. The  paper says: Some quarters' attempts to circumvent the Yemeni  will came in the wake of recent national developments which  proved that the Yemeni state has restored its influence and  prestige in the face of the secessionists' attempts to exhaust  the state and weaken its capabilities and authorities during  these past months of the crisis, which is part of a foreign and  domestic scheme to exhaust Yemen and dismember its new  democratic entity. Hence, the suspicious moves are a reaction  to Yemen's ability to maintain its unity in the face of the most  difficult and critical circumstances. They are also an attempt  to reverse the negative results of the unity enemies' wagers on  dismembering Yemen through igniting a comprehensive war and  involving the people in a civil strife. However, this attempt  has ended in utter failure.    Yemen has emerged from its bitter experience like the sphinx  from the ashes. Everyone, here and abroad, has come to the  conclusion that the unity and the state of law and order are  neither theories nor slogans intended for boasting. Rather,  they a realistic and firm fact that possesses all requirements  of progress, self-protection, and survival throughout Yemen.  This has been proved by the recent confrontation of the  secession drama. The entire international community has come to  realize that the director and characters of this drama are  thieves and advocates of terrorism. Thus, the unity remained  while they hid themselves like rats to look for new pretexts to  destroy this national entity.    The paper adds: When Yemen appeared before the world as a  state with a fair cause, the international community understood  the peculiarity of the recent events and the intentions of the  forces fanning the war and the secessionist drive. Those  forces, after they wagered on erasing Yemen from the map, were  stunned to see Yemen rising to confront the challenges with  greater ability than they anticipated.    Although the UN Security Council permanent member states'  efforts have exposed some parties' malicious intentions, what is  reassuring is that throughout its history, the United Nations  has never supported any secessionist trend in any country.  States' domestic affairs are respected by the permanent UN  Security Council member states. The U.S., British, and French  representatives' rejection of the draft resolution proposed by  some states served as a political reprimand. This rejection  also exposed some parties' desire to punish Yemen for its unity,  faith in democracy, and respect for human rights. Hence the UN  Security Council representatives' emphasis on the need to  respect Yemeni unity, maintain its constitutional institutions,  preserve the democratic course of the Republic of Yemen, and to  resolve differences through peaceful means, considering that  what is going on in Yemen is a domestic affair. In this  context, brother 'Abdallah al-Ashtal, Yemeni permanent UN  representative, cautioned that any initiative that does not  emphasize Yemeni unity and compliance with constitutional  legitimacy is completely rejected and deemed interference in  Yemeni internal affairs.    Concluding its editorial, AL-THAWRAH says: This serious  strife has made it clear to the world that in the course of the  war imposed on Yemen, all attempts of custodianship have been  foiled. Those who are concerned for the interests of their  peoples and states should realize that Yemen will devote its  efforts to comprehensive development now that it has become in  possession of all that is needed to protect it. We will bless  others' moves to defend their states' sovereignty and  development programs. Yemen, which knows the dangers of  destruction, is fully aware of the importance of development.  Our entire people are confronting the secessionist war. This  proves that the entire Yemeni people and their Armed Forces  totally believe that defending unity and supporting the  constitutional legitimacy are the only way to secure economic  and social construction and national development.    The will of our one people in the Republic of Yemen and the  forces of constitutional legitimacy have triumphed. We are well  aware of the facts of history. It has never happened in the  history of the Security Council that it supported any  secessionist movements or groups. Rather, the Security Council  supported Nigeria's efforts when it confronted a secessionist  group in the early seventies. It also supported Congo against  the separation of one of its regions in the sixties. According  to UN officials, it has never happened in the history of the  United Nations that it interfered in any country's domestic  affairs. Yemeni unity has been achieved by the will of the  entire Yemeni people. If there is a small clique attempting to  impose its secessionist ideas on the majority of the Yemeni  people, the Yemeni people have every right to address their  domestic problems in a manner that preserves their unity,  security, and stability.</p>

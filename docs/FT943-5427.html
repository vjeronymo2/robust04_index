			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The temptations of Utopia: In search of a perfect world, 25 'Freelanders' set sail for Africa 100 years ago. JDF Jones tells how it all ended in disaster One hundred years ago this summer, two dozen Europeans of different nationalities, members of 'The Freeland Association', attempted - and failed  -to establish a Utopian 'Freeland' in East Africa, on the slopes of Mount Kenya. Not that they ever got within sight of that wonderful mountain which sits on the Equator - they never set foot beyond the exotic Indian Ocean island of Lamu, where they arrived on All Fools Day, 1894, and sat there sweltering in the Big Rains for three months before they gave up. Their expedition is remembered today only as one of the smallest footnotes of colonial history, forgotten almost at once by the chancelleries of Europe and by the people of Lamu. But the story of Freeland, inasmuch as we can rescue it from obscurity, has its own particular fascination, coming as it did just before a century whose political history was to be dominated by the great Marxist experiments. It was just one of countless examples of our human attraction to Utopias: the Freelanders were a very minor example of the phenomenon, a ridiculously tiny group in comparison with the millions who were to be involved in the Marxist revolutions, but their story illustrates the temptation, and the inevitable frustration, of the journey. The Freeland movement flourished briefly in Europe in the early 1890s under the inspiration of Dr Theodor Hertzka, a not-too-nutty Austrian economist and visionary who, in an extraordinary book Freeland: A Social Anticipation, described in extreme detail how a new and splendid community might be achieved if interest rates were abolished and land held in common. He chose to describe this revolutionary social order - which was to be accompanied by a host of other high-minded reforms - by setting it in the hinterland of East Africa, which he apparently assumed was under-populated and therefore available to newcomers. The Freeland movement managed to attract adherents from across the fringes of radical Europe - anarchists alarmed by the police crackdown throughout the continent, revolutionaries on the brink of admitting defeat, socialist idealists disillusioned by the drift into conventional and cautious political processes - and, it seems, more sober citizens who were looking for a new life. Astonishingly, Dr Hertzka managed to persuade the Foreign Office in London to grant permission to the Freeland Association to send a pioneer party to establish a settlement near Mount Kenya: hence the arrival of 25 Austrian, German, English, French, Dutch and Scandinavian members, of whom two were women, on Lamu Island on April 1. 'Freeland' shared many of the characteristics of Utopian movements worldwide and across the centuries. For instance, its adherents were inspired by the vision of a single leader or sage - the counterpart of Karl Marx, the said Dr Hertzka, of whom little else has been remembered. Dr Hertzka had never been anywhere near East Africa - though he must have read the self-regarding memoirs of Carl Peters, the vicious German imperial adventurer of the time - but he does not hesitate to expound, over hundreds of pages, a ridiculous farago of fantasies about life on the African savannah: zebras will be trained to draw carriages, elephants will be amenable to domesticity like their Indian counterparts, the Masai maidens will embrace chastity, their warriors will lay down their spears and don tunics of Grecian style, criminals will reform, wives will be faithful, drunkenness will vanish, nihilism will wither away, hundreds of thousands of European disciples will soon flock to Freeland. There were plenty of people who read the good doctor's prophecies in 1892, either in German or in the English edition, and joined the various branches of the Freeland Association in the principal cities of Europe. In 1894, 25 of them sailed for Lamu Island. These Freelanders were radicals, as Utopianists usually are. They were eager for a vision of the future - a better future. They were also, we may guess, in retreat from their own European world. But the particular fascination of the Freelanders is that they were emigrants who rejected the motivations of their age. This was a decade when millions of people were leaving Europe to make a new life overseas  - in the United States, in South America, in the Antipodes, in Southern Africa. Many of these millions, probably most, left the poverty and impediments of Europe in order to seek economic success. The Freelanders were not like this: they left Europe in order to get away from the norms and ambitions of bourgeois society; they were trying to start again. Of course, 'Freeland' was a disaster. The detail of what happened has been lost but we know that the pioneer expedition never managed to get away from Lamu - an island whose exotic and decadent charms have been famous in the Indian Ocean for centuries (the local speciality, then as now, was transvestites). The Freelanders had arrived at the wrong time of year; the rains were imminent; the Tana River which they proposed to use as their route to the Highlands (utterly unrealistically because the Tana is not navigable) was in flood; the wild behaviour of their members offended the local community, which was and is strictly Islamic, with the women in deep purdah. There is today only the faintest folk memory of the Freelanders on the island: they are remembered for urinating from the rooftops on to the pedestrians in the narrow streets, for shooting water pots off the heads of servant girls, for carousing and drinking and for the immodest dress of the women. They hung around in Lamu for a few months, their morals and their behaviour degenerating in the uncomfortable heat of the 'off' season, until the British authorities lost patience and ordered the cancellation of the expedition and the disbandment of their association. Some of the Freelanders went home, where Dr Hertzka, who had not actually accompanied his disciples, admitted the failure of his Utopia; rather more of them went elsewhere in Africa, to Tanganyika, Rwanda, Mashonaland, the Transvaal. Perhaps some of them could not face going home after such a rapid humiliation, perhaps some of them could not risk it - an expedition of this sort would have included adventurers and rogues as well as idealists and socialists. So the Freelanders were soon forgotten. But the moral of this tiny episode, this abortion of an equatorial jaunt by a small bunch of fantasists, niggles away. If these Utopian projects seem invariably to fail, why have there been so many? What is it in the make-up of morally-aware and not-necessarily-foolish people that tempts us to venture out so rashly to seek to make a reality out of manifest fiction? Did the Freelanders seriously think that the African tribes of the Kenya Highlands would welcome them? The explanation must be that it is too easy to invent Utopias, to dream. Occasionally that dream is so persuasive that it comes to be implemented and offered up to the experience of reality. Always, the dream fails, whether of Dr Hertzka or Karl Marx, Freeland or Soviet Russia, the Third Reich or Apartheid. Better to be Plato or More, Fourier or Butler, Proudhon or Morris, Bacon or Coleridge, and remain in the library. Dr Hertzka's tragedy was that, in the summer of 1894, Freeland was essayed. Freeland, a novel by JDF Jones based on these events of 1894, has been published by Sinclair-Stevenson (Pounds 14.99).</p>

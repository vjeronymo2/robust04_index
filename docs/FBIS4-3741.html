			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["BW News" report: "Two-Year Bonds Sell Fast; City Meets </F> Target Early"]    [Text] Shanghai has met its target for selling 1994  two-year State treasury bonds sooner than expected.    The value of distribution contracts between city financial  departments and local State treasury bond wholesalers has  reached 4 billion yuan ($460 million).    Shanghai Finance Securities Co. undertook to market 1  billion  yuan ($115 million) in bonds, taking the largest distribution  share.    The Shanghai branch of the Industry and Commercial Bank of  China took on the sale of 600 million yuan ($69 million) in  bonds to rank second. Next were International Securities Corp  and Haitong Securities Corp.    More than half of the 4 billion yuan ($460 million) in bonds  have already been sold.    The rapid sales of two-year bonds should stimulate sales of  three-year treasury bonds, sources said.    According to statistics from the city's major financial  institutions, about 770 million yuan ($80 million) in three-year  bonds have been sold so far.</p>

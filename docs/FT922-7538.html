			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: Arianespace celebrates its quiet successes - The satellite launch group has earned a reputation for reliability Arianespace, the successful European satellite launch company, faces increasing competition as today it celebrates two symbolic achievements  - its 50th launch and its 100th contract. When the group was set up by a French-led consortium of private and state-owned companies 12 years ago, critics saw Arianespace as a Euro-eccentric, proposing to put satellites into orbit on expendable space rockets at a time when the US space shuttle seemed to be the space vehicle of the future. Quickly, Arianespace confounded the doubters by emerging as a serious competitor, taking more than half of the Dollars 1.15bn western market for commercial satellites by the mid-1980s. The lion's share of the rest goes to three US groups: General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, and Martin Marietta. The space shuttle, which stopped commercial flights after the 1986 Challenger tragedy, has grabbed the world's imagination over the past week with its dramatic satellite rescue. Ariane has made a less exciting but important name for itself as one of the most dependable commercial launchers in the world, says Mr Charles Bigot, Arianespace chairman. Now, the French-led group makes on average of seven to eight flights a year from the European Space Centre in French Guiana, its most recent being a twin satellite launch for France Telecom and Inmarsat, the international marine telecommunications organisation. Last year, its sales jumped by nearly 50 per cent to a record FFr5.87bn (Dollars 1.08bn), on which net profits rose by 14 per cent to FFr154m. Mr Bigot is confident that the European group will be able to stick to its target of at least holding market share in the years ahead. The delays imposed on the French-supported Hermes shuttle do not affect Arianespace's commercial satellite business, he points out. With a backlog of orders for 33 launches worth FFr15bn, Arianespace has enough work to keep it busy for three years. But there could be one or two bumps on the way. An important German client has just become the first company from a Arianespace member country to buy a cheaper launch elsewhere. US competition is intense, and the whole industry is anxious over the threat of being undercut by Russia's gigantic and under used space programme. Arianespace is owned by aerospace and electronics companies from the 12 European countries that include its main customers. French state and private groups are a long way in the majority, reflecting Aerospatiale's position as Arianespace's lead contractor for rocket building and design. Germany comes second, with 18.6 per cent. So it was that a recent decision by Deutsche Telekom, the German public telephone service, to choose McDonnell Douglas to launch its next telecommunications satellite created consternation at the French-based company. Mr Bigot regrets the move, which he attributes to Deutsche Telekom's desire to show its independence in the wake of German telecommunications deregulation. McDonnell Douglas helped by pitching its prices low, he estimates. 'We think they should be more circumspect in the future and give preference to Ariane,' says Mr Bigot. After all, he points out, the US government and its agencies give preference to US companies to the extent that it is almost impossible for Arianespace even to place a bid for such contracts. This matters, since satellite launches for the US administration represent two thirds of the entire western civil and government market, he says. Competition rules have long been a source of friction between the European group and its US rivals. Arianespace's US competitors can charge most of their launch centres' fixed costs to the government. They only have to pay by themselves an extra percentage to cover any commercial business which they take on. Arianespace, by contrast, simply charges government clients by the number of launches they use. Since 15 per cent of Ariane's flights are for governments, while its US rivals get 80 per cent of their orders from the US government, the European group is at a clear disadvantage. Competition rules also need to be agreed with Russia, the inheritor of the former Soviet Union's space programme, says Mr Bigot. THE European space industry is facing a recession during the next two years because of difficulties in its two main markets - space telecommunications and large European Space Agency programmes, writes Paul Betts. This is the conclusion of the latest annual study of the European space industry by the Paris-based Euroconsult group. Although industry figures for 1991 have not yet been released, first estimates indicate a slowdown in growth last year to be followed by recession this year and in 1993. The survey says the slowdown in the telecommunications satellite business and the intensification of competition in the international market has posed a significant challenge for European satellite manufacturers. Over the past 18 months, only two of the 27 civil telecommunications satellites ordered internationally were awarded to European prime contractors, although this was in part offset by subcontracting work on several satellites under US prime contractorship. But telecommunication satellites are expected to remain a key market for the European industry. The report expects this market to rebound in the mid-1990s as recently launched satellite systems will have to be renewed. European Space Industry, 1992 edition.

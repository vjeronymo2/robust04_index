			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SILVER, LINDROTH PREMIERES AT JAPAN AMERICA THEATRE  </P> <P> Fresh hope, the kind of optimism associated with the advent of spring, rose  again at the latest event by the Los Angeles Philharmonic's New Music Group  Monday night at Japan America Theatre.  </P> <P> And, appropriately on the eve of a change of seasons, that optimism was not  misplaced Monday.  </P> <P> Five works by North American composers, works dating from 1974 to 1990, were  heard, three of them utilizing instrumental ensembles numbering over 20  players. And all five gave pleasure.  </P> <P> Most engaging was the piece receiving its world premiere performance, Sheila  Silver's "Dance of Wild Angels," a 17-minute, tuneful, motif-laden work of easy  and old-fashioned accessibility.  </P> <P> Closer inspection, i.e., further hearings, may reveal esoteric or crafty inner  goings on in this composition; a first encounter gleaned surface charms hard to  resist. David Alan Miller led 21 well-employed players.  </P> <P> At one-third the length of Silver's piece, and using only half the players,  Lindroth's "Stomp" (1988) accomplishes similar fascination. It is a work of  apparent perpetual motion, moving along steadily and sometimes irritatingly. At  times it becomes noisy; at no time is it not percussive and colored by seeming  belligerence. But it stops short of causing hostility in the listener. Jacob  Druckman, the other conductor on this program, led a punchy performance.  </P> <P> Druckman's own "Lamia," a dramatic essay for singer and a large body of  instruments, ended this program in an energetic, compulsive manner. Mixing  texts -- words dealing with witchcraft -- in several languages, the 19-minute  piece boldly describes a world of magic and incantation in a rich musical  vocabulary. Mezzo-soprano Nancy Assaf was the assured soloist.  </P> <P> With the composer present, Michael Daugherty's "Snap!" a pops-derived, eclectic  confection of real complexity yet simple profile, opened the evening in a  hyperactive way.  </P> <P> The small item here, Rand Steiger's "ReSonata" for cello and piano, did not  suffer in this company. Merely eight minutes in length, it represents one part  of a projected, three-movement work. If the rest turns out this tight and  compelling, the total will command attention. Cellist Gloria Lum and pianist  Gloria Cheng were the authoritative protagonists.  </P></p>

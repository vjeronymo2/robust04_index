			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: VW up slightly to DM1.04bn VW, the German car group, announced an unchanged dividend of DM11 per ordinary share and DM12 per preference unit after net profits for last year showed only a slight rise, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. VW said net profits in 1990 were slightly above the DM1.04bn (Dollars 619m) of 1989. Its earnings suffered last year from tougher competition, problems in South America, and the strong D-Mark. In the first nine months, pre-tax profits were 19 per cent lower at DM1.7bn.</p>

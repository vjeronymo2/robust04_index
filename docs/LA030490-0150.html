			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> The Santa Monica City Council is behind the times. While the yoke of oppression  has been lifted from the shoulders of East Germans, Czechs, Hungarians and  Poles, Santa Monica landlords are still fighting to regain their property  rights (Times, March 1).  </P> <P> If capitalism and democracy have been revived in these countries, it might work  in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Even President Gorbachev has just pushed through a measure for the private use  of land by Soviet citizens. The economic failures of Marxism are as evident in  Santa Monica as they are in the Eastern Bloc countries. As economic freedoms  are restored to these nations, Santa Monica apartment owners, at the least,  deserve the return of their property rights. Gorbachev's reforms, if emulated  in Santa Monica, would most likely provide for the elimination of the Rent  Control Board; then, hundreds of boarded-up apartments would return to the  rental pool where they belong.  </P> <P> NORMAN JACOBSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> The Westside Section of The Times welcomes all viewpoints from readers about  issues on the Westside.

A statement distributed by the  two parties and printed by local Jerusalem newspapers said armed  'Arafat loyalists burst onto university grounds, smashing  furniture and tearing up election posters. They then threatened  the committee supervising the vote, saying that unless they left  the campus within a quarter of an hour they would wreck their  cars. The committee left to prevent infighting.    The statement called this behavior a brazen violation of all  our values. It is a flagrant breach of all democratic values  and a form of terrorism, for which the 'Arafat supporters must  be held responsible. We urge all nationalist and Islamic forces  to assume their responsibilities toward such behavior, and we  call on the committee to set a new election date for next  Friday, 11 February, the statement said.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCK DRIVER IS BLAMED IN FATAL TEXAS BUS CRASH  </P> <P> The driver of the truck that hit a school bus in Texas last fall, sending it  into a water-filled pit and killing 21 students, should have been able to stop  despite faulty brakes, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The small number of emergency exits -- only two -- contributed to the deaths,  the board said. NTSB Chairman James Kolstad said driver Ruben Perez "did not  respond soon enough and he did not respond aggressively enough."  </P></p>

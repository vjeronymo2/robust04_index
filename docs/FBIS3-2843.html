			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, a top  leader of the Chinese Communist Party, said that development and  stability are two major issues for Tibet-related work and that  establishment of a socialist market economy will provide new  opportunities for economic development in the region.    "We must further emancipate the mind and guide Tibet's  economic development with new concepts and new thinking that are  suited for a socialist market economy," he said.    He asked local officials to take Tibet's special conditions  into consideration, do everything in accordance with the reality  of Tibet, always serve the interests of Tibetan people, promote  Tibet's development, maintain its stability and continuously  carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle.    "The party Central Committee and the State Council have  always attached great importance to Tibet work, having adopted a  series of preferential policies and flexible measures for the  Tibet region," he said.    During the process of developing a socialist market economy,  the central authorities will continue to pay great attention to  economic development and social progress in Tibet, he said.    He expressed the belief that Tibet will have a bright future  thanks to the correct leadership of the party Central Committee,  hard struggle by the Tibetan people and support from the rest of  China.    Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,  expressed the views in a group discussion with Tibetan deputies  to the National People's Congress now in session in the Chinese  capital.    Talking about Premier Li Peng's government work report  delivered yesterday at an NPC session, Hu said the report spells  out the national task of seizing development opportunities,  deepening reform, opening the country wider to the rest of the  world, promoting economic development and maintaining social  stability.    "All our work must be concentrated on fulfilling this  central  task," he said. "And it is imperative to promptly solve  problems that should crop up amid continuous progress."</p>

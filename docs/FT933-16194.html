			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: Taiwanese expand in Hong Kong HUA NAN Commercial Bank of Taiwan is to upgrade its operations in Hong Kong to provide financial services to Taiwanese companies operating in China from Hong Kong. Mr H. T. Chien, deputy general manager at the bank's Taipei headquarters, said that Hua Nan's application to strengthen its presence was approved by Hong Kong's Executive Council last week. Hua Nan, which is one of Taiwan's leading state-run banks, opened a representative office in Hong Kong in 1988 and submitted an application to upgrade to a branch in April 1993, after receiving permission from Taiwan's ministry of finance. Three state-run banks have applied to upgrade representative offices into branches, including the Bank of Taiwan, the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank Ltd and the First Commercial Bank. Hua Nan said the new branch would primarily provide trade finance to Taiwan companies with offices in Hong Kong. More than 10,000 Taiwan companies are estimated to have investments in China. Most use overseas Chinese-run banks or foreign banks in Hong Kong for financial services in the triangular trade between Taiwan, Hong Kong and China. The bank will also assist such companies secure working capital for freight fees, providing letters of credit, foreign exchange transactions and deposit services. The bank's ability to provide such services will be boosted by new rules, effective from May, allowing overseas branches of Taiwan banks to have business ties with overseas branches of mainland-based banks. 'We should be able to attract many of the Taiwan firms as they are our customers here,' the bank said. 'We are optimistic that we can operate the Hong Kong branch profitably from the very beginning.' The branch will open in the Central Plaza Building in Wanchai by end-September, manned by seven staff members from Taiwan and some locally-hired employees. Its manager will be the current head of the representative office, Mr T. C. Wu.</p>

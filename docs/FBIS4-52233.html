			<p>BFN     [Text] Police in southern border provinces have been  ordered to keep a close watch on Muslims and to stop them from  gathering in Hat Yai to protest the arrest on Wednesday of four  Muslim teachers suspected of involvement in eight different bomb  attacks between May 1991 and March 1994.    Police in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat were ordered to try  to  stop people gathering in either Chana District or Hat Yai town.  A checkpoint will be set up at Don Yang intersection in  Pattani's Nong Chik District and at an adjoining area in  Narathiwat and Pattani Provinces.    Police fear Muslims will come to Hat Yai in their thousands  today to see off relatives leaving for Mecca on the annual  pilgrimage and take the opportunity to stage a protest. This  will make it difficult for police to differentiate between  protesters and relatives.    The four suspects, all Islamic teachers in Chana District,  were arrested in Chana District on Wednesday. They are Sa-ali or  Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or Mut Loman, Suroma or  Daman Leduwi, and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya Hamanapden. The four  have been charged with premeditated murder, rebellion and  possessing ammunition illegally in addition to the bombing  charges.    Region 9 Police chief Lt. Gen. [Lieutenant General] Michai  Nukunkit said police had acquired sufficient evidence to believe  the four and 20 others still at large took part in eight  different bomb attacks as follows:    -- An explosion at a bridge in Bacho District of  Narathiwat Province on May 13, 1991;    -- A bomb attack on a train in Chana District of Songkhla  Province on May 25, 1992;    -- A bomb explosion at Hat Yai Railway Station in Songkhla  Province on August 13, 1992, killing three people and wounding  75 others    -- A bomb attack on a marine police boat in Pattani  Province on December 6, 1993;    -- An explosion at Dechanuchit Bridge in Pattani on  December 25, 1993;    -- A bomb attack on a train in Songkhla's Chana District  on March 8, 1994;    -- An explosion in front of a bookstore in Hat Yai on  March 20, 1994, and    -- An explosion on the rail track in Na Mom Sub-district  in Songkhla Province on March 30, 1994.    Pol Lt. Gen. Michai claimed the four and their colleagues  were part of an organization with links to a foreign country.  The evidence against them was strong enough for police to be  certain they are not scapegoats, he said. He alleged the group  had also worked together with the Pattani United Liberation  Organization (PULO) with the objective of overthrowing the  Government.    Pol Lt. Gen. Michai does not believe the group is  responsible  for torching 36 southern schools on August 1 last year. Police  will continue to gather more evidence to nail the suspects, he  added.    Police Director General Prathn Santipraphop said in Bangkok  the four were certainly not "scapegoats" as police had acquired  hard evidence against them. Arrests of "scapegoats" might have  been widespread in the past, but not this time, he said.    Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wuthimathi said the strong evidence  meant the four suspects would face legal action despite being  Islamic teachers. The four, who studied religion abroad, will  be held for further legal processing in Songkhla. They will not  be granted bail until questioning is finalised. said Mr. Yuwat.    Asit Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of  Songkhla, said the people of Chana District did not believe the  four suspects were guilty as charged. They said it was not  possible for the four to have conducted such serious crimes, he  said.    Fourth Army Region Commander Lt. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya  said  he did not believe there would be an uprising over the arrest of  the four Islamic teachers because all wrongdoers must face legal  action. He said he had not received a detailed report of the  arrest but believed the police must have sufficient evidence to  take such action.    Rewat Ratchamukda, chairman of the Islamic Committee of  Narathiwat, said the arrest had sparked unrest among Muslim  people. Never before have Islamic teachers been suspected of  involvement in sabotage and there are doubts surrounding the  arrest of the four, he said. Mr. Rewat said he hoped  authorities would provide the suspects with due justice. He  asked fellow Muslims to cooperate with authorities to prevent  possible interference by a "third hand" in causing further  divisiveness in the country.</p>

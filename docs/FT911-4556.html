			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Teachers to have pay review body: Government's policy reversal is dependent on unions agreeing to a no-strike deal AN INDEPENDENT pay re-view body to assess teachers' pay and conditions is to be set up later this year and could lead to a significant increase in salary levels. The setting up of the review body is conditional on teachers not resorting to strike action. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, who ann-ounced the sharp reversal in policy to the Commons yesterday, expects the body to be in place for next year's pay settlement. The review body is intended to give teachers parity of treatment with doctors, dentists, nurses and the armed forces, who have similar boards. The Teachers' Pay and Conditions Bill, which would have restored negotiations between teachers' unions and local authority employers, is to be withdrawn, and a new bill will be introduced shortly. The about-turn in policy signals the government's determination to enhance the status of teachers as promised by Mr John Major during his campaign for the Conservative party leadership last year. Five of the six main teachers' unions gave broad support to Mr Clarke's announcement. 'This is a step forward; we are very pleased indeed,' said Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, the second largest of the unions. The National Union of Teachers remained opposed. Mr Doug McAvoy, its general secretary, said he 'totally rejected' the review body. 'It will be hidebound to the government. And it will be the only pay review board which covers conditions as well as pay,' he added. School teachers' pay should be such as to 'recruit, retain and motivate' high-calibre teachers, Mr Clarke said in his statement to the Commons. He pledged that the government would implement the review body's recommendations unless there were 'clear and compelling' reasons to the contrary, but made its establishment conditional upon the teacher unions not taking strike action on matters within its remit. 'My concern is that we should have a well-qualified and well-paid teaching force . . . The body will not be subject to a pre-determined financial constraint,' Mr Clarke said. He also stressed the need for 'maximum flexibility' in teachers' pay to reflect local labour-market conditions and good classroom performance. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's ed-ucation spokesman, attacked the 'no strike' condition, and condemned the proposed body as a 'breach of faith with the teaching profession' but refrained from outright opposition.

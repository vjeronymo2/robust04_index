			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (14): A gift for order, serenity and logic  -Finnish design should not be ignored, though it is out of the limelight The glory days of Finnish design are, for the moment at least, over. Way back in the 1950s and 1960s, anybody who knew anything at all about design knew that the Finns were much of what modern design was at. Though Finland came into design prominence later than its northern neighbours, Sweden and Denmark, the impact it made was huge. Alvar Aalto's beautifully lucid and tranquil designs, often based on laminated blond Finnish beechwood, from the 1930s found a new audience in the young Europeans hungry for a new aesthetic after the dreary war years. Eero Aarnio's chairs became models of ergonomic rectitude. Designers such as Tapio Wirkkala and Timo Sarpaneva brought a new approach to glass-making and bounced upon the international stage at the Milan Triennales during the 1950s. But it was probably the colourful cotton textiles of Marimekko that made the biggest impact round the world. Her fresh, joyful, sunny approach brought a new innocence and vivacity to the business of weaving textiles. Today the works of these designers may be no less beautiful or attractive but they are somehow, subtly, out of tune with the times. In spite of an inherent feel for quality combined with simplicity and a deep aversion to pretentiousness, Finnish design currently seems to be out of the limelight. A look through the International Design Yearbook for 1993 edited by Borek Sipek reveals scarcely a Finnish object - during the 1950s and 1960s this would have been unheard of. Nevertheless, behind the scenes, all is not lost. The high-profile names may not be there (this is currently a niche market for the Italians and, surprise, surprise, the British) but profitable, if less starry, markets are being developed in office, school and other contract areas. These have always been particularly suited to the Finnish gift for order, serenity and logic. Isku, for instance, uses light Finnish birch and pine for shelving, simple, orderly chairs and tables, while Lepo Product's Paletti collection of chairs, tables, office furniture, lamps and storage units is durable, sturdy and much in demand among interior designers. Even though Finland is unlikely ever to prove a rival to Paris, Milan or New York, it is building up a surprisingly successful and profitable business in clothing. Exports have grown continuously and steadily. The opening of the Russian market has given the clothing industry a big boost but ranges such as Luhta skiwear have built a steady international following for their combination of practicality, fashionability and reasonable prices. Anne Linnomaa had built up a niche business, too, with her ecological clothing collections for the eco-aware. The company was producing simple, naturally dyed cotton clothing long before ecology became fashionable. Friitala has always been renowned for its exquisitely made and classically designed suedes and leathers. It has managed to walk that fine line between the classic and the modern, updating the suedes (reindeer and pig) and leather styles with cut and colour. Popular in St Petersburg, as well as Peking, it is concentrating on selling through specialty boutiques. Lapponia is Finland's biggest, most internationally successful jewellery company. It uses gold in a rich, almost sculptural way, combining it with aquamarines, opals, amethysts, tourmalines or pearls of diamonds if you wish, to make rings, brooches, necklaces and bracelets. Less ethnic in its appeal than Kalevala Koru and more contemporary in approach, it has an international following. Hackman Housewares has long been a byword for solid quality, sturdiness and clean lines. Its range of stainless steel, coated aluminium, copper and cast iron cookware is scarcely bettered anywhere. Though Finland is on the whole irredeemably associated with the contemporary, there are niche businesses that hark back, or perhaps more politely put, build on a more nostalgic past. J. Marttiini's hunting, fishing and camping knives, derive from a traditional way of life and have a strong, visual appeal even for those who will never gut a fish or skin a reindeer. Kalevala Koru makes jewellery that celebrates the myths and legends that are part of Finland's past. Many of the pieces are inspired by excavated artefacts - rings are intricately worked, a menagerie of animals ranging from serpents to horses and birds appears on brooches, rings, necklaces. Pectoral crosses based around the 'praying Mary' and Karelian ribbon winding are richly dramatic. Stones such as amethyst and spectrolite as well as rock crystal are combined with silver and bronze to produce jewellery with a distinct national identity. All the jewellery is made by the Women of Kalevala, a non-profit organisation formed to ensure that Finland's rich cultural history lives on in a vital way. The Nostalgia Home Collection looks as if it comes straight out of a quintessentially English conservatory - here are elegantly light and graceful shapes, tables, chairs, storage shelves, all made from lightweight, sandblasted and powderpainted iron, which could happily live indoors or out. Aalos managed to combine traditional woodworking skills with a contemporary approach to children's play in its beautifully crafted wooden toys all made from Finnish birch. Those who have forgotten, or those who are too young ever to have seen, Alvar Aalto's serene and classic furniture might like to know that Artek, the company which is forever linked with his name, is still going strong. As trends go in and out, Aalto's furniture may be more or less in fashion, but something about them endures. There is nothing that is modish or ephemeral about them. As long as men need seats to sit on, tables to eat off and quelque chose pour l'oeil' Aalto's furniture will live on.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: PowerGen Those looking for a duopoly can easily spot the similarities between PowerGen and National Power. Indeed, it is tempting to argue that the technical accounting differences which separate their earnings figures at the half-way stage are needed to tell the companies apart. After privatisation, however, PowerGen's shares traded at a premium as its management seemed more aggressive. That premium has disappeared since the coal row erupted. In part this may reflect disquiet at the robust criticism PowerGen's chief executive, Mr Ed Wallis, dished out over the continued operation of ageing nuclear stations. PowerGen's stations are also slightly better placed than National Power's to take imported coal, so if more domestic coal is burnt, the company will lose a marginal cost advantage. But these differences are dwarfed by a common interest. If the generators help the government with a larger coal deal, they are less likely to feel the hot breath of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

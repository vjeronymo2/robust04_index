			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRICE OF CRUDE OIL SURGES AMID FEARS;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: WORLD MARKETS REACT TO THE IRAQI THREAT. TRADERS FEAR SAUDI ARABIA MAY  BE ATTACKED NEXT.  </P> <P> Crude oil prices surged on world markets today as fears mounted that Iraq would  move against Saudi Arabia after establishing control over Kuwait.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures soared from the opening,  with the September contract gaining a record $2.34 to $25.45 in the first two  hours of trading.  </P> <P> The trading range, reflecting concerns that no one could tell where Iraq's  military machine would stop, fulfills Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's stated  wish for a barrel of oil at $25.  </P> <P> "Crude oil prices climbed steadily from the opening and scored gains almost by  the minute," said trader Peter Beutel, with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. "And the  market is still moving up, fast."  </P> <P> Crude oil prices gained $1.75 in the first hour of trading, steadily pushing up  refined products prices that soared in sympathy.  </P> <P> At noon, unleaded gasoline was quoted up 7.93 to 76.00 cents a gallon. Heating  oil was quoted up 6.21 cents to 70.90.  </P> <P> "The crude market rallied strongly on early fears that Iraq was massing troops  at the Saudi border," said Steve Platt, senior energy analyst with Dean Witter  Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. "Reports that the troops had crossed into Saudi  Arabia appeared not immediately correct but prices are moving up to include  this eventuality."  </P> <P> Traders and analysts said the market could see some corrections but prices were  likely to hold at a high level until the crisis in the Middle East is resolved.  They agreed that the most important factor likely to influence the market would  be the U.S. response to Iraq's aggressive policy.  </P> <P> "The crude oil price at $25 a barrel seems overdone at this stage, and the  barrel could shed $2, but it is likely to hold at the $23 level," Platt said.  </P> <P> In London, the spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded  international crude, was quoted at $23.25 a barrel today, up 86 cents from  Thursday, when the price rose $2 a barrel.  </P> <P> Stock prices also tumbled overseas in response to the Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 729.42 points,  ending the day at 29,515.76. The index lost nearly 593 points on Thursday.  </P> <P> Japan is especially vulnerable to the possibility of a disruption of energy  sources because it imports 99% of its oil. Traders there are concerned that the  oil price rise will take a heavy toll on Japanese business.  </P></p>

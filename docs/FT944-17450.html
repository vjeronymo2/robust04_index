			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Market crisis spurs probe into Hualon links Taiwan's monetary authorities yesterday launched an investigation into the extent of financial institutions' exposure to the Hualon group, a textile conglomerate, in the wake of the country's worst stock market crisis in two years. Four of the group's executives were detained on Thursday as they tried to leave the country after payments defaults triggered when underground financiers called in loans. Another was detained later. They are being held under suspicion of violating article 155 of the Securities and Exchange Act, which prohibits direct or indirect manipulation of share prices. The maximum sentence is seven years in prison or a TDollars 750,000 fine. Relative calm returned to the market, which fell by more than 4 per cent on Thursday. Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese legislator and Hualon's behind-the-scenes head, conceded he was not entirely blameless but said he could do nothing to resolve the matter until Ms Li Hsiu-fen, his top aide and manager of his share trading activities and one of the executives who has been detained, was released from detention to help clarify matters. Mr Oung enjoys virtual immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker. He launched his political career with his election to Taiwan's Legislative Yuan shortly after a similar share payments crisis in 1992 to which he was also linked. The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday defaults had been staunched at TDollars 7.6bn. Mr Day Linin, SEC chairman, said the incident, which sparked a share index dive of more than 7 per cent in two sessions, had been contained and would not precipitate instability. According to figures from the Central Bank of China, outstanding loans to Hualon's five listed companies alone amounted to at least TDollars 28bn at the end of August, newspapers reported. Loans from banks, bills finance companies and other formal financial entities to Hualon-Teijran were reported to total more than TDollars 10bn. Central bank officials could not be reached for comment. Brokers said it was impossible to estimate the group's borrowings from underground financiers. Market sources estimated Mr Oung has TDollars 4bn in cash on hand. Taiwan banks generally lend on the basis of full security, mostly in the form of real estate or equipment, but sometimes they hold securities as collateral. Market sources said some banks refused to lend to entities affiliated to the Hualon group following a similar share payments default crisis in autumn 1992. That resulted in default totalling TDollars 9.2bn. As well as being one of Taiwan's wealthiest men, Mr Oung is a powerful politician. He controls the parliament's finance committee and is said to have his own faction of a dozen or more legislators in the 161-seat legislature. He is an enigmatic character who sports a scraggly beard, dresses sloppily and is renowned for his retinue of attractive young women. 'Oung Ta-ming is very mysterious; you can't try to understand him using normal logic,' said a Taiwanese investment banking source. The analyst suggested that with Taiwan's closely-knit business and politics, there was likely to be more to the situation than met the eye. 'Anything related to politics here is not so simple - you can't just add one and one and come up with two,' he said. Hit by a global slump in the textile industry, Hualon-Teijran Corp posted net losses of TDollars 384mn (USDollars 14.2mn) in 1993, the fourth consecutive year in the red. The company forecasts a profit of TDollars 968mn (USDollars 35.85mn) in 1994. One of Taiwan's biggest textile companies, Hualon-Teijran's total assets stood at USDollars 1.7bn at the end of 1993. Total group assets are estimated at USDollars 2.5bn. Mr Lin Chen-kuo, the finance minister, said those responsible for the defaults crisis would be brought to justice.</p>

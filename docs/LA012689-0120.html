			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE BACK ASSAULT WEAPON CURBS, POLL FINDS  </P> <P> Law enforcement agencies throughout the state favor sharply restricting the  easy availability of military assault firearms, from an outright prohibition on  such guns as the AK-47 to stiffer controls on their purchase, a legislative  study said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The survey also found that 34% of the law enforcement agencies that  participated in the study indicated that assault-style rifles are replacing  handguns as the "weapon of choice" of street gangs and other criminals.  </P> <P> An additional 32% said the assault guns have "augmented" rather than replaced  revolvers and semiautomatic pistols, creating an even more formidable "firearm  arsenal of gang and criminal offenders."  </P> <P> However, the study by the Assembly Office of Research found that for 62% of the  responding agencies, sawed-off shotguns and rifles remain the most common crime  weapon.  </P> <P> Cary J. Rudman, the principal consultant, conducted the 2 1/2-month study at  the request of Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond). He said  questionnaires were sent to 496 state and local law enforcement agencies  throughout California. Of those, 206 (41%) responded.  </P> <P> By coincidence, the report was released one week after a gunman mowed down 34  children and a teacher in a Stockton schoolyard, killing five of the children,  with an AK-47. It also comes as battle lines are being drawn in the Legislature  over outlawing such firearms.  </P> <P> The report's immediate impact was unclear, because it appeared to give both  sides of the controversy additional ammunition. For example, spokesmen for  gun-owner organizations have long maintained that while semiautomatic military  weapons may be gaining popularity among criminals, the most popular guns remain  illegal sawed-off shotguns and civilian firearms.  </P> <P> On the other hand, advocates of a ban on the sale and manufacture of military  semiautomatics could cite a finding that during the last five years 63% of the  agencies reported a "significant increase" in the use of such weapons.  </P> <P> Rudman noted that the survey covered virtually all of the regions of California  and all kinds of law enforcement agencies -- urban, suburban and rural, police  and sheriff's departments, district attorneys and campus police forces.  </P> <P> The law-enforcement officials were asked what controls over assault weapons, if  any, they would recommend to the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Eleven percent responded that existing controls were adequate or that the  problem was not guns but "controlling" criminals who use such weapons. However,  31% favored outright prohibition of the manufacture, sale or possession of  assault weapons.  </P> <P> Twenty-nine percent favored applying the same restrictions on handguns to  assault weapons. A handgun purchaser must wait 15 days for the gun while the  state conducts a background check.  </P></p>

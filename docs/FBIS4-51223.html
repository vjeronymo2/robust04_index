			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei is not interested in resuming high-level  talks with Peking [Beijing] before issues stemming from the  Chientao [Qiandao] tragedy are settled, the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC] has announced. Before issues relating to the 31  March boat fire in which 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed as  well as other functional disputes are resolved, Taipei sees no  reasons of holding another round of chairman-level talks between  it and the Peking semi-official organization, sources quoted an  MAC official as saying. The official was apparently referring  to a meeting between the chairman of the Straits Exchange  Foundation [SEF], Ku Chen-fu, and his mainland counterpart Wang  Tao-han [Wang Daohan] of the Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. The two chairmen met in the  ground-breaking Ku-Wang Talks in Singapore last April. At that  time, they agreed to meet at least once a year to maintain  regular cross-strait contacts. However, the cabinet-level MAC,  which formulates Taiwan's policy towards the mainland, asserts  there is no point in moving on until the current issues are  finally resolved.</p>

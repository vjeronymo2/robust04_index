			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ian Rodger report: "$150m Held in UBS Account by Wife of </F> Suspected Drug Dealer"]    [Text] The pride of leading Swiss bankers in the care they  take to avoid handling dirty money has been bruised by  revelations that Union Bank of Switzerland [UBS] has been  holding $150m (102.7m pounds) in Zurich for an alleged Colombian  drug dealer for several years.    Although it is by far the largest amount of drug money  uncovered in a Swiss bank, the account is not the first of its  kind. In 1989 a parliamentary commission accused the public  prosecutor of laxity in pursuing narcotics investigations, and a  book with the cheeky title, La Suisse Lave Plus Blac  (Switzerland Washes Whiter), became a best-seller.    But this latest case is a surprise in the light of the  efforts made by Swiss authorities in the last few years to  outlaw money-laundering and force banks to stop dealing with  criminals.    The controversy began when Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de  Nasser,  who held the account, applied in January for permission to buy  her house near Geneva.    As with every foreigner, Swiss authorities insisted on  checking her background and bank references. With the help of  U.S. Drug Enforcement [Agency] officials, they identified her as  the wife of Mr Julio Nasser David, sought as a leading drug  trafficker in Colombia.    On February 23, Mrs Arana was arrested by Swiss police and  the account frozen. On Friday, charges were filed in Miami  against the couple for smuggling more than 55,000 1bs of cocaine  and 3 million lbs of marijuana into the United States from 1976.  Mr Nasser David is still at large, and the United States is  seeking Mrs Arana's extradition from Switzerland.    The UBS vice-president who opened and handled Mrs Arana's  account has been suspended and is being questioned by Zurich  police. The Swiss Bankers' Association due diligence committee  has launched an inquiry.    The big question among Zurich's banking community is how  UBS,  renowned as the most cautious and meticulous of banks, could  have failed for so long to have spotted trouble in the Arana  account. According to the authorities, she opened it in 1979  with a $50m cash deposit. UBS claims it carried out its normal  identity checks which showed the family had extensive shipping  and hotel interests in Colombia, so there was no reason to  suspect anything untoward.    "Not every Colombian is a potential money-launderer," says  Mr  Stephan Haeringer, a UBS director. However UBS admits that the  account manager must have been very naive.    Swiss laws and regulations on money-laundering were  tightened  in the late 1980's. Analists were asking why UBS, which has a  100-strong internal audit team, did not pay special attention to  accounts from places such as Colombia and Sicily with known  links to drug smuggling.    Apparently not much effort was required. A Zurich prosecutor  says that even the children in the Nasser Davids' home town of  Barranquilla were aware of the alleged drug links. The bank  says the account has been virtually inactive for many years, so  there was no reason for suspicion.    "The manager's superiors asked questions and got appropriate  answers," UBS said. "We are now checking to see if we have to  change our procedures."</p>

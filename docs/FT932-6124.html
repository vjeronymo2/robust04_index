			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Where have all the playboys gone? - Dear Giovanni or Alphonso, please call me soon TIME WAS when a girl could have fun. But take this sad tale from my diary of early this week. The scene: an intimate table at a smart Chelsea restaurant. The characters: one footloose brunette (me) and one renowned playboy (my date). Enter the opposition. 'Darling, how lovely to see you,' trills a bronzed blonde, draping her limbs over Freddie. 'How come you never call me these days? We must meet up.' Freddie smiles weakly. I scowl. It never used to be like this. You had Freddie for the evening. He lived only for you. Now, a sighting of this dreamy dish is as rare as caviar on a City bagel. And everyone wants a bite. They are welcome to it. He is droning on about the exams he is taking, the diet he is on and, worse, his latest girlfriend, in whose honour he is considering hanging up his prophylactic. (She is seriously rich). Each diary page reads the same. Freddie, Charlie, Hugo, James and Johnnie are otherwise engaged. Are playboys growing up, or what? I turn to my old friend Hannah - a Punjabi princess whose vowels make an Etonian sound like a taxi driver - for advice. She used to date 'Bungalow' Bill Wiggins, Joan Collins' walker, and has been wooed by cricketer Imran Khan as well as by the Duchess of York's duo, Steve Wyatt and John Bryant. Hannah should know. 'If you are really that desperate, the only place you will find one nowadays is an escort agency,' Hannah tells me. But even Sabre and Bearskin, a new company of former guards officers which specialises in supplying companions for women in need, does not answer its telephone to me. Five years ago, you could not go to nightclubs like Annabels or Tramp without tripping over a playboy waving a deck of gold cards and offering a dream of an evening. 'They would take you to some nice restaurant,' says Hannah. 'Nowhere particularly expensive, as they knew the food would be wasted on you because either you were dieting or too in love to eat.' Today, all you find is Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, Italians, aged businessmen muttering about the Pounds 200 bill, and wealthy tourists. What has gone wrong? Where are the playboys? Hannah again: 'It is no longer fashionable to be flashy and the recession has forced many to marry. Besides, to be a playboy you need a plaything, and so many girls are now going off and getting proper jobs that they can no longer say 'Yes, I'll come to Monte Carlo with you' at the drop of a hat. Look at Serena Stanhope, Viscount Linley's fiancee. She is still going to carry on working at Armani even though she clearly does not need to.' The 1980s bred playboys as fast as the 1990s have killed off estate agents. Rupert Deen was a case in point. He inherited a shipping fortune and lived for the sporting and social seasons. His butler wore leather jackets, and he had girls posted to his house in the country by chauffeur-driven car. Rupert was last sighted shopping forlornly for sausages in Safeways. His only hope is to find a rich woman and marry her. Loyal friends are reputed to have clubbed together to finance a Pounds 20,000 bet to encourage him. Those who are still in pocket have a more sober lifestyle. They have become serious about money, fret if they miss an appointment at the gym and are horribly likely to choose water when buying you an aperitif. Casinos are visited once a week and nightclubs once a fortnight. One socialite tells me: 'If I told you the names of any of the young playboys on the scene, they would mean nothing to you. They are all foreigners, and unexciting ones at that - the odd Swiss banker, a French art dealer. It is much more amusing to listen to retired playboys. They may wear toupees and be draped with an anaconda, but at least they tell stories of the real high life.' As for me, I have scratched all the Anglo-Saxon boys from my list. Giovanni, Massimo and Alphonso - I am painting my nails and waiting for you to call.</p>

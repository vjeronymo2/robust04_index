			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES: KUDOS FOR SOME OF THE COUNTY'S BEST  </P> <P> Several Orange County restaurants currently shine in the national/international  spotlight. The Aug. 31 issue of Wine Spectator, which unveils the worldwide  1990 grand awards for restaurants with great cellars, cites Five Crowns in  Corona del Mar and Mr. Stox in Anaheim. Both restaurants have been grand-award  winners since 1983.  </P> <P> Also, in the August issue of Bon Appetit, the "Western Insider" column features  Kachina restaurant in Laguna Beach. It calls owner David Wilhelm, who recently  opened Bistro 201 in Irvine and will debut Barbacoa in Newport Beach this fall,  "one busy restaurateur."  </P> <P> Four Orange County restaurants received top evaluations in the new, second  edition of Gault Millau's "The Best of L.A.," which reviews 1,300 restaurants  in southern California, from Santa Barbara to San Diego.  </P> <P> Rated on a scale of 1 to 20, Antoine at Le Meridien in Newport Beach received a  16.  </P> <P> The Dining Room of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Dana Point; Pavilion in the Four  Seasons Hotel, Newport Beach, and Pascal, Newport Beach, each rated a 15.  </P> <P> The Millau guides to fine dining have directed connoisseurs abroad for years.  Recently the guides expanded to focus on specific areas of the United States.  </P> <P> Pascal Olhats, by the way, will demonstrate his cuisine Sunday, Sept. 9, at the  Robert Mondavi Wine &amp; Food Center in Costa Mesa. From 10:30 a.m. to 12:30  p.m., he'll create several different French dishes from a menu for a black-tie  dinner at 7 that evening. Cost of the demo is $45; the dinner, $125.  </P> <P> The menu will include poached oysters with spinach and shallot cream, crayfish  pastry with lobster bisque, rack of baby lamb with cepes and garlic in white  wine sauce, plus a fruit gratin.  </P> <P> Five different reserve wines will complement the courses. The Mondavi center is  at 1570 Scenic Ave., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-4510. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH  </P></p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Boost for Travelers' shares as profits show advance SHARES in Travelers, the US insurance group hampered by a Dollars 5bn portfolio of property loans, jumped by Dollars 2 3/8 yesterday before settling back to close at Dollars 31 3/8 , a rise on the day of Dollars 1 3/8 , on news that profits had advanced strongly in the second quarter of the year. Operating profits reached Dollars 94m, compared with Dollars 72m in the first three months of the year and Dollars 58m in the second quarter of 1992. After a net investment loss of Dollars 1m (compared with gains of Dollars 8m in the same period a year earlier), after-tax income reached Dollars 93m, or 55 cents a share, against Dollars 66m, or 59 cents, a year earlier. The fall in earnings per share follows the issue of new shares last year to the financial services group Primerica, which now holds 27 per cent of the company. Strong gains in managed care, personal property/casualty insurance and financial services drove the advance, helped by cost-cutting and a concentration on higher-margin business. Operating profits in the managed care and employee benefits area rose to Dollars 26m, from Dollars 18m the year before, while personal property and casualty insurance returned Dollars 21m, up from Dollars 13m. Operating profits from financial services more than doubled, from Dollars 9m to Dollars 20m. 'Travelers' restructuring activities are resulting in stronger core businesses which are providing improved products and better service at significantly lower cost,' said Mr Edward Budd, chairman. Commercial property and casualty insurance suffered a decline at the operating level, from Dollars 42m to Dollars 38m, as price competition remained fierce and the fall in interest rates hit investment income. Under-performing property investments led to an operating loss of Dollars 5m (unchanged from the year before) on asset management and pension services. The bond market rally helped to push up unrealised profits on the company's bond portfolio by Dollars 132m to Dollars 1.3bn during the quarter.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MRS. BUSH CREDITS RADIATION WITH ENDING DOUBLE VISION  </P> <P> Barbara Bush said Tuesday that she no longer suffers double vision caused by  Graves disease.  </P> <P> "Last week was the first week without seeing double," she told reporters at the  White House.  </P> <P> "I think the radiation worked. That's very good news."  </P> <P> The First Lady was referring to radiation treatments that she underwent in  January. Aides had said it would take two to four months to determine whether  the treatment was effective.  </P> <P> However, Mrs. Bush said that she had not been evaluated recently by  specialists.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush was determined early last year to have Graves disease, an immune  system disorder that initially attacked her thyroid, causing dramatic weight  loss. It also caused eye irritation and double vision, especially in the  morning.  </P> <P> She talked with two reporters Tuesday morning after surprising tourists by  showing up in the White House main foyer, through which tours pass.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush held a small ceremony at the foot of the grand staircase to receive  new editions of "The Presidents of the United States" and "The First Ladies"  from White House Historical Assn. President Robert L. Breeden.  </P> <P> About 200 tourists gathered to hear Breeden and Mrs. Bush, who autographed  several copies of the books. She opened one to a page with her husband's  picture and held it up for the crowd's applause.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush said she was glad to be asked about her health, adding that reports  that she is not doing well are fabricated. She has acknowledged frustration  with the eye irritation, which persisted after the thyroid condition improved.  </P> <P> Doctors prescribed the steroid prednisone to treat her eyes and resorted to  radiation treatments when drugs had no effect.  </P></p>

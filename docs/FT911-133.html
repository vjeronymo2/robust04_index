			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (7): Academia and industry forge tighter links - Research &amp; Development BILL Hillier joined the Science and Engineering Research Council (Serc) six years ago 'to see if I could help to get academia to work with industry'. He moved from industry, Racal Redac, where he worked on computer-aided design, to become the co-ordinator of the Acme research programme at the Serc's headquarters in Swindon. Acme stands for Applications of Computers in Manufacturing. Serc invests about Pounds 7m a year through Acme in projects in universities and polytechnics in Britain. These projects cover the whole range of computing in manufacturing, from work on the control of robots, for example, through computer-aided design to production management. Mr Hillier says 'Acme activities emphasise research at universities into real problems that are industrially relevant.' The R &amp; D is not, though, day-to-day trouble shooting. Industry does not expect academia researchers to provide immediate answers to short-term problems. Mr Hillier says that Acme hopes to support research that will deliver useful results within two to five years. In all, Acme supports something like 135 projects. These range from small grants for visiting fellowship to large clubs with industry. The largest grants are for about Pounds 350,000 for three years. Serc launched the Acme programme six years ago. Since then it has awarded grants worth a total that is approaching Pounds 40m. The work, on about 400 projects, is in four main areas; advanced production machines, computer-aided engineering, manufacturing processes, and planning and management. In each Acme project, the Serc expects academic institutions to work closely with industrial partners. Industry may contribute financially to a project - it adds an average 15 per cent to the Serc's contribution - but in many cases, industry's contribution is not so much financial as in time and other resources. For example, companies sometimes provide materials for processing in university projects. Acme's projects cover a wide range of industries. For example, the Control and Robotics Group, part of the Department of Electronic Engineering at the university of Hull, is involved in several projects with the shoe and garment industries. The aim of this research is to develop automated manufacturing processes. In one research project at Hull, the group is developing a robotic work cell to assemble complete garments, in this case underpants. Each cell would have seven or eight machines performing a particular task on a garment before passing it on to the next stage. In the cell, robot vision system would recognise the parts and tell the machines what to do with them. A big problem with textiles is that the parts are flexible. This makes it difficult for an optical system to recognise the shape. 'Pick up a dishcloth and it doesn't look like a rectangle at all,' says Dr Gaynor Taylor, a researcher in the group. The industrial collaborator is Corah, a garment manufacturer that supplies Marks and Spencer. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop a production cell that can receive cut parts at one end and deliver finished garments from the other. In their research, the Hull group analyses the production process a step at a time. Another series of projects brings together researchers from the universities of Durham and Hull. Their industrial collaborator is British United Shoe Machinery (BUSM). Here the step-by-step approach is even more important because companies making shoes are not accustomed to investing large amounts in machinery. So the projects set out to automate individual steps of shoe production, with a particular emphasis on preparing the parts and sewing them together before they go on the final manufacturing stages. The aim of the project is not to develop prototype machines, says Mr Taylor. It is up to the machinery makers to develop commercial equipment. The research at Durham and Hull has concentrated on the use of electronic vision and image recognition equipment and other technologies to develop manufacturing and handling processes that do not have to be altered every time a company changes the style of the shoes that it is making. Mr David Reedman is on the receiving end of this research. He is manager of research for BUSM. 'Universities and polytechnics are very good at research but not at product development,' he says. Mr Reedman believes that projects with academic researchers can tell a manufacturer if a particular piece of technology will work in its industry. 'I ask 'Can I use this technology in Shoe making?'' he says. 'A research project which establishes quickly and efficiently that a new technology is unsuitable is just as successful, if not as acceptable, as one with a more positive outcome.' 'What you get out of the university research is usually a model that demonstrates some principle,' says Mr Reedman. It is then down to development engineers to turn the idea into commercial products. Earlier this month at a trade show in Germany, BUSM showed a prototype shoe stitching machine based on its work with the university research teams. Over the past five years, BUSM has benefited from grants totalling almost Pounds 450,000 for work at the two universities. 'I don't see how we can survive without the research,' says Mr Reedman. Acme supports a range of projects in the general area of computer aided design. Dr Bob Cripps at the university of Birmingham, works on the computer modelling of surfaces and how they behave in various manufacturing processes. One such project involved collaboration with Austin Rover on a phenomenon know as springback. When a piece of flat steel is pressed into a complex shape, a car bonnet for example, it takes up the exact shape of the press. But remove the pressure and the shape changes slightly. In the past, getting the right shape was more a black art than a science, according to Dr Bob Cripps who worked on the project. The Birmingham team computerised the whole process of design manufacture of complex components in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of springback. The idea was to be able to predict exactly how much of a change in shape a component would experience as it came out of a press. The work at Birmingham achieved its goal, the researchers could predict the amount of springback that would occur. However, in the process of computerising the manufacturing process, the problem of springback lessened. Another task facing manufacturers is to move products around in factories. In another Acme project, Professor Mike Brady of Oxford University has developed an automatic sensing system that can guide an unmanned vehicle around a factory. This Pounds 250,000 project, with four industrial collaborators including GEC and Thorn-EMI, has resulted in the development of a vehicle equipped with a laser-rangefinder and ultrasonic position detection. Sensors feed information into an on-board computer that can then pick a route around unexpected obstacles. Computerised hardware is an essential part of any manufacturing system. There are, however, other issues facing the manufacturer who wants to introduce new technology. This too is an area for academic research. Mr Mike Gregory is pioneering a new area of research - for academia at least. There is nothing new about research on the technology of manufacturing, engineering departments have been doing it since their beginnings. Researchers have also studied the social impacts of new manufacturing technology on the workplace, but they have yet to look seriously at the management of manufacturing. Mr Gregory believes that before a company can develop a manufacturing strategy, it needs to undertake a manufacturing audit. Companies need to design manufacturing systems that meet their business requirements. To achieve this, he says, 'We need more research into the interface between organisations and technology'. More research is only of value if the results reach industry. Mr Gregory's work has led to a booklet called Competitive Manufacturing, that is published by the Department of Trade and Industry. There are, though, gaps in the flow of information from R &amp; D on computers in manufacturing. The government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Acost) highlighted these gaps in its recent report called Advanced Manufacturing Technology. The report drew attention to the lack of co-ordination in the various activities in advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). 'The aggregation of the dispersed knowledge of AMT in the UK, both industrial and academic, together with the acquisition of international experience, can offer individual companies a valuable new resource,' says the report. Professor Lionel Maunder of the university of Newcastle, chairman of Acost's Engineering Technologies Committee, hopes that this report will lead to the creation of local centres where industry can seek information on advanced manufacturing technologies. It has prompted the DTI to enter into discussion with the Science and Engineering Research Council on the issue. Unfortunately, the Acme programme has been hit by the shortage of funds facing the Serc. The programme has to find savings of some 15 per cent. This will inevitably put pressure on the DTI's own R &amp; D programmes.</p>

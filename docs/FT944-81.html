			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Kim's balancing act - War and Peace (Warmongers and Peacemakers) It appeared at times during the past year that the South Korean president, Kim Young-sam, was hindering, rather than helping, the process to find a solution to the international dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme. As the US negotiated last autumn with North Korea to persuade it to return to the international nuclear safeguards treaty, Kim was describing as 'naive' Washington's conciliatory approach. He suggested at one point that the troubled North Korean economy should be allowed to collapse rather than being bolstered with international aid that would be granted in return for Pyongyang's compliance. The remarks by the 67-year-old president reflected the general frustration that South Koreans felt about the subordinate role their country was forced to play in the nuclear talks and the resulting agreement reached in October. North Korea, which regards its southern counterpart as a 'puppet state' of the US, had successfully demanded exclusive negotiations with Washington to settle the issue. Seoul's participation was limited to sending an observer to the talks in Geneva. Seoul's exclusion from the US-North Korean talks was considered a blow to the country's strong national pride. It was also taken as another sign that Koreans have not yet achieved full political mastery over their divided peninsula without meddling from outside powers. Feelings of betrayal also affected Seoul's attitude. 'How would you like it if your best friend was suddenly talking to your worst enemy,' said one presidential aide, referring to the US. Attempts by Seoul to influence the outcome also led to policy confusion. While Kim sounded hawkish at times, he also urged Washington to resist adopting a tough response when the US was contemplating a confrontation with North Korea earlier in the year. Although Kim was criticised for his inconsistent stance, his advisers contend that he was engaged in a delicate balancing act to avoid a deep split in his own government. He also wanted to prevent the nuclear issue leading to the possible break-up of the ruling Democratic Liberal party, which is still dominated by allies of the former conservative military government. 'President Kim could not appear to be too conciliatory to the North,' said one adviser. Kim also had to take account of public opinion. An estimated 7m South Koreans, one-sixth of the nation's population, are either refugees from North Korea or their descendants. Most of them are supporters of the ruling party and harbour strong anti-communist sentiments. Moreover, Kim has experienced the hostility of North Korea at first hand. His mother was killed in 1960 by North Korean infiltrators when they landed on his home island of Koje off the south-eastern coast of Korea. By adopting a firm position on the nuclear issue, Kim has probably done much to persuade the Korean public to accept the eventual agreement produced by the US-North Korean talks. Although the public was initially sceptical about the accord when it was announced in October, support for it has been growing. South Korea is now supporting tentative economic ties with the North by allowing its businessmen to visit Pyongyang to discuss proposed investment projects. If North Korea fulfils its promise to resume dialogue with Seoul, Kim can claim that the country has benefited from the Geneva agreement.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Downturn in Germany hits energy group VIAG, the German energy-based conglomerate, has forecast that profits for the full year will be lower than last year, and reported pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June down from DM384m to DM305m. Group turnover rose fractionally from DM12.08bn to DM12.14m. The company said the downturn in Germany's economy hit the group's packaging and trading subsidiaries especially hard in the first six months of the year. There was likely to be no respite from recessionary pressure in the second half, the Bonn-based group predicted. On a more positive note, it said its core energy business was to a large extent immune to the economic downturn and that profits in its chemicals activities, as well as its Kuhne &amp; Nagel transport and logistics subsidiary, would continue to develop positively in the second half of the current year. It would make further efforts to establish a 'permanent improvement' in its cost structures, Viag said, and the effects of a wide-ranging rationalisation programme would make themselves felt in the second half. After stripping out the effect of recent acquisitions, the number of employees fell by 5 per cent year-on-year. Viag is in negotiations with the government of the state of Bavaria to participate in the planned privatisation of Bayernwerk , the largest southern German energy utility in which Viag already has a 39 per cent stake and which in turn has a 24.9 per cent stake in Viag .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Special report for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by Daniel Casal] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Jun (NA) -- The economic plan must  face and overcome such obstacles as the lack of profitability  among regional economies, the threat of a recession, the new  international financial context, and the requirements arising  from the political situation in the run-up to the elections.    These obstacles are inextricably intertwined since the  provinces are unable to ease their situation, which is provoked  by increased relative prices and the difficulties of marketing  their products.    The showcase was Tierra del Fuego Province, which has a  flourishing economy under the protection of a moribund  Industrial Promotion System.    Difficulties arising from other causes, but with similar  consequences are found throughout the country -- be it the other  Patagonian provinces, the northwest, or the northeast.    The country is haunted by the ghost of recession over  setting  the production machinery in motion. This recession could be  staved off by strengthening the domestic market or by increasing  exports.    The former possibility seems, however, to have reached a  point of counter-production, given the reiterated call to  increase domestic savings.    Hence, the only alternative is to increase our exports,  although we are still trying to increase our productive capacity  to a point where we can place our products on the international  market at more competitive prices.    The search for increased factory capacity is weighing  heavily  on the trade balance deficit, which is an ominous warning for  the near future.    The possibility of devaluing the peso has been totally ruled  out. This move would cause hundreds of bankruptcies because the  indebtedness of the private sector. Thus the exchange rate  should be improved through a reduction of costs.    The recent hike in public utility rates was not only  instrumental in checking the trend toward reducing costs, it  also helped to ease the May inflation above zero percent.    The immediate move of economic authorities will be an  all-out  offensive to reduce labor costs and to restore the provincial  administrations' economies.    There are also plans to scare off the ghost of recession,  which would undermine the basis of one of the most vital tools  of the convertibility plan -- namely, the level of tax revenues.    Housing development plans were designed to boost the  construction industry, which is undoubtedly the driving force of  the economy and which generates many new openings.    The present international financial market is hampering the  normal avenues into which investment projects are generally  channeled and is obliging the government to devise a panoply of  ideas to boost the construction industry.    If the United States had not had the wonderful idea of  betting on its growth and had decided against increasing  interest rates to prevent an overheating of the country's  inflation, the international situation would have continued  favorable for Argentina.    Yet, the Clinton administration bet on growth and  consequently placed a question mark on the entry of foreign  capital into Argentina based on the danger of a possible  increase in domestic interest rates and consequently, a slowdown  in Argentina's economic growth.    Following the same line of reasoning, it would be of  paramount importance for the government to signal that it will  try to reduce its trade deficit as a way to obtain genuine  foreign currency, and thus ease the scarcity of foreign  financial resources.    To conclude, several economists have warned of the risks  that  political needs may entail for the economy.    Ricardo Lopez Murphy from the Radical Civic Union [UCR]  believes the Constituent Assembly is the worst thing that could  have befallen the Argentine economy.    Lopez Murphy shares the views of Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo. He utters things that, to some extent, may be  interpreted as the expression of Cavallo's thinking.    Cavallo is concerned about the outcome of the Constituent  Assembly, the power to be vested in the coordination minister,  and the concessions that may be granted to the provinces.    The 1995 presidential elections are on the horizon, and it  has already been warned that there might be an increase in  government spending to attract votes to the ruling party.    Nevertheless, the Economy Ministry is well aware that the  Convertibility Plan was the most effective weapon in the last  elections, and therefore, will avoid any possible chaos in  public accounts.    As another UCR economist -- former Central Bank President  Jose Luis Machinea -- said: "The best social program the  government can implement is to try to stave off recession."    Machinea added that the only way the government can meet  this  objective is "by increasing exports by an average 15 percent per  annum."</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Review starts champagne corks popping The chief executives of most of the regional electricity companies made a 'gentleman's agreement' some time ago that whatever the outcome of the distribution review they should not accept the regulator's verdict on the day it was announced. One said: 'We felt it might be a bit unseemly to snap it up immediately.' But behind closed doors yesterday the celebrations were well under way - the champagne corks had started popping as early as Wednesday morning, almost as soon as the companies had time to digest Prof Littlechild's report. The City yesterday expected all 12 electricity distribution companies for England and Wales to follow the lead of East Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire Electricity and Seeboard and accept the report. The long months of uncertainty were all but over and, as one analyst put it, 'none of the companies are in trouble'. The rises in share prices and the revised forecasts of analysts suggest that may be an understatement. UBS was expecting the sector to show real dividend growth of 8 per cent annually until the end of the decade, with real growth in earnings per share of 6 per cent a year. Hoare Govett pushed its forecasts for real dividend growth for the sector from 6 per cent to 8 per cent to the end of the century. SG Warburg predicted 6.5 per cent. Most houses also expect the companies to be cash-positive for most of the five-year review period, taking the businesses as a whole, rather than just the distribution divisions which were the subject of Prof Littlechild's review. Analysts differed, however, on which companies had won and lost the most. The companies that were initially judged to have come out worst were the three whose allowed price caps Prof Littlechild said should be revised downwards by 17 per cent. As a result Chester-based Manweb; Swalec, serving south Wales; and Northern Electric saw relatively low increases in their share prices. There were signs, however, of a rethink later in the day. Some analysts believed that the scope for Manweb and Swalec to cut costs might mean that they were not as disadvantaged as at first appeared. There was less enthusiasm for Northern's position. Manweb also pointed out that the 17 per cent reduction was from the full prices it could have charged under the existing formula - since Manweb was not recovering its full entitlement, the effect was a one-off drop in nominal charges of just 10 per cent. The chief executive of another company - one of the six which will be suffering cuts in allowed revenues of 14 per cent - said it was too simplistic to judge companies simply on the revenue cut being applied to them. He said: 'You have to take a variety of factors into account including the size of the existing price cap, the capital-expenditure requirements and the asset base.' Southern Electric, which serves south-east England, was one of the few companies thought to have come out well by virtually all analysts. Other companies which saw relatively high rises in share prices included London Electricity. Shares in London Electricity have performed relatively poorly in recent months because of fears that the regulator would not approve its explanation that its cost base is higher than most as a result of being based in the capital. Several analysts said that its appearance among the six companies which have to cut price caps by 14 per cent next April meant that the regulator had accepted London's arguments.

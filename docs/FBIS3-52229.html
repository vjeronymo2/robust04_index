During his meetings in Tunis, he  said, discussions will be held on the memorandum which some  Palestinian personalities submitted to the Palestinian  leadership on recent developments in the Palestinian arena.    [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Shafi, in progress] ... the  memorandum. President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] asked for a  meeting with representatives of those who signed this memorandum  to discuss it with them.    [Jordan Television correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab] What are  the outlines of this memorandum?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] In fact, the memorandum is concerned with  the situation which resulted from the Declaration of Principles.  This situation poses serious threats to the Palestinians. This  requires several things. It requires good readiness and  preparation for the negotiations that will be held to interpret  and implement the agreement and also for decisionmaking. In  this context, we want to expand the basis of decisionmaking.    [Dhiyab] Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, you were one of those who  advocated Jordanian-Palestinian-Arab coordination. Are you now  satisfied with the level of current coordination?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] The principle of coordination was approved  by everyone. All parties acknowledge that Middle East peace is  an indivisible issue, and that there should be a unified Arab  position. These are agreed issues. The foreign ministers'  meetings which preceded each round of negotiations were held out  of [Arab] coordination. It is true that the declaration of  principles was reached away from the Arab brothers, which  actually violated the principle of coordination. However, I  hope that matters will proceed in the direction of coordination.  This is an extremely important matter. [end recording]</p>

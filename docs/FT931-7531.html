			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd defends role on UN security council BRITAIN'S ROLE as a permanent member of the UN security council was strongly defended by Mr Douglas Hurd in the Commons yesterday. Opening a debate on international peacekeeping the foreign secretary said Britain would not participate in any US operation to airlift humanitarian aid to Bosnia. Mr Hurd said he felt 'some irritation' at comments that assumed nothing was being done in Bosnia after the United Nations High Commission for Refugees decided to suspend some aid convoys. Dr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, said he was concerned aid efforts on the ground could be disrupted by air drops. 'We need convincing that this will not only work in practice for the people it is targeting, but also it will not fatally damage the effort . . . on the ground,' he said. Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, made it clear that if talks on the the Owen-Vance peace formula failed to make progress the UN security council would be asked to tighten sanctions to seal the frontiers of Serbia and Montenegro. He also indicated that Britain would be unlikely to participate in any peacekeeping force to underpin an agreement unless the government could be satisfied on a number of key conditions. During the debate Mr Hurd said Britain was prepared to play a constructive part in any discussion about the reform of the UN charter to take account of changes in the international scene since it was drawn up in 1945, but he stressed the need for caution. 'I do not believe, for example, that a simple proposition to add Germany and Japan to the list of permanent members could survive without others from other continents putting forward their claims.' He argued that the Maastricht treaty took account of the fact that Britain and France were the only nations in the European Community to hold permanent membership of the security council. Mr Hurd stressed: 'The treaty recognises our responsibilities under the charter, and we accept the need to take the views of our partners into account.' Permanent membership of the security council also carried its obligations, and he doubted whether it could be easily extended to countries which - for their own constitutional reasons - would be unable to contribute troops to the full range of UN peacekeeping activities. Mr Hurd envisaged that discussion about possible reforms would continue for a long time, and warned that it should not be allowed to frustrate or undermine the efforts of the actual security council, which had never been more in demand, in international peacekeeping. National governments and international institutions needed to take account of three main lessons: that it was better to move early to avert a disaster than to clear up its consequences, that there had to be an equitable sharing of burdens, and that there had to be a disciplined analysis of risks and benefits so that the international community did not lurch into enterprises without thinking them through. Editorial Comment, Page 19                       *      *      * Other trouble spots highlighted by Mr Hurd included: Arab-Israel dispute. The peace process sponsored by the US and Russia was 'really the only game in town'. While no one could realistically expect an early and complete solution, all sides now seemed to genuinely contemplate 'the possibility of compromise, of real peace'. Iraq. Severe punishment inflicted on the two imprisoned Britons Mr Ride and Mr Wainwright in no way fitted their supposed offence. 'Iraq would gain some credit for releasing them, and no gain from continuing to keep them in unjust captivity,' Mr Hurd said. Cyprus. Britain was helping to prepare ground for next round of talks which he hoped would be attended by newly-elected President Clerides and Mr Denktash under the chairmanship of the UN secretary-general. Somalia. Mr Hurd praised the unified task force, particularly the US, on the success of the humanitarian mission Operation Restore Hope. Britain remained the second-largest aid donor, and the RAF had helped with the airlift, he told MPs.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOFTWARE FIRMS MAKING IT BIG IN EMPLOYEE TRAINING PLANS  </P> <P> Over the past decade, a new generation of software companies has emerged to  help corporations reduce the increasing cost of employee training, which adds  up to more than $40 billion a year nationwide.  </P> <P> One such company is Courseware/Andersen Consulting, a Scripps Ranch-based  software company that assists corporate clients in developing and implementing  self-administered, personal computer-based learning software. The training  programs reduce the cost and time involved in employee training and make the  programs demonstrably more effective, industry observers said.  </P> <P> International Business Machines, for example, has reduced by half the time it  used to take to train its computer sales personnel, an improvement due in part  to systems designed by Courseware/Andersen Consulting. The savings to IBM total  in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Courseware/Andersen Consulting partner  John Splavec asserted Monday.  </P> <P> Self-administered, PC-based software programs now represent 50% of a typical  IBM corporate training curriculum, Splavec said, up from zero eight years ago.  The rest of a trainee's time is generally spent in a classroom setting or on  the job, he said.  </P> <P> Known simply as Courseware before it was acquired for more than $5 million last  July by Chicago-based Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. accounting and consulting firm,  Courseware/Andersen Consulting has been a leader in developing "interactive"  systems that employ video disks to give training systems a personal touch.  </P> <P> Founded in 1972 and based in San Diego since 1977, the company got its start  designing training systems for the Navy, including flight training programs for  pilots and gunnery practice instruction for sailors.  </P> <P> The company was "discovered" by IBM in 1981, which then gave it a $10,000  contract to analyze the effectiveness of its marketing training. The  relationship with IBM subsequently has grown to the point that IBM is  Courseware/Andersen Consulting's largest customer, accounting for more than $1  million per year, or 20% of the company's expected $6 million in 1989 revenue,  Splavec said Monday.  </P> <P> Other clients include NCR, Apple Computer, Fujitsu Systems of America and  Leadership Studies of Escondido, a corporate leadership training firm that has  taught more than 1 million corporate managers, Splavec said. The bulk of the  Courseware/Andersen Consulting's products are sold to computer and insurance  companies.  </P> <P> Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., one of the nation's "Big Eight" accounting firms,  came into the picture after Courseware sent out feelers to the industry that it  was looking to forge a "strategic alliance" to pursue the booming systems  integration market. The term is the catch-all phrase used to describe  companies' attempts to unify disparate elements of the electronic office into  systems easily used by all employees.  </P> <P> The combination with Andersen is a "natural fit" because Andersen had a similar  employee training practice within its Andersen Consulting subsidiary numbering  400 employees. Splavec said the worldwide network of Andersen offices will  afford Courseware/Andersen Consulting "a tremendous opportunity to expand our  services."  </P> <P> The firm's sales could reach $13 million by 1992, he said. The company and its  60 employees will remain based in San Diego, however.  </P> <P> Splavec, 48, himself a former IBM computer salesman, was one of a half dozen  major shareholders who, combined, held a controlling interest in Courseware  stock before the sale to Andersen. Other major shareholders are co-founders  Gerald Faust, Jonah Hymes, C. J. Ross and Gene Regard. Only Regard is still a  full-time employee.  </P> <P> Why are the PC-based training systems more efficient than classroom settings?  Splavec said it has to do with the fact that most classroom curricula are  geared to the "bottom 15% to 20%" of a class, meaning that a majority of  students are held back by the minority.  </P> <P> Students on the PC-based programs can proceed at their own speed.  </P> <P> Also, the computer training programs are non-threatening, unlike the classroom  environment in which many adult students are afraid to ask what they think are  dumb questions, Splavec said. "You can ask the PC all the dumb questions you  want and not be intimidated by it," he said.  </P> <P> The need for employee training in the workplace is heightened by the presence  of sophisticated equipment. But the need is also exacerbated because 25% to 33%  of all high school graduates would flunk one adult literacy test or another and  must be brought up to speed by their employers, Splavec said.  </P> <P> Another key is that systems such as those designed by Courseware/Andersen  Consulting include built-in self-assessment functions that do not allow the  student to go forward until he or she has mastered the material to be learned.  The self-assessment function also allows the trainee to jump ahead to the  appropriate place in the curriculum.  </P> <P> The self-assessment function also gives companies the means to measure the  success of the training programs, a key element as the cost of employee  training rises, said Jack Bowsher, the retired head of IBM's employee education  program who now lives in Westport, Conn. Bowsher is also the author of  "Educating America, Lessons Learned in the Nation's Corporations."  </P> <P> "When companies are spending billions on these programs, it tells you that they  are getting very serious about how to train and retrain employees," Bowsher  said. "What it amounts to is that companies are putting more measurement into  the things. They want people to like (the material), learn it and apply it, and  they want it to have a business result."  </P> <P> "As companies become more professional about wanting a higher return on  training, they turn to someone like Courseware who have instructional  designers, media experts and professional educators who know how to build high  quality courses that will ensure what we call 'mastery of learning,' or that  all the students will learn."  </P> <P> The integration of video technology displayed on a PC's high-resolution monitor  in particular has helped PCs augment classroom teaching as the means of  transferring "corporate culture," or history, tradition and beliefs, Bowsher  said, a critical objective in most employee training programs.  </P></p>

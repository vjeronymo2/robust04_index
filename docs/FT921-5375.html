			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Gold and currency reserves rise Dollars 181m THE UK's gold and currency reserves rose by an underlying Dollars 181m last month, indicating that the Bank of England did not have to support sterling in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System last month. The Treasury said the increase, which confounded market expectations of a small Dollars 120m decline in the reserves, partly reflected Dollars 51m of foreign proceeds from the privatisation of Britain's power companies. The overall level of Britain's official reserves, which includes borrowings in foreign currencies and the Ecu and official repayments, rose by Dollars 169m to Dollars 44.76bn at the end of last month from Dollars 44.59bn at the end of January.</p>

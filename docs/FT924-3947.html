			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur Pounds 157m in the red INNTREPRENEUR Estates, the Grand Metropolitan/Courage pubs joint venture, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 157m in the year to September 30. GrandMet disclosed yesterday that IEL's 6,800 pubs achieved a trading profit of Pounds 162m but interest charges of Pounds 203m on the company's Pounds 1.3bn debt resulted in an operating loss of Pounds 28m. A revaluation of IEL's property in September showed a reduction of Pounds 234m in the value of the estate over the year to Pounds 2.17bn. Half of the deficit was charged against GrandMet's IEL revaluation reserve of Pounds 280m and the rest charged to IEL's profit and loss accounts. Apart from meeting IEL's operating loss of Pounds 28m, GrandMet and Courage have each injected a further Pounds 32m cash into the venture to ensure compliance with banking covenants. With two-thirds of the pubs now converted to 20-year leases, GrandMet said that operations were in line with forecasts. In what Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman and chief executive, described as 'one of the worst economic environments of our 30-year history', disposal of peripheral businesses enabled the group to reduce its debt by Pounds 158m to Pounds 2.44bn and gearing from 75 per cent to 64 per cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds 171m to Pounds 94m.</p>

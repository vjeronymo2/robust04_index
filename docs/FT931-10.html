			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Mediobanca reports rise in pre-tax profits Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, reported that profits for the first six months of its 1992-93 financial year prior to tax, write-offs and provisions rose slightly to L350.7bn from L340.4bn at the same time last year. Italian banks have recently reported heavy write-offs on securities holdings and additional loan-loss provisions owing to the recession, implying that the trend in Mediobanca's earnings may not be maintained when full-year figures are reported in September.</p>

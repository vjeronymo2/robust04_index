			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Marut Bunnak, president of the Thai Parliament </F> and speaker of the House of Representatives, at a banquet in  Vientiane on 1 February -- recorded, in Thai]    [Text] I would like to thank Your Excellency Saman  Vi-gnaket as well as the Lao National Assembly, Government, and  people for giving me and my party an honorable and warm welcome  from the moment we set foot on this land.    Laos and Thailand have maintained close and brotherly  relations since ancient times. The peoples of the two countries  have maintained close contact and have constantly exchanged  cultural and artistic visits. Particularly in linguistic and  cultural exchanges, the peoples of the two countries are able to  speak to each other in their own languages and with a profound  understanding. Far from being weak, our relations are always  strengthening -- especially in the economic field, where a great  deal of trade has been conducted between our two countries. The  Lao-Thai Mekong Friendship Bridge will officially open in the  near future, greatly facilitating mutual contacts and visits  between the brotherly Lao and Thai peoples. I firmly believe  that once the Friendship Bridge opens, our two peoples will  gradually increase their trade contacts and visits with each  other. I hope I will have the opportunity to use this bridge to  lead another Thai parliamentary delegation to Laos.    The purpose of our current visit to Laos is to bring the  Thai  people's best wishes to our Lao brothers and further strengthen  relations between our two countries' legislative institutions.    On this occasion, I would like to invite Your Excellency  Saman Vi-gnaket to lead a Lao National Assembly delegation on an  official visit to Thailand at your convenience as guests of the  Thai Parliament, so that we can exchange further views and  develop mutual understanding. In addition, I would like to  stress that if Your Excellency and the distinguished members of  the Lao National Assembly require any cooperation from our  delegation or from the Thai Parliament for the sake of mutual  benefit and close relations between our two peoples, feel free  to inform our delegation of your request. I assure your that my  party and I will do our best to fulfill your wishes.    At this time, I would like to invite Your Excellencies to  toast the health of His Excellency Lao President Nouhak  Phoumsavan, His Excellency Saman Vi-gnaket, and everyone at this  banquet. May the good relations between our two countries last  forever. [applause]</p>

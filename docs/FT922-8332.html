			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Protests grow in Dushanbe MOSLEM and democratic opposition demonstrators in Tajikistan, describing government concessions as inadequate, demanded the resignation of President Rakhmon Nabiyev yesterday, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. Thousands packed into a central square in the capital Dushanbe, keeping up pressure on Mr Nabiyev after seven weeks of unrest in which more than 100 people have been reported killed in the former Soviet republic bordering China and Afghanistan. Many voiced discontent with Monday's agreement between opposition leaders and Mr Nabiyev, a former Communist Party boss elected last November, on forming a coalition government and creating an interim legislature until new parliamentary elections are held next December. The influential Tajik poet Bozor Sabir captured the mood of the people with a rousing speech. 'Most of you are not happy ..and I am not happy. Even before the casualties, I called on Nabiyev not only to resign but to leave the republic,' he said.</p>

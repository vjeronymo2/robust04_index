This technique reduces the level of background noise that is present in the standard electrocardiography and allows the detection of signals of very low amplitude, such as ventricular late potentials. The AHCPR is particularly interested in whether the performance of SAECG has a positive effect on health outcomes and whether it influences the medical management of the patient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A description of AHCPR's process for conducting technology assessments and technology reviews was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , December 3, 1993. In brief, the full assessment process includes an extensive review of the published literature, consultation with other components of the Public Health Service (PHS), obtaining information from relevant specialty groups and evaluation of information received in response to a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. A technology review is a shorter evaluation of a technology; it may be performed if the medical or scientific questions posed are limited, the available evidence is limited and the published medical literature is insufficient in quantity or quality, or the time frame available precludes utilization of the full assessment process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AHCPR is interested in receiving information which would help in the assessment or review of the technology as described above. To enable the scientific community to evaluate the information included in the assessment or review, AHCPR will discuss in the assessment or review only those data and analyses for which a source(s) may be cited. Respondents are therefore encouraged to include with their submissions a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the sources of the data and comments provided. Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 299a-l(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could identify an individual or entity described in the information, or could identify an entity or individual supplying the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information and comments should be submitted in writing no later than July 5, 1994 to the AHCPR Office of Health Technology Assessment at the address below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas V.

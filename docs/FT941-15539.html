			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Arts: Brigands and violets - Ronald Crichton reviews new productions of Offenbach and Cilea at Opera Bastille, Paris Financial scandals, robbery, law and order - the subject of Les Brigands has an enduring relevance while Offenbach's music remains unquenchably alive. This production by Jerome Deschamps and Macha Makeieff, made for Amsterdam and adapted for the Opera Bastille, uses an assemblage of scraps of old-type scenery-painted cloths, paste-board, old methods, old gags and even old costumes from provincial theatre wardrobes. That may sound tatty, but choice and blending have been done with such flair and affection that the result is ravishing, colourful and witty. The performance crackles with a cheerful vigour calculated to please all except the stuffies who do not want theatre to be theatrical. There are problems: most of the cast have difficulty in projecting words in the cold spaces of the Bastille auditorium. There are two casts of principals. I heard Georges Gautier as Falsacappa (chief bandit), Michele Lagrange as his daughter Fiorella, Brigitte Balleys in the travesty part of her adored Fragoletto. Pleasing, warm-voiced performances all of them, but only about half their words came over. Of the permanent cast the ever-reliable Jules Bastin as the chief of the carabiniers, Ryland Davies and Daniel Galvez-Vallejo as the Spanish envoys and Steven Cole as the impenitently unreliable cashier had more luck. The welter of noises off and on, the abundance of picturesque livestock real and sham, though it gave the audience enormous pleasure, did not help the clarity, but the size of the place was chiefly to blame. Invaluable support came from the conductor (on the night I attended it was Louis Langree) the soul of crisp discretion in accompaniments, in able control of the ensembles. One does not often find Offenbach revivals where riotous theatricality is so well joined to musical quality. What better symbol for Cilea's opera Adriana Lecouvreur could there be than a bunch of faded violets? Much is seen and heard of this nosegay in the libretto, based on an old piece of theatrical hokum by Scribe and Legouve, once a vehicle for Sarah Bernhardt. The opera, first given in 1902, has survived chiefly by virtue of two popular arias; and, as Julian Budden neatly puts it in the New Grove Opera Guide, mainly because of the 'opportunities it affords to an experienced prima donna who has already passed her prime'. There is not much else. Cilea knew all the tricks but his invention is weak. In the well-known arias he explores a genuine gift for rather flaccid melancholy reflection. But he works his themes too hard. The ascending phrase associated with the 'humble handmaiden' aria is heard almost as often as its cousin in 'Depuis le Jour' in Charpentier's Louise. Most of the comedy scenes are made out of leavings from Falstaff Mirella Freni takes the title-role in this new production at the Bastille. Experienced she certainly is but not, on this evidence, in decline. There was some hard tone, but she cossets and floats the lyrical phrases with undiminished charm and skill. Still, she hardly suggests the burning fires of the tragedienne, rather the quiet confidence and poise of a polished, versatile comedienne - more Marie Tempest than monstre sacre. Peter Drovsky, singing Adriana's lover Maurizio in place of the announced Giacomo Aragall, was effective in his forceful way except when he belted out phrases as if he were already on the battlefield. As Michonnet, loyal and devoted stage director, Jean-Luc Chaignaud, a baritone of whom we shall surely hear more, did full justice to the best of the male roles. The young conductor Maurizio Benini accompanied skilfully without spurring the orchestra to much eloquence. Production by Jean-Luc Boutte, decor and costumes by Louis Bercut, were economical to the point of stinginess; Bercut's costumes on the other hand were very fine. Les Brigands is sponsored by France Inter.</p>

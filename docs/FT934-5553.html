			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Then and now: what the politicians have said 'All terrorists, at the invitation of the government, end up with drinks at the Dorchester.' Hugh Gaitskell, former Labour leader 'We must try to find ways to starve the terrorist of the oxygen on which they depend.' Baroness Thatcher in July 1985 'If the implication of his (Gerry Adams') remarks is that we should sit down and talk with Mr Adams and the Provisional IRA, I can only say that that would turn my stomach . . . we will not do it.' John Major in the Commons on November 1 'Those who decline to renounce violence can never have a place at the conference table in our democracy. But if the IRA end violence for good, then, after a sufficient interval to ensure the permanence of their intent, Sinn Fein can enter the political arena as a democratic party and join the dialogue on the way ahead.' John Major at Guildhall on November 15 'The prospects for peace and a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland today trembles in the balance as a result of what is now revealed as at best stupidity and at worst duplicity by the prime minister and the government.' Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday 'What is at stake is the question of the integrity and honour of the British government.' Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday (There has been) 'Deliberate bare-faced lying from the secretary of state and Downing Street . . . Both the prime minister and the secretary of state are involved and both of them should get out.' The Rev Ian Paisley DUP leader, yesterday 'I am trying to face up to the real problem in Northern Ireland, and that problem is of a divided people. It cannot be solved by a victory of one side over the other.' John Hume, SDP leader, yesterday 'Can you imagine how the people of Northern Ireland feel this morning when they see that they are being used as pawns while politicians do dirty deals behind their backs.' Peter Robinson, DUP deputy leader, yesterday</p>

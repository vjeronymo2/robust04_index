			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" (1984), directed by W.D. Richter. 103  minutes.  </P> <P> Rated PG-13. Forget Dick Tracy, Batman, Darkman, The Flash, et al. Buckaroo  Banzai is the greatest comic-book hero who never was. He's also the hippest  super-hero around. When not fronting his band of New Jersey rock 'n' rollers,  he's busy creating a device to penetrate the eighth dimension. It might take  two or three viewings just to figure out what the heck is going on, but the  ride is worth it. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

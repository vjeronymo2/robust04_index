			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Sugar in move to block Venables MR ALAN Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, has launched a court move to 'strike out' a legal attempt by Mr Terry Venables to seize control of the football club. Mr Sugar says Mr Venables, the club's former chief executive, should be blocked from pursuing his action because he has still not paid the Pounds 300,000 'security for costs' demanded by the High Court as a condition of being allowed to continue with the case. The payment, ordered on July 29, was due by August 19. The deadline was not met and Mr Sugar is to apply on September 13 for a court order striking out the action. Mr Venables has already made an application for extra time to pay the money  -but that plea is not due to be heard until October. Yesterday Mr Justice Lindsay granted Mr Sugar's lawyers an order for production of official transcripts of the July 29 hearing for use in the strike-out move. Mr David Mabb, counsel for Mr Sugar, his holding company Amshold and Tottenham Hotspur, said it was 'somewhat curious' that Mr Venables' plea for extra time was scheduled for October - well beyond the 21-day extension he was seeking. Mr Sugar issued the strike-out application after failing to obtain an explanation from Mr Venables' solicitors as to the basis of the plea for more time.</p>

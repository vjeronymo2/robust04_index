			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC members agree on farm price deal THE EC-US agreement on oilseeds is set to be ratified by all Community member states including France on June 8, following an accord reached yesterday on this year's EC farm price regime. The bilateral understanding is a vital building block for an overall deal on the Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations. At 5am yesterday, after four days of talks, EC agriculture ministers agreed on a predominantly French-compiled list of extra concessions to farmers. This means EC foreign ministers should be able to wave through the oilseeds deal when they meet in Luxembourg in 11 days time. France had strongly opposed the deal with the US, limiting subsidised oilseeds output to 5.128m hectares, from the moment it was reached last November in Washington, along with a bilateral agreement on the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round. The European Commission is anxious to get the oilseeds dispute out of the way quickly, fearing that otherwise the US would have a pretext for reopening the whole farm trade deal reached last year, which Brussels believes is advantageous to the Community. This week's concessions increase compensation to EC farmers for 'set-aside', the land they have to take out of production in order to reduce output. The production cuts, along with heavy price cuts, are the means through which the EC is reforming its Common Agricultural Policy and intends to meet the subsidy cut commitments it has made in the Uruguay Round. Commission officials say the extra compensation will cost nearly Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) over three years, and claim the swelling EC farm budget will still come in under its ceiling, or 'guideline'. 'Now we know how much French principles cost,' one EC official commented acidly, adding that a modest multiple of this week's concessions would probably in the end reconcile France to a full Uruguay Round deal. Within the terms of the EC-US agreement, direct payments to farmers in compensation for CAP price and output cuts will be exempt from subsidy cuts required under the Uruguay Round.</p>

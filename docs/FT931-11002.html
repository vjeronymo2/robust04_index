			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Belarus ratifies Start I The Belarus parliament ratified the Start I treaty yesterday, leaving Ukraine the only former Soviet republic still considering the pact, AP reports from Minsk. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and its protocols require Belarus to surrender all 81 SS-25 single-warhead missiles it inherited from the former Soviet nuclear arsenal. The parliaments of Russia and Kazakhstan ratified Start I last year. The treaty was signed in 1991 by former US and Soviet Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev. If ratified by Ukraine, the treaty would leave Russia as the only one of the four with nuclear weapons. It also would make deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia.</p>

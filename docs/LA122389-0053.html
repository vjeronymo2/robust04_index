			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTER SHOULD OFFER COFFEE TO CONCERT-GOERS  </P> <P> My husband and I are longtime subscribers to the Orange County Philharmonic  Society. We were disappointed when the philharmonic moved to the Orange County  Performing Arts Center and began scheduling performances on weeknights. But we  have since adjusted to that.  </P> <P> However, there is one thing to which we have not adjusted: On concert nights we  rush home from the office, have a quick supper and go off to the symphony.  Frankly, we're tired and we often have to fight the urge to doze. We are not  alone in this. Many of our friends have similar complaints. The philharmonic  used to present its shows at the high school, and we could get a quick cup of  coffee. But at the Center none is available.  </P> <P> About two years ago I wrote to the president of the philharmonic to ask that  they revive the custom of serving coffee. I was astounded to hear that the  Center has no facilities to brew coffee. I have since heard that the problem is  the carpeting -- that management is concerned about coffee stains.  </P> <P> Why did they install carpeting that is susceptible to stains? Especially in a  public place? Since they serve coffee at the Los Angeles Music Center, I can  only assume that their carpeting is either stain-proof or they are more  interested accommodating concert-goers than are their counterparts at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> Once more, I write to ask that coffee be served before the performance and  during intermission. But I propose a compromise: Engage an outside vendor to  sell coffee out on the patio; the Center staff won't have to assume the added  responsibility, and the carpeting will be preserved.  </P> <P> One final thought: When you consider how society's attitude about drinking has  changed, it would be to the Center's credit if they would offer a warm  non-alcoholic drink as an alternative to wine.  </P> <P> JUNE L.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The country, Rwanda, as you know, is going through  the most difficult time in its history, ever since last week's  events which followed the tragic death of the late president  Juvenal Habyarimana. He was killed with his Burundian  counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira, in an attempt against the  presidential plane which was hit by a rocket while approaching  Kigali airport. It is known what followed: an instant wave of  violence, first in Kigali, then in other regions of the country.    However, high-ranking cadres of the Army and the Gendarmerie  very quickly carried out their responsibilities, since civilian  power had been curtailed with the death of the head of state  followed by that of the prime minister and other high-ranking  personalities of the country who died as a result of events.  [Words indistinct] officials of political parties who took part  in the previous transitional government met and formed another  government. This was done on 8 April. Since then, the  president of the National Development Council, Dr. Theodore  Sindikubgabo, in accordance with the relevant article of the  Constitution of 10 June 1991, has assumed the interim presidency  of the Republic. From the moment of the swearing-in ceremony on  9 April, the new government headed by Prime Minister Jean  Kambanda has consistently called for peace and the situation  clearly improved.    However, following the threat of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] to march on Kigali, tension increased. That is why the  government decided, among other objectives, to pursue a dialogue  with the armed opposition so as to set up a broad-based  transitional government. It called upon the RPF to favor peace,  instead of plunging the country once again into misery. For the  time being, the RPF declares that it does not recognize the new  Rwandan Government and seems unwilling to reject the resumption  of war. The Rwandan Armed Forces, however, are confident that  the punitive [word indistinct] of the RPF will not be a walkover.    This brings us to the military situation in the country.  Last night Kigali was relatively peaceful in most suburbs.  However, there was an exception. There was heavy shelling  around the Parliament Palace where the RPF battalion of 600 men,  who arrived in Kigali at the end of December to protect  political officials of the rebel movement, is stationed.    This morning, there was also relative peace in most parts of  Kigali, however shots were heard below (Rebero) District towards  (Butamwa) District. We learn from informed sources that the  Rwandan Armed Forces are chasing elements of the RPF battalion  which did not return to its camp after leaving it to attack the  Presidential Guard camp. On the northern and northeastern  fronts, the Rwandan Armed Forces have the upper hand, according  to the same sources.    However, the people must redouble their awareness since RPF  units are attempting to infiltrate Kigali in small groups. On  the humanitarian level, the situation will very quickly become  catastrophic. It may already be catastrophic, since all  officials and personnel working in humanitarian assistance  organizations have left the country. The camps of war-displaced  and Burundi refugees have been left to fend for themselves, and  the next few days will be chaotic.    In short, that is the situation prevailing in the country  today. Militarily, the Rwandan Armed Forces are in control of  the situation but on the humanitarian level, one should soon  fear the worst. In order to ensure that supplies reach the town  of Kigali, Trade and Industry Minister Justin Mugenzi yesterday  asked the prefects meeting here in Kigali to facilitate the  arrival of supplies with the assistance of security service  officials.</p>

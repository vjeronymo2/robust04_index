Lithuanian and Polish experts finished editing the text of  the draft treaty last week.    The Nationalist Union Board has proposed in an appeal to  President Algirdas Brazauskas, published today, that the main  passages of the treaty be discussed without delay with all  Lithuanian parties having representatives in the Seimas. The  president is asked to take the initiative and reach agreement in  this vitally important common national issue.    The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stressed in a  statement that it rejects any pressure as an attempt to  influence the course of negotiations and complicate mutual  relations between states. It points out that in a democratic  state trust in the quality of work by the diplomatic service is  confirmed by the ratifying of signed agreements in parliament,    Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislovas Domarkas said today in  an  interview with Lithuanian radio that the contents of the present  draft treaty should guarantee that there will be no territorial  claims between the two states and that national minorities in  the two states will behave in accordance with the laws of the  state where they reside. The states, for their part, are  obliged, in accordance with international standards, to  guarantee corresponding rights to national minorities. This  treaty, undoubtedly, will not bar the way to the further  examination of sensitive issues. Historians and public  organizations will be able to continue their discussions on the  past, but these discussions and the analysis of history must not  put the lid on the future. On the contrary, we should pay more  attention to joint work in the economy, culture, education, and  other spheres so that we can join Europe as soon as possible,  Vladislovas Domarkas said, concluding his interview.    After the Lithuanian-Polish treaty has been initialled in  Warsaw on Friday, it is due to be signed by the Lithuanian and  Polish presidents during their forthcoming meeting.</p>

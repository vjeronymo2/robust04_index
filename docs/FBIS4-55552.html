			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alban Bala: "When Will They Be Giving Out </F> Identification Cards?"]    [Text] Currently three-quarters of the people in Albania do  not have any personal identification cards. Letters of  certification have been distributed, but is this sufficient?    Since 1981 no identification cards have been prepared by the  Albanian Government, which, prior to 1990, had used the funds  set up for this purpose in the Ministry of Public Order. For  almost four years citizens have had only letters of  certification of their citizenship because there has been no  government decision or, more importantly, there have been no  funds. This has created anomalies and possibilities for abuse  and falsifications, presenting no small danger for the country.  It is said that falsified letters of certification are being  sold in Greece, thereby making it possible for Albanians to  change their names. In addition to international passports, a  number of foreign countries also require ordinary identification  cards, a requirement which -- since it is transformed into a  "necessity" -- becomes a source of illegal business and profit  in the respective areas.    "We have made several appeals to the government," Abdyl  Xhaja, director of the Office of Vital Statistics, says, "but it  is clear that there are no funds." The problem becomes more  complex when you consider that one-third of Albanians work  outside the country and that this reform, if it is carried out,  requires uniformity in development. Another possibility is that  the government might apply a system like the one in use in many  European countries -- an ordinary identification card, which is  also currently in effect in Macedonia. But in Tirana people have  not been able to get identification cards since June 1990. We  have to think as soon as possible, not only about recognizing  the rights of Albanians in this situation but also about  eliminating opportunities for chauvinistic moves on the human  level for banal economic reasons.</p>

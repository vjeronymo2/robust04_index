			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (9): Custodians face rising demand  -Derivatives / The growth of the industry The rapidly growing derivatives industry has faced some setbacks this year, with a string of highly publicised corporate losses and two legal actions denting its image. Yet underlying growth in the use of derivatives - both simpler options and futures traded on exchanges and the more complex swaps and packages bought over the counter - has continued apace. As a result the demands on banks to adapt their custodial functions to accommodate derivative instruments are rising. Global custodians are in little doubt about the pace of change. 'We have seen a huge increase in interest among certain types of client, including fund and investment managers who are looking to get the custody of traditional securities and derivatives in one place,' says Aidan Dennis, vice-president global securities services at Chase Manhattan. 'Two years ago nobody used to ask about derivatives when they submitted a 'request for proposal' (industry jargon for the detailed proposals made by clients to their custodians). Every request I have received in the last six months has contained something on derivatives. It is quite unbelievable. Everyone is asking for it,' adds Mr Dennis. 'Up to two years ago there was nothing on derivatives. It is beginning to appear now,' says Dick Feehan, a managing director at Bankers Trust. 'There used to be a dichotomy between the rocket science grand masters who were designing the products and the back offices who were reporting on them. That gap no longer exists,' he adds. Increasingly fund managers - even at conservative investment institutions such as UK life offices - are using derivatives, for purposes such as tactical asset allocation. Bankers Trust estimates that up to 50 per cent of fund managers with more than Dollars 500m under management are using or reviewing their use of derivatives. The pressures on custodians who have traditionally supplied a range of core services such as settlement, safekeeping, dividend collection and tax-related services for physical assets are growing. 'Custodians tended to adopt an ostrich approach and duck their heads in the sand. They can't do that any longer,' says Mr Feehan, who adds that the demand for derivatives-related services is part of growing interest in other 'value-added' services, such as accounting, valuation, foreign exchange, and cash management. Indeed, global custodians can help streamline information gathering, reporting and accountancy procedures. A custodian, for example, can facilitate central clearing of all contracts traded on an international exchange such as Liffe or the Chicago Board of Trade. This can help consolidate and streamline the payment of margin, the capital needed to uphold positions. 'The whole idea is to get all your positions with one global clearing broker rather than with a multitude of brokers round the world. You get all the information in one place,' explains Mr Dennis. 'Without centralised brokers you could be paying margin to 16 different places - you could be getting 16 sets of reports back and the back office would be swamped.' Custodians can also help traders manage their trading positions better by more effective use of netting off - offsetting different sets of credits and debits. 'A custodial system can make it easier for investors to manage their physical and derivative assets in a more effective way for reporting purposes. If you are long individual stocks in the FTSE and short FTSE futures contracts - then from an exposure viewpoint you would need to net the positions off,' adds Mr Dennis. Mr Feehan also emphasises the value of uniform reporting. 'Some organisations come to us who are investing in derivatives, but who are putting their investments out with seven or eight separate fund managers who specialise in different areas. We can supply a combination of reports to cover and consolidate the whole portfolio,' he explains. Again with exchange traded products, investors are moving towards a single point of settlement and clearing. 'This is for convenience, cost and reporting,' adds Mr Dennis. 'A single information flow is what it is all about. It should allow them to make better investment decisions.' Not all banks are up to meeting the challenge. The complexity of the instruments involved, and their relationship with the rest of an investment portfolio, requires more sophisticated reporting than straightforward equity or bond trades, as well as strong operational support. Practitioners emphasise two problems in particular. First, the accounting treatment for derivatives can vary from that of other securities and may vary from region to region. 'For example, it is very common to account for securities on an average cost basis, but most customers run their derivative portfolios on a first in/first out basis,' notes Mr Dennis. Second, the industry has a considerable amount of work to do and this suggests the need for standardisation. In the securities business practices have been partially harmonised and there has been a move towards the use of international security identification numbers. Unfortunately there are no comparable standards existing in the derivatives markets and this is partially because of the life span of derivative products. 'With the addition of a variety of strike prices and delivery months there may be more than 50 different contracts available on the same underlying instruments at any given time. 'Clearly the amount of time and effort required to maintain individual codes for such a universe would outweigh the benefits of standardisation,' points our Mr Dennis. 'But the need to standardise the methods of communication remain as does the need to have a standard method of creating international security identification numbers,' he adds.</p>

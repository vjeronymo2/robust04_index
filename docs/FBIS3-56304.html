			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "What the Future Has in Store for </F> Us.... U.S. Analysts on Russia's Future"]    [Text] A book entitled Russia in the Year 2010 and  What It Means for the World has been published in the  United States. THE NEW YORK TIMES reviewed the book and  described it as the "methodology of informed forecasting," in  which "the social, political, and economic forces operating in  Russia are separated from the myths, then these forces are  formed into various structures and unexpected changes made in  them."    The book, which, according to THE NEW YORK TIMES, provides  an  "invaluable service" for anyone "trying to predict where Russia  is going," was the by-product of research by its authors, Daniel  Joergen and Professor Thane Gustafson of Georgetown University.    The book will disappoint people looking for an unequivocal  answer to the question posed in the title, namely what Russia  will be like in the year 2010. Instead the reader is offered  four scenarios for the possible development of events. The  so-called "miracle" scenario takes him to 17 May 2010 when, in  the trade center built for the Moscow stock exchange, the head  of a major Russian bank announces the purchase of the seventh  largest U.S. bank. Thus symbolically summing up the successful  implementation of market reforms.    The "Russian bear" scenario makes a diametrically opposite  forecast: A military parade is under way in Moscow's Red Square  to mark the eighth anniversary of a successful military coup.  The Kremlin towers are adorned with two-headed eagles, slogans  proclaim the glory of the supreme commander in chief and the  valiant Russian Army.    According to the other two scenarios, Russia either  gradually  breaks up in the grip of political and economic paralysis or  continues to vegetate under the leadership of an authoritarian  group of officials, representatives of the military-industrial  complex, state enterprise directors, and the Army command.    Strictly speaking, all these scenarios only summarize the  very extensive range of predictions and hypotheses current in  the United States.    The book's authors draw several conclusions which, in their  opinion, will remain true however events develop. Thus they  believe that, whatever happens, Russia will inevitably have  increasingly close ties with the world economy. They also  predict that toward the year 2010 Russian agriculture will not  under any circumstances be able to find its feet even if it  passes entirely into private hands, since the countryside is too  ravaged and lacking in manpower. The authors' main conclusion  throws down a challenge to those who are banking on the West in  the formation of the new Russia. They write confidently:  "Ultimately Russia will of course write its own history by  itself...."</p>

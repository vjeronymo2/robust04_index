			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLING IT OUT IN SYNDICATION;  </P> <P> THE NEW TV SEASON;  </P> <P> JOAN IS BACK; 'JEOPARDY' AND 'WHEEL' ON KCBS  </P> <P> While his talk show flounders late at night on KCBS Channel 2, Pat Sajak and  that colorful "Wheel of Fortune" arrive today to try to spin the CBS-owned  station out of the early evening ratings cellar where it has languished for  more than a year.  </P> <P> Channel 2 swiped "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" from KCOP Channel 13, which  had used the two game shows to dominate the 7-8 p.m. hour for the past several  years -- a programming coup that appears to be the most significant local  development in a new syndicated season that will also see the return of Joan  Rivers to daily television, the daily proliferation of big-time network sitcoms  such as "Who's the Boss?" and "Night Court" and the birth of a physical,  action-packed game show genre, appropriately dubbed "Crash TV."  </P> <P> While considerably more attention is paid to how the networks program and  counter-program each other in prime time, the local stations also slug it out  for viewers with first-run syndicated fare and network repeats during key,  locally programmed time periods. The 7-8 p.m. time slot, for example, when  every local station carries some form of syndicated product, is the local  stations' most lucrative hour in terms of ad revenues.  </P> <P> Though Channel 2 would not reveal how much it paid to acquire the two top-rated  syndicated shows in the country, officials there predicted that "Wheel of  Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" will instantly vault their station from seventh place  to at least second in the time period. Ed Spray, KCBS' director of  broadcasting, said that luring such a sizable audience to the station during  this one hour should also rub off on other time periods.  </P> <P> "It was important for us to acquire these shows just to get watched again after  a rough few years," Spray said. "If we can get the mass viewer coming to our  station -- and we have not been successful at that at any time period for the  last several years -- we can get our promos for the local news and even for CBS  prime time seen.  </P> <P> "And if people start watching Channel 2 again in large numbers, maybe they will  develop an affinity for Channel 2 and maybe the habit of watching us will  return again."  </P> <P> Channel 13, which last year paid a record sum to secure reruns of "The Cosby  Show," plans to fill the void left by the departure of its top-rated game shows  with a 6-8 p.m. weekday lineup of reruns of "Night Court," "Growing Pains,"  "The Cosby Show" and a second episode of "Night Court."  </P> <P> One reason that KCOP may have let "Wheel" and "Jeopardy!" get away is the  astronomical sum it paid for "The Cosby Show," which has been airing at 6 p.m.  for the past year and should bring a larger return when it begins airing at 7  p.m. next week. But Rick Feldman, KCOP's station manager, said that though  "Jeopardy!" is still a "hot" show, his station dumped the game shows because  they both play mostly to an older audience.  </P> <P> Both shows are still highly rated, "but the name of the game is demographics,  not household ratings," Feldman said. "Advertisers want to buy adults 18-54 and  'Wheel' has been getting older and older and now the audience is predominantly  50-plus. KCBS had no alternative but to pick them up, but if they think it will  help CBS play to young viewers, they're crazy."  </P> <P> Feldman predicted that with the two-hour block of high-profile sitcoms, Channel  13 will be No. 1 in every half hour from 6-8 p.m. Plus, he said, the sitcoms'  younger audience will be more receptive to station promotions for "The Arsenio  Hall Show" and the station's prime-time movies than the older audience of the  two departing game shows ever was.  </P> <P> Disney-owned KHJ Channel 9 and Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11 will also compete in  the early evening with popular network reruns. KHJ will go with "Who's the  Boss?" and "Kate &amp; Allie" from 6-7 p.m. while KTTV counters with an hour of  the old "Batman" series at 5:30, "Mr. Belvedere" at 6:30 and "Family Ties" at 7  p.m. as a lead-in to its ratings smash, "A Current Affair," at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, KTLA Channel 5 will rely on the first-ever reruns of the hourlong  network dramas "Highway to Heaven" and "Hunter" from 5-7 p.m. and then will  continue with its time-tested hour of first-run sitcoms until 8 p.m. Starting  next Monday, original episodes of "Charles in Charge" will air daily at 7,  followed at 7:30 p.m. by a checkerboard of original sitcoms -- "Out of This  World," "My Secret Identity," "Punky Brewster," "The New Leave It to Beaver"  and "The Munsters Today."  </P> <P> KNBC Channel 4, the top-rated local station, will insert only one new show in  its daily lineup, another tabloid news/entertainment magazine called "Hard  Copy." The new program, which is co-anchored by former local newswoman Terry  Murphy, premieres at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 18, bumping the once ballyhooed "USA  Today on TV" to 2 a.m. daily.  </P> <P> The highlight of the local daytime scene will be the return of Joan Rivers to  the world of talk television for the first time since her disastrous stint as  the host of Fox's "The Late Show" ended more than two years ago. "The Joan  Rivers Show" will enter the already heated afternoon talk wars Tuesday at 3  p.m. on Channel 2 opposite both "Oprah" and "Donahue."  </P> <P> Another Joan, "Good Morning America's" Joan Lunden, will also try her hand at a  daytime talk show every weekday at 1 p.m. on Channel 9 beginning Sept. 18.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7, Channel 13 will premiere "Inside Report," a new half-hour news  magazine in the tradition of "A Current Affair" and "Inside Edition." (The show  is reviewed by Howard Rosenberg on Page 1.) "Inside Report" will move to its  regular 5:30 p.m. time period next Monday. Channel 13 will also carry a new  courtroom program, "Trial by Jury," every weekday at 4:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Late-night television will also be filled with a few new faces. Former CBS  newsman Ike Pappas will host "Crimewatch Tonight," a nightly program filled  with sensational crime stories and crime prevention tips that premieres Sept.  11 at midnight on Channel 13.  </P> <P> "After Hours," a glitzy magazine show that is designed as an alternative to the  late-night talk shows, will air nightly at 11:30 on Channel 11 beginning Sept.  18. Press releases for the show characterize it as "zapless television,"  because the program "presents stories and personalities in such a quick  fashion, the viewer gets the impression that the channel changing is being done  automatically."  </P> <P> And beginning next week, Channel 5 will broadcast Showtime's hit sitcom  "Brothers" every weeknight at 11:30.  </P> <P> Byron Allen, formerly of "Real People," gets his own weekly late-night talk  show this Saturday at 11:30 on Channel 7. And KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman  gets a Saturday night show of his own on Channel 4 at 1 a.m. beginning Sept.  30.  </P> <P> Channel 4 will also broadcast "Missing/Reward," a weekly syndicated program  about missing persons that offers rewards for their return, every Saturday at  4:30 p.m. beginning Sept. 23.  </P> <P> Crash TV comes in with a bang Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. as "Rollergames," a slam-bam  game of brawn, roller skates and skimpy costumes that includes such hazards as  the "Wall of Death" and a "Swamp" filled with live alligators, debuts on  Channel 5. "Rollergames" will then move to its regular weekly time slot,  Saturdays at 11 a.m., on Sept. 16.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, "American Gladiators," a show that features regular Joes and Janes  from around the country battling trained athletes in contests of strength and  speed, bows on KHJ Channel 9 Saturday, Sept. 23 at 10 p.m.  </P> <P> A more traditional sports show, "Insport," a weekly program that profiles both  the personal and professional sides of such sports stars as Magic Johnson,  Chris Evert and Mike Tyson, premieres Sunday at 12:30 p.m. on Channel 4. The  program will move to its regular time period, Saturdays at 4 p.m., on Sept. 23.  </P> <P> "Lassie," a remake of the beloved series starring the world's most famous  collie, will also air Saturdays beginning Sept. 23 at 6:30 p.m. on Channel 9.  </P> <P> "Inside Edition," the tabloid news show that Channel 2 dumped to make room for  "Wheel of Fortune," will also turn up nightly at 8:30 on Channel 9. If the  station goes ahead with its planned nightly three hours newscast in January,  "Inside Edition" will be bumped again.  </P></p>

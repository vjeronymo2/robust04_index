			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ELECTIONS SOUTHEAST / LONG BEACH MUNICIPAL, SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> MANY INCUMBENTS HAVE A DEFEATING DAY;  </P> <P> 24 NEWCOMERS GAIN OFFICE IN 16 CITIES, AS 10 REELECTION BIDS FAIL  </P> <P> Voters changed the makeup of city councils throughout Southeast Los Angeles  County, ousting 10 incumbents and selecting 24 newcomers Tuesday in 16 cities.  </P> <P> Political representation for Latinos, slow growth and campaign spending were  some of the issues that contributed to the defeat of the incumbents.  </P> <P> South Gate will have three new members on its five-person council. The only  </P> <P> </P> <P> Artesia  </P> <P> Veteran incumbent Jim Van Horn was returned to office while Mary Alyce Soares,  a savings and loan official who was born in Artesia, was elected for the first  time to the five-member City Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bell  </P> <P> Voters sent City Hall mixed messages by reelecting two incumbents who say they  have run the city well, and electing the candidate who criticized the slow pace  of redevelopment, an outdated sewer system and the city's financial condition.  </P> <P> George Bass, 59, a retired fire chief who has criticized Bell leaders for  failing to revitalize the downtown, defeated Allen Caddy for one of the three  spots on the City Council. Caddy was running on the same slate as incumbent  Rolf Janssen, 34, who will begin his second term, and Jay Price, 75, who will  begin his ninth consecutive term in office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bell Gardens  </P> <P> Incumbent Ronald Bird and federal employee Douglas O'Leary won an election in  which one of the key issues was whether the all-Anglo City Council had been  representing the Latino population, which has mushroomed the past few years and  now makes up 75% of Bell Gardens' population.  </P> <P> Bird, 46, who was elected to his second term, and O'Leary, who will begin his  first, successfully fended off a challenge from Latino candidates Josefina  Macias and Rosa Hernandez, who were attempting to become the first Latinos to  sit on the council. O'Leary took the seat of Mayor Roger McComas, who retired  after 22 years in office.  </P> <P> O'Leary said the results show that a council member does not necessarily have  to be Latino to represent Latinos. Both he and Bird said they represent the  entire community.  </P> <P> Macias and Hernandez said Latinos are making their presence felt now and that  this election helped them realize their potential.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bellflower  </P> <P> The calm, quiet campaign belied a close race with a nail-biting vote count that  at one point had all six candidates virtually even. In the end, the three open  City Council seats were won by incumbent John Ansdell, who will be serving his  third term; incumbent Bill Pendleton, elected to his second term, and newcomer  Bob Stone, 43, an insurance salesman. Stone unseated Ken Cleveland, who has  served on the council twice.  </P> <P> Stone attributed his victory in part to the strong support of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has been trying to  unionize some Bellflower employees for the last few months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cerritos  </P> <P> Candidate Charles J. Kim's high-spending campaign turned the election for three  City Council seats into a late-night cliffhanger.  </P> <P> Kim, who raised $104,000 for his campaign, more than triple what any other  candidate has raised in a Cerritos election, narrowly missed winning one of the  seats in an election that featured a significant increase in absentee  balloting. Kim received more votes in absentee balloting (1,135) than in the  polling booth (802). A total of 2,260 absentee ballots were cast, three times  the number in the 1988 council election, city officials said.  </P> <P> Incumbent Councilwoman Ann Joynt, a former teacher, received the most votes in  the 13-way race. Her political ally, Planning Commissioner Sherman Kappe, came  in second. Third place went to John Crawley, president of the Optimist Club and  a senior financial analyst for the Atlantic Richfield Corp.  </P> <P> Kim's campaign left a bitter taste in the mouths of some locals, who had been  highly critical of his spending and called him a carpetbagger because he moved  to town only last year. His elaborate campaign, which featured a computerized  voter registration and absentee ballot drive, cost about $54 for every vote  that he received.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cudahy  </P> <P> The accusations and finger-pointing in this election continued even after the  results were announced. Incumbent Joseph Graffio, and candidates Alex Rodriguez  and Jack Cluck handily won the three seats on the five-member Cudahy City  Council, but most of the other candidates said they are planning to challenge  the election.  </P> <P> "This was the filthiest race I've ever seen," said incumbent Bill Colon, who  was unseated after four years on the council. "There is something wrong  somewhere."  </P> <P> Colon said some residents were intimidated by the winning candidates'  campaigning illegally at one of the city's polling places. Candidate Valerie  Hansen said the race had been "stolen." Graffio, Cluck and Rodriguez denied the  charges, saying they had run a clean races.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, 63, a retired refrigeration engineer, and Cluck, 70, president of a  local senior citizens organization, were elected to their first terms. One of  the three council seats on the ballot was vacated earlier this year when Tom  Thurman resigned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens  </P> <P> Incumbent Kathleen Navejas was reelected by a solid margin, but incumbent  Donald Schultze was defeated in the races for two City Council seats in  Hawaiian Gardens.  </P> <P> However, just one vote separated two candidates vying for Schultze's seat, with  about 20 questionable ballots yet to be counted. Former Councilman Richard  Vineyard, who lost his seat two years ago by three votes, held the one-vote  lead over Domenic Ruggeri, a Navejas ally.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huntington Park  </P> <P> Latino candidates won City Council seats for the first time in this city of  59,000, which is 90% Latino.  </P> <P> Raul Perez, who had run unsuccessfully five times before, was the top  vote-getter, followed by incumbent William P. Cunningham and upstart candidate  Luis Hernandez. Councilman Jim Roberts, who had served on the council since  1970, lost his seat after finishing 20 votes behind Hernandez.  </P> <P> Perez and Hernandez used nearly opposite campaign strategies to win office.  Perez billed himself as a cooperative team player, while Hernandez, always the  firebrand, lashed out at the incumbents during a candidates forum and with  mailers.  </P> <P> Political representation for Latinos was the key theme of Perez's campaign. The  47-year-old loan officer called for more neighborhood meetings and overall  community involvement to deal with the city's crime problem, including gang  crime. He stressed his longtime involvement in civic groups and his dedication  to the city -- demonstrated by his 12-year quest for a council seat. He  refrained from strongly criticizing the incumbents.  </P> <P> Hernandez, a 29-year-old financial consultant, downplayed the issue of Latino  representation throughout the race. He attacked the incumbents for the city's  financial problems, which forced the layoffs of 25 municipal employees last  October.  </P> <P> Cunningham and Roberts attacked Hernandez. Some of the 14 mailers they put out  accused Hernandez of lying about his background and alleged that he did not  live in the city. Hernandez, who was living in nearby Walnut Park, said he now  lives with his sister in  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huntington Park.  </P> <P> But they spared Perez. "(Perez) had the Hispanic vote and the Anglo vote," said  Cunningham, 50, who ran a joint campaign with Roberts. "If a white person asked  me who to vote for the third seat, I told them vote for Perez."  </P> <P> A Latino candidate was virtually assured of winning at least one seat when  longtime Councilman Herbert A. Hennes decided to retire for personal reasons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lakewood  </P> <P> Voters gave Larry Van Nostran a fifth term on the City Council and elected  Joseph Esquival to replace Councilwoman Jacqueline Rynerson, whose retirement  next week will make the council an all-male body for the first time in 12  years.  </P> <P> Esquival, 57, is a quality control engineer for American National Can Co. in  Carson. He has been a city parks and recreation commissioner for 18 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> La Habra Heights  </P> <P> Voters soundly defeated a proposal to increase annual fire fees from $200 to  $500 per parcel, which would have provided money for around-the-clock paramedic  service. They also elected two new City Council candidates who had been  endorsed by the city's retiring mayor.  </P> <P> The winners are Richard Newbre, 55, a real estate lawyer, and Diane Kane, 42,  an environmental planner for the state Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Norwalk  </P> <P> Norwalk Parks and Recreation Commission member Robert J. Arthur, 41, upset  two-term Councilman Marcial (Rod) Rodriguez in a relatively quiet campaign.  Mayor Grace F. Napolitano received the most votes, followed by Arthur and  Councilman Luigi A. Vernola.  </P> <P> The four major candidates ran courteous campaigns, focusing on their  accomplishments and avoiding criticism of their opponents. But Rodriguez had  been criticized by the weekly News Tribune for, among other things, using an  off-duty sheriff's car to carry him to and from Norwalk Dodger Day last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paramount  </P> <P> Mayor Henry Harkema, 78, lost his bid for reelection to the five-member  Paramount City Council. Voters returned Councilman Manuel E. Guillen to office  and selected two newcomers, Elvira (Vera) Amaro and Allen (Joe) Parker.  Harkema, Guillen and Parker were endorsed by Councilman Charles R. Weldon, who  decided not to run for a fourth term.  </P> <P> Amaro, a teaching assistant for the Paramount Unified School District, has  served on the city Water Commission, an appointed position, for the past six  years.  </P> <P> Parker, 51, was also making his first try for an elected office. He was  appointed to the Planning Commission more than a year ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pico Rivera  </P> <P> City Councilmen John G. Chavez and Albert Natividad won reelection in Pico  Rivera, while challenger Richard L. Mercado Sr., 55, a city building inspector,  overtook incumbent Gilbert De La Rosa, an eight-year City Council veteran. The  victory was Mercado's first in five efforts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Signal Hill  </P> <P> Incumbent Councilwoman Sara Dodds Hanlon lost her seat to Carol A. Churchill,  chairwoman of the Planning Commission. Signal Hill voters reelected Mayor  Gerard Goedhart for the second open council seat.  </P> <P> Churchill, a lawyer, credited her victory to her "strong position" against a  large development proposed for the city's hilltop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> South Gate  </P> <P> Voters elected three new City Council members, signaling a change in the  balance of power on the five-member South Gate council.  </P> <P> Mayor Herbert W. Cranton, 66, the only incumbent seeking reelection, was  defeated. The three victorious newcomers -- Mary Ann Buckles, 50; Larry R.  Leonard, 47, and Johnny Ramirez, 35 -- were endorsed by Councilmen Robert A.  Philipp and Gregory Slaughter, who frequently found themselves on the losing  side of key votes by the five-member council. Philipp and Slaughter were not up  for reelection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Whittier  </P> <P> Two City Council candidates who campaigned for slow growth were elected in one  of the most spirited campaigns in decades. An incumbent who had defended  Whittier's recent development policies was defeated.  </P> <P> "(The vote) is a mandate against the policies of the old-boy network that has  run this town," said Helen McKenna Rahder, a teacher and local activist who led  the field of 10 candidates in the hotly contested race. "It means that the  preservationists, the slow-growthers and the younger environmentally aware vote  has come through. This is a statement for quality of life and quality  development standards."  </P> <P> Bob Henderson, an insurance broker and former councilman, won the second  council seat.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Michele Fuetsch, Tina Griego, David Haldane, Lee Harris,  Rick Holguin and Roxana Kopetman contributed to this report.  </P></p>

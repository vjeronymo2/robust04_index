			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE PUTS NO STOCK IN THE BUG MARKET  </P> <P> Cathy Endfield, the "Rent-a-Bug-Lady" (Sept. 30) says insects are lacking in  pain receptors and have no emotional life. Unfortunately, the real issue  involves the worldwide disappearance of wildlife.  </P> <P> Pet shops have long drained remote places of tropical fish, reptiles and birds.  Now insect dealers and shell shops are trading in more exotic organisms.  Poaching, habitat loss and human encroachment have made even isolated species  vulnerable.  </P> <P> Beetles, butterflies, ants, wasps, scorpions and grasshoppers serve a purpose  in nature. Insects pollinate flowers and fruit, and are essential to the food  chain. Beetles are an important part in the breakdown of leaves, twigs and  rotting wood.  </P> <P> By creating a market for the world's largest or most beautiful moths, spiders  and beetles, as well as the ugly or unattractive forms, these dead-bug dealers  continue the attack on the now-fragile ecosystem. None of these mounted  specimens will ever reproduce.  </P> <P> This siphoning off of rare and unusual species must stop, or we may be witness  to the end of nature.  </P> <P> RICK SEED  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

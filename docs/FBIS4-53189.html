			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said Thailand is  entitled to make comments about Cambodia, and confirmed  Thailand's policy of non-involvement. The prime minister said  it is impossible to end the conflict in Cambodia through  fighting, which would worsen the situation. He urges that  diplomatic means be used to solve the problem. The prime  minister also confirmed Thailand's policy of non-involvement.    [Begin Chuan recording] We have the right to make our  opinion known, but we have no right to carry out actions in  their country. We are entitled to make comments -- whether we  support or do not support any options. We the Thai people, as  we already had an experience, we realize that it is difficult to  solve national problems by making war. The problem would worsen  and great damage would be done to the nation, making it  difficult to restore law and order in a short time. We  therefore believe that any problem should be settled through  political and diplomatic means, which is more appropriate. [end  recording]    Concerning Cambodia's repeated accusations of Thailand, the  prime minister said it is the responsibility of the Foreign  Ministry and the Thai Government to clarify things to it.</p>

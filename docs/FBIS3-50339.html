			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today the Bucharest Territorial Military Court  accepted the application of Andruta Ceausescu [brother of former  dictator Nicolae Ceausescu], requesting that he should be  released from jail for health reasons.    The judges decided to set Ceausescu free for the next six  months, considering that he is suffering from illnesses that  cannot be cured within the penitentiary system.    The ROMPRES news agency reminds us that, in his capacity as  commander of the Baneasa school of Romania's Ministry of  Interior, in December 1989 Andruta Ceausescu participated in the  repression of demonstrators, after which he was sentenced to 15  years imprisonment and reducing to the ranks, for attempted  aggravated murder and the instigation of genocide.</p>

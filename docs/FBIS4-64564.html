			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Co Welgraven: "Crucial Role Is for Biggest </F> Winner"]    [Text] Following the sensational election result, a  government of the CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal], PvdA [Labor  Party], and the Elderly People's Party is, in theory, possible.  This gray coalition can count on a slight majority with 78  seats. The CDA and VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] managed to survive for four years, from 1977 to 1981,  with one less seat, so why not?    There is no shortage of alternatives. But many are not  realistic and have already been ruled out by those in question.  This is true, for example, of a national government of the four  major parties.    What is sure is that any majority government must include  three parties. A coalition goverment of only two parties is out  of the question. More than anything else, this shows the  weakened position of the CDA, which has been used to governing  alternatively with the PvdA and the VVD.    Reasonably sure, too, is that the D66 [Democrats 66] is  going  to play a crucial role in the formation of any new government.  A government which does not include Hans Van Mierlo's party is  virtually inconceivable. In this respect, the position of the  D66 is in theory stronger than that of the three other major  parties.    There are in fact just three serious possibilities. The  least probable is a government of the Right including the CDA,  VVD and D66, which would have 89 seats in Parliament. For  tactical reasons, however, Van Mierlo is reluctant to exclude  this option, but it is difficult to imagine that the D66, which  is constantly pressing for government reform, will be prepared  to go down in history as the party which assisted a majority  government of the Right. This would most probably annul  yesterday's gains at future elections, at the very least. The  party still remembers how the electorate judged the summer  government of the CDA and D66 back in 1982.    That leaves two options. One is the purple coalition of the  PvdA, VVD, and D66. Such a government would have a solid  parliamentary majority with 92 seats. Finally, there is the  center-left option, with a government of the PvdA, CDA, and D66  with 95 seats.    It is still going to be difficult to choose. The D66 is a  great supporter of a purple coalition and this party's opinion,  which was the big winner at the elections, naturally carries a  great deal of weight.    The advantage of such a purple coalition is that it would  also include the election runner-up, the VVD. During the  election campaign, VVD leader Bolkestein already stated that the  two winners should sit together in a future government. He left  the question open as to whether the third party should be the  CDA or the PvdA.    The advantage for the CDA as a non-participating party is  that it could seek the shelter of the opposition ranks in order  to solve its leadership crisis. With a loss of 20 seats and a  discredited party leader, its further participation in the  government, as if nothing had happened, would be difficult to  justify.    The disadvantages of a purple coalition, however, are just  as  numerous. There are a number of major problems in terms of  political programs. How will the PvdA and the VVD be able  bridge their differences on the future of the social security  system? And what about the conflict over education for illegal  immigrants? Bolkestein has already made it clear that these are  subjects which must be discussed.    A center-left government of the CDA, PvdA, and D66 seems  somewhat easier. The differences, in particular in the  financial-economic area, are not insurmountable. The D66 will  want the concession from the PvdA that the social security  system is not sacrosanct. But is a government of three parties  in which two of the parties suffered serious losses at the polls  really acceptable? The CDA and PvdA together have lost a total  of 32 seats, a loss on an unprecedented scale.    The PvdA has the trump card as the biggest party. It will  probably be given the first initiative [to form a government].  But probably not alone. Also in the game is D66. It is still  possible that two persons, one from the PvdA as the largest  party and one from the D66 as the winning party, will be  designated to test the ground for the formation of a government.    They would first of all look at the possibilities for a  purple coalition. This would appeal to the D66 in particular,  which would certainly make concessions to its program to achieve  it. A purple government is Hans Van Mierlo's dream.    His PvdA colleague Kok is much less enthusiastic, but cannot  quickly disregard the possibility. To reject it would  automatically mean bringing in the Christian Democrats and  giving them a trump card to play, because the CDA also knows  that, if a purple coalition does not work, the PvdA has only one  other remaining option: a center-left government. Moreover, in  such negotiations, the D66 is likely to adopt a much tougher  stance than in a purple coalition. The party has repeatedly  stated that it will not simply fall into line with the CDA and  PvdA.    Whichever of these two coalitions will actually come to  power, one of the bizarre results of these elections may be that  the man who has imposed two legislative election defeats on the  PvdA and who has brought it to a an all-time electoral low may  well become the first social democrat prime minister for 17  years.</p>

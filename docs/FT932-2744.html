			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: London Scottish Bank up 11% as loan arrears improve LONDON SCOTTISH Bank, the consumer finance company, yesterday announced an 11 per cent rise in interim profits after its income from personal loans rose for the first time in two years. The bank, which makes consumer loans and collects debts on behalf of other companies, said its rise in pre-tax profits for the half year to April 27 to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 1.81m) reflected an improvement in loan arrears as recession eased. Income from interest on loans rose 2.5 per cent to Pounds 9.75m (Pounds 9.51m), which the bank said was the first rise in loan income since April 1991. Income from commission on third party debt collection rose 17 per cent to Pounds 3.11m (Pounds 2.66m). Mr Jack Livingstone, chairman, said the rise in interest income had been produced by an improvement in arrears, as the net value of loans to customers - less unearned interest and insurance payments - rose to Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 37.5m). The bad debt charge fell Pounds 184,000 to Pounds 1.06m. The results were also helped by a 13.9 per cent fall in finance costs for funding lending to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 1.4m) following the fall in base rates. Income from the sale of Christmas hampers - for which customers contribute weekly - fell by 5.1 per cent to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 1.17m). The bank said orders in the first 26 weeks, which will be taken into profit in December, had risen by 15 per cent. Income from insurance to cover interruptions in loan payments fell by 1.3 per cent to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.93m). The figure was affected by higher unemployment. The interim dividend is increased by 8.4 per cent to 1.03p (0.95p). Diluted earnings per share rose by 8.7 per cent to 2.5p (2.3p). The shares closed 1/2 p down at 82 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gengold shelves development plans GENGOLD, the gold arm of South Africa's Gencor group, has been forced to mothball the developing Weltevreden mine and shelve plans to deepen a shaft at Winkelhaak because of a weak gold price. Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said work had been stopped at Weltevreden because the gold price was 41 per cent lower than envisaged when the project was undertaken. He said a price of R45,000 (Dollars 16,304) per kilogram would be needed to restart the project. The current price is under R31,000 per kilogram. Mr Maude said the Winkelhaak shaft would be viable at a gold price of R32,000 a kilogram. The price, however, was weakening. The average price received by group mines in the June quarter was R32,071 per kilogram. Previously announced plans to merge Winkelhaak and Kinross Gold Mines would be delayed. A feature of the group's results for the quarter was the substantial contribution to profits from hedging. Mr Maude said the group had made hedging profits of R16.8m during the quarter from the forward selling of nearly 147,000 ounces of production. He added that hedging profits had accounted for about one third of the 5 per cent improvement in group after-tax profits, to R70.6m compared with the previous quarter. Gengold mines hedge up to 20 per cent of production. The R1.3bn first-phase capital programme for Oryx mine in the Orange Free State is continuing.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ACTOR QUINN DOESN'T FEAR DEATH  </P> <P> Anthony Quinn says he's never been scared of dying, not even by heart bypass  surgery. But he admitted making out a will before he underwent surgery last  month.  </P> <P> Quinn called the operation "a breeze" in an interview taped Wednesday for "The  Joan Rivers Show."  </P> <P> "It's complicated for the doctor, but for you it's very simple," the  75-year-old actor said.  </P> <P> Although he made out the will before going under the knife, he said the thought  of dying doesn't worry him.  </P> <P> "I've never been afraid of death," he said. "I don't think it exists. . . . I  think it's just a change that you go through.  </P> <P> "There's a light at the other end of a tunnel that is just another life, and I  think it's a better life than this one, without all the wars and all the hunger  and all the nonsense that's going on now."  </P> <P> The interview will be broadcast Friday.  </P></p>

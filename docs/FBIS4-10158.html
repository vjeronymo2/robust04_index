			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Benitez] </F>   [Text] Asuncion, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Paraguayan peasant  organizations have been sustaining a confrontation with the  government for the past two months. They warned that the country  is risking a class struggle due to the official lack of  sensitivity to solving rural problems.    Peasant and executive branch relations had entered a stage  of  relative calm following President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's decision  last month to create the Social Development Council, seeking an  open dialogue will all social and economic groups.    Everything indicated that council negotiations were going to  end with a final agreement. The signing of the agreement was  even announced for 5 April. But that day the Senate approved a  government decision blocking the pardoning of a portion of  producers' debts to the Agriculture Development Fund (CAH),  which angered peasants.    Peasant leaders withdrew from the negotiating table  temporarily. However, they later said they considered the  position of the executive and legislative branches a joke,  adding that in these circumstances they were not willing to  agree to anything.    "The Senate decision is an insult to peasants, an attack  against them that will deteriorate their situation even more,"  said Alfonso Cohene of the National Peasants Federation. Cohene  added that they cannot pay all their debts because they are  being paid too little for their products.    The secretary of the National Peasant Organization (ONAC)  based in Coronel Oviedo, in the country's center, believes the  executive and legislative branches' attitude is offensive to  farmers, adding that it endangers the future of more than  250,000 families dedicated to cotton cultivation.    "It is a dangerous provocation, and the result is obvious  because the country is made up of a majority of poor people who  are getting increasingly poor and a minority of rich people who  are getting increasingly rich," ONAC Secretary Adolfo Ortiz told  EFE.    Peasants distrust everyone. They no longer believe in  official promises. They can make mistakes if they are pushed  against the wall, Ortiz admitted, citing as an example what  happened at the beginning of the week in Colony Yby Pe, San  Pedro Department, some 300 km north of Asuncion.    On that occasion a group of landless peasants blocked a road  and held four Agrarian Reform Institute (IBR) technicians  hostage for 24 hours in order to force a meeting with IBR  officials.    "If we follow this path we are not too far from violence and  class struggle," Ortiz said. The peasant leader announced that  national peasant organizations' representatives will meet on 8  April to discuss a strategy to face the derogatory campaign  launched by the government against rural demands.    "We have enough reasons to walk away from the negotiating  table and resort to new mobilizations. We cannot negotiate for  six or seven months. We have concrete problems, and they need  urgent solutions," Ortiz stressed.    Thousands of peasants marched on Asuncion on 15 March. It  was  the largest rural demonstration the country can remember.  Peasants protested Wasmosy's economic policies, demanding more  land, better prices for their products, and more efficient  sanitary and educational assistance.    In the past two months, peasants have blocked several  highways in the country's northeast, east, center, and south in  support of their demands. They also are holding the largest  portion of their cotton production in their farms.    According to official figures, cotton bins have received  only  30 percent of the total volume anticipated for the year, despite  a 15 percent price increase over what was initially estimated.</p>

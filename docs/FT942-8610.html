			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: EDS and software group agree licence deal Electronic Data Systems, the computing services company, and Computer Associates, the provider of systems and application software, have ended a 28-month legal dispute and announced a software licensing agreement they claim to be the largest. Computer Associates sued EDS in 1991, alleging it had obtained unauthorised access to its software and used it without paying fees to process data for third parties. The centrepiece of the agreement is a 12-year licence, renewable for a further five years, giving EDS broad and flexible use of all current Computer Associates products for itself and its customers throughout the world. Where appropriate, EDS will standardise on Computer Associates products at all its information processing centres. EDS will become a value-added reseller of Computer Associates software. It will initially have the right to resell Dollars 100m of CA-Unicenter, a systems management package for the client/server market. The two sides are discussing an agreement for Computer Associates to outsource the information technology support for some of its administrative and financial functions to EDS. Both refused to put a value on the settlement. Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, said the deal was unrelated to Monday's news that General Motors, which owns EDS, was considering spinning it off to facilitate a possible merger between EDS and Sprint, the telecommunications group. Mr Alberthal said EDS had long believed an alliance with a leading software group would be of benefit.</p>

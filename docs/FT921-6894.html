			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / S African Conservatives urged to reject reforms SOUTH Africa's pro-apartheid Conservative party yesterday urged its supporters to reject political reform, and vote 'no' in next month's whites-only referendum. Mr Andries Treurnicht, the Conservative leader, said the party's leadership had wished to boycott the poll but rank and file members had outvoted them. The party met for several hours on Monday night and all day yesterday to resolve the dispute over participation. Mr Treurnicht, announcing the start of the 'no' campaign in a radio broadcast, referred several times to the possibility that the Conservatives might lose the referendum, an outcome which would have grave political consequences for the party. 'If we lose, this is not the end of the political war in South Africa,' he said, adding, 'there is still a white nation that cannot be wished away.' Asked whether his party expected to win the poll, Mr Treurnicht said only that victory would be 'difficult, but it is possible'. The Conservatives cannot count on a united right wing front in the referendum campaign, which may also explain their reluctance to participate. Yesterday Mr Eugene Terre Blanche, leader of the largest right wing splinter group, the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), or Afrikaner Resistance Movement, said it would do all in its power to stop South Africa's 3m whites voting in the poll. 'We cannot allow them to be led to the slaughter like lambs,' said the AWB leader, who shares Conservative party demands for a return to apartheid and creation of an all-white state, but supports the violence which the Conservatives eschew. He threatened violent resistance, saying blacks, who outnumber whites by five to one, 'have declared war on your property rights . . . We are going to have war.' The referendum is a political gamble by Mr FW de Klerk, the president and leader of the ruling National party, to marginalise the Conservatives. He has challenged them to prove that they represent the majority of whites, but has phrased the referendum question so that all but the most committed racists will support it - including not only members of his party but also supporters of the liberal Democratic party. If they lose, the Conservatives will be left with little constitutional outlet for their opposition, with only 42 seats in a parliament dominated by 102 National party MPs. If Mr de Klerk loses the referendum, he will resign and call a general election, which the Conservatives could expect to win on a pro-apartheid ticket. Stark choice for white voters, Page 4</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRANIFF STRUGGLING TO FIND BUYER, CREDITORS TOLD  </P> <P> Executives of Braniff Inc. told a roomful of disgruntled creditors Tuesday that  the airline was just getting by as a "limited charter carrier" while seeking a  buyer and continues to run up expenses under bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> "We have a number of alternate plans, but each plan requires investments," said  Howard McKinnon, the company's chief operating officer, who along with Braniff  Chairman Bill McGee has been talking to potential investors or outright buyers  for the Orlando-based airline.  </P> <P> The lack of adequate funding "prevents us from having any meaningful discussion  or planning," McKinnon said, adding that pressure from creditors "clouds this  whole issue."  </P> <P> Howard T. Glassman, a Philadelphia lawyer representing Braniff, told the  creditors in one of a series of meetings conducted by the bankruptcy trustee  that there was no clear picture of the airline's future.  </P> <P> But officials said they do not expect Braniff to go into liquidation and sell  its assets.  </P> <P> The company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors Sept. 28, has  275 to 300 employees left from a total of about 4,800, the officials said. It  is losing money on a charter operation run by 15 pilots.  </P> <P> Mark Osterberg, Braniff's senior vice president for finance, said in response  to questions from creditors' lawyers that the company had about $500,000 cash  in hand and monthly expenses of about $1.7 million, including $1 million in  payroll for remaining employees. The figures do not include hefty legal fees,  the charter operation and other non-scheduled expenses, he said.  </P> <P> Osterberg also said the company pays $1 million in rental costs every month.  Braniff anticipates some $3 million to $4 million in credit card fees and  another $1.5 million from other sources this coming month, he said.  </P></p>

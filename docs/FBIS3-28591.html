[TEC] will introduce a  system of international bidding for procuring large  general-purpose equipment, including hydraulic power generators.  As the first step, TEC will invite European companies to join  in an international bid to be held in the near future to procure  a water turbine for one of its generators. TEC has so far held  international bidding only for procuring high-tech equipment  such as nuclear reactors, or for general-purpose equipment such  as transmission lines which would require only a small amount of  funds. TEC is expected to place constant orders for equipment  -- such as hydraulic power generation equipment which requires  relatively large amounts of funds. If the international bidding  for this procurement should be expanded, it would be useful in  easing the demand by the United States and European countries to  open the Japanese market.    TEC plans to place an order for a water turbine for one of  its generator to replace the obsolete turbine at Yukawa  Hydraulic Power Station (in Nagano), and also to increase its  generating capability to 18,000 kilowatt-hours. Prior to the  bidding, in late January four Japanese companies and three  European manufacturers -- including Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba  Corporation as well as GEC Arstaum-Nelpick of France,  Fest-Alpine of Austria, and Surdzer- Eshawis of Switzerland  [names as published] respectively -- were entrusted with  estimations.    Various European countries have criticized Japanese electric  power companies for favoring mostly American companies such as  General Electric (GE) as far as international biddings are  conducted. European companies are known for high technological  standards in manufacturing hydraulic power generators. TEC has  judged that with the participation of the three European  companies in this bidding, various European countries will  become less dissatisfied.    A water turbine costs hundreds of million in yen. However,  in addition to turbine used at the Yukawa Hydraulic Station, TEC  still has many hydraulic power stations whose turbines have to  be replaced. Therefore, it is expected that a considerable  number of orders for water turbines will be placed in the  future. If TEC should succeed in the current order, the company  intends to invite more foreign companies to join in the bidding  for large machines such as thermal power generators.</p>

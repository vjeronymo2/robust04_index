			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Holiday flat rental My son, a US expatriate, owns a small flat in Limassol, Cyprus which I let to holidaymakers on his behalf, by advertising in the UK press and receiving the rents plus the returnable deposits here; the cheques being in my name. Sometimes I let the flat to Scandinavian and German holidaymakers who usually send cash by registered post. The rent is about Pounds 100 per week and the total income is about Pounds 3,000 a year gross. The expenses are advertising, telephone/fax (payable in the UK), and water, electricity, gas, local property taxes, repairs, cleaning materials. It is obvious that this service is provided overseas but paid for in the UK. 1) Am I liable to UK income tax? 2) Is he liable to UK income tax? 3) If either of us is liable to UK tax how can we arrange our affairs to avoid UK taxation? It seems clear that your son's income from the letting of his flat in Cyprus falls only within the scope of case V of Schedule D (Income from foreign possessions); consequently it is exempt from UK tax for as long as he is not resident in the UK, by virtue of section 18(1) (a) (iii) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It is also exempted from UK tax by articles 6 and 22 of the US-UK double taxation convention, for as long as he is resident in the US. You may like to ask your tax office for the free booklet IR20 (Residents and nonresidents: liability to tax in the UK). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

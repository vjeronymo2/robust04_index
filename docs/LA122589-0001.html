			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINISHING STRONG, THE SAINTS FINISH OFF COLTS WITH A ROUT  </P> <P> For New Orleans, it was a great finish to a disappointing season. For  Indianapolis, it was a disappointing ending to a promising season.  </P> <P> John Fourcade passed for two touchdowns and ran for one Sunday, leading New  Orleans to a 41-6 victory over Indianapolis that ended the Colts' playoff hopes  and gave the Saints an unprecedented third straight winning season.  </P> <P> "Everything rolled their way," Colt Coach Ron Meyer said. "It looked like we  were always a play behind them."  </P> <P> New Orleans, which never finished above the .500 mark in its first 20 seasons,  failed to make the playoffs despite a 9-7 record.  </P> <P> The Colts, who needed a victory to gain a wild-card berth, finished 8-8, one  game behind Buffalo in the AFC East.  </P> <P> Fourcade, who had never started a regular-season game until three weeks ago,  completed 21 of 28 passes for 291 yards and ran five times for 30 yards.  </P> <P> He hit Eric Martin with a three-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter and  Hoby Brenner with a 30-yarder five seconds into the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The Saints' quarterback also came up with a few free-lance plays, such as a  shovel pass to fullback Craig Heyward after being chased from the pocket.  </P> <P> "I used to be on a flag football team, and we had that play," Fourcade said.  "Craig wasn't on that team, but he sure picked it up in a hurry."  </P> <P> The Saints won eight of their last 11 games after starting the season 1-4.  </P> <P> "We have nobody to blame but ourselves (for missing the playoffs)," New Orleans  linebacker Pat Swilling said. "We dug our own hole with that 1-4 start. But it  still hurts."  </P> <P> The Colts also blew their chance to make the playoffs, but Meyer wasn't bitter  about it.  </P> <P> "Thank heavens we were in a position to be there," he said. "There were a lot  of football teams, like the Saints, playing on sheer pride."  </P> <P> New Orleans scored on a seven-yard run by Dalton Hilliard in the third quarter,  a two-yard run by Fourcade in the fourth period and a 63-yard interception  return by Toi Cook with 1:37 left in the game.  </P> <P> Morten Andersen added two field goals for the Saints, a 21-yarder in the first  quarter and a 29-yarder with 3:05 left to play in the game.  </P> <P> Hilliard scored 114 points and Andersen 104 this season, the first pair of  100-point scorers in Saints history. Hilliard is the first non-kicker to hit  the century mark for New Orleans.  </P> <P> The Colts' only points came on a pair of field goals by Dean Biasucci in the  second quarter, from 41 and 22 yards.  </P> <P> The Saints held Eric Dickerson, who rushed for more than 1,300 yards this  season, to 54 yards in 16 carries.  </P> <P> "I had no idea we could hold them without a touchdown," Saint Coach Jim Mora  said. "We were concerned about their offense, with Dickerson and that offensive  line they have."  </P> <P> Indianapolis quarterback Jack Trudeau completed 15 of 27 passes for 118 yards  and was intercepted twice.  </P> <P> Backup Tom Ramsey threw the pass that was picked off by Cook in the final  quarter.  </P></p>

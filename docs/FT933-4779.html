			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Last stop in plan for privatisation FOR the French government, the merger between Renault and Volvo is the last stop on the road to privatising one of the most important symbols of state-owned industry. In May, Renault was placed on the list of the 21 state-owned companies targeted for sale as part of the government's ambitious privatisation programme which gets under way this autumn with the sale of Banque Nationale de Paris. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday that he hoped Renault's privatisation could take place from the second half of 1994, depending on market conditions and the performance of the merger. The government's desire to see Renault in the private sector reflects both pragmatic and strategic considerations. The strength of the company and its familiarity with French and international investors makes it a relatively attractive candidate for privatisation. Industry analysts estimate that a sale of the government's entire stake could raise about FFr40bn (Dollars 6.87bn), a substantial asset in the government's plans to curb its budget deficit, targeted at FFr317bn this year and FFr300bn next year. Plans to privatise Renault also reflect a conviction in Mr Balladur's government that the competitiveness of French industry requires reduced state intervention and a greater role for market forces. Privatisation will, however, be a delicate task. In particular, the government is determined to maintain French control of the merged car group after the sale of its shares. French control is important for political reasons. 'Renault's history means the merger and privatisation are a very sensitive political issue,' says a government official. 'It will require careful handling.' Such careful handling is evident throughout the terms of yesterday's deal which includes a series of measures to maintain French control after privatisation and to protect the company from predators. At the core of this structure is the creation of two companies - a holding company (RVC), and a company which pools the automotive interests of Renault and Volvo (Renault-Volvo Automotive). The holding company has 35 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive. Initially, the French government will hold 51 per cent of RVC and 46.4 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive, giving it effective control of the group at both levels. But with privatisation, which is expected to involve the sale of the state's direct 46.4 per cent stake in Renault-Volvo Automotive, the dominance of French investors is obviously threatened. Once privatised, the whole shareholding structure changes, but French control may not. Under the agreement with Volvo, the French state reserves to right to retain a 'golden share' in Renault-Volvo Automotive when the group is privatised. This device will require French approval for any increase or participation in the share capital of Renault-Volvo Automotive, up to a certain, unspecified, level. In addition, the government will seek to assemble a core of long-term stable French investors in Renault SA, the majority shareholder in RVC which holds 35 per cent of Renault-Volvo Automotive. The government itself could be one of these shareholders. The rest of this core is likely to comprise state-owned banks and insurance companies. But it could also involve industrial companies. One such group is Matra-Hachette, the French defence electronics and media company. Its cars division co-produces the Espace luxury van with Renault.</p>

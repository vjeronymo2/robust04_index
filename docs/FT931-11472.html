			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai carrier blames higher costs for fall THAI Airways International, the partially-privatised national airline, yesterday blamed higher costs and increasing competition for a sharp fall in profits in the first quarter to December 31. Thai announced that net profits fell to Bt120m (Dollars 4.7m) in the quarter from Bt792.2m a year earlier. In a statement to the Thai stock exchange, the airline said operating expenses rose 8.32 per cent over the year, while yields were lower than expected because the airline decided to maintain market share by lowering fares on some routes. Thai said there was strong competition in Asia from new airlines such as Eva and Aseana. Thai said it would cut costs by suspending some investments which would not affect earnings, and would introduce marketing strategies such as frequent-flier programmes.</p>

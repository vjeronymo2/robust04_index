			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / German coal levy is ruled illegal Germany's heavily subsidised coal industry was thrown into turmoil yesterday after the country's constitutional court ruled that a controversial levy paid by industrial and private electricity consumers to support domestic coal production was unconstitutional. The decision was immediately welcomed by Mr Erwin Teufel, prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, who said the Kohlepfennig, the special levy to protect domestic coal production against imports, was 'unjust and against the principles of the free market economy'. But Germany's powerful miners' trade union, IG Bergbau, called the findings 'hugely disappointing'. 'It is now up to the government to act as quickly as possible to find a way to subsidise our coal after 1995,' said Mr Christoph Meer, a union spokesman. The constitutional court's decision comes eight years after the case was first sent to it by the district court in Moers, near Dusseldorf, acting on behalf on an individual who refused to pay the Kohlepfennig. The court said yesterday the government would have to phase out the levy by the end of next year. That would coincide with the termination of another coal subsidy, the Jahrhundertvertrag, which obliges German electricity utilities to buy domestic coal. 'We respect the decision of the court,' said Mr Friedrich Bohl, chancellery minister, adding that the government 'would scrutinise the ruling carefully'. The Kohlepfennig, which amounts to a 7.5 per cent levy on industrial and consumer electricity prices, was introduced in 1976 as a means of protecting domestic coal production against cheap coal imports. A tonne of west German coal costs DM280-DM290 (Pounds 114-Pounds 118) against imports costing an average DM83-DM90. At the same time, under the terms of the Jahrhundertvertrag, Germany's electricity companies are commited to buying about 40m tonnes of domestic coal a year to protect the industry. In all, through the Kohlepfennig, the government has been subsidising the coal sector to the tune of about DM8bn a year. But German industry, which is saddled with some of the highest electricity prices in the European Union - tarrifs are 30 per cent more expensive than neighbouring France - has repeatedly demanded a reform of the subsidies, claiming they have hindered competitiveness, and competition. In response, the government decided in November 1993 to extend the entire system only until the end of 1996, to impose a 4.5 per cent Kohlepfennig on east Germany even though the region neither produces nor consumes hard coal, and to reduce subsidies to DM7bn between 1997 and 2000. No decision has yet been made about how to finance the subsidies after 1996. Yesterday's court ruling means the matter can no longer be postponed.</p>

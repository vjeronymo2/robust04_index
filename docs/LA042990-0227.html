			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GAO LABORING MIGHTILY TO REFORM AGRICULTURE DEPT.;  </P> <P> BUREAUCRACY: CONGRESSIONAL WATCHDOG MAY HAVE BITTEN OFF MORE THAN IT CAN CHEW  WITH HUGE AGENCY MIRED IN INERTIA, WORK-FORCE PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> Congressional watchdogs continue to nip at the Agriculture Department in hopes  the creaky old agency will modernize itself before the 20th Century ends.  </P> <P> But the structure and inertia of USDA are formidable. Attempts have been made  for 45 years -- largely unsuccessful -- to streamline departmental field  structure and management.  </P> <P> The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has been  studying USDA organization and departmental inhibitions for at least two years.  A preliminary report was issued in December.  </P> <P> Formal responses to GAO's analysis will be sought from departmental agencies  and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter when the final report is ready later  in the year.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the GAO has followed up its initial review with a supplemental  report to Yeutter about the need for improved work-force planning in his  department. Such planning should be mandatory, the GAO said.  </P> <P> At its simplest, work-force planning means getting the right people in the  right jobs, now and over the long haul. The object is to deliver government  services to the public, efficiently and economically.  </P> <P> The problems involve 36 agencies that carry out the department's policies and  programs. In 1988, the GAO said, those functions cost taxpayers more than $44  billion and required the services of 110,000 full-time employees in more than  15,000 places around the world.  </P> <P> "USDA agencies are experiencing problems recruiting highly skilled workers,  providing adequate training to employees, developing effective managers, and  managing a culturally diverse work force," the latest report said. "These  problems are longstanding, pervasive and will likely continue given present  trends in USDA and in the federal government."  </P> <P> The growing importance of food safety, water quality and biotechnology requires  more scientists in USDA's work force. Yet a shortage of scientists generally,  as well as competition from the private sector, put USDA at a disadvantage.  </P> <P> Moreover, the report said, agencies within USDA "sometimes find themselves  competing against each other for people from the same job occupations, a  condition which is counterproductive from a departmental standpoint."  </P> <P> Another inhibitor has been the lack of a departmental recruiting program. Each  USDA agency goes its own way and generally does not refer unneeded applicants  to other agencies.  </P> <P> However, the report noted that the department's Office of Personnel has  recently contracted to develop a videotape for recruiting new employees.  </P> <P> "As the agricultural economy becomes more consumer-driven than  production-oriented, USDA needs employees with backgrounds in marketing  management to supplement the skills of their other employees trained in the  agricultural sciences," the report said.  </P> <P> When the GAO looked at employee training, there were many indications of  "poorly or inadequately trained staff" in a number of areas. Also, the report  cited "continuing problems in achieving and maintaining an ethnically diverse  work force" of women and minorities.  </P> <P> A major GAO complaint is that department agencies generally address only a  single year's needs to patch up a problem when long-range remedies are in  order. This has been apparent in the Farmers Home Administration and the  Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, for example.  </P></p>

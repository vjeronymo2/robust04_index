			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fifth Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Commission adopted rules providing that gross revenues, assets and personal net worth of affiliates of a broadband PCS applicant are attributed to the applicant and counted toward certain eligibility criteria. These affiliation requirements are intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the Commission's size standards from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities. These safeguards ensure, pursuant to Section 309(j)(3) of the Communications Act, that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  designated entities are provided with meaningful economic opportunities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services. Generally, affiliation arises when the applicant (or an attributable investor in the applicant) controls or has power to control another entity or if the applicant (or an attributable investor in the applicant) is under the control of the other entity. In developing its affiliation rules, the Commission borrowed from rules that are used by SBA to make size determinations, including guidelines used to establish when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of an applicant and other safeguards designed to ensure that only qualified entities are eligible for special benefits under the SBA's ``section 8(a)'' program. The Commission failed, however, to adopt an exemption in the SBA's rules that excluded from affiliation coverage entities owned and controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations. See 13 CFR 121.401(b), 121.1102(a), 124.112(c). SBA is required by statute generally to determine the size of a small business concern owned by an Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe) ``without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe.'' <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The SBA has incorporated these and other statutory provisions into its regulations. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10)(J)(ii). The term ``Indian tribe'' defined in 25 U.S.C. 450b(e) includes ``any Indian tribe, band nation, or other organized groups or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.] which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.'' See also 15 U.S.C. 632(d) (defining ``Qualified Indian tribe'' for purposes of the Small Business Act; 25 CFR Part 83 (Department of the Interior procedures for establishing that an American Indian group exists as an Indian tribe). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Small Business Size Standards, 54 FR 52634, 52635 (Dec. 21, 1989) (amending 13 CFR 121.401(b)); Small Business Size Regulations; Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, 59 FR 12811 (March 18, 1994) (amending 13 CFR 121.1102(a), 124.112(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. We have reexamined our eligibility and affiliation rules and will make an amendment to these rules that is more consistent with the other Federal laws, policies and regulations so as not to preclude the eligibility of entities owned and controlled by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations for entrepreneurs' block licenses and for the benefits accorded businesses owned by members of minority groups. We believe that adoption of an affiliation exemption for Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations for purposes of eligibility in the entrepreneurs' blocks is consistent with these other Federal policies <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and complies with the congressional mandate in the auction law. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, this exemption will ensure that the congressional policies of ensuring that minority-owned businesses have the opportunity to participate in spectrum-based services will apply to a class of designated entities, Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, that Congress has determined to be economically disadvantaged. Without the exemption we adopt herein, the Commission would not be able to ensure that all classes of designated entities are provided meaningful opportunities to participate in broadband PCS spectrum auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> C.f.

Cir. 1974). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(D), (3)(B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. We note that Section 7(j)(10)(J) of the Small Business Act gives the SBA the discretion to consider tribal and other affiliations if it determines that one or more such tribally owned businesses have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  We do not believe it is necessary to make such a determination for broadband PCS auctions. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The limited potential number of broadband PCS applicants that may benefit from this affiliation exemption will not present any unfair advantage to other eligible applicants that have had gross revenues up to $125 million and assets of up to $500 million. In addition, this exemption from the affiliation rules applies only to applicants for entrepreneurs' block licenses owned and controlled by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, not independent entities composed of individual Native Americans or other entities composed of individual Native Americans or other entities owned by members of this minority group. Thus, such entities will not have any unfair advantage over other minorities in the entrepreneurs' blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10)(J)(ii)(II). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We will retain the discretion, on a service-specific basis, to determine whether providing this exemption from similar affiliation rules applicable to other auctionable services would give these entities a substantial unfair competitive advantage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. For purposes of determining eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we also attribute to the applicant (in addition to ``affiliates'' as discussed above) the gross revenues, assets and net worth of non-passive investors in the applicant. The attribution and affiliation rules are designed to prevent ineligible parties from exerting control or undue influence over firms eligible to apply for entrepreneurs' block licenses and to ensure that only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  applicants receive broadband PCS licenses. At the same time, we recognized that passive investment in entrepreneurs' block applicants would be critical to the successful development of these smaller companies. To balance these competing considerations, we decided not to attribute investors in corporate applicants that own a 25 percent or less passive equity interest. Passive equity in a corporate applicant was defined to include non-voting stock and no more than 5 percent of the voting stock. An exception was created, however for evaluating a publicly-traded corporation's financial eligibility in the entrepreneurs' blocks: an investor's ownership of no more than 15 percent of the voting stock in a publicly-traded corporate applicant would be considered passive equity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. We now believe that investors in all corporate applicants, including those that are not publicly traded, should be able to include in their 25 percent passive equity investment up to 15 percent of the applicant's voting stock. Both publicly traded and non-publicly traded applicants would have difficulty attracting substantial investment if each individual investor could own no more than 5 percent of the voting stock. Investors that are prepared to devote considerable funds to an entrepreneurs' block applicant should reasonably expect to exercise some ability to protect their investment through a modest level of voting stock ownership. The 15 percent voting stock limit would, in this respect, not rise to the level of a controlling interest, but, from the investor's perspective, could diminish the substantial risks associated with committing funds to a PCS applicant and enhance the potential rewards for providing start-up capital to these new ventures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (1): In the throes of transformation - Social upheaval is rare in Japan. When it takes place, it does so with dramatic suddenness, as in today's radical changes Japan does not evolve gradually like other leading industrialised countries. Instead, it goes through decades of stability, punctuated by upheavals such as the one happening now. Evidence has piled up over the past year that Japan is starting to redefine every aspect of its society. Old maxims, such as stability, consensus, the subordination of the collective will to export-led economic growth, have all been thrown into question. A new blueprint is beginning to emerge. It is only partly drawn and will take years to complete. But the first blurred sketch shows an unpredictable Japan, in which open debate rivals consensus, individual initiative has begun to challenge collective will, and the race for growth is giving way to the challenge of adjusting to a slowly expanding mature economy. Optimists liken the present phase to the start of the Meiji Restoration, Japan's high speed transformation at the end of the 19th century from a medieval to an industrialised society; or to the creation of Japan's economic miracle in the decades after the second world war. Realists point out, however, that for the moment there is no restoration. Japan wavers tantalisingly between the partial destruction of the old order and the construction of a new one. For every few steps forward, it takes a step back. 'Change has been slower and more disorganised than many foreign observers think, but it is real. It is also much stronger than many foreign observers think,' says Mr Kiyoaki Kikuchi, a former ambassador to the United Nations. Nowhere has the transformation been more visible than in politics. Formerly stable Japan has produced four prime ministers over the past year. The monolithic dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party has given way to a shifting web of alliances between 12 parties, in which policies are announced one day to be revoked the next. The breakdown of the old political order began a year ago today, when the electorate voted out the LDP after 38 unbroken years in power. An LDP government returned to office three weeks ago, but this time under a prime minister from the Socialist party, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the LDP's traditional enemy since 1955. It is a partial step back to the old system, but also an illustration of how severely the old structure has been fractured. While a humiliated LDP spent 11 months in opposition, two unstable coalition governments led by a younger generation of reform-minded politicians managed to achieve a long-delayed redesign of the political system and set curbs on political funding. The new rules, to be completed with the redrawing of electoral boundaries this autumn, will make Japanese politicians compete for seats more on the quality of their policy ideas, and less on their newly curtailed ability to hand out favours. The defeat and subsequent weakening of the LDP, which has seen its numbers dwindle through a trickle of defections over the past year, was a terminal blow to the so-called iron triangle of business, politics and the bureaucracy. 'Business no longer knows where to go for favours and the bureaucrats feel there is no power centre,' says Mr Kikuchi. Elements of the old system, in which important decisions were made in secret by LDP factions, are of course still intact. The pact between the LDP and SDP that brought the odd couple to office shows that governments can still be made by the backroom collusion of the LDP's heyday. The LDP and the SDP remain the first and second largest parties respectively. Yet the framework in which they operate has shifted irreversibly. Japan has already moved from one-party rule to a system of three competing political groups; the rump of the LDP; centre-right reformist parties like the Japan Renewal Party and the Komeito clean government party; plus a left wing loosely grouped around the Socialists. Political upheaval may be linked to Japan's longest economic downturn since the second world war, another challenge to the old power structure. There are signs of recovery, but the recession has overturned several traditional assumptions about Japan's economic strength. Unlike previous recessions, this one was at least partly caused by internal structural weakness, rather than just by external blows, like a rise in oil prices. That is why the recession has been a long one, likely to be followed by weak growth, rather than the shallow dips followed by vigorous recoveries shown in previous cycles. The recession has uncovered heavy overcapacity in the former engines of economic advance, the car and electronics industries. These will take years to correct and provide a drag on growth in the future. No industry is an obvious candidate to power the economy in the next decade, as cars and electronics did in the 1980s. The government is backing multi-media as one possibility, but the international competition is intense. There has also been a heavy external shock. In the past few weeks, the yen has risen for the first time through the psychological barrier of Y100 to the dollar, threatening to choke the fragile recovery by further squeezing the yen value of export earnings. Business leaders are running even more scared than they did in previous rounds of yen appreciation. The yen's ability to defy gravity means that even as Japan comes out of recession, there will be no let-up in the pressure on industry to restructure. The outward shift of production capacity to cheaper locations in south-east Asia is accelerating, as a result, raising fears that Japan may deplete its industrial base. Japan's formerly all powerful financial system has also been forced to face up to structural weaknesses. This downturn has left banks straining under a mountain of bad debts, inherited from the unsustainable rise in asset prices of the late 1980s. In previous recessions, banks could be counted on to tide their customers through hard times and provide the funds needed to finance recovery. But this time, banks are letting shaky corporate customers go under in record numbers, rather than allow bad loans to pile up faster. It will take several years for them to reduce bad debts to manageable levels, during which time the banking system's ability to fund a recovery may well be weakened. Economic upsets have gone hand in hand with social change. Japan's social contract, in which companies guarantee a job for life in return for life-time loyalty, is up for renegotiation. Prominent standard bearers of life-time employment, such as NTT, Nippon Steel and Toshiba, have had to cut their workforces. Others, including Sony and Honda, have replaced traditional seniority-based pay with merit awards and encouraged staff to compete for jobs. One reason why Japanese industry still carries so much overcapacity is that it has restructured to nothing like the extent of its US and European competitors. Yet the process has been radical enough to unnerve millions of salarymen who used to think of the company as the staple of their personal lives and have learned to value corporate loyalty above personal initiative. The tradition of life-time employment is still intact, but no longer guaranteed. Social change has stretched to the behaviour of Japan's formerly passive consumers, who are flocking in record numbers to increasingly popular discount retail stores. This is partly a symptom of the pressure on wages. But many analysts believe it also marks an underlying change in attitude. Consumers are starting to realise that they can no longer tolerate the fact that Japan's consumer prices are still on average 80 per cent above the OECD average. Consumers' new taste for a bargain has wide repercussions. It challenges the existence of the multi-layered distribution system, the main feature in Japan's high prices and a factor in the orderliness of its social structure. Deregulation, given fresh emphasis by governments over the past year, has also played a part. The practical impact has been slight so far, but deregulation is popular and widely accepted. Consumers' interests are starting to assert themselves in a society traditionally dominated by producers' interests. It is no surprise that, with all these changes churning away at home, Japan is redefining its place in the international community. The first step has been to start renegotiating its traditional dependence on US leadership. This is a belated response to the end of the cold war, which has reduced Japan's role as a passive US-sponsored bulwark against communism in Asia. Evidence of this is Japan's newly assertive stance on economic relations with the US, as shown by its continued opposition to US demands for numerical targets for increases in imports. When Mr Morihiro Hosokawa met US President Bill Clinton in February, it was the first time that a Japanese prime minister chose to come away from a US summit without an agreement, rather than make concessions. Yet Japan's dependence on US military protection is as strong as ever and may increase with North Korea's nuclear ambitions. While Japan rethinks its US relationship, it has - again belatedly - started to make overtures to its increasingly important Asian neighbours. Mr Hosokawa's unprecedentedly explicit apology for Japan's wartime record helped, for a while, to reduce Japan's isolation in Asia. Unfortunately, the gesture was ruined later when a justice minister in the next government denied that a notorious wartime atrocity had ever occurred. Japan's search for a credible voice of its own will be as sensitive and difficult as the rest of the changes sweeping through the country. Japan is changing from a passive economic machine to something different, but as yet incompletely defined.</p>

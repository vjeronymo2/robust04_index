			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today in the parliament session hall, head of state  Eduard Shevardnadze heard information about the measures taken  by the law enforcement bodies during the period of the state of  emergency in the republic.    Jaba Ioseliani, the chairman of emergency situations;  Parliament Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze; Prime Minister Otar  Patsatsia; ministers, administrators, and representatives of  force departments were present at the session.    The session was conducted in a businesslike and interesting  manner. Full information about the session will be broadcast in  the near future.    We would like to stress the unanimous opinion of the session  participants: That a lot has been done in the republic for  establishing order.    [Begin Shevardnadze recording] After they [Russian  officials]  had noticed these tendencies [of improving the criminal  situation in Georgia], a decision was made that Russian  President Yeltsin visit Georgia in the near future. I would  like to say that in ancient Russian-Georgian relations, this  event is the most significant one. Russian Emperors used to  visit Georgia, our representatives also used to visit Russia,  and you know how they would reach Russia, some would fail  altogether; Soviet leaders used to visit Georgia and there would  be a celebration but then it was still a visit to a colony and a  periphery.    Now, the leader of one of the world's greatest countries is  going to visit independent Georgia, an independent country. The  greatest acknowledgement for Georgia's independence is a visit  by the Russian president and his emphasizing this fact.    Georgia has a lot to tell, her needs are plenty, and there  are many problems that cannot be resolved without Russia, we  have already made sure that they cannot be resolved [without  Russia]. Therefore, it is our essential goal to establish  good-neighborly, friendly and kind relations with Russia. I am  grateful to President Yeltsin for -- if I am not mistaken his  birthday is on 3 February -- having chosen this very day for  visiting this friendly country, to meet these friendly people,  and greet them the way a representative of a great country  should.

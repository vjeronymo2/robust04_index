			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (20): Austerity a la mode - Luxury goods trade faces a period of discomfort WHEN the heads of France's luxury goods groups gather next week in the opulent Louis XVI rooms of the Hotel de Crillon in Paris for their annual Creanova lunch, their mood will be somewhat subdued. France is still the bastion of the international luxury goods industry. Hermes scarves, Dom Perignon champagne, Chanel suits, Louis Vuitton luggage and Guerlain scents are instantly recognisable all over the world. In the 1980s the French luxury goods houses expanded rapidly in a buoyant economic environment. Now, they face a much more competitive climate. For the past two years the luxury goods groups have been beset by a significant slowdown - and changes in consumer taste - in major western markets, notably the US and Germany. Now they face the threat of a similar slowdown in Japan, by far their most buoyant market during the 1980s. At the same time the industry is still adjusting to the structural changes wrought by the influx of investment into luxury goods in the mid 1980s. The expansion of major players - from France's LVMH, to the UK's Dunhill and Seibu of Japan - has turned a fragmented industry of small family firms into a more mature sector dominated by a handful of powerful holding companies. This consolidation has aggravated the recessionary pressures on smaller players. So far it is difficult to assess the full impact of the industry's problems. The situation is complicated by the Gulf War early last year, which caused chaos in the duty free market. The war was cited as the chief scapegoat for last year's lacklustre results. But to some extent it camouflaged the industry's underlying problems, which are now surfacing. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, struck a cautious note at a recent shareholders' meeting when reporting on first quarter trading conditions, as did Mr Pierre Berge, chairman of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house. The chief problem for the luxury goods groups is the economic slowdown in the US which has depressed sales for at least two years. This situation has been aggravated by the financial crisis of the US department stores, the main outlets for designer fashion and expensive cosmetics. The same scenario has been replicated in smaller markets, notably the UK. But more recently the larger European markets of Germany, Italy and France itself have slowed. Although this downturn is chiefly due to economic pressures, it also reflects the shift in tastes against the ostentatious values of the 1980s. Some sectors of the industry have benefited from this, notably the older houses such as Hermes with artisanal roots, whose products evoke the quality and authenticity that consumers are looking for. In spite of the recession, Hermes is selling more of its 2,000 calf leather Kelly bags - which date back to 1935 and take 20 hours to make by hand  - than ever. Other areas of the industry are suffering, particularly the nouveau designers who sprang up in the 1980s and older houses without the same heritage as Hermes. Balmain, for instance, changed hands last summer for the third time in three years. Earlier this month Karl Lagerfeld was sold by Revillon, a privately owned French company, to the UK's Dunhill. The whole industry is waiting to see how Orcofi, the holding company founded by the Vuitton family and the L'Oreal cosmetics empire, fares with Lanvin after its relaunch this autumn. The industry is now threatened by the prospect of a serious slowdown in Japan, which accounts for FFr884m, or a third, of all French designer fashion exports. Until recently Japan was one of the few markets that could be counted on to compensate for the downturn elsewhere. Mr Arnault said that, perfumes apart, LVMH's sales had either fallen or stagnated in Japan during the first quarter of this year. This situation could become more serious if Japan's economy deteriorates further, or if the Japanese follow the same pattern as in the past by responding to economic difficulty by increasing savings and reducing discretionary expenditure. Japan's instability poses another problem in that, in recent years, the Japanese have emerged as an important source of investment for French luxury goods houses. Martine Sitbon, one of the leading young Paris fashion designers, was recently bought out by the Seibu group which already had an interest in Jean-Louis Scherrer. Chantal Thomass and Jean-Paul Gaultier also have business links with Japan. But the flow of funds from Japan could be more limited in the future. Meanwhile, the luxury goods industry is trying to come to terms with its own internal changes. The expansion of French holding companies, such as LVMH and L'Oreal, as well as of foreign players like Dunhill and Seibu, has raised the stakes in the industry. These companies have undoubtedly made it more complex, and much more expensive, to function in the luxury goods sphere by initiating a new era of mainstream management techniques and extravagant marketing. It is these companies that have increased the cost of staging a fashion show. LVMH and YSL may be able to afford to pay up to Dollars 25,000 for super-models like Linda Evangelista or Christy Turlington to appear in their catwalk shows, but the specialist fashion houses cannot. Similarly it now costs around Dollars 50m to publicise the launch of a new perfume worldwide which is well beyond the means of the smaller players. This increase in costs is already taking a toll on smaller companies and some of the most prestigious names in French luxury goods - from the grandest of Bourdeaux chateaux to famous fashion houses - are now up for sale. The consolidation of one of France's largest and once most lucrative industries, aided and abetted by the recession, seems set to go on and on.</p>

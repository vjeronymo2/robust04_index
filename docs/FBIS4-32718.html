			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 25/6/1994 -- "Political  undertakings initiated by the Democratic Convention of Romania  [CDR] regarding a suspension from office of President Ion  Iliescu and a vote of no-confidence prove the ability of this  political alliance to act in the interest of the citizens," CDR  President Emil Constantinescu told a news conference held  Saturday, 25 June, in Bucharest.    "Incitement of local authorities not to put into application  final court decisions as well as President Iliescu's refusal to  give an explanation before Parliament are also violations of the  Constitution and of the principles of democracy," according to  Emil Constantinescu.    As for the censure motion, the CDR front-ranker said that  "it  first of all aims to bring a normal terming to the dialogue  between the government and the country's citizens."    Asked about divergent opinions within the alliance, Emil  Constantinescu and the representatives of other parties in the  alliance admitted that "several divergent opinions are  persisting within the convention" which prove, however, the  democratic spirit of the alliance. While liberal Dinu Patriciu  has drawn attention on the need for the convention "to become a  homogeneous political party, a powerful decision-making  structure" and a right-wing force, Civic Alliance Party  front-ranker Emil Tocaci considered that tensions within the CDR  have been magnified, for the convention "will further be a  reality of the Romanian political life."</p>

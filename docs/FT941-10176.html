			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bayernwerk taps energy opportunities in the east - The west German power group plans a DM5bn investment in Thuringia The Treuhand privatisation agency has sold the remainder of eastern Germany's regional utilities to Bayernwerk, west Germany's third-largest electricity company. Bayernwerk, which has acquired majority stakes in three utilities in the eastern state of Thuringia, will invest more than DM5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) over the next five years and guarantee several thousand jobs. The sale follows separate acquisitions by RWE Energie, the country's largest utility company, and PreussenElektra, the electricity division of Veba, the energy-based conglomerate which together will invest more than DM5.5bn and secure another 8,000-plus jobs. The significance of these acquisitions is that they finally open up east Germany to large investments in the electricity sector. These are expected to exceed DM40bn by the end of the decade. More importantly, the sale ends a bitter three-year-old property rights dispute in which eastern Germany's 164 municipalities had unsuccessfully tried to claim the assets of the region's 15 utility companies with the aim of opening up the sector to genuine competition. At issue in the dispute was the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract negotiated by the then east and west German governments in August 1990. It stipulated that only 49 per cent of eastern Germany's 15 regional utilities could be owned by the municipalities with the remaining 51 per cent divided among RWE, Preussen-Elektra, Bayernwerk, and west Germany's five smaller utilities which would modernise the utilities. However, as a means of underwriting these investments, the Stromvertrag stipulated that the regional municipalities must buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag over the next 20 years. Veag is a monopoly structure: the Stromvertrag gave RWE, PreussenElektra, and Bayernwerk a 75 per cent stake in Veag, with the remaining 25 per cent divided among the five smaller west German utilities. Veag, which controls the region's high-voltage grid, is being privatised by the Treuhand to these companies. In spite of the large investment commitments, 'the principle weakness of the Stromvertrag is the way it stifles competition in eastern Germany's energy sector', an energy expert and adviser to the Treuhand said. Veba defends the Stromvertrag on the grounds that the two German governments negotiated the deal as a means of securing a future for brown coal, or lignite which fuels eastern Germany's utilities. However, the municipalities have argued that west German utilities have established a monopoly in the east's energy sector, stifling competition as a result. Eastern Germany's municipalities, which retain the right to generate or buy from elsewhere 30 per cent of their energy needs, have tried to fight back. Several cities, including Potsdam, have opted for gas to circumvent the monopoly structure and enter the lucrative energy sector. At the same time, outsiders can take a stake in the remaining 49 per cent stake of the regional utilities. But even they are locked into the Stromvertrag: the utilities must buy 70 of their energy from Veag. Yet common to all the players in eastern Germany's energy sector is the need for customers. Before German unification, natural gas accounted for less than 10 per cent of primary consumption in eastern Germany, while electricity, fuelled by brown coal, accounted for more than 87 per cent. Energy consumption has fallen 60 per cent since 1990, with brown coal/electricity bearing the brunt, following the collapse of the region's manufacturing base. The concerns facing western German utilities centre on whether there will be a sufficient growth in electricity sales in eastern Germany to justify their large investment programme, and whether gas is set to become a leading player which would undermine the careful architecture of the Stromvertrag. Veba is confident that PreussenElektra will reap the benefits of its recent acquisition. 'I don't see any danger for our investment. The Stromvertrag guarantees us energy sales,' the company said. It added that politicians would put pressure on east German cities to buy electricity instead of gas to protect miners' jobs. Veba's confidence has been further lifted by the prospect that even if energy consumption shows few signs of a pick-up in eastern Germany, PreussenElektra and the other west German utilities can resort to Union pour la Coordination de la Production du Transport d'Electricite, or UPCD. This means that energy generated in eastern Germany, unlike pre-unification days, can be sold to other European Union countries as part of the UPCD arrangement. The Veag management is connecting high voltage grid lines to the eastern and western German networks to secure sales across Germany and to EU countries. 'You can see why our investments and acquisitions in eastern Germany are an opportunity of a life-time,' added Veba. Indeed, as one energy expert said, without competition, how could they be anything else.</p>

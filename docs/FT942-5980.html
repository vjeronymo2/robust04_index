			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Indictment seen as a blow to 'politics the old-fashioned way': Every aspect of Congressman Rostenkowski's personality and career reflected the old ways Congressman Dan Rostenkowski has never made any secret of his belief that he is worth a great deal more than his congressional salary of Dollars 133,600. 'In being shy about declaring our worth in an honest way,' he said some years ago in a rare speech on the floor of the House of Representatives defending a pay rise for members of Congress, 'all we are doing is reinforcing the impression that that is all we are worth.' He has frequently taken steps to stretch his congressional salary: in 1990, before new rules on members of Congress accepting fees for speeches to private groups, Mr Rostenkowski set a record with Dollars 310,000 of honoraria. Other members have their own techniques for making a dollar go further. Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the deputy Republican leader and one of the House's most outspoken critics of ethical lapses, uses a private political action committee to finance his trips to lengthy seminars and brainstorming sessions in holiday resorts. Mr Rostenkowski could have retired in 1992 and pocketed more than Dollars 1m from his campaign funds perfectly legally under now-expired rules that left long-serving members of Congress subject to older, looser campaign finance restrictions. But a 17-count indictment filed in Washington DC on Tuesday by the US prosecutor charges that Mr Rostenkowski's efforts to stretch his salary went far outside the law. 'The allegations contained in today's indictment,' said Mr Eric Holder, the US district attorney, 'represent a betrayal of the public trust for personal gain. Mr Rostenkowski used his congressional office to perpetrate an extensive fraud on the American people.' Among other charges, Mr Rostenkowski is accused of drawing cash in exchange for stamp purchase vouchers at the House of Representatives post office, of padding his congressional payroll with people whose tasks were to mow the lawn at his holiday home in Wisconsin or take photographs at his daughter's wedding, and of buying expensive gifts for friends and political allies on his office stationery account. Mr Holder rejected suggestions that Mr Rostenkowski, who has sat in the House for 35 years, was simply doing business the old-fashioned way. 'This is not, as some have suggested, a petty matter . . . . This was not conduct that was ever acceptable,' he said. Yet every aspect of Mr Rostenkowski's personality and career represent politics the old-fashioned way, and that is the main reason why the sweeping indictment filed on Tuesday caused such distress among his fellows on Capitol Hill. Congressman Charles Rangel, a colleague on the Ways and Means committee which Mr Rostenkowski has chaired for the last 13 years, said yesterday that the indictment had 'hurt the committee and the Congress'. 'He is the best there is,' added Congressman Michael Andrews of Texas, another member of the Ways and Means committee, in which all US tax legislation must start. What made Mr Rostenkowski so good was his ability to gauge exactly how far each member could be pushed or pulled to put together a majority for legislation. Even political opponents, such as Mr Gingrich, acknowledge Mr Rostenkowski's skill at getting bills through the House. That skill existed before he took the Ways and Means chairmanship - then-Speaker Tip O'Neill relied on him in the 1970s to take the pulse of the House on important issues - but it has been reinforced by his ability as chairman to return favours and settle scores. Congressman Sam Gibbons, a courtly 74-year-old Floridian who took over the chairmanship yesterday after Mr Rostenkowski's indictment, has neither his predecessor's political sense nor his ruthlessness. But dire predictions that Mr Rostenkowski's fall would doom the Clinton administration's efforts to draw up healthcare reform legislation have, as is usual in Washington, been exaggerated. The heart of the healthcare battle is, in any case, the Senate, not the House, and particularly the Senate Finance committee, the House Ways and Means' counterpart. The tax lawyers who throng the lobbies outside the Ways and Means and Finance committee rooms always complain that everything will fall apart under a new chairman; yet business continues. Similar forebodings prevailed a year and a half ago when Senator Pat Moynihan took over the chairmanship of the Finance committee from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, who left Congress to become Treasury secretary. Although Mr Moynihan has not been exactly the chairman the White House might have hoped for, thwarting the administration on several issues, he has certainly not been an incompetent flop. The same is likely to be true of Mr Gibbons. The institution of the Ways and Means committee carries an authority that transcends each successive chairman. That is, perhaps, as Mr Rostenkowski, long one of the staunchest defenders of Congress as an institution, would like it.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Italian business chief resigns Mr Franco Nobili last night tendered his resignation as chairman of Iri, the state holding company, following his arrest on Wednesday for alleged corruption, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Mr Nobili, appointed to head Iri in 1990 by his close friend Mr Giulio Andreotti, the then prime minister, had initially refused to resign. The Ciampi government is understood to be keen to find a replacement to Mr Nobili to head Iri as soon as possible since the group faced key decisions on privatisation and on reducing L70,000bn (Pounds 31bn) worth of debt. Mr Nobili is alleged to have helped arrange a L600m payment to the Socialists arising from a contract with Enel, the state electricity authority.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary by journalist Jose Armas] </F>   [Text] Following NATO's ultimatum yesterday that the Serbs  of Bosnia-Herzegovina remove their artillery within 10 days from  around the capital, Sarajevo, or the West would undertake air  strikes against Serb positions, we do not think that is the path  that will lead that martyred republic to a real and effective  peace. To the best of this commentator's knowledge, ultimatums  have never brought any lasting solutions to ethnic conflicts.    If NATO leaders and the United States have decided to take a  major hand in the Bosnian conflict, they should, in a totally  disinterested manner, at least place their emphasis on a just,  negotiated solution, without favorites. We stress this point  because there are some very dark areas in NATO's decision.    It has been explained that what brought about the  organization's meeting in the first place was the explosion of a  shell in the middle of Sarajevo that killed 68 people and  injured another 200. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has  denied Serbian responsibility in the matter, and has called the  report [not further identified] a mise-en-scene. In his opinion,  the event was manipulated. In that connection, he has asked U.S.  President William Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to  use every means to uncover the truth. U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher himself admitted that his country has no  proof. No one has proven that the Serbs were responsible for the  attack on the Sarajevo marketplace.    So, where does the truth lie? What dark interests might be  at  play behind the Bosnian conflict? Is there a sincere desire on  the part of all parties for peace to prevail there? Many  questions remain unanswered.    For the time being, amid the tensions, the agreement between  Serbs and Muslims for an immediate ceasefire in Sarajevo, and  the holding of peace talks today in Geneva between the warring  factions, have been received with relief. We reiterate: It is  there that the emphasis should be placed, not on bombs.</p>

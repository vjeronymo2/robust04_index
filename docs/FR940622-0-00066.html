			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Section 1003.101: We are adding or revising in this section the definitions for the terms ``participating hospital'' (to comport with the statute), ``respondent'', and ``responsible physician''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1003.102: This section also has been revised by several rulemaking documents since the publication of our June 16, 1988, proposed rule. In this interim final rule, we are clarifying in paragraph (c)(2) that the term ``knowingly'' encompasses reckless disregard and deliberate ignorance of a material fact. We are also revising this section to comport with the OBRA 89 amendments that allow the Inspector General to impose civil monetary penalties when a physician signs a certification when he or she knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the risks of transfer, or when the physician misrepresents an individual's condition or other information. We are also revising proposed &sect;1003.102(d) to eliminate the reference to a ``knowing'' standard (that is, a physician knowingly failed to provide care). This results in a clearer approach that sets forth our basis for imposing civil monetary penalties for violations of section 1867 of the Act and is consistent with the statutory amendments and with other revisions to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1003.103: We are revising this section in accordance with section 1867(d) of the Act, as amended by section 4008 of OBRA 90, to clarify that the OIG may impose a penalty of not more than $50,000 against a participating hospital and a penalty of not more than $50,000 against each responsible physician (and not more than $25,000 against a participating hospital and each responsible physician for violations on or after August 1, 1986, but before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 22, 1987) for violations determined under &sect;1003.102(d). For penalties imposed on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 1, 1991, if the hospital has fewer than 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds, the maximum penalty will be $25,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1003.105: We are revising this section to comport with the OBRA 90 amendments to section 1867 of the Act by specifying in &sect;1003.105(a)(1) that a physician who grossly and flagrantly or repeatedly violates the statute or &sect;489.24 may be excluded from Medicare and any State health care program. We are also revising &sect;1003.105(b) to clarify that, for determinations under &sect;&sect;1003.102 (b)(2) and (b)(3), and for violations under &sect;1003.102(c)(1)(ii) occurring on or after December 22, 1987 and before July 1, 1990, a physician may not be excluded if the OIG determines he or she is a sole community physician or the sole source of specialized services in that community. We are moving references to limitations in time periods of exclusion to &sect;1003.107.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1003.105: Effective December 22, 1987, the statute was amended to allow the Secretary, pursuant to section 1842(j)(2) of the Act, to exclude a physician who knowingly violated section 1867 of the Act. In OBRA 89 Congress amended section 1867, allowing the Secretary, pursuant to section 1128A (instead of section 1842(j)(2)), to exclude a physician who knowingly and willfully or negligently violated the statute. The statute was then amended in OBRA 90, changing the standard for exclusion from ``knowing and willful or negligent'' to ``gross and flagrant or repeated'', effective May 1, 1991. We are implementing this provision in &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii)(C). In addition, in accordance with section 1842(j)(3) of the Act, the physician may not be excluded if the physician is the sole community physician or sole source of essential specialized services in a community. We are revising &sect;1003.105(b) to include these exceptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1003.106: As indicated in a response to one of the comments, in accordance with the requirements of section 1128A(d) of the Act, the final regulation includes two additional factors for consideration in determining the amount of the penalty and the length of the exclusion under part 1003: (1) ``The financial condition of the hospital and each responsible physician who have violated any requirement of section 1867 of the Act,'' and (2) ``The nature and circumstances of the violation.'' We are adding &sect;1003.106(a)(4) to reflect these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

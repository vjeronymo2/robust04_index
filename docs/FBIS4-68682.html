			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kaija Virta: "Karelia Leader Stepanov Continues </F> With New Title"]    [Text] With his new title, Karelia's president, the  communist Viktor Stepanov, from now on will be deriving his  power from direct election by the voters in acting as leader of  the Republic.    According to preliminary results in Monday's election, the  47-year old Stepanov garnered 68 percent of votes cast in the  race for chairman of the Karelian government. He was thge only  candidate whose powers correspond to those of other republics'  leaders. Until now, Stepanov's title has been speaker of the  Karelian Supreme Soviet, or parliament.  <H5>  Reformers Not Able To Put Up Candidate </H5>   Karelia's venerable Prime Minister Sergei Blinnikov likewise  politically a man of the old guard, was originally a candidate  running against Stepanov, but pulled out of the campaign a month  before the election. Pro-reform forces tried in vain to push a  young generation democrat, Petroskoi University Professor Sergei  Belozertseveya, to become a third candidate.    Stepanov's behind-the-scene forces, the Karelian Communist  League and the Veterans Association, in his election campaign  charged the breakup of the Soviet Union as a mistake, and  demanded those responsible for it--thus also President Boris  Yeltsin--be brought to justice.    Stepanov himself, however, apparently would prefer a  face-to-face meeting with Yeltsin, and to appear as the man  whose good relations with the central government will produce  tangible advantages for Karelia.    The Moscow paper NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in its latest monthly  rating of political figures ["political stock exchange"] placed  Stepanov 88th on the list of Russia's one-hundred most  influential politicians.  <H5>  New Name for the Parliament </H5>   Karelian voters on Sunday [17 April] elected a group of  local  government bodies, as well as a new 61-member, bicameral  parliament. Its name will no longer be the Supreme Soviet, but  the Lawmaking Assembly.    The election outcome will be more clear later. Definite  power  relationships of the type seen in West Europe are out of the  question, since many representatives have not revealed their  affiliations, and because identification with a party is in  practice far less binding than is in the case in the Finnish  parliament.    For Finns this was hardly a real election, since less than  35  percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in the city of  Kostamus and in the Petroskoi election district. For the entire  Republic the figure was 42 percent. In elections held last  December and in voting on the constitution 54 percdnt of  Karelians still bothered to vote.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Travellers snap up holiday bargains TOUR OPERATOR Thomson and Lunn Poly, the travel agency chain it owns, reported a strong response to discounts and price cuts for the 1994 season which were announced last week, Andrew Adonis writes. Thomson claimed to have sold nearly 250,000 summer 1994 holidays, costing Pounds 80m, within two days of the launch of its brochure. Lunn Poly said that on Friday and Saturday it sold more than 80,000 holidays and gave more than Pounds 3m in discounts, its highest volume for a summer launch. The summer holiday price war started last week when Thomas Cook announced discounts of 10 per cent for early bookers. Its move was followed by Pickfords Travel and Lunn Poly announcing similar discounts. Airtours and Cosmos said that they were offering free holidays for children and teenagers.</p>

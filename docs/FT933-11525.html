			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Agents expect more gazumping ESTATE agents yesterday said that this week's Court of Appeal ruling against a seller who gazumped a buyer was welcome but in practice would have little impact on the property market. The ruling followed the case of Mr Tim Pitt, a broker who successfully sued a company that made a written agreement to sell him a Suffolk cottage for Pounds 200,000 but later sold to a bidder who offered Pounds 10,000 more. Mr Pitt refused to match the higher bid and took the company to court for breach of contract. Lawyers decided that the faxed agreement amounted to a binding contract. This sets a precedent - previously nothing has been regarded as binding until the final exchange of contracts, which can come several months after an offer is made. 'The curtain has not come down on gazumping,' said Mr Tony Clark, general secretary of the British Association of Estate Agents. 'It takes our campaign against gazumping a little stage further,' he said. But he pointed out that in practice sellers would be extremely wary of such 'lock-out' agreements. He added: 'Solicitors will advise the average purchaser to try to obtain a lock-out agreement but vendors will be advised at the same time not to enter into them.' Purchasers in a chain would also find it difficult to meet the likely conditions of a lock-out clause, the association warned.</p>

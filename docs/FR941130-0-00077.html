This action will result in Celsat's pioneer's preference request, PP&hyph;28, being considered in RM&hyph;7927, the proceeding in which Celsat's companion petition for rule making is under consideration, rather than in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;28, the above 1 GHz low-Earth orbit satellite service proceeding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> November 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Rodney Small, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8116. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This is a summary of the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order, adopted October 24, 1994, and released November 3, 1994. The full text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and copying during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street, NW, Washington, DC.

In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) in this proceeding, 58 FR 57578 (October 26, 1993), the Commission sought comment on whether and how the pioneer's preference rules could be amended to take into account competitive bidding and its experience administering them, or whether they should be repealed. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First R&amp;O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 59 FR 8413 (February 22, 1994), the Commission determined that it would not apply amendments to its rules to the three proceedings in which Tentative Decisions had been issued. Celsat requested reconsideration or clarification of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First R&amp;O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  insofar as that decision affects the inclusion or exclusion of Celsat's pioneer's preference request, PP&hyph;28, in Docket 92&hyph;28, which is one of the three proceedings in which a Tentative Decision had been issued and therefore, under the decision in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First R&amp;O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , would be considered under the existing pioneer's preference rules. Celsat argues that its pioneer's preference request is pending in Docket 92&hyph;28. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First R&amp;O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  did not address whether Celsat's pioneer's preference request is being considered in Docket 92&hyph;28 and had no effect on the status of Celsat's request. However, because Celsat argues that it is uncertain as to the status of the request, the Commission clarifies that the request has been, and remains, pending in RM&hyph;7927. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Celsat states that the Commission issued a Public Notice on March 11, 1992 ``in an apparent response to Celsat's [pioneer's preference] filing [that] established April 10, 1992 as the final day for filing any additional pioneer's preference requests'' in Docket 92&hyph;28. Celsat also argues that the Commission's Office of Engineering and Technology issued an Order consolidating Celsat's pioneer's preference request with five other pioneer's preference requests in Docket 92&hyph;28, and that the Commission made an initial ruling on Celsat's companion petition for rule making in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Tentative Decision (NPRM) in that docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Commission finds that Celsat's petition for rule making addressed a number of frequency bands, several of which were already the subject of an ongoing proceeding. Those portions of Celsat's petition that addressed two bands being considered for low-Earth orbit satellite operations, 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz, were considered in the proceeding initiated to address those bands, Docket 92&hyph;28. Because Celsat's petition as it related to those bands proposed a terrestrial component that was inconsistent with the international allocation of those bands, the portion of Celsat's petition that addressed those bands was dismissed. Had Celsat's petition addressed only those bands, its request for pioneer's preference also would have been dismissed, inasmuch as a pioneer's preference request is tied to adoption of rules consistent with the request. However, since the portion of Celsat's petition addressing other bands remains pending in RM&hyph;7927, its companion pioneer's preference request also remains pending in that proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Celsat's arguments that its pioneer's preference request was associated with Docket 92&hyph;28, either in addition to or instead of RM&hyph;7927, are demonstrably incorrect. Celsat's request was placed on public notice on March 9, 1992. The public notice clearly stated on it face that the pioneer's preference request was filed in conjunction with Celsat's petition for rulemaking, RM&hyph;7927. Pioneer's preference requests pertaining to Docket 92&hyph;28 were separately placed on public notice and clearly marked with that docket number on the same day. There was no mention of Docket 92&hyph;28 in the Public Notice addressing Celsat's request, and no mention of RM&hyph;7927 in the Public Notice addressing Docket 92&hyph;28. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Additionally, an Order extending comment time periods cited by Celsat as consolidating the two proceedings clearly did not do so. While the Order denied an extension of time request that was filed with respect to the two separate proceedings, the request did not ask us to consolidate the two proceedings. Both the caption and text of the Order, as released March 27, 1992, made clear that RM&hyph;7927 and Docket 92&hyph;28 are separate and distinct. The Order twice refers to the ``proceedings,'' and paragraph 4 exclusively discusses Docket 92&hyph;28 while paragraph 5 separately discusses RM&hyph;7927. Not only would consolidation have been beyond the bounds of a routine ruling on an extension of time request that made no reference to consolidation, but the Order itself left no doubt that it did not address consolidation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Finally, the NPRM and Report and Order in Docket 92&hyph;28 dismissed Celsat's petition for rulemaking only with respect to the 1610&hyph;1626.5 and 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands. The Commission explicitly stated therein that the surviving portion of Celsat's petition remained pending. Furthermore, Celsat's pioneer's preference request was addressed in the Tentative Decision in Docket 92&hyph;28, and Celsat did not file comments nor request clarification of the status of its request despite its request not being addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. For the above reasons, we conclude that Celsat's pioneer's preference request remains pending before the Commission in RM&hyph;7927. Whether any changes to the pioneer's preference rules that may be adopted in the instant proceeding will apply to pending requests, such as Celsat's PP&hyph;28, is yet to be determined. Accordingly, it is ordered, That the petition for reconsideration filed by Celsat, Inc., is denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR Part 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Frequency allocations and radio treaty matters, Radio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR Part 5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Experimental radio services (other than broadcasting), Radio. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Communications Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> LaVera F.

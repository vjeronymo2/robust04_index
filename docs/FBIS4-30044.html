			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ko Tae-song] </F>   [Text] The ROK Government took the initiative to propose a  preliminary contact for the early realization of the North-South  summit talks. Diplomatic measures supporting the government's  initiative in North Korean affairs are becoming concrete. As  soon as the telephone message proposing the preliminary contact  was sent to North Korea on 20 June, the Foreign Ministry  immediately gave formal notice of the fact to its allies,  including the United States and Japan, permanent members of the  UN Security Council, including China and Russia, and  international organizations including the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA]. The government made it clear to the  international community that it is moving toward dialogue while  keeping the stick of sanctions in hand.    The government is pursuing the North-South summit talks  while  rechecking the alliance between the ROK and the United States  under the assessment that the dialogue phase might be the last  chance to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.  This reflects the government's position that the United States  and the international community's demands, including special  inspections, are necessary elements for achieving the  fundamental goal of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    The government is reportedly evaluating the variables of the  situation presented by the North-South summit talks and the  third round of North Korea-U.S. talks while straightening up the  confusion related to Former U.S. President Carter's visit to the  North and rechecking the alliance to cope with the new  situation. Based on various scenarios, the two governments are  reportedly adjusting their positions regarding the verification  of agenda in case the North-South summit talks are realized, the  plan for achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  and the principles of the North Korea-U.S. talks.    The government also welcomed Japan's reaffirmation of the  three-party alliance between the ROK, the United States, and  Japan at a time when the North-South summit talks are being  pursued, and reportedly asked for Japan's diplomatic support to  realize the summit talks. The government is checking Japan's  intention through diplomatic channels regarding Japanese Foreign  Minister Kakizawa Koji's remarks at the House of Councillors'  Foreign Affairs Committee on 20 June that the elimination of  nuclear suspicions will not be a precondition to the resumption  of negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations with North  Korea. As negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations  between North Korea and Japan could actually be resumed around  the time of the North-South summit talks, the government is also  finalizing its position regarding this possibility.    As the general situation is inclined toward the possibile  resumption of dialogue with North Korea, the Foreign Ministry  has readjusted the principle of three-channel dialogue --  dialogue between the North and the South, North Korea and the  United States, and North Korea and the IAEA -- and established a  policy to utilize the three channels to complement each other.  The government's position in the case of dialogue between North  Korea and the IAEA, is that, with North Korea's withdrawal from  the IAEA, it is better to induce practical dialogue rather than  to agitate North Korea by demanding its return to the IAEA.  According to a relevant government official's explanation, the  government's readjustment of the basic frame of channels of  communication is designed to efficiently respond to Russia's  intention to exercise influence on the North Korean nuclear  issue with its proposal of an eight-party conference, while  taking advantage of the development in the North-South summit  talks.    With the resumption of the North Korea-U.S. talks, the  government decided not to oppose the third round of high-level  North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea's sincerity is verified  and to keep watching the result of working-level contacts  between North Korea and the United States in New York. The  government is positively appraising the remarks by U.S.  President Clinton on 21 June that North Korea's proposal made  through Former President Carter is a hopeful sign and that  verifications will be made through contacts between North Korea  and the United States. The government expects that the ROK and  the United States may disagree on assuring the transparency of  not only the present and future but also past nuclear activities  of North Korea. The government reportedly conveyed a strong  message regarding its position to the United States.</p>

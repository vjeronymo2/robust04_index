			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Sport: Hard workers in an industrial game - Rugby League; Britain and Australia meet today in the World Cup final. Kevin Brown, in Sydney, and John Hopkins assess the two sides HAVE ANY industries been more closely associated with one sport than cotton, and wool and coal mining with rugby league? As Geoffrey Moorhouse noted in At The George, his book of essays about rugby league: 'The industrial heartland of the north of England was powered by men who worked in the mills, foundries and pits of the region . . . in time the majority of rugby clubs in the north drew their playing strength from . . . these places.' There is therefore, a particular piquancy that at the moment that Britain's rugby league team has achieved its greatest success by reaching the final of the World Cup at Wembley this afternoon, 30 pits are being threatened with closure and British Coal is ending its sponsorship of Great Britain's rugby league team. Eighty thousand spectators will be at Wembley to watch Britain play Australia, the world champions. Great Britain have improved so much recently that the Australian coach said the current side would beat its predecessors of four and six years ago by 30 points. Nevertheless, the Australians are the favourites. They have held the Ashes since 1970 and won the World Cup in 1975, 1977, 1985 and 1988. 'They are the champions. They have beaten us in the past two Test series,' says Jonathan Devereux, the burly Widnes back who was in Great Britain's World Cup squad. 'Their record stands for itself and in Allen Langer they have the outstanding player. If he was in our side then we would be favourites. He has got everything. He has speed. He can read a game very well. He has electrifying pace over ten yards, which is what he needs to get through a gap. He can wrestle the ball clear of his opponents in a way that is almost uncanny for a small man. He is a good kicker and he is very tenacious.' If Langer, a scrum-half, is a potential match winner for Australia, then Martin Offiah is quite capable of doing the same for Great Britain. Offiah, whose nickname is Chariots, is the fastest man on the field so long as the injury he appeared to be carrying last Sunday when he played in the Lancashire Cup Final has healed. Much will depend on him as it will, too, on Gary Schofield, Great Britain's captain, playing in the centre, and on the 35-year-old warhorse, Kevin Ward, in the front row. If Great Britain win, and it is an even money bet that they will, then they will have demonstrated how much they have learnt from the Australians in the past ten years. A decade ago British rugby league hit rock bottom. It was time for change and officials were dispatched from Britain to sit at the feet of men who had once been their pupils. They discovered that Australian rugby league was applying science to the art of football, setting scientifically determined standards for everything from diet to fitness. Whereas in Britain many training sessions included unopposed rugby, the Australians favoured fierce physical contact in practice. This was one radical change. Another that the British noted was the way the Australians work with weights to develop their upper bodies. The British, up to then, had concentrated on building up the torso and legs. The result was a generation of massive, fast-running men like Mal Meninga, the Australians' captain who is 6 ft 1 in and weighs 17 st 2lbs. This afternoon he will face Gary Schofield who is 5 ft 8 in and 12 st 7 lbs. Schofield is wiser and heavier than he was when he met Meninga in 1984 and was thrown around like a rag doll, but he is still giving away five inches and 65 lbs. The Australians did not stop there. They trained hard so that they could play the game at a fast pace. Having done all this, they set about shoring up their defence so that it was well-nigh unbreachable. 'They put so much pressure on you when they have not got the ball that you start to make mistakes' says Davies, a member of Britain's 1990 Test team. As the years went by, the Australians refined all these skills, making themselves more formidable still. One try in the second Test against Great Britain in 1990 bore out everything they had been trained to do. The ball was in play for 36 seconds and there were 16 passes before the try-scorer touched down. No other team could live with such an athletic, skilful approach. The advances shown by the Australian rugby league teams were soon noticed by that country's rugby union authorities as well. That code now produces big men of great athleticism, trained to a higher level of fitness than ever before. When these mastodons are teamed with key individuals in the key positions such as scrum-half, stand-off and full back, then the entire team whirrs as smoothly as a Swiss watch. The result is that the Wallabies won the rugby union World Cup last year and there is no sign of their dominance being ended. As the Australians were pushing back the frontiers of the game, so in Britain it was being professionally administered and marketed. In the days of Eddie Waring commentating on BBC television on a Saturday afternoon, rugby league was, frankly, a joke. To my eyes, used to the rhythm of rugby union, rugby league was nothing more than a series of crash, bang, wallop attacks. Six tackles and then something had to happen. The game seemed one-paced, physically unambitious, tactically sterile. 'Oooooop and oooonder' and 'he's taking an early bath' were Waring's catch phrases. Now it has become a game of considerable pace and skill - as you should see this afternoon. It is as different from the rugby league of 20 years ago as colour is from black and white television and jets are from propeller-driven aeroplanes. 'Rugby League has remained unusually true to itself' noted Moorhouse, 'an expression of values as well as a challenge and an entertainment now embedded deeply in the lives of generations on both sides of the world . . . But a game can be much more complex than patterns of athletic energy on a playing field. It can reflect and embody various habits and attitudes that amount to nothing less than a way of life and this game does.' Like rugby union, rugby league is a game in its prime.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MINUS COLUMN  </P> <P> What did I ever do to Tony Perry?  </P> <P> Each week I have come to expect a new "hit" in his "San Diego at Large" column.  </P> <P> City Hall regulars assured me that Tony's critiques were simply a result of my  disagreements with Mayor O'Connor.  </P> <P> Although I have mended fences with Mayor O'Connor, my problems with Tony Perry  remain!  </P> <P> For example, Tony's May 7 column described the big "flip-flop" on the minds of  all San Diegans: After criticizing the neon El Cajon Boulevard sign during his  campaign, Hartley puts a photo of the sign up at his office!  </P> <P> If he would contact me on these matters, I would be glad to set him straight.  </P> <P> I criticized the sign because it was not designed or placed in accordance with  community wishes. I also questioned whether the sign represented the most  pressing needs of a community ridden with street violence and gang activity.  </P> <P> I feel the same way today.  </P> <P> The photo of the sign was ordered by my predecessor, prior to my swearing-in.  The photo was not placed in my office; it is in the hallway outside my office!  I did not choose the photo to decorate the hall with; the deputy mayor handles  the hall-decorating responsibilities.  </P> <P> Unlike council members, Tony Perry apparently enjoys the ability to work  without accountability to anyone for the quality of the product.  </P> <P> I offer Tony Perry the same deal I made with the mayor. Let's disagree  agreeably. I'll do my job and expect you to do yours. When I make a mistake --  nail me. But let's keep it above the belt!  </P> <P> JOHN HARTLEY  </P> <P> San Diego City Councilman  </P> <P> Editor's note: Perry did contact Hartley's office before the item appeared, but  his telephone call was not returned.  </P></p>

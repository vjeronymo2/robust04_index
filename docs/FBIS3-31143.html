Speaking about the Albanian foreign policy, Mr. Arbnori said  "Albania is committed to have good relations with its  neighbouring countries like Italy, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria,  Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, and Macedonia. But we do not have  good relations with Serbia because it is pursuing a genocidal,  dictatorial and chauvinistic policy.    Concerning the Kosova question, Mr. Arbnori said that  Albania  is not for changing the borders by force, but we always will  defend the rights of the Albanians who live there according to  all the international charters.    "The changes brought about by the reform and the new  improved  law on foreign investments are a guarantee for all the foreign  investors," speaker Arbnori pointed out.    President Tabone hailed the Albanian parliament for the work  it has done in reforming the laws and establishing the  democratic institutions which will advance Albania toward  Europe. Considering the parliament as a living reflection of  the democracy, Mr. Tabone expressed his pleasure for an  interparliamentary cooperation between Albania and Malta.    The Maltese President Tabone said the Albanian approach  toward Kosova question is very wise and that her right request  can be solved in the context of the European Union.</p>

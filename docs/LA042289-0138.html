			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL;  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TUSTIN BREAKS ESTANCIA GRIP IN A BIG WAY  </P> <P> Tustin High School has had more than a few problems against Estancia pitchers  this season.  </P> <P> The Tillers hadn't scored a run against the Eagles in 12 innings. They were  shut out Wednesday by Estancia, putting the two teams in a tie for first place  in the Sea View League.  </P> <P> Things have been so bad that Tustin Coach Vince Brown taped a photo of Estancia  starting pitcher Greg Brannis in the Tiller dugout before Friday's game.  </P> <P> Well, it took a while, but it worked.  </P> <P> The Tillers vented their frustration Friday with a 13-run sixth-inning for a  14-5 rout-from-behind victory at Tustin.  </P> <P> The victory moved the Tillers into first place, one game ahead of Estancia.  </P> <P> "With the problems we've had scoring runs against them this year, Estancia must  have felt pretty good about having a four-run lead in the sixth," Brown said.  "But once we broke through, it became a tidal wave."  </P> <P> After Ted Wieczorek led off the sixth with homer to cut the deficit to 5-2, the  Tillers loaded the bases with no outs.  </P> <P> Brown then reached deep into his dugout to find someone to create the  breakthrough. Pete Gerlach was sent up to pinch-hit for shortstop Erik  Lagafuaina.  </P> <P> Gerlach, a reserve outfielder, was hitless in five previous at-bats this  season.  </P> <P> But on Friday he lashed a two-strike pitch down the right-field line, scoring  three runs to tie the score, 5-5.  </P> <P> "It was just a hunch," Brown said. "Yesterday we had worked on a few things and  corrected a flaw in his swing."  </P> <P> After Gerlach's triple, Clayton Nelson replaced Brannis and gave up a single to  Shawn Green, which gave the Tillers (12-7 overall, 7-2 in league play) a 6-5  lead.  </P> <P> From then on, it became batting practice.  </P> <P> Everyone in the Tustin lineup, with exception of Dave Sagan, got a hit.  Everyone scored a run, some two.  </P> <P> "Once Gerlach tied the score, everyone relaxed and began hitting like they are  capable," Brown said.  </P> <P> The benefactor of the offensive awakening was pitcher Dan Baker, who went the  distance for the victory.  </P> <P> Baker (4-2) had struck out 14 in a one-hitter a week ago, but on Friday he was  wild through the first three innings. He walked four batters, hit another, and  committed a balk.  </P> <P> He also served up a three-run homer to Mark Hartley in the second, which gave  Estancia (13-6, 6-3) a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> Baker, who finished with 13 strikeouts, gathered momentum after working out of  a base-loaded jam in the third. But, by then, it looked too late.  </P> <P> "After the third inning I told the guys in dugout they had to come through for  me," Baker said. "I told them I needed their help."  </P> <P> In the sixth, the Tillers honored that request.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 12, Newport Harbor 5 -- Second baseman Greg Haack was three for  three and knocked in four runs to lead Corona del Mar (6-12, 3-6). First  baseman Todd Kehrli hit a three-run homer in a nine-run first inning for Corona  del Mar. Left-hander Matt Goldstein picked up his second league victory.  Newport Harbor dropped to 1-8 in league play.  </P> <P> University 4, Saddleback 0 -- Senior left-hander Kevin Squires (4-2) pitched a  one-hitter with five strikeouts for host University (8-10-1, 5-4). First  baseman Al Marlinga went two for three with two RBIs for University. Saddleback  is 5-4 in league play.  </P></p>

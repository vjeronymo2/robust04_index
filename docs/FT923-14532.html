			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine firm against devaluation BRITAIN's 'relatively uncompetitive inflation figures' compared with the US and Japan were cited by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in the Commons last night when he re-affirmed the government's determination not to devalue the pound. Responding to Labour accusations that he had failed to make any impact on the recession since taking charge of his department, he maintained that a realignment of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism would encourage domestic inflation. Mr Heseltine stressed that Britain's inflation rate was still above that of her principal competitors - the US at 3 per cent, and Japan at 2.5 per cent. He said Labour MPs who called for a cut in interest rates and favoured letting the pound 'take the strain' were indulging in escapism. That did not deter Mr John Biffen, a Tory who has held cabinet posts as a trade and Treasury minister, from advocating a cut in interest rates and the return of exchange rate policy to national governments. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, insisted that Mr John Major, the prime minister, should be using Britain's presidency of the European Community to secure 'interest rate cuts across Europe'. Mr Heseltine argued that more importance should be attached to the level of wage settlements, and emphasised that last year manufacturing earnings grew by about 8 per cent in Britain compared with 6 per cent in Germany, 4 per cent in Japan and 3 per cent in the US. He warned: 'There are no policies of any domestic government which can prevent the conversion of those figures into lost jobs, lost competitiveness and higher unemployment'. Dismissing suggestions that there was no sign of economic recovery, Mr Heseltine pointed to the rise in car registrations and the improved showing of commercial vehicles as examples of where it was 'beginning to emerge'. He drew encouragement, too, from the growth in exports, stressing that for the first time since the Second World War Britain's share of world trade had stabilised and 'even a little improved'. Mr Brown contrasted the forecasts of economic recovery made by the prime minister during the general election campaign with the fact that in the succeeding three months business failures had risen by 15,000. Unemployment had continued its rise for 24 consecutive months, and in south-east England had increased by more than 150 per cent in the space of two years. A Labour motion pressing for policies aimed at reducing unemployment, promoting investment, tackling Britain's training and skills crisis and boosting the regions was defeated by 301-262, a majority of 39.</p>

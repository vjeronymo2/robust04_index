			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Observer: Sino-Irish declarations? Was it wise for Britain and Ireland to call yesterday's statement a joint declaration? Given that Britain's last joint declaration - its 1984 agreement with China over Hong Kong - is now threatened, another form of words might have been preferable. Just like the Anglo-Irish accord, Hong Kong's was an attempt at squaring a few circles. Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher said in 1984 that the joint declaration  -guaranteeing Hong Kong 'a high degree of autonomy' under Chinese sovereignty from 1997 - had 'brought our countries closer together. It has increased our mutual understanding, respect and trust.' You wouldn't have thought so yesterday, when China crossly rebuffed Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten. It described Patten's proposed electoral reforms as having 'demolished the foundation of Sino-British co-operation' - code for the joint declaration. Another triumph bites the dust; no doubt Ian Paisley will have been watching closely.</p>

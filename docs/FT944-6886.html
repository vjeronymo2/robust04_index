			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Boost for economic forecasts launched The Economic and Social Research Council, a government agency, has launched a Pounds 1.4m research programme that might help chancellors make better predictions about the electoral and economic impact of Budget proposals, Peter Norman writes. The programme will focus on peoples' economic values, beliefs and behaviour. It is based on the council's contention that 'there is a lot more to what people do than simply the money in their pocket'. The 'economic beliefs and behaviour programme' will involve 52 researchers at 17 universities. They will work on 13 projects covering areas such as taxation, pension and benefit provision, as well as investment and entrepreneurship. The programme will try to assess how far cultural beliefs and moral values as well as shifting ideas about consumerism or entrepreneurship interact with conventional incentives based on money. The programme's authors believe such an approach could have warned the government of the outcry that followed last year's Budget announcement of value added tax on domestic fuel.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Anger at funeral of Mafia's victims THE PEOPLE of Palermo yesterday vented their anger and frustration over the state's inability to curb the ever more brazen power of the Mafia. Crowds jostled, jeered and insulted Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian president, Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, and police chiefs as they attended the funeral of five bodyguards assassinated on Sunday in Palermo alongside Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate. The crowd's frustration was also reflected in a potentially more awkward move for the government. Seven of the 16 junior judges in Palermo working on Mafia-related cases announced they were resigning. At the same time, Mr Aldo Rizzo, mayor of Palermo, handed his resignation. It was the second time in two months that government members have been abused by hostile crowds at funerals of magistrates and policemen murdered by the Mafia. The last occasion was the funeral of Mr Giovanni Falcone, whose three-car armoured convoy was destroyed by a powerful bomb on May 23 outside Palermo. Yesterday the mood was uglier and more frustrated over the authorities' failure to prevent the car bomb attack on the bodyguards and Mr Borsellino - a man known to have become the prime target for the Mafia. Some 10,000 people gathered outside Palermo cathedral. A heavy police cordon finally broke and people rushed inside at the end of the service. The president and government members had to leave by a side entrance, their escort scarcely able to hold back the jostling crowd. The government's hostile reception occurred despite rapid action in despatching nearly 3,000 extra police and troops to the island. The government also promised to toughen existing anti-Mafia laws going through parliament, and set in motion a large-scale plan of transferring imprisoned Mafia bosses to high security jails on the mainland and on an isolated island off Elba.</p>

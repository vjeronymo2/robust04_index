There are an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 carriers of the  AIDS virus. Our correspondent has the following report:    [Unidentified Correspondent] Twenty-five new AIDS cases were  discovered in Greece during the last three months, raising the  total number of cases since 1984 to 916. At the same time, the  carriers of the AIDS virus are estimated to number from 13,000  to 15,000. Of the 916 cases, 801 are men, 55 women, and 20  children. Already 354 of those infected with the virus have  died.    Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos, who held a news  conference in the framework of an AIDS seminar organized by the  Center for the Control of Special Infections at PARTET [not  further identified] Institute, stressed that Greece still has  the fewest cases in Europe. However, this does not justify  relaxation, since the disease is progressing in other countries  and preventive measures should be intensified. [passage omitted]</p>

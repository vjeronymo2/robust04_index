			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / First class travellers may avoid queues at Heathrow FIRST CLASS and business class passengers flying into London's Heathrow airport could have their own express queues for immigration controls, under a plan put forward by airlines. They have told the Home Office they would be prepared to pay for extra immigration staff to speed up formalities for first and business class passengers. The Home Office said yesterday it was examining the proposal, which is aimed at reducing immigration queues for non-European Community nationals. The queues are particularly long in the early morning when flights arrive from North America and the Far East. The suggestion has received the backing of the British Tourist Authority. Previous attempts by airlines to reduce Heathrow immigration queues have foundered because the Home Office has said it does not have enough money for additional staff. British Airways, one of the airlines behind the move, said the offer was an attempt to overcome this difficulty. Although the airlines would bear the cost of the extra officers, they would remain under Home Office control. BA said that the proposal was the first step in an attempt to shorten waiting times for passengers. The Home Office said that because airline funding would result in an increase in staffing it did not expect any union opposition to the proposal. The Home Office said the plan had been supported by several airlines using Heathrow, but not all. United Airlines, the US carrier, said it was in favour of speeding up Heathrow immigration formalities but did not see why it should have to bear the cost. The Home Office said it was also looking at allowing visitors to clear UK immigration before boarding. This would involve stationing British immigration officers at airports in New York or Tokyo. The British Tourist Authority has also suggested having a separate queue at UK airports for non-EC nationals who are resident in Britain. BAA, the company which owns Heathrow, said a survey conducted at Terminal 3 last summer revealed significantly longer waiting times for non-EC nationals arriving on early morning flights.

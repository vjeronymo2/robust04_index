			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Hong (1776 3126) ] </F>   [Text] Wu Yi, minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], wants the China Resources  (Holdings) Company Limited to try its best to expand, link the  development of the company with the prosperity and stability of  Hong Kong, and make active contributions.    The female minister ended her 12-day visit to the United  States and arrived in Hong Kong on the 21st of this month after  attending a meeting of the Eighth Joint Sino-U.S. Committee on  Commerce and Trade as head of delegation. On the 23d, she spoke  at the second session of the China Resources (Holdings) Company  10th board of directors and 11th shareholders' meeting.    She fully affirmed the achievement of the company, stressing  that "if China Resources seizes opportunities before 1997 and  works actively for a breakthrough, it should become a big  multinational corporation."    She wants China Resources to participate actively in the  Hong  Kong's economy, fully exploit its role as a financial center and  a free port, and expand its business in conformity with  international conventions and Hong Kong law and according to  Hong Kong's economic situation.    As MOFTEC's biggest company, the China Resources company  grossed $6.77 billion in total turnover, up 5.7 percent from  last year, and initially achieved the change from being  primarily a marketing agent to an independent business concern.  Independent trade last year rose to account for 66.4 percent of  its overall trade volume. New steps were also taken in  industrialization and diversification.    Wu Yi visited China Arts and Crafts, the China Resources  Department Store, the new Cheung Sha Wan Pier, new oil tanks  under construction, and some enterprises under the China  Resources Company. It is known that China Resources industrial  and diversification programs extend to banks, listed companies,  transport companies, shipping lines, oil storage, bonded  warehouses, property and real estate, retailing, and industrial  concerns.</p>

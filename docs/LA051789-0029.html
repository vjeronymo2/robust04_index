			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UNSEEDED ITALIAN STUNS MECIR; WILANDER STRUGGLES BUT WINS  </P> <P> Italy's Omar Camporese, a wild-card entry ranked 120th in the world, eliminated  fourth-seeded Miloslav Mecir, 6-2, 7-5, Tuesday night in the first round of the  Italian Open at Rome.  </P> <P> But another major upset was averted earlier in the day when top-seeded Mats  Wilander came to life after a listless first set and outlasted Javier Frana of  Argentina, 6-7 (8-6), 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Mecir, who returned to action two weeks ago after injuring his back in March,  had three set points at 5-4 in the second set before Camporese fired three  serves that the Czech couldn't handle.  </P> <P> Camporese then got a service break to go ahead, 6-5, when Mecir double-faulted  once and committed three unforced backhand errors.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old Italian, a doubles specialist who had beaten Mecir once before  in Milan, served out the match in the next game. On the second match point,  Mecir slapped a backhand into the net after an rally of more than 30 shots.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, second-seeded Andre Agassi survived a brief second-set lapse to beat  fellow American Todd Witsken, 6-1, 6-4; and fourth-seeded Jimmy Connors,  playing in Rome for the first time in 14 years, defeated French qualifier  Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 6-2.  </P> <P> Other seeds advancing were No. 6 Emilio Sanchez of Spain, a 6-1, 6-2 winner  over Eduardo Bengoechea of Argentina; No. 11 Alberto Mancini of Argentina, who  defeated Francisco Clavet of Spain 6-3, 6-2, and No. 13 Jaime Yzaga of Peru,  who beat Marian Vajda of Czechoslovakia, 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> Two other seeded players were eliminated. No. 9 Ronald Agenor of Haiti, who  reached the semifinals here last year, was upset by Bruno Oresar of Yugoslavia,  7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-2. No. 12 Andres Gomez of Ecuador, winner of the Italian Open  in 1982 and 1984, was ousted by Spain's Sergio Bruguera, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Steffi Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, overcame early deficits in  both sets and went on to defeat Tine Scheuer-Larsen of Denmark, 7-5, 6-4, in  the first round of a $300,000 women's tournament at Berlin.  </P> <P> The West German took 2 hours 8 minutes to dispose of her opponent, ranked 94th  internationally, after falling behind 1-2 at the start of both sets.  </P> <P> Nathalie Tauziat of France, ranked 12th, also won but with difficulty, 4-6,  7-5, 7-6 (7-3), against Sabrina Goles of Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Noelle Porter of Pepperdine, an unseeded freshman, and Stanford's Lisa Green  advanced to the semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's  individual tournament at Gainesville, Fla.  </P> <P> Porter held off Danielle Jones of Oklahoma State, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, and then  defeated Shannan McCarthy of Georgia, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1.  </P> <P> Green pulled off two upsets, defeating No. 5 Stacey Martin of Tennessee, 6-4,  6-0, and then No. 2 Jessica Emmons of UCLA, 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-2.  </P> <P> "When I was down 5-1 (in the first set against Emmons), I was just trying to  win one game to maybe make her think about it some more," Green said. "After  that, I just started playing better. I stoped rushing so much. It was a good  match to win."  </P> <P> Green will next play her Stanford teammate, Sandra Birch, who is seeded third.  Porter will meet No. 4 Jennifer Santrock of Southern Methodist.  </P> <P> Birch advanced by defeating Nicole Arendt of Florida 6-2, 7-6 (9-7), and then  Ginger Helgeson of Pepperdine, 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Birch later teamed with  Debbie Graham to upset the top-seeded doubles team, Mamie Ceniza and Stella  Sampras of UCLA, 6-4, 6-1, in a second-round match.  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / On the world's coldest mountain: Rebecca Stephens endured sleepless nights and numbing storms trapped in a snowhole 14,000 ft up in Alaska MOUNT McKinley, Alaska: at 20,320 ft, the highest mountain in the North American continent, and cold. By all accounts it is the coldest mountain of any range. And one of the most crowded. Big mountains - the biggest - attract climbers in their hordes, and on McKinley in May there were scores, hundreds, who had flown in from gateways across the world. Of these, a good half would fly home having stood on the top. Or so said the book. 'Don't be fooled, though,' said a friend. 'McKinley isn't a mountain to be underestimated.' These cautionary words from a veteran mountaineer rang in my ears, in a snowhole. We were stuck - unable to climb higher, unwilling to climb down - at some 14,000ft, forced by high winds to abandon our tents and burrow deep, like high-altitude moles, underground. Four days, maybe five we'd been there  -I forget. One nameless, numberless day merged into another in an unstructured sort of timelessness, in this northern land where darkness fell only a couple of hours in 24. But we were comfortable, if a little cramped, three of us lying prostrate one side of a snowy shelf on which we cooked, two on the other. The ceiling by now had sagged under its own weight and that of the falling snow so that sitting upright was made impossible. But we were warm, relatively so: the temperature hovered around - 10'C. We ate and chatted, brewed drinks and read and slept. Only sleeping was a worry. At night, snow drifted, blocking the cave entrance. No matter what we did, it drifted. We dug, built protective walls, troughs and tunnels. Come morning, the entrance was always blocked. We had a chimney, but this snowed over too, in spite of a protruding ski pole. What happens if one runs short of air? Does one wake? Or fall peacefully into a coma? I wanted to know. Occasionally, we had to venture outside, for sanity's sake, or to use the communal, extremely exposed, loo dug in the middle of this wilderness by conscientious rangers in an attempt, successfully in the main, to keep the mountain clean. We were not alone at 14,000ft. There were 60 or so, in a large, snowy basin - Americans, Koreans, French, German, Swiss - all dug in, waiting. That morning of the fourth - or was it the fifth day? - I woke early, my bladder wanting out. The boys were asleep. I pulled on windproofs over layers of fleece, not shed since I had set foot on the mountain. Boots, over-gaiters, gloves, hat, goggles, face-mask; I never left the cave with less. And a shovel. Gathering my strength, I dived into the entrance hall, which by now had been excavated into an impressive 20ft long narrow, tunnel. I was forced to lie on my belly, digging somewhere above my head and having no choice but to shovel the snow back around my body so that I was cocooned, barely able to move. Three times I retreated, and three times forced myself back, until, at last, I broke a window to the outside. But that is where I stopped. A storm blew fiercely. Spindrift swirled round me, masking my goggles and freezing my hands, and nothing in me could force my body through the tiny escape hole. I retreated, close to tears; I was angry and frightened, defeated. It got worse, that day; or sadder. A fortnight ago there had been 12 in our party, enthusiastic on the lower, sunny slopes, and optimistic for the summit. Four had forked off as planned to climb the arduous Cassin Ridge, leaving eight of us on the less challenging, and more popular West Buttress; the 'dog run', it's called. We could not fail. It was three of our friends in the group of eight - Peter and Mike and Brian  -who dug us out that morning. They occupied a neighbouring snowhole and we had hardly seen them in days. They had bad news. The temperature outside, they said, was - 38'C and the wind speed at least 80mph. least. It was the worst weather on the mountain in 30 years - my lifetime, damn it. And there were no signs of improvement. They, and Sandy, our doctor, too, had pressing engagements at home, and could not wait. It was a sad decision, and a sad moment seeing them go. John Barry, the most experienced mountaineer among us, and our leader, roped them up and sent them on their way: 'Just stood there watching,' he said, 'till they disappeared out of sight.' We could only imagine them retracing our steps through the various camps to the landing strip at 7,200ft. By morning they'd be on an aircraft to Talkeetna , then Anchorage and home. Just the four of us now - John, myself, Dave Halton and a young lad of 22, Paul Deegan; and that afternoon, of course, the sun shone. 'Should have persuaded them to stay,' muttered John. Maybe. Maybe they would have done. It felt so good to be out of the cave, stretching our legs and squinting all the while into the sun. So beautiful in the sunshine: white and clean, and warm. Sixty people enjoyed the same pleasures that afternoon, mingling and chatting away, as if in a park on a Sunday. But it was only a temporary reprieve. The following morning, Bob, a down-suited American, fought his way through a storm and squeezed into our cave. 'Heard the news? A Swiss guy, a guide, died in camp last night. Cerebral oedema.' He went on: 'And that's not all. Two bodies have been found on the Cassin, and three Koreans fell just here, on the Orient Express. All dead.' Six people. 'Do you know what that makes me think?' said John. I didn't answer. 'This whole bloody game's a waste of time.' But my mind was on the Cassin. Were they our guys, dead? 'It's not Bill and Harry, or Smiler, or Brian. They're just too experienced.' John's words. This unquestioning faith was all we had to hold on to. For the first time I had serious doubts whether we would make it to the summit. Spirits were low. This mountain was a killer, and the winds continued to blow. We spent two, or three more days in that cave . . . and then the weather changed, for a day. Just the motion of moving, upwards, pumped energy back into our bones. We travelled light now - just rucksacks, no sleds - up a steep 2,000ft climb on to the buttress; and for an hour or so the sun shone so fiercely that it seemed impossible that a storm could ever blow again, but no: the mountain threw us its worst once more, thwarting our chance of climbing the length of a ridge to an inviting plateau at 17,200ft. We pitched our tents instead, short of the ridge on an exiguous, shark-fin crest. We had no choice, other than going down. The temperature was worryingly low; the wind, in gusts, knocked us to our knees, and when finally we succeeded in pitching our tent, the poles buckled and the canvas tore. We didn't sleep that night, uncomfortable in the knowledge that a tent, plus occupants, had been blown off this very spot. And it continued, a second night and a third. We were tiring, and time was running short. Already we had missed our flight to London, and if I held on one more day I'd lose my job. Others had worries too. What to do? That last possible day for an ascent and the winds dropped a little. The weather wasn't good, but it was fair. We went for it. Four thousand feet - from 16,000ft to more than 20,000ft - is a lot to climb in a day, when the air's so thin. The oxygen was half that at sea level, and we felt it. We moved slowly, painfully so. 'What do you think?' asked Dave. There was still a good way to go and it was late, and cold. Gloves weren't removed for fear of frostbite. 'I'm not turning back now,' said John. 'Nor I' We stood on the summit ridge of McKinley at about 9pm. It was perfectly clear. The Alaska Range stretched before us, with light cloud filling the valleys thousands of feet below. All was tinged pink and we were alone. And there wasn't a whisper of wind. Footnote: Our friends were not killed on Cassin Ridge, we learnt at base camp. They started the climb, but retreated early in worsening weather. So John was right.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules of the CVTMS are intended to enhance safe and expeditious vessel traffic movement, to prevent groundings and collisions, and to minimize the risk of property damage and pollution to the marine environment. The rules apply to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Each vessel of 30 meters or more in length; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Each vessel that is engaged in towing alongside or astern, or in pushing ahead, one or more objects, other than fishing gear, where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The combined length of the vessel towing, the towing apparatus, and the vessel or object towed is 45 meters or more; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The vessel or object towed is 20 meters or more in overall length.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Canadian and the United States Coast Guards are studying methods to improve the CVTMS in the area. Items being studied include replacement of outdated equipment, elimination of gaps in coverage, and increasing operator training and assignment length.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) requires the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct a national Tanker Free Zone Study. This study is nearing completion and will recommend regulations requiring tank vessels to remain offshore during coastal transits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, NOAA has recommended to the U.S. Coast Guard that an International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved ATBA be established within the proposed Sanctuary boundary. This would request that vessels transporting hazardous materials remain at least 25 nautical miles offshore while in the vicinity of Sanctuary waters or until making their approach to the Strait of Juan de Fuca using the established CVTMS traffic separation scheme. Although ATBA's are not compulsory for foreign flag vessels, a maritime state may make such an area compulsory for domestic vessels transiting the waters under its jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Clarify ``commercial vessel'' and distinguish between various sizes, uses, and types of vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Commercial vessel'' means any vessel operating in return for payment or other type of compensation. Clarification between sizes, uses, and types of vessels would require more space than is available in this document. Rather than attempt to hold to a general definition of ``commercial vessel'', reference will be made to specific types of vessels, i.e., tank vessels, bulk carriers, fishing vessels, pleasure craft, etc., wherever required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Sanctuary boundary should be published on navigational charts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA agrees and will submit the Sanctuary boundary to the Nautical Charting Division of the National Ocean Service. The boundary will be delineated on the next update of the appropriate navigational chart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Spill containment and cleanup measures should be part of appropriate mitigation requirements for vessels operating within the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OPA 90 mandates that tank vessel contingency plans be prepared for a worst-case discharge, and that vessel plans be reviewed and approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. OPA 90 also stipulates that each responsible party for a vessel from which oil is discharged, or which poses the substantial threat of a discharge of oil into or upon the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone, is liable for the removal costs and damages resulting from such an incident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, Washington State law (title 88 section 46 Revised Code of Washington) requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel to prepare and submit an oil spill prevention plan prior to the vessel's entry into a Washington port. The law also requires that each tank vessel, cargo vessel of greater than three hundred or more gross tons, or passenger vessel of greater than three hundred or more gross tons have a contingency plan for the containment and cleanup of oil spills from such vessel into the waters of the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA should provide a more complete explanation of how implementation of each of the regulations would put U.S. shipping companies at an economic disadvantage in relation to foreign vessels. Precisely what would be the estimated cost in dollars, time, inconvenience, and ultimate impact upon U.S. shipping companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

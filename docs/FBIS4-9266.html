			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Mircea Geoana made a few points on news items in the  Romanian media on the Romanian-Hungarian treaty, during a news  conference he held in Bucharest on 20 April. The news items  claimed that "sources at the Foreign Ministry and the presidency  said that, pursuant to U.S. and NATO pressures, the basic  Romanian-Hungarian political treaty will be signed by 1 July,  1994."    Mircea Geoana denied the existence of such an understanding  and said that as far as Romania was concerned, it was interested  to conclude the political treaty with Hungary the soonest.  "Even before the Paris conference or 26-27 May, when the  `stability' pact initiated by Balladur is launched, we would  like to do it," said Mircea Geoana. He added that Hungary has  not stated its stand on the proposals advanced long ago by the  Romanian Foreign Ministry regarding the outstanding issues. "If  we got an answer and were able to agree on a new round of  negotiations, this would be a positive element in the actuation  of the Romanian-Hungarian political dialogue," he said.    Regarding the issue of lifting the embargo against the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, "from what we know this is not  envisaged for now" -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana  said, referring to the "official launch" of the joint demarche  of Greece, Bulgaria and Romania in this respect. The Foreign  Ministry spokesman said such a demarche ought to be made at the  right time, when the process of political negotiations reaches a  congenial stage. "In keeping with the evolution of the  negotiations between the Bosnian conflicting parties, a decision  will be analyzed and made by all parties concerned", he said,  adding that Hungary showed interest in the demarche, while  Ukraine did not state its stand.    The idea of a joint demarche of Greece, Bulgaria and Romania  for the lifting of the embargo on the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia was launched during the Bucharest visit by the Greek  foreign minister a few weeks ago. The initiative pursues the  easing of the negative effects emerged following the application  of the UN sanctions by the countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia.    The prime minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Jacques  Smiter, will make an official visit in Romania over April 24-26  at the invitation of the Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu, the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said.    The agenda of the visit includes official talks with the  Romanian premier, interviews with Romanian President Ion  Iliescu, Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Adrian Nastase.    On the occasion of the visit, an inter-governmental  agreement  of cooperation in the fields of culture, education, science and  sport will be signed.    The postponement of the signing of the basic political  treaty  between Romania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, first  scheduled to take place while Yugoslav Federal President Zoran  Lilic was in Romania for the Crans Montana Forum, stirred the  interest of the journalists who attended the Foreign Ministry  briefing on 20 April. Confirming President Lilic would not  attend the Forum because of the tense situation in Bosnia,  Mircea Geoana said the official document would be signed only  after the two parties agreed on all issues. "It is an important  political document with a neighbour state, that has to fall in  line with the whole of the political treaties Romania is  concluding with other states of the world," he added. "It is  not to be achieved upon conjunctural bases, statuting instead  the format of bilateral relations in all spheres."    Referring to the conflict in Gorazde, the Romanian Foreign  Ministry spokesman reiterated Romania's constant stand relying  upon the principle of using the whole range of  political-diplomatic means to induce the conflicting parties to  go on negotiating. "We follow with worry the events in Gorazde  and see the high rate of contacts and statements by all parties  concerned, which leaves room for optimism," Geoana said.</p>

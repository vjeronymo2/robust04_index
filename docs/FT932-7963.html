			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Basques and Catalans plan own 'central' banks SPAIN'S TWO big governing regional parties, the Basque PNV and the Catalan CiU, have both issued a serious threat to the central authority of Madrid before the June 6 election by announcing plans to set up public banks which could increase the financial autonomy of the two regions. The move, started by the Basques and quickly followed by the Catalans, is a taste of the complex political dilemma that could confront either of Spain's two main parties, the governing Socialists or the conservative Partido Popular (PP), after the election. These parties are neck-and-neck in the polls, which predict a hung parliament in which any government would have to have the assistance of the Basque and Catalan parties. By launching their proposals now, the Basques and Catalans are making clear the price of such co-operation. The PNV has said its planned public bank for the Basque country would enjoy the same powers as the Bank of Spain in obliging Basque financial institutions, mainly savings banks, to deposit with it a proportion of their deposits, interest free, to meet liquidity requirements. A draft law publish by the Basque government says the new bank, the Euskadiko Banku Publikoa, would serve to 'obtain the maximum financial autonomy for Euskadi' (the Basque country). The possibility of creating a Basque central bank has been raised before and it is believed that, ultimately, the PNV intends the new bank to be a central bank issuing its own currency. The Basque country already has a statute of autonomy, allowing the regional government the exclusive right to collect and distribute taxes. Responding to publication of the Basque draft law, the CiU leader and Catalan premier, Mr Jordi Pujol, emerged from a cabinet meeting this week saying: 'We must do it too.' The Catalans, who do not yet collect their own taxes, want a public bank run by the regional government which would be used to help fund regional government projects. It is taken for granted, however, that the Catalans, sooner or later, would also want this bank to take some control over Catalonia's financial sector, and that it would also begin to set liquidity requirements for local banking institutions.</p>

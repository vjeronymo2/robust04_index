			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 200-YEAR TRADITION;  </P> <P> CAPITAL SETS THE STAGE FOR ITS BIG DAY  </P> <P> As Friday's inauguration approaches, Barbara Bush has almost single-handedly  packed all the boxes of belongings in the rambling Victorian mansion that  serves as the vice presidential residence. She has marked each with a colored  dot -- red to the White House, yellow to the presidential retreat at Camp  David, Md., and blue to the family home at Kennebunkport, Me.  </P> <P> In the meantime, as part of the tightest security preparations for any public  event in the nation's history, welders were sealing manhole covers on  Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday to prevent terrorists from popping up in the  middle of the inaugural parade.  </P> <P> And at the Washington Convention Center, where two of nine inaugural balls will  take place, Kevin Moley was planning the installation of luminous ceiling  sculptures meant to symbolize the Bush campaign theme of "a thousand points of  light." In all, $25-million worth of parties -- including one on Saturday  dubbed "From George to George" (Washington to Bush) -- are ready.  </P> <P> </P> <P> West Steps of Capitol  </P> <P> Continuing a 200-year-old tradition, the city named after the first President  is all set to inaugurate and celebrate the reign of the 41st. Before a live  audience of 140,000 and millions more watching on television, George Herbert  Walker Bush and James Danforth Quayle will be sworn in as President and vice  president of the United States at noon Friday on the west steps of the Capitol.  </P> <P> That is, unless the weather votes otherwise. Four years ago, snow and arctic  cold forced the oath-taking ceremony for President Reagan and Vice President  Bush indoors, under the Capitol dome, and the parade was canceled. The early  forecast for Friday is for a high temperature in the mid-40s and precipitation  no heavier than a few Democratic tears.  </P> <P> The whirlwind of celebratory bashes this week will present a paradox. Tickets  to many events will be the most expensive in history, ranging up to $25,000 for  an eight-person box at Thursday's gala, to be televised live by CBS, featuring  such entertainers as Julio Iglesias, Roberta Peters, Frank Sinatra, the Oak  Ridge Boys and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Free Events  </P> <P> At the same time, there will be more free events than ever, including a forum  Thursday at which "heroes from all walks of life" will tell young people about  the "tremendous opportunities" awaiting them.  </P> <P> The committee planning the privately financed balls, galas, pageants, salutes,  dinners, forums and parade has budgeted a record $25 million, to be raised  through a combination of interest-free loans and contributions from  corporations and rich individuals as well as sales of tickets, memorabilia and  television advertising.  </P> <P> Partly because of inflation and the increased free events, that is far more  than the $4.5 million spent on Jimmy Carter's inaugural celebration in 1977 or  even the much-criticized $16.3 million lavished on Reagan's first inauguration  in 1981. (The 1985 price tag was scaled back to $9.5 million.)  </P> <P> An additional $5 million in taxpayer funds will be spent this year on such  things as security and platform construction at the Capitol.  </P> <P> "The money is not being spent for gold and glitter but for substantive kinds of  things," insists Stephen M. Studdert, executive director of the inaugural  committee.  </P> <P> The festivities, says Penne Percy Korth, an art dealer who serves as committee  co-chairman, are meant to "demonstrate to the world the beauty and uniqueness  of an orderly, peaceful system that has operated successfully for 200 years."  </P> <P> Inaugural extravaganzas have come a long way since George Washington, who took  the oath of office in New York in 1789, watched a nighttime fireworks display  from a friend's house and walked home through crowded streets.  </P> <P> When John Adams succeeded Washington eight years later, there was a ball that  evening, but it was for the retiring President, and no one thought to invite  Adams, a political rival.  </P> <P> Andrew Jackson, the hero of the common man, threw open the doors of the White  House during his 1829 inauguration -- and thousands of celebrants descended on  the mansion, stepping with muddy boots on damask-covered chairs and knocking  over furniture and glassware to get at barrels of orange punch, ice cream and  cake.  </P> <P> Despite that fiasco, the Bushes are reviving Jackson's idea, opening the White  House to all comers for three hours on Saturday morning. The newly moved-in  hosts plan to greet many of the visitors themselves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tight Security  </P> <P> Reflecting concern over a worldwide epidemic of terrorism, extraordinary  security measures have been taken for the string of inaugural events.  </P> <P> To prevent an airborne attack at the inauguration, a sentry armed with a  Stinger anti-aircraft missile will be stationed atop a building on the Capitol  grounds, sources said. Sharpshooters will peer down from the Capitol roof as  Bush takes the oath and gives his speech behind bulletproof glass.  </P> <P> Each of the tens of thousands of people attending the ceremony will have to  pass through metal detectors at just four openings in miles of snow fencing  that surround the grounds. Television operations with bulky equipment have been  warned to show up well before dawn so that bomb-sniffing dogs and security  personnel can go through their gear.  </P> <P> Along the parade route from the Capitol to the White House, mailboxes, litter  cans and newspaper vending machines will be removed to prevent the placement of  time bombs. Buildings will be marked with large numbers so that roving SWAT  teams can be directed quickly to any trouble spot.  </P> <P> More than 300,000 federal workers will be given the day off, at a cost to the  government of $40 million, to permit office buildings to be closed along the  route and to ease traffic jams.  </P> <P> The Bushes are not expected to follow the example of Jimmy Carter and his wife,  Rosalynn, who took a surprise stroll down the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue  after his inauguration in 1977. Instead, they plan to ride from the Capitol to  the parade reviewing stand at the White House in a new $600,000 armored Lincoln  limousine that took three years to build.  </P> <P> In line with past practice dating to Lyndon B. Johnson's inauguration in 1964,  the Bush inaugural committee raised $20 million in start-up money for the  parade and private events by borrowing $100,000 interest-free from each of 200  corporations and wealthy individuals.  </P> <P> The loans will be repaid from corporate sponsorship of free events and from  sales of tickets, television advertising and memorabilia ranging in price from  $25 belt buckles to $1,195 crystal eagles.  </P> <P> For Thursday night's gala, to be televised live on CBS, 14 minutes of  commercials have been sold for $350,000 a minute, about one-quarter the price  for Super Bowl air time.  </P> <P> Executive director Studdert dismissed suggestions that the many generous  financial supporters of the inaugural events might seek return favors when they  have business before the new Administration. "There's no linkage at all," he  said.  </P> <P> This year's inaugural parade probably will not be able to compete with some of  its predecessors for colorful participants and humorous moments. Buffalo Bill  rode in Benjamin Harrison's 1889 parade and Indian chief Geronimo rode in  Theodore Roosevelt's in 1901. In 1957, a horseman playfully threw a lasso over  President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who as a West Point cadet 40 years earlier had  marched in Woodrow Wilson's parade.  </P> <P> But this year's parade will feature at least one first: politically significant  police officers. At a cost of $75,000, the inaugural committee is bringing to  Washington by train police officers from Boston, Springfield, Mass., and New  York City who supplied key endorsements in Bush's presidential campaign against  Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.  </P> <P> "It's a way where George Bush can clearly send a message that he has a very  strong posture toward law and order," Studdert said. "Second, it's a way to say  thank you."  </P> <P> Also appearing in this year's parade, amid some lighthearted controversy, will  be the California Raisins, a group of promotional dancers usually seen on  television dressed up as dried grapes. When a last-minute scheduling change  forced Bush, who had been in the area earlier, to cancel a rally last year in  Fresno, home of the California Raisin Advisory Board, he joked: "I didn't want  to see those damned dancing raisins again."  </P> <P> Perhaps as a good-will gesture, the raisins were invited to march in the  inaugural parade. They declined at first, saying their 18-inch sneakers were  not meant for walking, but then agreed to ride on a float sponsored by the  President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.  </P> <P> In all, 214 bands, equestrian teams, choral groups or other units will be  represented in the 1.6-mile parade, and every state and territory except North  Dakota will have an entry. North Dakota's "centennial band" came up $80,000  short in travel money and opted instead to go to the Rose Bowl Parade in  Pasadena.  </P> <P> California's entry will be the Sacramento County Mounted Posse, which appeared  in Reagan's first inaugural parade in 1981 and was in Washington for the 1985  parade before it was canceled by the cold weather.  </P> <P> Some of the most intensive inaugural planning has gone into avoiding a repeat  of the Great Fur Flap of 1985, when hundreds of ballgoers wound up with someone  else's fur coat -- or none at all -- because of a gigantic coat-check mix-up at  the Washington Convention Center.  </P> <P> California firms making interest-free loans to the inaugural committee include  Atlantic Richfield Co., Bank of America, Chevron Corp., Fluor Corp., Frederick  Weisman Co., Pacific Telesis Group, Sun Diamond Growers of California and  Unocal.  </P> <P> Individual lenders from California include Donald L. Bren, chairman of Irvine  Co.; Dr. Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; actor Glen  Holden; Gordon C. Luce, chairman of Great American First Savings Bank of San  Diego; David H. Murdock, Los Angeles real estate developer; Gerald L. Parsky, a  Los Angeles attorney and former official in the Gerald R. Ford Administration;  Jerry Weintraub, movie producer and close friend of the Bushes, and Earle C.  Williams, a Los Angeles businessman.  </P></p>

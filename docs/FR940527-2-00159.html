			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Public Utilities Corporation, et al. (70&hyph;8409) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered holding company, and its subsidiaries, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company (``JCP&amp;L''), 300 Madison Avenue, Morristown, New Jersey 07960, Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike, Reading, Pennsylvania 19640, and Pennsylvania Electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street, Johnstown, Pennsylvania 15907, have filed an application-declaration pursuant to sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 86&hyph;95 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GPU proposes to organize a new, wholly-owned subsidiary company to be known as GPU Generation Corporation (``GPUGC''). GPUGC proposes to undertake responsibility for the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of all non-nuclear generation facilities owned and/or operated by JCP&amp;L, Met-Ed and Penelec (collectively, ``Subsidiaries''). GPUGC also proposes to undertake responsibility for the design, construction, start-up and testing of any new non-nuclear generation facilities which the Subsidiaries may need in the future. In addition, GPUGC proposes to assume (subject to obtaining the requisite consent of the station co-owners) the responsibilities of Penelec and JCP&amp;L under certain operating agreements under which they operate and maintain certain fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation facilities ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Keystone, Conemaugh and Homer City coal-fired facilities and the Yards Creek and Seneca pumped storage hydroelectric facilities) each of which is jointly owned by a GPU company with one or more unaffiliated utilities. GPUGC's Board of Directors will include the presidents of each of the Subsidiaries. Ownership of the generation facilities, however, will remain unchanged so that each Subsidiary will continue to own the utility plant currently reflected on its respective books, as well as any capital additions made to its respective facilities or other new generation investments made at its request for its own account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To implement this program, the Subsidiaries will enter into an operating agreement (``Operating Agreement'') with GPUGC. In effect, the Subsidiaries will simply make use of the staff, facilities and other combined resources of GPUGC (which, at least initially, will be largely derived from existing GPU system staff, facilities and resources) to operate and maintain the same generation facilities in which the Subsidiaries presently have an interest. From time to time, GPUGC may also employ others (who may or may not be present employees of the GPU system) and engage consultants and contractors as needed for the discharge of its functions. It is also contemplated that certain general and administrative functions and services, such as finance/treasury, accounting, internal auditing, legal, data processing, taxes, insurance, human resources and environmental, will be performed for GPUGC at cost by GPU Service Corporation (``GPUGC'') and/or one or more of the Subsidiaries. The services rendered by GPUSC will be furnished at cost, including reasonable compensation for necessary capital, in compliance with Rule 91. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GPU will acquire for cash all of the 2,500 authorized shares of GPUGC's common stock, par value of $20, at a price of $20 per share or an aggregate consideration of $50,000. If necessary, GPU proposes to make open account advances to GPUGC from time to time during the term of the Operating Agreement up to an aggregate amount of $1 million outstanding at any time. Interest on such open account advances will accrue at a rate equal to the Citibank, N.A. base rate as in effect from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain management and supervisory personnel presently employed by the Subsidiaries (and/or GPUSC) are expected to be transferred to GPUGC. However, it is not expected that union employees of the Subsidiaries will initially be transferred to GPUGC. Rather, such employees will continue to perform their services at and on behalf of the GPU system's non-nuclear generation facilities as employees of the same entities within the GPU system with which they are currently associated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Fuel Gas Company, et al.

(``Leidy Hub''), <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, a non-utility subsidiary of NFG, have filed an application-declaration under Section 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 16 and 45 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Leidy Hub, Inc. is the successor of Enerop Corporation. This change was reported in a Rule 24 certificate filed on January 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NFG and Leidy Hub propose that Leidy Hub acquire, for $500,000, an interest in a partnership (``Partnership'') with Hub Services, Inc. (``Hub Services''), an unaffiliated company, and a subsidiary of Natural Gas Clearinghouse (``Clearinghouse''). Leidy Hub proposes to borrow the $500,000 needed for the acquisition from the National Fuel System Money Pool (``Money Pool''). Leidy Hub presently has the authority, pursuant to an order dated December 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25964), to borrow up to $2.5 million from the Money Pool. Leidy Hub and Hub Services plan to form the Partnership in order to operate a natural gas market area hub (``Hub''). The Hub will offer customers services relating to the transportation, storage, purchase, sale, exchange and lending of natural gas in the Hub area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFG also proposes to act as guarantor, through December 31, 1998, of certain obligations of Leidy Hub and the Partnership in an amount not to exceed $5 million at any one time. The guarantees will be made for an indefinite period of time not to exceed four years. It is stated that the obligations of Leidy Hub and the Partnership to be guaranteed would be incurred as a result of the activities undertaken by the Partnership related to the supply of natural gas as delineated in the Gas Related Activities Act of 1990 (``GRAA''). It is anticipated that whenever the Partnership is required to provide a guarantee, it will be provided one-half by NFG and one-half by Clearinghouse. Such guarantees include the guarantee of obligations associated with: (1) Gas transportation agreements entered into by the Partnership with local distribution companies or pipelines such as Distribution and Supply; (2) gas purchase and sale agreements entered into by the Partnership in the provision of certain contemplated title transfer services; and (3) any and all other agreements relating to the transportation, storage or supply of natural gas, as such activities are defined under the GRAA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

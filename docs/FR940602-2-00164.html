			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another group of respondents felt that the proposed policy ignored the Assistant Secretary's appeal decision. They felt that any lots available for in-lieu lots should be made available instead to the general public for recreation residences. Their view was that the holder whose permit expires and is notified that a new permit will not be issued acquires no more rights to available lots than any other member of the public and should not receive any preferential treatment. Generally, this group of respondents felt the entire policy of offering of in-lieu lots should be deleted but if retained should be limited strictly to lots available within existing recreation residence tracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responses to the proposed policy provision on in-lieu lot availability following destruction of the improvements by catastrophic event (FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 13) reflected a similar division of views as was found in the overall policy. Some felt allowing a holder to rebuild the improvements or to receive an in-lieu lot extends the use indefinitely and is contrary to the appeal decision. Others felt the proposed policy was not clear with regard to when rebuilding the improvements would be ``consistent'' with Forest plan. Several suggestions were made to clarify this provision. Many respondents commented on the inclusion of fire in the list of catastrophic events to which this provision applies. This had been suggested in the September 1989 Advance Notice of Proposed Policy. Respondents overwhelmingly opposed the listing of fire in this provision. They felt the risk of loss of the recreation residence from fire is inherent in a forest setting and thus should not be cause for permit termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents commenting on the proposed Handbook direction at FSH 41.23c pointed out what they believed was more restrictive language than in the 1988 policy. Specifically, they cited the 12 month limit on offering an in-lieu lot, the 90-day limit on holders acceptance of the lot offer, and the requirement that occupancy of the in-lieu lot begins when construction begins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Forest Service does not agree that the reformulation of the in-lieu lot provisions of the 1988 recreation residence policy should be limited to the question of whether the offer is mandatory or discretionary. The appeal decision questioned the policy on offering of in-lieu lots and directed that all provisions of the policy dealing with this issue be stayed from implementation and reconsidered. The agency, in its September 1991 proposed policy, modified it to respond to the appeal decision's concern that the use was being perpetuated when in-lieu lots were offered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under policy stated at FSM 2347.1, the agency affirms that recreation residences are a valid use of National Forest System lands and an important component of the overall National Forest recreation program. It also acknowledges that there may be circumstances, albeit very limited, where this use is not consistent with the overall management direction for the land and the recreation residence use must be converted to an alternative public use. When these circumstances occur, however, the agency believes that holders of these uses should not be subjected to the loss of the use if reasonable options are available to accommodate the use elsewhere. Thus, it is maintaining its long-established in-lieu lot provisions in the final policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency does recognize that certain provisions in the proposed policy limited the scope of the 1988 policy and has reconsidered several provisions. In FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, the first sentence is revised to read ``Although provision of an in-lieu lot is not required, make a reasonable effort to provide a lot to holders whose lots will be converted to an alternative public use and have received notification that new permits for those lots will not be issued, or who have received termination notices (except termination for noncompliance) (FSM 2721.23e).'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is maintaining the provision in the proposed policy that prohibited establishment of new tracts for in-lieu lot purposes. However, the agency points out that it is possible under the revised second sentence of this provision to expand a recreation residence tract in order to relocate the use to accommodate a change in land use. Such could happen when a river is designated as a Wild and Scenic River and recreation residences located a few feet from the riverbank are moved several hundred feet back from the river to accommodate public use along the riverbank. The third sentence of this provision is clarified to identify locations suitable for in-lieu lots to include undeveloped lands, and formerly developed and withdrawn recreation residence lots in or adjacent to established recreation residence tracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 13, describing action to be taken when a recreation residence is destroyed or substantially damaged by catastrophic event, is revised to clarify when improvements could be rebuilt or the permit terminated and in-lieu lot available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23f affirmed the overall in-lieu lot policy stated at FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, in connection with the policy on continuation of recreation residence use. The language in this provision has been revised to be consistent with the overall policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The language at FSH 2709.11, section 41.23c of the proposed policy provides the procedural guidance for implementing the overall policy on offering in-lieu lots. Paragraph one of this section limited the availability of lots for in-lieu lot purposes to 12 months following notification of the holder that a new permit would not be offered. The agency finds that this limitation is inconsistent with the policy requiring a 10-year notification to the holder. Lots which come available during that 10-year period should be available as in-lieu lots if not otherwise needed for other public purposes. Thus, the agency has restored the language of the 1988 policy as follows: ``If lots do not become available until later, offer them then.'' Paragraph 3 allowed the holder 90 days from the date of a joint inspection to accept the offer of an in-lieu lot. This has been clarified to require both actions_arranging a joint inspection and providing 90 days to decide. The paragraph is also clarified to require the 90 day period to occur while access to the lot is possible. Paragraph 4 required that a new permit be issued when a holder accepts the offer of an in-lieu lot. The agency recognizes that his means the holder will have two permits for recreation residence use for a limited period of time. However, this provision has been kept in the final policy to be consistent with overall special use regulations which require all users of National Forest land to have a permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Aeromexico in share swap deal with its larger rival AEROMEXICO and Mexicana, Mexico's two main airlines, have agreed to a share swap deal giving Aeromexico control over its larger rival. The move will allow them to restrict competition on some routes and share reservation systems. Under the alliance the companies' shareholders will swap shares in each other's businesses. The more efficient Aeromexico will gain the controlling interest in a new holding company which will run both airlines. However, Mexicana and Aeromexico will survive as separate entities, in name at least. Despite rapid growth in Mexican air travel, both Mexicana and Aeromexico have been losing money. Mexicana, whose principal shareholders include Sir James Goldsmith, incurred net losses of 223,892m pesos in the first nine months of last year. The company owns 11 airbuses, 20 Boeing 727-200, and six DC-10's. The agreement marks a triumph for Aeromexico, which has just bought a controling interest in AeroPeru, and is looking to expand internationally. THe agreement appears to have received the green light from the Mexican government, and raises questions about official commitment to competition policy. Many sectors of the Mexican economy are dominated by quasi-monopolies, including television, telecommunications, and now airlines. United Airlines, the US airline controlled by UAL, is offering for sale its 17 flight kitchens located throughout the US and has engaged First Boston to serve as its financial adviser for the transaction, Reuter reports from Chicago. The flight kitchens employ about 5,000 people, who prepare more than 125,000 meals daily in 14 cities for United and for other airlines on a contract basis.</p>

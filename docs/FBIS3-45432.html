A ministry official yesterday said the chemical industry  will  pursue 8 per cent growth this year. That will bring its annual  production value to 190 billion yuan ($21.84 billion).    Last year, total production in the chemical sector was worth  178.79 billion yuan ($20.55 billion), an increase of 7.2 per  cent over the previous year.    Chemical product exports should experience a 16 per cent  rise  over 1993, the official said.    However, the export growth rate set for this year is lower  than that in 1993.    In the January-November period last year, China's chemical  sector saw its imports hit $11.02 billion, up 1.6 per cent while  its exports reached $9.97 billion, representing a record growth  of 27.3 per cent.    Among exports, the ratio of finished products to unfinished  products increased last year, indicating China's chemical  industry has made progress in variety and quality of goods, as  well as advances of its technologies.    In the past, raw chemical materials amounted to a large  share  of exports due to China's low technical level, the official said.    Meanwhile the chemical industry this year will continue its  opening drive in a bid to attract more foreign investment and  establish more foreign-funded ventures in coastal areas, the  official said.    But the spokesman warned that last year's problems of funds  shortages and price hikes for raw materials energy resources and  transportation may continue to restrain this years production.    Due to price hikes, the chemical industry suffered a  production cost rise of more than 7.3 billion yuan ($844.8  million) last year. That figure was 1.7 fold the industry's  total profits in 1992.</p>

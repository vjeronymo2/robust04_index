			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Pakistan flood toll climbs to 1,700 AT LEAST 1,700 people are feared to have died in floods and torrential rains which hit parts of Pakistan towards the end of last week, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. There are also fresh fears that the country's economy may suffer due to widespread damaged caused to the cotton crop, regarded as the agricultural backbone. Experts were yesterday continuing their assessment of the crop after Mr Majid Malik, the agriculture minister, said as much as half the cotton in Sindh had been destroyed. Output is also expected to fall in the cotton fields of Punjab. According to weekend estimates by the government of the semi-autonomous Northern Kashmir state, at least 1,000 are feared dead in that area alone, in addition to another 700 in parts of Pakistan's Punjab province. Road networks are gradually being restored, and relief camps set up.</p>

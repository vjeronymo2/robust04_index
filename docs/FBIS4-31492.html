			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 9 (CTK) -- "Some political parties  have set out on a path of stirring up national feelings,  opposing Slovaks to Czechs and Hungarians, and creating the  atmosphere of threat," chairman of the Democratic Left Party  (SDL) Peter Weiss tells the Czech agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE  NOVINY today. "I believe that this policy glaringly contradicts  the Slovaks' interests," he adds.    "The chairman of the HZDS (Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia) has taken to discrediting, grossly  slandering, and challenging his political opponents and  splitting political parties which are not obedient or compete  with him. In a way, I understand Meciar's attacks against our  party. The SDL is, in fact, the only political party he has not  managed to split," Weiss says in reaction to Meciar's recent  statement that the SDL rank and file should put their leadership  in order.    "As we are the most serious rival to the HZDS in the  elections (September 30-October 1), Meciar, indulging in his old  style, has over and over again fabricated rumors about sharp  feuds in the SDL leadership. I would like to send a message to  Mr. Meciar that it was not the SDL group of deputies, but that  of the HZDS which was abandoned by a quarter of its deputies!  He should perhaps first tidy up his own backyard," Weiss said.    "Due to the HZDS and SNS (Slovak National Party) and,  unfortunately, also a part of ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles  [Coexistence] movement, the signpost law (stipulating that towns  and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic population  should have bilingual signposts) has become a political problem,  although at the beginning it was more of a legislative issue.  Some politicians are evidently engaging in provoking a  nationalist mood. This is the main reason why the law was not  passed. The HZDS and SNS on the one hand, and a part of the  Egyutteles, on the other, simply were not interested in a  compromise," Weiss states.    "If Miklos Duray, chairman of the Egyutteles, chooses  confrontation, he will only confirm the statement which appeared  early this year: Meciar cannot be without Duray nor Duray  without Meciar," Weiss adds.    "The SNS Komarno congress has sent a clear message that the  party of Jan Slota has opted for extreme nationalism. The  attempt to exclude legally elected deputies of the Slovak  Parliament of Hungarian nationality from political  decision-making is against the spirit of the Slovak Constitution  for which also the SNS deputies had voted, which I would like to  emphasize," Weiss says.    "As the SDL is a left-wing party, it is pushing for the  principle of social justice, equal opportunities for all, and  equal distribution of the costs necessary for restructuring the  economy," Weiss says.</p>

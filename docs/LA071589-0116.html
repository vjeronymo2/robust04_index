			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Based on erroneous information from old company publications, Friday's obituary  of Richard G. Adams, former secretary and general counsel for the Times Mirror  Co., said that he had joined the company in 1930, instead of 1931, and retired  in 1960, instead of 1966. Also, he attended the University of Colorado and not  the University of Oklahoma.  </P></p>

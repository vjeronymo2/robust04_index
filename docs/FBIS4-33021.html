			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guillermo Rodriguez from the Catam Military </F> Airport -- live]    [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has arrived.  A very important event has taken place in his first public act:  the Jewish-Palestine community has greeted him, which is a sign  of new times. Peres praised Colombian democracy and said things  are being corrected in Colombia through elections and that it is  a privilege for him to arrive just when Colombia is voting. He  also said Jerusalem will continue to be Israel's capital, but  that Jerusalem will not be divided as Berlin was after World War  II. Peres said he believes more in deeds than words regarding  Palestinian leader Arafat's unfortunate remarks to the effect  there would be a jihad or sacred war to liberate Palestine.  Here is Shim'on Peres:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you believe  that  results will allow your [as heard] country to continue to make  great economic strides?    [Peres, in English with passage-by-passage translation into  Spanish] All of Latin America is undergoing great changes and is  making important changes to the world outlook. Colombia, as one  of the four great countries in Latin America, will play an  important role. It is a great pleasure for me to have the  opportunity to improve relations between Colombia and Israel.  [end recording]    This was part of the statements made by Shim'on Peres,  architect of the Middle East peace process. He feels very  satisfied and said he is confident that peace in the Middle East  will be lasting. He intends to visit several voting tables; he  will also visit the Gold Museum; and he will meet the president  and they will issue a joint communique.

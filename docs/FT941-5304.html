Credit Suisse, the bank which accounted for over 80 per cent of 1992 group profits, has just reported a 53 per cent jump in net income and CS First Boston, the New York investment bank subsidiary, an 87 per cent leap. The question is whether CS will be less miserly with a dividend increase than the other two big Swiss banks.</p>

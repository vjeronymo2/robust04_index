			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Arts: Women of importance - Willian Packer admires the work of Sandra Blow; Emma Sergeant and Sophie Macpherson It is, perhaps, invidious today to lay too much stress on what should be unremarkable, but so often the most interesting of current work is by women. Sandra Blow, if it is not ungallant to say so, is now nearer 70 than 60. She has been an ornament of the Royal Academy's Summer Show for more than 20 years, and her work is widely represented in public collections. And yet to look back over her career is to find not a steadily cumulative celebration of her achievement but only a list of mixed and survey shows here, a handful of solo shows there. She was a bright and rising star of the 1950s, showing regularly at Gimpel Fils and, into the 1970s, at the New Art Centre, all set to shine along with such as Gillian Ayres and Bridget Riley, a rare female in the then male firmament of abstract painting. But somehow it never quite happened. If each of those women painters has suffered a career of periodic shadow and eclipse, for Sandra Blow the shadows have been the deepest, and the longest-lasting. Was it her association with the Academy itself that was the mistake? Certainly the free-for-all of the Summer Show is not the easiest of contexts for work such as hers, with its generous, environmental scope. But then it was the Academy that gave her, in 1979, her one proper show in 20 years, until Francis Graham-Dixon brought her forward again in 1991. And now again it is the Royal Academy that is giving her at last her due and proper retrospective, filling the splendid Sackler Galleries with light and colour. In the 1950s she saw at first hand, in all its shock and excitement, the assault upon European sensibilities of the American abstract expressionists, Pollock, Rothko, Kline and all. From their example came the amplified scale of her work, its light and open surface and space generated by clear, pure colour. These, however, are technical considerations. She remains as ever European at heart, associative, romantic and intuitive in her approach. She worked closely with the Italian painter, Alberto Burri, in the 1950s, from whom she took the practice, which she still employs, of working up the surface, often quite densely, with collage, matiere and applique. But she spent time too at St Ives, with Roger Hilton especially, whose graphic gestural freedom is still characteristic of her work. She was never truly a member of the Cornish School, but always a loose associate. To dwell on influences here is no disparagement, for Sandra Blow has never been anything but true to herself. The great thing in this exhibition is indeed to see how strongly personal those works of the 1950s and early 1960s now seem, all whites and greys, blacks and ochres, plaster, sawdust and sacking. They are very beautiful and have been unjustly overlooked for far too long. But the greater surprise of the show is the group of huge canvases that mark Miss Blow's extraordinary creative achievement of the past year or two. After those early works, and the calmer formal engagement of the middle years, we come to paintings that are astonishing in their confidence and authority, so deceptively simple in their imagery, so certain in their articulation, with the broadest sweep of pigment held just so by the particular accent of colour, pitched to a nicety. Here is an artist at last resolved in her work, come into her own. Emma Sergeant, still in her 30s, has a long way to go before she resolves the problems she sets herself, but she does not flinch from the grand scale and the great theme, the ambition of which is itself admirable. But she deserves rather more than a mere pat on the head for trying hard. She has taken the story of Orpheus and Eurydice as her subject, which she treats for the moment in terms of life-size figures painted in isolation within an empty and portentous stage-like space, with but a hint of a world beyond. So far so good, and the figure painting alone is remarkable in its accomplishment. It is only the theatricality of the setting that is occasionally obtrusive and self-conscious, with diptychs and triptychs set up for the sake of it. The simpler these compositions, the better they are and, with only a few days left on show, well worth the seeing. Sophie Macpherson, also in her 30s, is no less ambitious but less conspicuously so. Her subject is the industrial relic left ambiguously in the landscape, the boiler in the scrap-yard, the wreck on the foreshore, disused or forgotten tackle and trim. Hers is the romantic surrealism of the megaliths and fallen trees of Paul Nash, but more quietly and discreetly so, and more dispassionately seen. Her work gets more confident with every show. Sandra Blow: Royal Academy, Piccadilly W1, until March 3; sponsored by Silhouette Eyewear Minimal Art Collection, Harpers &amp; Queen. Emma Sergeant: Orpheus on the Underworld; Agnew's, 43 Old Bond Street W1, until February 18. Sophie Macpherson: Portland Gallery, 8 Bury Street, SW1, until February 25.</p>

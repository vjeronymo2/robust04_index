			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks between the prime minister, Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao, and the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, on the  19th of this month in Washington are expected to cover a wide  range of bilateral and international issues. While stating  this, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New Delhi  today that substantial preparations are being made to make the  visit successful. He said the visit will lead to enhanced  cooperation between the two countries. Denying reports in a  section of the press about the reported ultimatum or  preconditions being laid down by the USA for the visit of the  prime minister, the spokesman said the report is full of errors  and distortions.</p>

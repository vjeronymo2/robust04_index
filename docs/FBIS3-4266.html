The document, initialled by the countries' top military  officials last July, was formally signed by Romanian Defense  Minister Gheorghe Tinca and his Russian counterpart Pavel  Grachev here on Monday [28 March].    The traditional ties between the armed forces of Romania and  the former Soviet Union have gone through twists and turns in  recent years.    Previously cemented in the Warsaw Pact, they hit rock bottom  with the dissolution of the eastern military bloc and the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, and plummeted further in the  summer of 1992, when a bloody ethnic conflict flared up between  Moldovan troops and mainly Russian-speaking national guards of  the breakaway Dnestr River region. Historically and ethnically,  Moldova, where a majority of the population speak Romanian, has  had close relations with Romania.    However, a thaw in the relations took place last July when  Romania's chief of the general staff visited Russia and  initialled the military cooperation accord with the Russians.    But some later incidents including the bloody clash between  the Russian Government and rebel parliamentarians in Moscow and  the invectives by Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  against Romania forced Grachev to postpone his visit time and  again.    The eventual realization of the trip, Tinca said, indicated  the end of the most difficult period in bilateral relations.    The accord envisages a restoration and expansion of  cooperation in military training, armament and military science.    The media here appeared more interested in the cooperation  in  the area of military materiel, disclosing Romania is in dire  need of upgrading its Soviet-made military equipment and  importing parts from Moscow to keep it working.    After the signing ceremony, the two defense ministers said  that the accord would help promote mutual trust between the two  countries, and contribute to stability in Eastern Europe and to  security in Europe as a whole.    During a meeting with Grachev, Romanian Foreign Minister  Teodor Melescanu said Romania's security not only depends on the  Partnership for Peace relationship with the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO), but also on Russia's domestic  situation and Romanian-Russian relations.    The press here said that a once prevailing strategic  thinking  in Romania's diplomacy, which stands for bilateral cooperation  with both Russia and the West for the sake of the country's own  national security, is still applicable nowadays.    Since 1989, Romania has signed as many as 15 military  cooperation accords with its neighboring and Western countries.    Grachev and Tinca agreed that the significance of the accord  has gone beyond the military area, as the document represented  part of the efforts to foster many-sided cooperation between the  two countries.    The signing of the accord has also paved the way for Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to visit Romania, they said.</p>

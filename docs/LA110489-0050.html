			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN GIVES UP AFTER BARRICADING HOUSE  </P> <P> A 75-year-old man apparently despondent over medical problems barricaded  himself in his Castaic house for 4 1/2 hours and fired at least two shots  before surrendering Friday afternoon, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department reported.  </P> <P> Jack Neely was taken to Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar for a 72-hour  psychiatric observation after he walked out the front door of his house with  his hands above his head about 4:30 p.m., authorities said.  </P> <P> His wife, Martha Neely, left the house in the 31600 block of Cherry Drive about  noon to call for help after he fired a handgun at the ceiling, Lt. Dennis Burns  said. No one was hit, Burns said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly afterward and called for the sheriff's  Special Weapons Team and Crisis Negotiation Team, which arrived about 2 p.m.,  authorities said. Neely gave himself up after a negotiator asked him repeatedly  over a loudspeaker to come out of the house, a witness said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop said Neely was depressed over heart problems and a  recent bout with emphysema. He has no history of violent behavior or run-ins  with law enforcement, Roop said.  </P></p>

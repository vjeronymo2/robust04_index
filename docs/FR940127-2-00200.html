			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Description <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Program, USDA will competitively award research grants to support science-based biotechnology regulation and thus help address concerns about the effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the environment and to help regulators develop policies concerning such introduction. Proposals are invited in the area of biotechnology risk assessment research as appropriate to agricultural plants, animals and microbes. Emphasis will be given to risk assessment research involving genetically modified organisms, but model systems using nongenetically modified organisms also will be considered if they can provide information that could lead to improved assessment of potential risks associated with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals will be evaluated by a peer panel of scientists for, among other things, science quality; relevance for current regulatory issues; and intent to advance the safe application of biotechnology to agriculture by providing new knowledge for science-based regulatory decisions. The development of better methods for field testing genetically modified organisms will also be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Areas of Research To Be Supported in Fiscal Year 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals addressing the following research topics are requested: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Development of new risk assessment methods (e.g. monitoring organism escape, measuring biological impacts), and risk assessment procedures (e.g. comparative analysis of ecosystems, models to predict risks) that could be used in risk assessment of genetically modified fungi, bacteria, viruses (including animal vaccines), plants, arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals. Applicants should address the development of such new risk assessment methods in the course of addressing a specific and defined risk assessment issue, especially as pertains to genetically modified organisms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Creation of information systems and computer models to support regulatory agency decision-making in regards to potential impacts to the environment over time (e.g., computer models to describe the interaction of environmental and organismal factors especially for establishment and dispersal of the organism). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Risk assessment of the environmental fate (e.g. survival, reproduction fitness, genetic stability, horizontal gene transfer) as correlated with effects (i.e., loss of genetic diversity, enhanced competition) of genetically modified fungi, bacteria, viruses, plants, arthropods, fish, birds and mammals introduced into the environment (e.g., not in a contained laboratory greenhouse or building); and studies or identification of traits which may influence fate and effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

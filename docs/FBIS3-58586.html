			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Major Esko Tavia, detachment field officer, </F> General Staff technical development unit: "Security Policy  Debate Now in Progress Is Getting Nowhere Fast; Basis for  Credible Defense Capability May Crumble"]    [Text] According to the government, Finland intends to  maintain a credible national defense capability. Esko Tavia asks  whether this goal is in keeping with the existing reality and  our prospects for the future.    All of a sudden we get the impression from the discussions  of  the past few days that the country's economy will get back into  shape all at once by giving up the new F-18 Hornet interceptors  that have been ordered for the Armed Forces.    Television current affairs programs, the equipment displayed  in parades, the lines of generals at Independence Day [6  December] celebrations, and the presidential election panels  have probably misled people into thinking that the country,  which is struggling with its economic difficulties, has totally  exaggerated its defense needs.    In trying to cope with the nation's economic difficulties,  there is talk of budget limits and cutting expenditures. Each  of the various business sectors has received a given share of  future budgets on which to base their plans.    The expenditures for the major chief categories of the  national budget are in large part prescribed by law. The  Eduskunta has passed laws in keeping with our world of values.  Our society has evolved through the joint decisions of those who  look after the interests of its different groups.    Our national defense was not separately developed by  promoting some private sphere of interest. Defense policy has  been part of our foreign policy.  <H5>  Defense Committees Have Come Up With Common Approach </H5>   The Armed Forces' mission has been determined by law and the  parliamentary defense committees have provided the directions  and goals for their development. In retrospect, however, we have  to assert that the objectives determined by them have never been  achieved.    The development of Finland's national defense has long been  guided by the tradition that expenditures for defense must  amount to about 1.5 percent of the gross national product. The  only reason for continuing the tradition appears to be the  realization that we cannot afford any more than that.    The reason for the niggardliness cannot be a lack either or  will or of appreciation of the situation. Parliamentary defense  policy debates conducted over the decades demonstrate this.    The defense committees have always come up and agreed on a  common approach. Nevertheless, there has never been an open,  polished analysis in terms of military technology and military  policy like those made in the West, based on their reports.  Recollections of military experiences, the tradition of the  proletariat army, and an active, peace-seeking neutrality policy  currently constitute the basis for our defense decisions.    The security policy debate now in progress is getting  nowhere  fast. Nonalignment and an independent defense sound like mere  empty rhetoric if we adhere closely to the defense expenditure  level of 1.5 percent while the national economy is being  strangled.    Defense policy studies conducted in areas close to our  borders and in West Europe have raised the level of  appropriations for defense in those countries to over 2 percent  of the gross national product.    A rigorous discussion of values is needed now so that we do  not do irreparable damage with shortsighted decisions to cut  expenditures. The present defense policy solution cannot be  changed in the foreseeable future, nor is there any need to  either. The danger lies in the fact that the defense capability  it is based on may crumble very quickly. A parliamentary  committee does not have to be appointed at this point, but it is  urgent that we set in motion a major study to determine our  defense capability.    When considering the order of importance of things, the  foundation pillars of an independent nation's existence, the  provision of external and internal security, should be raised to  their own position. If they totter, it will be hard to imagine  what can be achieved for the rest of the development of the  society with long-range investment. In principle, we can only  see what else we can afford after matters involving our security  are at an at least satisfactory level.    Appropriations for defense accounted for only 5 percent of  this year's budget. This was a drop of about 8 percent from the  funds allocated last year.    Of this 8.7-billion-markka appropriation, 2.7 billion were  used for expenditures for defense equipment. Appropriations will  decrease over the next few years to a point at which we will  only be able to spend about a billion markkas a year on new  fighter aircraft after the mid-1990's. This approaching sharp  drop is not based on need, but on tradition.    It is perfectly clear that all of the Hornets that were  ordered will have to be purchased. Speculations on a reduction  in the number of fighters that have appeared in the press are  irresponsible populism. Our air defense is built on 60  interceptors, or three squadrons. No one can show that a single  one of these is unnecessary given our security environment.  <H5>  Military Technology May Become Unattainable </H5>   Reports on the development of military technology that are  to  be prepared in the not too distant future will show that  appropriations cannot be reduced because of military technology,  but that their present level must be raised to the average  European level.    Suspending development of our ground forces for decades will  give our immediate neighbors an unattainable lead over us. A  decision to increase appropriations for defense to a level  compatible with an independent and credible defense is certainly  a politically difficult one. We must nevertheless now have the  courage to act and bear the responsibility for such a decision.    The technological level and real performance capability of  our immediate neighbors' armed forces is growing so fast that  our present funding level will under no circumstances be high  enough to provide a credible defense by the turn of the century.    The basic question is: Will we defend this country in the  future or not?</p>

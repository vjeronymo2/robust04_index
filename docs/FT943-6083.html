			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll active Turnover in food retailer Argyll Group jumped to 9m in busy trading of the stock after the company announced the sale of 123 of its Lo-Cost outlets and 28 Presto stores for Pounds 39.4m. The shares declined 9 to 307p on a combination of profit-taking after their strong performance last Friday and fears that the sale might dilute earnings per share. One analyst suggested that there could have been disappointment that Argyll had not off-loaded the whole Lo-Cost chain - around 140 stores remain unsold. Mr James Edwardes Jones at Hoare Govett said the sale was bound to be 'mildly dilutive'. However, Mr Bill Myers at Yamaichi took the contrary view and said: 'They have sold the least profitable chunk of the Lo-Cost chain for a fair price and dilution seems exceedingly unlikely.'</p>

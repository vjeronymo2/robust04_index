			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Economics Notebook: Town halls might drag the UK out of recession Do Britain's local authorities hold the key to economic recovery? It appears an unlikely question. But as City analysts have been scaling back their forecasts of growth for this year, some economists and members of Parliament have hit on increased local authority spending as a way of promoting activity. In particular, the influential all-party House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee (TCSC) believes local authorities should be allowed to spend more of the receipts they accumulated, from the sale of council houses and other property, on capital investment. At present, the use of such funds is strictly controlled by the Treasury as part of the government's policy of keeping a lid on public spending. The TCSC is well qualified to comment on the issue. It reviews the government's spending plans each year. In recent months it has also been investigating the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. While scrutinising the losses of those local authorities which were unwise enough to leave large deposits with BCCI, it also unearthed figures showing that the sums placed by local authorities with financial institutions are very large indeed.* The committee heard that local authorities had 'just short of Pounds 8bn' invested with financial institutions - against the Pounds 10.2bn of spending that local authorities will determine for themselves and finance through poll tax receipts in the current financial year. While investigating BCCI, the TCSC carried out its regular inquiry into the government's Autumn Statement**. This found that local authority capital expenditure rose significantly in the years to 1989-90, when it totalled Pounds 10.5bn, and then fell sharply to Pounds 7.7bn in 1990-91. Such spending is due to amount to Pounds 7.8bn in the current financial year, according to Mr Terry Ward, an economist and one of the committee's specialist advisers. The committee noted that 'an important element of public sector capital spending' had therefore 'reached a peak when the economy has been at its strongest and fallen when activity has reduced'. It recommended changes so that local authority capital spending 'does not compete with the private sector during years of higher growth, but assists its suppliers such as the construction industry when growth is below trend'. At first glance there seems nothing more sensible than using some of the Pounds 8bn of local authority cash slumbering in the banks for public spending projects that could boost the economy. Mr Terence Higgins MP, the TCSC chairman and a former Treasury minister, has suggested such a course on condition that any such spending should be for a limited period of perhaps 18 months. He cites the case of his Worthing constituency, which needs to buy two tractors to help remove seaweed from the beach but which, it seems, cannot make the investment under current government rules on public spending. Releasing funds for similar blocked spending by local authorities throughout the country could make a difference to the economy, he believes. Mr Higgins points out that the recession has gone on longer than the chancellor hoped. All the evidence points to people taking advantage of lower interest rates to pay off debt rather than increase their spending. There is little to suggest that consumers will respond any differently to last week's mortgage rate cuts or any income tax reductions in the Budget. But public spending questions in Britain are rarely simple. According to the Treasury, it is open to question whether the local authorities have a right to spend much of the Pounds 8bn they have on deposit. These deposits have arisen in spite of government restrictions which insist that 75 per cent of receipts from the sale of housing and 50 per cent of other capital receipts should be used for the redemption of debt or in lieu of future borrowing. It is unclear how much cash would be available for capital investment if all local authority debts were paid. When asked last week, the Treasury said that the amount could be 'between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 8bn'. What the Treasury did make clear was its strong opposition to any extra spending by local authorities beyond that agreed in the last annual public expenditure round. A spokesman insisted last week that there were no grounds at present to relax public spending policies by allowing the authorities to spend some of their banked funds. Such a move would loosen the government's fiscal stance. It would also risk channelling funds into areas of low spending priority. Releasing local authority funds could not boost the resources needed by British Rail or London Transport, for example. 'Local authorities do little infrastructure spending apart from housing,' the spokesman said, 'and would housing be a government priority?' So it looks as if there can be no unblocking of local authority funds to stimulate growth without a change of heart by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. But the large sums deposited by the local authorities with financial institutions have helped focus attention on the oddities of Britain's public spending policy. Even those who fear greater spending by local authorities believe there is a case for the government to accelerate some public spending. Professor Douglas McWilliams, the economic adviser of the Confederation of British Industry, says the public sector is quite likely to underspend its overall budget for capital projects this year by about Pounds 500m because the penalties for going over budget are severe. The government should therefore do everything possible to make sure that spending plans are carried out to the full. Mr Higgins would like to see the chancellor adopt a more flexible approach to fiscal policy and use the March Budget to raise public spending if necessary rather than concentrate solely on taxation. 'If you find the forecast has gone wrong, it may be more sensible to say let's use public spending to correct it instead of tax,' he says. Such a move would be a significant break with Conservative government practice since 1979. But it might help Mr Lamont to fulfil his ambition of entering the history books as a fiscal reformer. *Treasury and Civil Service Committee. Second Report.

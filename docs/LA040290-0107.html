			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> PACT TO RESTORE OLD THEATER COMING UP  </P> <P> After months of negotiations, an agreement to restore and reopen the Fox  Fullerton Theatre will come before the City Council on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for the city to build a 200-space parking structure behind  the Fox in exchange for the owner's spending up to $1.55 million to restore the  65-year-old theater.  </P> <P> It has been considered a city landmark, and its reopening is part of the city's  goal of attracting more people downtown in the evenings.  </P> <P> The Fox closed in a state of disrepair in 1987 and since has sat empty on  Harbor Boulevard.  </P> <P> The new owner, Edward G. Lewis, an attorney in Hollywood, asked the city last  year for help in reopening the Fox.  </P> <P> The agreement, which the council will consider signing after a public hearing  Tuesday, spells out how the Fox must be restored and what the city will do to  help the theater reopen. Plans call for the balcony to be walled off and the  theater converted to two smaller screens. The city will require that murals,  decorative ceilings, fixtures and the proscenium be restored.  </P> <P> Lewis has signed an agreement with Landmark Theatre Corp. of Los Angeles to  restore and operate the Fox. Landmark has said it will show art and foreign  films, as well as movies aimed at families.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for the city to buy the necessary land behind the theater,  relocate renters now living there and build a parking structure. The city also  has plans to buy a closed mortuary nearby to allow better access to the parking  structure.  </P> <P> The city's cost is estimated at $4.1 million. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

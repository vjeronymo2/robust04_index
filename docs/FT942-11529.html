			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Major acts to protect balance of European manifesto Mr John Major has rejected calls from the right of the Tory party to recast in distinctly Euro-sceptic terms the government's manifesto for the June 9 European elections. Instead, the latest Downing Street version retains the careful compromises set out in the original draft written by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. It marks a significant setback for the party's anti-Europeans. Last night Mr Hurd reinforced the message in a letter to party activists pledging to mount a 'positive' campaign emphasising the need for European economic growth and employment. The latest manifesto draft, which will be subject to only minor changes before its publication on May 18, has been shortened to give it a sharper edge. But the careful balance of the original - seen by Mr Hurd as essential to preserve the peace between the pro- and anti-European factions in the Tory party during the run-up to the elections - has not been upset. It sticks firmly to a neutral line on participation in a single European currency - the subject of the latest Tory infighting over Europe. Earlier this week, Mr Major rebuked Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, for voicing opposition to economic and monetary union. The manifesto underlines the prime minister's insistence that parliament will take the decision only if and when Britain's partners move to a single currency. It stresses that Britain will not return to the European exchange rate mechanism in the foreseeable future but leaves open the possibility of participation at some stage in a reformed ERM. The central themes of the manifesto - the case for a decentralised, deregulated, open and competitive European Union - are designed to draw maximum support from the Tory backbenches. It underlines also the commitment to maintain Britain's veto in EU decision-making, to maintain Nato as a central pillar of European defence, and to preserve the present intergovernmental basis for foreign policy co-ordination. Mr Major hopes the contrast between those pledges and the alleged commitment to a European 'superstate' of Labour and the Liberal Democrats will suppress the Tory party's internal divisions during the campaign. But the manifesto flatly rejects the demand of hard-line sceptics that Britain consider disengaging from the EU if its partners press for greater integration at the intergovernmental conference due in 1996.

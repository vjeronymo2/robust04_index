A high-ranking Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that what President al-Asad proposes at the Geneva summit  meeting will be the most important factor for the establishment  of full peace in the region and that U.S. President Bill Clinton  would not have requested the meeting with President al-Asad had  he not been strongly convinced that the Syrian demands  representing all Arab rights are just and that the forthcoming  peace will not be a fragile peace but a genuine, firm, and  strong peace that will provide security and prosperity for the  region.    The Syrian official said that President al-Asad will carry  with him a complete peace document not about liberation of the  Golan and Syrian-Israeli peace but about liberation of the  accupied Arab territories and restoration of rights. He added  that when President al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher and in his contacts with President Clinton, he  repeated the same position, namely that peace is an indivisible  integral whole and cannot be achieved in some parts to the  exclusion of other parts, and that the Gaza-Jericho agreement  was the best proof exposing Israel's lack of interest in peace  except on its own terms and in fulfillment of its own objectives.    The Syrian official said that Syria's aim is to preserve the  unified Arab position of the frontline states in the face of  future challenges because Israel continues to change the  realities on the ground, showing no interest in progress that  would lead to a just and lasting peace. The Syrian official  added that the current Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination is  important in case the bilateral peace negotiations are resumed.    The senior Syrian official said that the Geneva summit is a  major turning point in U.S.-Syrian relations and that the summit  and its results will determine whether or not a just peace is  possible. Perhaps the changes in U.S.-Syrian relations and the  U.S. emphasis on Syria's central role in the peace process have  made Israeli very resentful and aroused its concern because  Rabin cannot walk away from the clear concept of peace to be  proposed by Syria in Geneva, otherwise he would lose the  justification for his continuation in power.    Syria, the Syrian official said, insists on complete  withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon, and the  al-Asad-Clinton summit will witness a Syrian position pressing  for a revival of Resolution 425 on Israeli withdrawal from  southern Lebanon. That, he said, confirms the credibility of  Syria's position on Lebanon and shows that Syria cannot possibly  barter Lebanese territory, not even a single grain of Lebanese  soil, in return for the restoration of its own territory  whatever its size. By taking that stance, Syria will pave the  way for Lebanese diplomacy in the next phase of peace  negotiations.    Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has expressed full  satisfaction with the results of his talks and consultations in  Damascus with President Hafiz al-Asad at a meeting lasting three  hours. Lebanese sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the  consultation channels between Damascus and Beirut will remain  open at the highest levels until the moment President Hafiz  al-Asad leaves Damascus on his peace trip to Geneva to submit  the Syrian Arab demands in strong terms.    The Lebanese sources quoted Prime Minister al-Hariri as  saying that President al-Asad reaffirmed Syria's support and  backing for Lebanon in all fields to enable it to fully regain  its health and liberate its territory from Israeli occupation,  emphasizing that Syria will never abandon Lebanon and leave it  alone in the arena. President al-Asad also expressed support for  the Lebanese Government and continuation of the current  political situation with no changes until the processes of  peace, accord, and reconstruction are completed. He also  stressed that Syria will never abandon its demand and insistence  on the implementation of Resolution 425 and Israeli withdrawal.  [passage omitted]</p>

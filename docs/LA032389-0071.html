			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGEMENT TEAM QUITS DEAL TO RUN BELL CARD CLUB  </P> <P> With city officials close to completing their purchase of the California Bell  Casino, a management group that agreed to handle day-to-day operations has  suddenly pulled out of the deal.  </P> <P> The breakdown of the 4-month-old pact with California Casino Properties Inc. --  led by several veteran casino operators -- was announced this week after the  management group failed to make a good-faith deposit of $1.2 million, City  Administrator John Bramble said. The deposit was supposed to have been made by  March 15.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Didn't Want to Go Forward'  </P> <P> "They kind of backed out of the deal," Bramble said on Tuesday. "They just felt  that given their financial position, they did not want to go forward."  </P> <P> City officials had been on the brink of scheduling a bond issue that would have  raised an estimated $7.1 million to pay off the beleaguered card club's  creditors and a block of limited partners, Bramble said. The bond issue was the  last hurtle in the city's 18-month effort to take over the club so it might  again provide a steady flow of tax revenue, he said.  </P> <P> "It was technically a default," Bramble said. Members of the management group  forfeited a $10,000 deposit after claiming that the signed operating agreement  would not prove as profitable as they had hoped, Bramble said.  </P> <P> "(The breakdown) was pretty much on friendly terms," Bramble said.  </P> <P> City officials said they intend to proceed with the casino purchase. But they  acknowledge that the transition will probably be delayed by at least two months  as they search for a new club operator.  </P> <P> "If we are not back to square one," Mayor George G. Mirabal said, "we are  pretty close to it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, casino attorney Howard Manning said the club's current owners are  "disappointed that this (takeover) process is taking so long."  </P> <P> He said the general partners -- California Bell Club Management -- are  considering keeping the club if the city cannot close a deal soon.  </P> <P> "The time has dragged on quite a long time," Manning said. "This is to the  detriment of the club. The question as to what lies in the future for the  California Bell Club has had a negative effect on the club's operation."  </P> <P> Mirabal said that city officials have begun negotiating with three other  management groups.  </P> <P> "We want to move on this fairly quickly," Mirabal said.  </P> <P> "We're just as strongly resolved today as we were a year ago," Mirabal  continued. "You cannot ignore how lucrative the tax is on the casinos." He  declined to name the other management groups, but said they were not from any  of the other, more profitable casinos in neighboring cities.  </P> <P> Mirabal said California Casino Properties backed out of the pact largely  because of a "black cloud hanging over the head" of pai-gow, a high-stakes  Asian game that generates as much as 25% of the revenue of area card clubs, but  that may soon be outlawed by the state.  </P> <P> Bob Bernstein, an attorney for the management group, declined comment this  week. But at a recent City Council meeting, the lawyer said his clients were  concerned about the uncertain future of the controversial Asian game.  </P> <P> Pai-gow and two similar Asian card games are played at all seven Southland card  clubs, but their legal status has been challenged in the courts by the Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Deputies contend that the games violate the century-old state gambling law  because they allow the dealer to enjoy a slight advantage over the other  players.  </P> <P> A coalition of city managers from Bell, Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, Commerce  and Gardena -- where the clubs are located -- are supporting a bill that would  update the state law, outlaw pai-gow, but permit the other games, Asian poker  and super pan 9.  </P> <P> Officials of California Casino Properties also expressed fear that rising bond  interest rates would have lowered the group's profit margin, city officials  said.  </P> <P> The operating agreement called for the $7.1-million bond issue to be paid back  from the club's gross receipts. The management group would have received a  percentage of whatever was left -- so the higher the bond interest, the smaller  their profit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Profits Are Down  </P> <P> And these days, the California Bell Casino's profits are far from what they  used to be. The club opened to standing-room-only crowds in 1980 and once  generated about $2 million in annual tax revenues and fees for the city.  </P> <P> But in recent years, other casinos have opened in Huntington Park, Commerce and  Bell Gardens, giving the Bell club stiff competition. Now, the city receives  only a small fraction of that $2-million high, Bramble said.  </P> <P> The Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens, the largest card club in the state, is less  than two miles from the California Bell Casino, located in the industrial  section of the city.  </P> <P> California Bell operators have complained that the glitzier Bicycle Club, run  by Cathedral City Mayor George Hardie, has lured thousands of gamblers from the  California Bell Club.  </P> <P> City officials moved to take over the Bell club in September, 1987, after it  became mired in a series of financial and legal problems as well as a bitter  dispute between shareholders.  </P> <P> Officials agreed to pay the club's general partners the $7.1-million to be  raised by the sale of development bonds.  </P> <P> But officials have run into several snags in their attempt to find a suitable  management team to handle day-to-day operations.  </P> <P> Negotiations between the city and Southwest Gaming of Las Vegas fell apart last  year after that management group became involved in a criminal profit-skimming  investigation that also touched some of the Bell club's general partners.  </P> <P> On March 3, several members of Southwest Gaming were charged with conspiracy to  commit grand theft and attempted grand theft, said Los Angeles County Deputy  Dist. Atty. David Conn.  </P> <P> Casino operators Don Speers, Michael Riordan, John Vukasian and James Salerno  were arraigned in Los Angeles Municipal Court and released on an unspecified  amount of bail, Conn said. Southwest Gaming acted as a consultant to the Bell  Club, casino attorney Manning said.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed, however, against the general partners of the Bell  casino, Conn said. The investigation is continuing, he added.  </P></p>

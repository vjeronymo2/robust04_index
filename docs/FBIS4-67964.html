			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Apr (EFE) -- In a final declaration  issued at the end of the fourth meeting of foreign ministers,  the Rio Group and the EU today agreed to call for a total ban on  nuclear tests in the world and condemned every form of terrorism.    Regarding their commitment to disarmament and to  nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the  participants of the fourth Rio Group-EU ministerial meeting  expressed their complete agreement in condemning every form of  nuclear testing.    The Sao Paulo Declaration, which was approved by 13 foreign  ministers of the Rio Group and representatives of the EU member  countries, states: ``The ministers (of the Rio Group and the  EU) agree on proposing the signing of a multilateral treaty that  would impose a total ban on nuclear tests and would be fully  verifiable.''    In the Sao Paulo Declaration, the Rio Group and the EU also  expressed their total condemnation of terrorism.    The declaration states: ``The ministers...condemn without  reservations -- as an unjustifiable crime--every act of  terrorism, irrespective of who perpetrates them, where, or why,  because acts of terrorism endanger and claim the lives of human  beings. They also undermine human dignity and are a threat to  democracy and to a state of law.''    The ministerial meeting between the Rio Group and the EU is  the fourth since bilateral talks were institutionalized by the  Rome Declaration (1990). The meeting, which is being held at  the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) building in the city  of Sao Paulo, is scheduled to close on 23 April but the final  declaration was released today.    In addition to condemning nuclear tests, the Rio Group-EU  ministers praised the ``recent progress made in consolidating  the regime for a total ban on nuclear weapons in Latin America  and the Caribbean as established in the Tlatelolco Treaty.''    The declaration also expressed support for the Convention  Banning the Development, Production, Storage, and Use of  Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction, and revealed their  resolve to adopt specific measures to fully implement the  Convention on Biological Weapons.    The Rio Group and the EU also voiced their desire to  cooperate to give openness to international arms trade.    The latter point was specifically requested by Andean  countries like Colombia, which has been affected by arms  trafficking financed by narcotrafficking and terrorist  organizations.    The two blocs' representatives agreed to promote a UN  Registry of Conventional Weapons with a view to effectively  controlling arms possession around the world.    In the Sao Paulo Declaration, which consists of 19 points  focusing on economic and political issues, the Rio Group and the  EU reaffirm their respect for democracy and the principles of  free trade.    The Rio Group and the EU also have agreed to define a new  model of bilateral relations in which the Latin American  countries would have greater participation in various  international issues such as world security and the reform of  the UN Charter.    The Latin American countries also expressed their concern  about the social, environmental, and labor conditions some  European nations are starting to impose on their trade with  developing countries.    The continuation and expansion of the Generalized System of  Preferences (GSP), which expires this year and regulates trade  between the EU and Latin American countries, was another request  made by the Rio Group that was included in the final declaration.    The Sao Paulo meeting was attended by all of the foreign  ministers of the Rio Group--which consists of Argentina,  Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay,  Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Attending the meeting as  observers were the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and  Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America,  respectively.    The EU was represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and  Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos,  who is vice president of the EU; deputy ministers; and deputy  ministers of the other members of the ``Group of 12'' (Denmark,  Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg,  the Netherlands, and France).</p>

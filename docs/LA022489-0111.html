			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUONO CHALLENGE TO VOID MURDER CONVICTION FAILS  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to set aside the conviction of  Angelo Buono in the grisly murders of nine young women in the Hillside  Strangler case.  </P> <P> The justices, in a brief order, declined to hear Buono's challenge to a ruling  last November by a state Court of Appeal that rejected his contention he had  been denied a fair trial.  </P> <P> Buono was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 1977 and 1978  murders. His cousin and accomplice, Kenneth Bianchi, pleaded guilty to five of  the murders and two other killings in Washington and is serving a life sentence  in that state.  </P> <P> In other criminal cases Thursday, the state high court upheld the death  sentences of two convicted murderers, including one case in which the  prosecution removed all blacks, Asians and Jews from the panel of prospective  jurors.  </P> <P> The justices, by a vote of 5 to 2, affirmed the sentence of Andrew Edward  Robertson for the stabbing deaths of two young women in San Bernardino County  in 1977. The court in 1982 had overturned a previous sentence of death and  ordered a new penalty trial for Robertson.  </P> <P> In another 5-2 decision, the court upheld the conviction and sentence of James  Willis Johnson for the murder of a Milpitas jewelry store owner during a 1980  robbery.  </P> <P> The court, in a majority opinion by Justice Edward A. Panelli, rejected  Johnson's contention that the prosecution improperly removed minority jurors  from the case, depriving him of the right to trial by a jury reflecting a fair  cross-section of the community.  </P> <P> Under previous rulings by the state high court and the U.S. Supreme Court,  challenges to any prospective jurors are permissible, so long as they are made  on individual grounds and do not reflect bias against an entire racial or  religious group.  </P> <P> The justices upheld the trial judge's finding that the prosecution had offered  acceptable reasons for excusing each of the jurors for specific reasons, such  as apparent prejudice against policemen or disapproval of the death penalty.  </P> <P> However, in an unusual 83-page dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk, joined by Justice  Allen E. Broussard, said the majority was retreating from previous rulings  designed to guard against group bias in jury selection. Mosk urged Johnson's  lawyers to press the issue in further appeals to the federal courts.  </P> <P> Mosk noted that the prosecutor, in defending his challenge to four Jewish  jurors, had denied prejudice by asserting, among other things, that he had  often entertained Jews in his home and that "some of the more diligent  prosecutors in our office" are Jews.  </P> <P> "This ritual recitation of the hoary excuse, 'Some of my best friends are  Jewish,' is obviously insufficient as a matter of law," Mosk observed.  </P> <P> In the Buono case, lawyers for the defendant contended that the appellate court  improperly rejected his challenge to the credibility of testimony by Bianchi  that implicated Buono.  </P> <P> The appeal panel found that Bianchi's testimony was "abundantly corroborated"  by independent evidence that was sufficient itself to support Buono's  conviction.  </P> <P> The panel, in an opinion by Appellate Justice Lynn D. Compton, conceded that it  might seem improbable that anyone could be capable of the brutality of the  crimes at issue.  </P> <P> "Yet it is certain that Bianchi and one other person were so capable," wrote  Compton. "Once such a premise is accepted, and its validity is neither  challenged nor rationally susceptible to challenge on the record before us, the  probability that (Buono) was that other person is an essentially inescapable  conclusion."  </P> <P> Lawyers for Buono, noting that 1,300 pages of briefs had been filed before the  appeal court, said the panel, in its 29-page opinion, had "not adequately or  fairly addressed" virtually any of the issues raised by Buono.  </P></p>

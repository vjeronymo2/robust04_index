			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Strength in car sector fails to support Dow Wall Street US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range either side of opening values throughout the day yesterday in the wake of a mixed batch of corporate earnings and some positive economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 7.83 down at 3,664.66. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.31 at 464.61 and the American SE composite firmed 1.42 to 475.06. The best performance came from the Nasdaq composite, which rallied after days of heavy profit-taking to close 6.42 ahead at 771.88. NYSE volume was 279.8m shares. With share prices at or near record highs, investors continue to trade cautiously, fearful of pushing stocks into previously unexplored territory without strong backing from healthy economic or earnings fundamentals. On the economic front, there was some good news yesterday in the form of the September durable goods orders report. The Commerce Department reported that orders rose 0.7 per cent last month. Although broadly in line with economists' expectations, the figures showed that excluding the depressed transportation component, orders actually rose 1.5 per cent in September. The data are in line with a series of recent figures which have pointed to a gradual improvement in the pace of domestic economic activity. Corporate earnings news, however, was mixed, with a handful of the biggest industrial groups in the country reporting varied performances for the third quarter. The best showing of the day came from Ford, which announced third-quarter net income of 79 cents a share, a sharp turnround from the year ago 66 cents a share loss. Ford put on Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 60 1/4 in volume of 5.1m shares, and the buying spread to other car stocks, General Motors rising Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 46 7/8 and Chrysler Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55 3/8 . While Ford prospered, other blue chip companies reported poor earnings. Eastman Kodak posted a third-quarter loss and warned investors not to expect record profits for 1994. The stock initially fell on the news, but rebounded to end a net Dollars  7/8 up at Dollars 58 3/4 . Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 103 1/2 after revealing net income of Dollars 1.47 a share, against Dollars 1.48 earned in the same quarter a year ago. Other big cyclical stocks were also weaker. Canada TORONTO set a record high in fairly busy trading as the market continued its post-election rally. The TSE 300 index added 10.3 to close at 4,197.5. Rises led falls by 474 to 295 after volume of 61.6m shares.</p>

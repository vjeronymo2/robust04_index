			<p>CSO     [Text] If approved by the Majles, telephone rates will  increase. This is the good news that Seyyed Mohammad Gharazi,  the Islamic Republic's minister of post, telegraph and  telephone, gave in a speech on the occasion of World  Communications Day for the information of those present and  journalists (telephone rates for calling outside the country  also increased recently).    Gharazi said: Based on a bill, which has been presented to  the Majles, telephone fees, depending on how large or small the  city, will increase between 2 rials [R] and R4 per pulse.    He also promised that by the end of this year [20 March  1995]  the delivery of telephones to applicants will take a day or a  month at the most.    In justifying the huge increase in postal rates, the Islamic  Republic's minister of post, telegraph and telephone said: In  this area expert work has been under way for five years in the  Plan and Budget Organization and two years in the General  Assembly, the Board of Directors and the Council of Ministers,  and finally this increase in price was approved by the Majles  along with the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Law.    It is necessary to explain that the Majles authorized  increasing postal costs a maximum of 50 percent, but the  Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone increased the postal  rates several times over.    Gharazi added: A 50-percent discount has been provided for  postal services to the press and publications.    He said: Production, supplies, and communications equipment  inside the country have reached a very suitable state, so that  70 percent of the nation's domestic communications needs are  being met.</p>

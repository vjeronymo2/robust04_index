			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolaos Kiaos] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's decision to  place sanctions on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] has somewhat postponed deliberations within  the government and PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] on the  various groups' gathering forces for PASOK's congress. These  deliberations have been going on for some time now.    Government and party officials view this congress as the one  preceding the succession of Papandreou and see it as an  important one for the future direction of PASOK. A crucial  factor in developments is the health of National Economy and  Finance Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas, who has apparently been  forced to withdraw from the contest. A large gap has apparently  been created, because he was considered the favorite in the  contest to succeed Papandreou.    Yennimatas' health gave an opportunity to other "hopefuls"  for this position within the government to assert their views  and policies on the current economic policy and, thus,  automatically appear as possible successors.    Some of the names mentioned include Alternate National  Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou and PASOK Deputy Ioannis  Pottakis. However, only Commerce and Industry Minister  Konstandinos Simitis can be considered to be politically close  to Yennimatas; he is probably excluded because he does not want  to move to Sindagma Square [government headquarters].    PASOK officials' interests are centered on the congress.  Through their moves, which began some time ago, they seek to  gain favor with party organizations and, if possible, gain  friendly delegates at the congress.    Reports note that Interior Minister Akis Tzokhatzopoulos,  who  is secretary of PASOK's Central Committee, has had, until now,  sufficient support and access to all organizations.    National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis is far behind  and  does not have access to all organizations. Furthermore, his  past also works against him because he was once removed from  PASOK.    A decisive role in developments will be played by the many  people closely associated to Yennimatas. Their interest, of  course, is centered on the alliances that will be formed before  the congress.    Konstandinos Laliotis; environment, town planning, and  public  works minister; does not appear to have any such aspirations.  It should also be noted that he frequently differs with  Tzokhatzopoulos on issues such as public works and flood  prevention.    As things stand right now, it is estimated that the contest  will be between Tzokhatzopoulos and Simitis.    Anyway, the road is still long and the stance of Papandreou,  who controls the time when succession will be discussed, will  certainly be decisive.    It is a well-known secret that from Maximos Palace,  Papandreou looks at the presidential palace next door with  interest. The distance, anyway, is small....</p>

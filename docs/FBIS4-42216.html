			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["fdo" report: "Lack of Money Makes Scientists' Work More </F> Difficult"]    [Text] Bonn, 28-29 May -- The Federal Government wants to  expand cooperation with Russia in the field of research. Bernd  Neumann (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state  secretary in the Research Ministry, said that cooperation  projects in research and development are profitable for both  sides.    Neumann announced that during his government talks, which  will begin in Moscow on Monday [30 May], three new technical  agreements are to be concluded on water and environmental  research as well as on biotechnology. In addition, the final  discussion about an agreement on ocean and polar research is  planned. Particularly in the fields of space flight, ocean and  polar research, and laser technology Russian scientists have  large know-how. An outstanding example for successful  cooperation in space flight is the joint development with Japan  of the "Express" retrievable space capsule.    At the international level, Germany is involved in the  International Economic and Technology Center in Moscow, which  was founded at the initiative of the German foreign minister and  the U.S. secretary of state. The institute is to open up new  opportunities of employment to Russian scientists, who have so  far worked in weapons development. The international  association for the promotion of cooperation with scientists  form the independent states of the former Soviet Union (INTAS)  in Brussels, which works in the civilian sector and has the same  goal, is also supported by Germany beyond its contribution to  the European Union.    At the national level Bonn will spend about 37.5 million  marks [DM] by the end of 1994 for a science support program,  which was initiated in 1992. In addition, Russian scientists  are involved in more than 100 projects for technical programs,  which are financed by the Research Ministry with DM240 million.</p>

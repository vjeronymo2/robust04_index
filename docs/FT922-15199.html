			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Price explosion hits war-worn Serbia THE inhabitants of Serbia awoke yesterday to the news that their government, under President Slobodan Milosevic, had admitted that inflation could reach an annual rate of 100,000 per cent. 'Our rate of inflation is the highest in the world', declared a bold headline in Politika, the Serbian daily. 'It could hit 100,000 per cent by this month.' The soaring rate of inflation is bringing home to Serbs the price of the seven-month war against Croatia. Many factories have stopped production and industrial output has fallen by more than 30 per cent in relation to the already low levels of last year. While the federal government is still servicing its foreign debt of Dollars 16bn (Pounds 9.2bn), many economists doubt Yugoslavia will be able to keep up payments. 'It is no longer a question of 'if' but 'when' the payments stop,' says one diplomat. 'The federal reserves are officially put at Dollars 1.95bn (Pounds 1.12bn), commercial reserves are at Dollars 500m - but these are collateralised. Free reserves are at zero,' he said. The only flourishing sector is the black market in hard currency. Desperate to keep pace with the plummeting dinar, shopkeepers change some prices twice a day. A family which just a year ago earned an average monthly wage equal to DM1,000 (Pounds 350) has seen their combined income fall to the equivalent of DM100. Hundreds of Serbs last month gathered in the centre of Belgrade to demonstrate their despair at the soaring prices by offering their babies up for adoption to Mr Milosevic. Mrs Maja Vujovic, the mother of 18 month-old Marko, said: 'I make 24,000 dinars, a month's supply of Pampers nappies costs more than my salary.' The average monthly wage for factory workers amounts to Dollars 30 on the black market. It would take a worker 13 years to buy a no-frills Yugo car manufactured in Serbia. Mr Dragan Stosic, a factory worker, said: 'My monthly wage is 16,000 dinars (Pounds 20). My head aches from the fear of how I will be able to feed my family of four after I've paid out rent.' Farmers have also seen inflation erode the prices they receive for their crops. Mr Dusko Vasic, a peasant from Pozarevac, the birthplace of Mr Milosevic, says: 'From sunrise to sunset, my entire family farms our 10 hectares.' Two years ago 100kg of beans sold for Pounds 48, but inflation means the price in real terms has fallen to Pounds 11.50. Observers have long predicted that the collapsing economy would touch off a tidal wave of social unrest. But the government has so far succeeded, in the eyes of most Serbs, in deflecting blame for the economic situation on to Croat leaders and the west. It has hinted at a programme of economic reform, but last year it was instrumental in undermining the market reforms of Mr Ante Markovic, the former prime minister. Mr Miroljub Labus, an economist, points out: 'The Serbian government is busy drawing new borders, claiming that their anti-inflation programme cannot be implemented until the state is clearly defined. . . We should not expect any programme in the next couple of months.' The presidents of the six sparring ex-Yugoslav republics agreed yesterday to work towards restoring trade and infrastructure links in a move that may increase pressure on the EC to remove its sanctions on Serbia, writes David Buchan in Brussels. After a low-key session of the EC-sponsored peace conference, its chairman, Lord Carrington, also hailed as progress the fact that leaders of Bosnia's Moslem, Serb and Croat communities agreed not to renege on their March 18 accord to negotiate a new constitution despite continuing violence . For the first time since the conference started last September, republican leaders appear to be taking seriously the need to patch up their collapsing economies.</p>

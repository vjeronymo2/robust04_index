			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> THE SAUDI MONARCHY'S PARANOIA RULES OUT DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL ARMY CAPABLE  OF DEFENDING THE COUNTRY. ;  </P> <P> THE BILLION-DOLLAR TWO-BIT ARMY  </P> <P> Along with the daunting problems of logistics and desert heat, the American  military command now on the ground in Saudi Arabia must also face the grim  realities of its new partner -- the Saudi army.  </P> <P> Since 1974, Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars building a defense  Establishment, while knowing that it could never fight a war. The backbone of  the kingdom's defense strategy lay in reliance on the American commitment to  the survival of an independent Saudi Arabia. With a relatively small population  of men eligible for military service, the kingdom must defend 872,722 square  miles, three coastlines and a northern border void of any natural defenses that  stretches the width of the Arabian peninsula. But Saudi Arabia's defense  problems go even deeper, into the very nature of its society and political  system.  </P> <P> More than a nation, Saudi Arabia is a fragile collection of fiercely  independent individuals who resist incorporation into institutions. Culturally,  Saudis are deeply marked by the Bedouin ethos, which holds that a man bows to  no master, not even his government. The Saudis have lived within a state only  since 1924, when the Bedouin army of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud finally subdued Mecca  and the Western coastal plain and declared the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. With no  fiscal resources with which to build a nation, Abdul Aziz brought the Bedouins  of the desert and the merchants of the towns together through a series of loose  alliances built on religious orthodoxy and the monarch's own 300 marriages into  the kingdom's major families. Relationships with the ruler were personal, not  institutional. Loyalty of the highly independent Saudis resided within their  individual families. And identity remained with a specific region of this vast  and vacant county.  </P> <P> For the House of Saud, the system worked. The king ruled by drawing the people  into the political system through their tribal chieftains and religious  leaders. With the 1973 oil embargo, Saudi Arabia transformed economically but  not politically. Rather than modernizing the political system through power  sharing, the House of Saud simply turned its network of alliances into a golden  pipeline through which the largess of the oil bonanza flowed to the citizenry.  Dispensing electricity, water wells, housing, education, health care, grants  and loans, the House of Saud held power unto itself.  </P> <P> In order to insure its survival, the House of Saud fine-tuned its unique  military structure. The military is constituted of two distinct parts: the  regular forces -- army, navy and air -- whose mission is to defend the country  against foreign threats, and the national guard, armed with sophisticated  weapons and trained largely by former U.S. military men, which is charged with  protecting the House of Saud against coups originating within the regular armed  forces. The 25,000-man guard is drawn from the descendants of those who fought  in Abdul Aziz's Bedouin army. Their loyalty lays within the old tribal  alliances through which the first Saud ruled.  </P> <P> The regular military, perhaps 50,000 men, is drawn out of the urban classes and  from those with ambition but no family ties to the House of Saud. With  attractive salaries and special privileges, the military forms one of Saudi  Arabia's new elite. But beneath the uniforms and outside the plush officers'  clubs, the defense Establishment lives under the cloud of the ruling family's  paranoia.The top positions are held by members of the royal family. Non-royal  brigade commanders and wing commanders are constantly shuffled to prevent the  development of personal attachments between officers and men. For non-royals,  initiative or efficiency elicits attention and arouses suspicion of clandestine  motives, blocking the way to further promotion. Thus an armed force equipped  with the best from the world's arms manufacturers atrophies as an organization.  </P> <P> The rivalry between the guard and the regular force can be crippling in a  crisis. When they were called into action in 1979 to dislodge religious  fanatics who had seized the Grand Mosque at Mecca, competition among units  paralyzed operations against the rebels. Order was restored only after the  royal minister of defense arrived on the scene to personally take command.  </P> <P> The House of Saud always understood the Saudis' fundamental resistance to the  organization and discipline required by a national army. It also understood the  weakness of its military structure, but was unwilling to sacrifice its own  security to build as effective a defense force as its limited population could  create. Instead, Saudi Arabia's rulers adopted in 1974 what remains its basic  plan of defense: Rush all available manpower to a handful of fortified  locations and hold on until the Americans arrive.  </P> <P> The Americans have now arrived. In this joint operation with incalculable  risks, they will have to work with the Saudi defense force as it is.  </P></p>

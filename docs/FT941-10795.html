			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Joint venture to build offices in central Leeds announced A joint venture to build up to 400,000 sq ft of offices in central Leeds was announced yesterday by the quoted property company British Land and Leeds City Development Company, a developer part-owned by Leeds City Council. The development is on a three-acre site adjacent to Leeds City railway station. The site was a former tram maintenance shed and is now being used as a car park. The Leeds City Development Company bought the bulk of the land from the council in 1989. The development is intended to expand the central business core southwards to link up with new development alongside the River Aire. Work on the first phase of the development is expected to begin once the scheme has been granted detailed planning consent.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Roads spending spree denied THE DEPARTMENT of Transport yesterday sought to play down suggestions that a pan-European road network recently agreed by the European Union would lead to large-scale spending on new roads in the UK. Mr Robert Key, roads minister, said there was no financial commitment by the UK government to fund improvements to the road network as part of the Trans European Road Network. He was speaking at the conference of the Permanent International Association of Roads Congresses. The EU Council of Ministers last month approved the designation of a 50,000-kilometre road network in Europe of which nearly one-quarter would require new building or improvement.</p>

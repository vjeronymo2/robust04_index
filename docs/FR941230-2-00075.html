			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. In the world distilled spirits market, production and distribution of most distilled spirits are controlled by several large international conglomerates. These conglomerates own the companies that produce most of the distilled spirits available in the world market, and each conglomerate offers a portfolio of products from the various distilled spirits categories. The conglomerates produce or handle the worldwide distribution of most of the distilled spirits sold in the Virgin Islands, and in 1991 their products accounted for approximately 64% of all distilled spirits sold in the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. In the world distilled spirits market, liquor suppliers often grant exclusive distribution rights to wholesalers. In the Virgin Islands, Topa and other wholesalers generally hold exclusive distribution rights for the distilled spirits that they sell. The distribution rights usually are limited to the Virgin Islands. Topa has the exclusive Virgin Islands distribution rights to almost every popular brand of distilled spirits available in the world market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Exclusive distribution rights for the most popular brands of distilled spirits, including those brands forming the portfolios of the large international distilled spirits conglomerates, are important to the success of a Virgin Islands distilled spirits wholesaler. A significant entrant in the Virgin Islands wholesale distilled spirits market would need the rights to distribute the products of one or more major suppliers to have a successful business. It is difficult, however, for a potential or existing wholesaler to obtain a brand or portfolio that is already being distributed by another wholesaler in the market, in part because a Virgin Islands law, Title 12A V.I.C. sections 131 and 132, allows a dealer to sue a supplier for wrongful termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The distribution of distilled spirits by wholesalers constitutes a relevant product market. The relevant geographic market for the relevant product is the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Most retail distilled spirits business in the Virgin Islands takes place on the island of St. Thomas. On St. Thomas, warehouse space suitable for the operation of a wholesale distilled spirits business is scarce and expensive because of the restricted terrain. An entrant in the Virgin Islands wholesale distilled spirits market would need adequate and accessible storage space for its distilled spirits on St. Thomas to have a successful business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The potential for litigation under the Virgin Islands wrongful termination statute helps to protect Topa's exclusive rights to distribute the various brands of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands and makes it more difficult for a potential or existing competitor to obtain the rights to distribute these brands. This potential for litigation and the scarcity of warehouse space on St. Thomas are among the most important barriers to entry which makes entry for a competitor difficult and costly, and significant entry has not occurred in at least ten years and is unlikely to occur without a Court order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Violation Alleged <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Topa entered the Virgin Islands wholesale distilled spirits market through a predecessor company in 1980. Through this entry and a series of acquisitions of competitors, Topa acquired the exclusive Virgin Islands distribution rights to almost every brand of distilled spirits in the world market. Topa has retained these distribution rights through continuing contractual relationships, both written and oral, with its suppliers. As a result of its acquisitions, and its retention of the exclusive distribution rights acquired, in 1991 Topa had a market share of approximately 96% of wholesale distilled spirits sold in the Virgin Islands market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Topa obtained and has retained its monopoly position in the Virgin Islands through the exclusive Virgin Islands distribution rights to almost every brand of distilled spirits in the world market. Topa's possession and retention of these distribution rights has made significant entry extremely difficult in the Virgin Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. The contracts in restraint of trade by which Topa obtained and has retained its monopoly position have had the following effects, among others: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The wholesale distribution of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands is a monopoly; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Competition in the wholesale distribution of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands has been reduced; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad: The trade deficit recorded a decrease of  US $700 million during the first nine months (July 1993 to March  1994) of the current fiscal year as compared to the  corresponding period of the last monetary year (1992-1993),  official sources told The News on Tuesday [26 April].    Statistics show that the trade deficit during the first nine  months of 1992-1993 was US $2.014 billion, which reduced to US  $1.322 billion between July 1993 to March 1994.    Financial managers consider this a significant reduction in  the trade deficit, which registered a decrease of almost US $77  million per month during the first nine months of the current  financial year. They hope that the deficit would further be  reduced by adopting more balanced approach in exports and  imports.    Official sources say the foreign exchage reserves have been  studied for the last two months at US $1.8 billion -- sufficient  for almost nine weeks of imports.    Between July 1993 to March 1994, the total export bill  remained US $4.80 billion as compared to US $5.05 billion during  the same period of last fiscal year, showing a decline of 3.4  percent in exports.    During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the  total import bill remained US $6.2 billion as compared to US  $7.1 billion in the corresponding period of 1992-93, showing a  decline of 12.2 percent in imports.    Financial managers say the decline in exports occured due to  the discontinuation of the yellow cab scheme, effect of  devaluation and title monetary policy and the government's more  stringent control on deficit.</p>

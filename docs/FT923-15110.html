			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Carrington plans to meet Sarajevo factions LORD Carrington, chairman of the European Community's sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia will today travel to the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo where he will hold talks with representatives of the republic's three ethnic communities. Moslem, Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to a meeting to discuss the possible resumption of peace talks, he said. Officials said Lord Carrington would meet separately President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serb irregulars who have besieged Sarajevo for the past 88 days, and unnamed Croat representatives. Sporadic fighting was reported in the capital yesterday as the first of 1,000 Canadian peacekeeping troops arrived to secure the airport. The Pentagon announced that US military cargo aircraft would begin humanitarian flights from Germany to Bosnia today, joining an international relief effort for the besieged capital. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, said some 1,500 French, Egyptian and Ukrainian troops would be sent to secure Sarajevo airport and take part in other peacekeeping activities in the Bosnian capital. Mr Boutros Ghali, speaking after a meeting in London with Lord Carrington, said the troops would eventually replace the Canadian forces, which would return to Croatia where they are part of the UN's peacekeeping force. In Vienna, Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, called for more UN troops to reinforce peacekeeping efforts in former Yugoslavia and for increased humanitarian aid to the besieged Bosnian capital. The European Commission promised a further Ecu120m (Pounds 85m) in aid to help refugees in the Yugoslav civil war, and said that by the end of this month it would have stockpiled nearly 6,000 tonnes of food in Zagreb for eventual transport to Sarajevo. Meanwhile, an American businessman born in Belgrade yesterday confirmed that he would return to Yugoslavia to become prime minister. Mr Milan Panic, the chairman of the ICN pharmaceutical company in the US, said in Washington yesterday that 'his first goal was to stop the fighting in his homeland and work for lasting peace'. In Belgrade last night tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the state-controlled television centre to demand the resignation of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in the fifth day of anti-government protests. Twelve Serbian Orthodox nuns headed a column of some 80,000 protesters who marched through the city centre to the television building, which was protected by a police cordon three deep. Some 1,000 policemen in full-combat uniform stood in the neighbouring park, backed up by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons. Meanwhile the nearby federal parliament building, the site of the five-day protest, was scarcely guarded. This signalled the extent that Mr Milosevic depends on control over television to win popular support. Chanting 'Resignation', the crowd jeered at Belgrade television, demanding the 'fall of the Bastille'. Observer, Page 17</p>

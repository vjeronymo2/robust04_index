These agencies either administer lands containing these species or authorize, fund, or otherwise conduct activities that may affect these species. In addition, the allocation of funding through the Federal Emergency Management Act, Housing and Urban Development, Federal mortgage programs, and the Veteran's Administration may be involved with these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR section 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered, and 17.71 and 17.72 for threatened species, set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered or threatened plants. With respect to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Downingia concolor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> brevior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limnanthes gracilis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> parishii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 or 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale any such species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100&hyph;478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63, and 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened species under certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plants under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. Trade permits will not likely be sought or issued for any of the plant species considered herein because they are not in cultivation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them should be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon, 97232&hyph;4181 (telephone 503/231&hyph;6241).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.

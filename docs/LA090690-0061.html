			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> VOGEL NAMED AS INTERIM SCHOOLS' HEAD  </P> <P> The chief financial officer of the Simi Valley Unified School District has been  appointed interim superintendent to run the county's largest school district  after Supt. John Duncan leaves later this month.  </P> <P> Associate Supt. Cathi Vogel will assume the top position Sept. 17, the day  after Duncan leaves his $98,900-a-year position to become head of the San Ramon  School District in Northern California.  </P> <P> "I'm excited and was honored to be chosen," Vogel said after the school board  made the appointment Tuesday night. She will serve for about 50 days until a  permanent superintendent is hired.  </P> <P> Vogel, 46, has worked in administration for the 18,300-student school district  since 1980. She holds a bachelor's degree in business management from Cal  Lutheran University and a master's degree in public administration from USC.  </P> <P> Under district policy, Vogel cannot compete for the top position since she will  serve as interim superintendent.  </P> <P> A consultant was hired in July to recruit a new superintendent.  </P> <P> Board President Helen Beebe said the board will probably interview the top six  to 10 candidates in closed sessions, then have a second private interview with  the top two candidates.  </P> <P> Associate Supt. Allan W. Jacobs, who has been with the district for 18 years,  said Wednesday that he plans to apply.  </P> <P> Applications are due Sept. 17. A superintendent is expected to be named by  mid-October, Beebe said.  </P> <P> School officials also voted to use state money to hire six teachers to reduce  the size of 10th-grade English classes at the district's three high schools.  The district expects to receive between $179,500 and $215,700, which will be  applied toward an estimated $228,000 in teacher salaries.  </P> <P> The classes would shrink from 36 students to 20 under the plan.  </P> <P> Substitute teachers will cover the extra classes for two weeks until the  district can hire temporary teachers.

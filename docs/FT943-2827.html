			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mayr-Melnhof Karton may offset materials costs with price rise Mayr-Melnhof Karton, the Austrian carton board producer, said a sharp increase in raw materials costs in May would only be offset by price increases in June and take full effect in the fourth quarter, Reuters reports from Zurich. As a result, full-year results are expected to show only a modest improvement over the first half. Group net profits are seen at Sch140m and cash flow at Sch920m. First-half net profits were Sch105m, while full-year profits for 1993 were Sch117m. Cash flow in the first six months was Sch511m, and Sch831m for the full year. 'The unprecedented increase in international used paper prices that began in May has had immediate and unpleasant consequences for the business year 1994,' the company said.</p>

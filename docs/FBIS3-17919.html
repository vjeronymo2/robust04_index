			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sevastopol -- Rear-Admiral Mykola Kostrov, deputy  commander of Ukraine's Navy, who was at one time appointed by  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry as chairman of the ministry's  commission for inventory of the Black Sea Fleet assets, gave  UNIAN his opinion about why such a commission was not set up by  the Russian Defense Ministry. In his view, Russia is  purposefully delaying the setting up of the commission, as well  as the launch of the joint fleet review. One of the main  reasons, the rear-admiral believes, is that "someone stands to  lose from disclosing the facts of illegal use of property and  funds, which unfortunately does happen in the Black Sea Fleet,  and therefore, does not think it desirable." Mykola Kostrov  recalled that the Black Sea Fleet command recently did all it  could to prevent the commission, which arrived from Kiev and  Moscow, from starting an inspection of one of the Black Sea  Fleet fuel bases. Despite the commission's wide powers, the  fleet command explained their actions saying that they were  subordinate only to the two presidents, of Russia and Ukraine.  They do, though, as a rule, obey orders, directives, and  instructions coming from Russia's Defense Ministry and Navy  headquarters.    Meanwhile, the rear admiral stressed, the delay of the  commissions' work only tightens the knot of the Black Sea Fleet  problems.</p>

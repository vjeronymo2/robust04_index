			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Burmistenko profile under "Who's Who" rubric: </F> "William Perry, Scientist and Secretary"]    [Excerpts] A few days ago the U.S. Senate unanimously  approved President Clinton's nomination of 66-year-old William  Perry for the post of defense secretary. This unanimity can  easily be explained because throughout his career Perry has been  closely associated with the Pentagon and has been widely  recognized as an effective leader of major corporations in the  military industry, and he is an eminent mathematical scientist  and arms control specialist. [passage omitted]    The new defense secretary believes that the department he  heads "must play an important role in strengthening democracy,"  because the U.S. military complex "can help peoples to  appreciate more fully the principles and advantages of civilian  control over the military department" by means of direct  programs of cooperation with various countries' defense  ministries. As we know, such a program is now being implemented  together with Russia.    In his recent speeches Perry has stressed that democracy  "has  bided its time and has proved stronger than the most powerful  armies." The advantages of democracy "are appreciated by  everyone who believes in peace and freedom," but at the same  time it must be borne in mind that "the collapse of Soviet  communism has by no means removed the sources of the threat to  our security."    Judging from these statements the new secretary intends to  stick to the traditional U.S. defense policy of "keeping its  powder dry," even in a favorable international climate, by  maintaining a level of combat capability ensuring its national  security interests whatever turn events in the world may take.    This is evidenced by the Pentagon's draft budget for the  next  fiscal year, which Perry has just submitted to Congress, for  $263.7 billion -- this is $2.4 billion more than last year.  This draft provides for the appropriation of large sums for the  development and production of high-technology armaments,  including a new aircraft carrier, the F-22 fighter, the V-22  combat helicopter, and a new generation of submarines.</p>

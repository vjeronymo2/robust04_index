			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bush uses power to block bill on China trade PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday vetoed a bill that would have linked China's tariff status to its good behaviour on human rights, trade and weapons proliferation. There is virtually no chance that Congressional leaders will muster the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to override the president's veto. Congress wanted to attach political conditions to China's enjoyment of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status governing the tariff levels on its goods sold in the US. These conditions would require China to show 'substantial progress' on human rights, arm sales and trade policy before its MFN status could be renewed again. Although the House of Representatives passed the measure by 409-21 last November, the Senate held off a vote, looking for a politically opportune time to bring it forward. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader and one of the bill's strongest backers, brought it up last week when Mr Bush was under attack from both left and right in the presidential primaries. Even so, the senator was unable to get the numbers he needed and the measure passed by only 59-39. In a message to Congress, Mr Bush said he approved of the aims of the legislation, but disagreed with the method of achieving them. 'There is no doubt in my mind that if we present China's leaders with an ultimatum on MFN, the result will be weakened ties to the West and further repression,' he said. In going ahead with his threatened veto, Mr Bush defied criticism by the Democratic party's presidential candidates, who want US foreign policy to be linked to human rights. They are expected to try to use the issue against him in the November presidential election by portraying him as a 'moral wimp', afraid of standing up to China. The issue will not be laid to rest. In May, the president must say once again if he will renew China's MFN status in June. Once again the Democrats, and many Republicans, can be expected to try to place conditions on the renewal, using the opportunity for a further attack on the president's foreign policy.</p>

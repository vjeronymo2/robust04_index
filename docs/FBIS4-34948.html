			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the scheduled 3 October  general elections.    PDT-PP Alliance in Minas Gerais -- The Minas Gerais office  of  the Democratic Labor Party, PDT, decided on 6 June to support  the Popular Party, PP, candidate for the state's governorship,  Helio Costa. In exchange Costa will allow PDT presidential  candidate Leonel Brizola to take part in his rallies. According  to Brizola, this alliance "will open up new possibilities not  only in Minas Gerais, but also in the rest of Brazil." It has  also been decided that Senator Darcy Ribeiro, vice presidential  candidate on Brizola's ticket, will concentrate his electoral  campaign in Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro.

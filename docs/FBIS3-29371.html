The spokesman said that President Li Teng-hui is not persona  non grata. Besides, his visit to Thailand was a private visit;  he was not even the guest of the Thai private sector. There is  no reason at all for Thailand to prevent President Li Teng-hui  from visiting the country.    Concerning Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan's meeting  with President Li Teng-hui when he visited Thailand, the  spokesman said the meeting was private. Regarding the luncheon  hosted by House of Representatives Speaker Marut Bunnak for  President Li Teng-hui, the spokesman said it was a parliamentary  affair and the government had no business interfering with it.    The spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office reiterated  that  Thailand is a free country, and anyone who is not persona non  grata can visit. The government, meanwhile, has reaffirmed its  one China stance, and hopes that the PRC does not become too  worried about the issue. The spokesman said he believes the  Foreign Ministry will be able to make China understand this.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / As They Say In Europe: Machiavelli and the Mafia SHAKESPEARE used Italy for his comedies because it provided a suitable backdrop for improbable events. But the present election campaign there attracts comment only insofar as it concerns the central figures of politica-spettacolo: pornographers, striptease artistes and the pneumatic descendants of dead dictators. The world ignores stories such as the decision by Rino Formica, the finance minister, to offer Neapolitan cigarette smugglers new employment in the civil service. 'If we can find jobs for 20,000 Albanians, we can surely do the same for 25,000 smugglers,' he said. Last autumn the government launched a campaign against the 'blondes,' the smugglers of light tobacco cigarettes. La Repubblica of Rome reported that the blondes wrote to Formica in these terms: 'Dear minister: if you take our cigarette market away from us, we shall be forced to steal. Signed: the Smugglers of San Giovanni a Teduccio, Naples.' The minister's offer to buythe merchants' speedboats and give them jobs led Corriere della Sera to do what Italian papers always do: ask a sociologist. One, Amato Lamberti, described as an 'observer' of the Mafia, said the proposal touched on an important question: 'the need to differentiate between criminals and those who are compelled to make a living by illegal means.' In Italy, sociologists and psychiatrists play the role of court jesters as we shall see. Repubblica objected. It said that the minister's ideas were 'in line with the juridical culture and moral philosophy which our secular government exudes: when a phenomenon is out of control, the system absorbs and metabolises it. You don't want to stand up to Mafia terrorism? Pardon the penitents and peace is won. You don't want to try to wipe out tax evasion? Total forgiveness and you're friends again.' It said the smugglers could double as border guards - a suggestion for which there was a precedent in Italian history. Another big story was about a gentleman from Verona who battered his parents to death with a frying pan to get hold of their fortune. He received a 30-year sentence, which means 14 at most, and a share in the inheritance. Psychiatrists at his trial said the accused was a victim of the materialist culture typical of rich places like Verona. He received letters of support from many young heirs around the country. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung tried to come to terms with other aspects of Italy's moral universe while pursuing its own, turgid, geopolitical speculation. Heinz-Joachim Fischer wrote an editorial entitled 'The unloved Germans' (a headline that has appeared a couple of hundred times this year.) He wondered whether Germany should run its foreign policy according to the categorical imperative of Immanuel Kant, the Prussian philosopher, or the 'sly counsel' of Macchiavelli. Fischer argued that every other nation conducted its policy towards Germany with a copy of Macchiavelli in its metaphorical hand. 'They accept in all innocence that their interests are self-evident principles . . . they organise their policy towards Germany on the basis of what is useful for them. From them and their masters, we can learn. 'Thus, the Italians have a special role vis-a-vis the Germans among European nations. They have no foreign policy principles, wanting only to live in peace and enjoy a few pleasures. While France pursues national glory and England strives to counterbalance any overweening power on the Continent, the Italians have no power-political or racial-psychological preconceptions  -except those which they cook up for their own purposes.' Italy is the one European nation with a reputation unchanged for 700 years. Dante said it was a 'Lady, no longer of fair provinces, but of a brothel house impure.' Shakespeare's contemporary, Sir Henry Wotton, said: 'A paradise inhabited with devils.' Dr Johnson completed the picture: 'A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority.' Specially if he never meets Rino Formica. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

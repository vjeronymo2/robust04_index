			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 23 SAPA -- At least seven people were  killed in violence in KwaZulu/Natal since the start of the  weekend, and the Human Rights Committee said this was the lowest  figure recorded over a weekend this year. The latest killings  pushed the death-toll in the province to at least 455 since the  declaration of a state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal on March 31.    In Montclair, Durban, the corpse of an unidentified man was  found on Saturday. He had been hacked to death, the South  African Police said. The bullet-riddled body of another  unidentified man was found in Inanda, north of Durban, on  Saturday morning. Another body of a man was found in the nearby  Nhulswane river. He had been shot in the left eye. In Stanger,  on the north coast, Mr Jabulani Mtembu was shot dead by unknown  gunmen on Saturday night. In Mtunzini, on the north coast, Mr  Amos Cebukulu was awoken by a knock on his door on Saturday  night. He saw that one of the men was armed, and fled. Upon his  return Mr Cebukulu found the body of his son.    The HRC meanwhile said violence had "definitely decreased",  but spokesman Linda McLean cautioned that there was still  dissatisfaction over the election results and concern over  policing in the province. "We are still very worried about the  violence in KwaZulu/Natal."</p>

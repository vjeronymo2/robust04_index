			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: No need for common environmental standards Sir, With reference to your article, 'Brussels' green sprouts' (October 21), it is not true that the single European market requires common environmental standards. It has been shown that the demand for environmental protection depends on income, the density of population and several other characteristics. The member countries differ widely in these respects. Environmental prices ought to vary accordingly. This conclusion holds also for international spill-overs. Ideally, each country should apply its domestic environmental prices to pollution from abroad as well. The Community would merely supervise the measurement of, and payments for, international pollution. International differences among environmental standards or prices do not distort trade. They are necessary to allow for differences in preferences and factor endowments. Harmonisation is the distortion. Roland Vaubel, Universitat Mannheim, D-6800 Mannheim, Germany</p>

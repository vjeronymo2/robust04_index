			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / EC drug advert rule angers industry UK DRUG manufacturers are launching a campaign against advertising rules proposed in a draft directive from the European Community. Information carried on the packaging of non-prescription medicines would have to be given in television, newspaper and radio advertisements, according to a code proposed this month by the EC environment, public health and consumer protection committee. The draft directive has also come under fire from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the trade body for prescription medicine manufacturers, because the EC proposes to ban all 'giving and receiving of gifts, pecuniary advantages and payments-in-kind' between the drug industry and practitioners. The association says that the proposed ban threatens to block sponsorship of conferences within the industry. The directive says that all usage instructions, side effects or adverse reactions, precautions, interactions with other substances and any special recommendations must be given not less than a quarter of an advertisement's space or air time, according to Ms Gopa Mitra of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, representing non-prescription medicine makers. The association carried out a survey in 1990 which showed that when two television advertisements for a cold remedy and a pain killer carried all the label information, fewer viewers remembered what the drugs were for than when another advertisement was shown with the simple message 'Always read the label'. Prescription medicines can be advertised only to the medical profession. Mr Ben Hayes of the ABPI said the association's code of practice allows 'gifts as promotional aids that are inexpensive and relevant to the practitioner'. The system has caused controversy, with allegations of inducements being made to doctors to prescribe a company's drugs or to take part in drug trials.</p>

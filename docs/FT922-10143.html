			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Co-op takes a stand FOX-HUNTERS may not be welcome, but tree-huggers will be embraced with open arms at the Co-operative Bank, following the launch of its ethical policy this week. The bank has stated that it will no longer take deposits from, offer financial services to, or in any other way do any business with organisations involved in a series of controversial activities. These include the oppression of the human spirit; manufacturing torture instruments or exporting arms to oppressive regimes; cosmetics-testing on animals; exploitative factory-farming; blood sports; production of animal fur; and the manufacture of tobacco. It will also encourage customers to take an active stance on the environmental impact of their activities, and will try to ensure that its own services are not exploited for the purposes of money laundering, drug trafficking or tax evasion. The message behind the approach is simple: banks do not simply store depositors' money, but loan it to other organisations involved in activities with which the customer may be opposed. The bank has identified six organisations involved in either blood sports and/or battery farming among existing customers, which will be told politely to amend their ways or close their accounts. Sceptics have been quick to suggest that the Co-op is cashing in on ethics. A number also indignantly suggest that banks have no rights to preach to their customers or discriminate against potential recipients of loans. Terry Thomas, managing director, says: 'We are not pretending to play God and tell people what their ethics should be. But we are telling them what our ethics are. We are principled bankers.' He makes no pretence of the fact that the campaign is a marketing drive designed to generate considerable new business, and estimates that the bank will gain at least ten new customers for every one who wants to leave as a result of the policy. But he stresses that the bank is committed to the policy in the long-term. He also argues that it always had an implicit ethical ethos which is now explicit - a fact which he says is proved by the fact only six organisations contradicting its policy have slipped through and become customers. For existing customers, the ethical stance is unlikely to be come as a surprise. Many joined on principle because of the Co-op's image, reflected in previous initiatives including a 'customers' charter' launched last year which ensures that no financial information is given to credit agencies without express approval. The bank believes that its 1.25m personal account holders are more highly-educated and from the upper range of the socio-economic scale than any other UK bank. It took great care in identifying the issues on which it is now publicly frowning. Work on the ethical policy began nearly two years ago, and when a draft was prepared late last year it was circulated to 30,000 customers for their opinions. Only those issues with which at least 60 per cent agreed found their way into the final policy. Four-fifths approved of the idea of a published ethical policy while only 2 per cent strongly disapproved. While it is modest in size and has the strongest concentration of branches in the north of England, the Co-op stresses that it offers the same services as any clearing bank. Among its services are free banking, a telephone inquiry service charged at local rates, a gold credit card guaranteed free for life, and membership of the LINK cash machine network which has 5,000 outlets around the UK.

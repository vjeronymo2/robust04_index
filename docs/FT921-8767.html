			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home rescues begin ANDREW Longhurst, chief executive of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, declared this week: 'Our aim is to ensure that our customers don't get into a position where they have to be rescued.' When the government and building societies met to discuss the housing repossessions crisis just before Christmas, Longhurst was the only building society chief with the nerve to resist the pressures from the politicians for mortgage-lenders to come up with rescue schemes. The lenders, mostly building societies, pledged more than Pounds 800m. In return, the government has arranged that, when borrowers are on social security, mortgage interest will be paid direct to lenders. Now, the lenders are getting under way with their rescue schemes. Nationwide Building Society led the way, followed by the Halifax, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Leeds Permanent and the National Westminster Bank. Woolwich is expected to start in the next few days. Only one centralised lender has a rescue scheme so far: the Mortgage Corporation, which has a Pounds 15m business expansion scheme to convert 150 homes into assured tenancies. Most of the schemes launched so far are trials that will operate on a relatively modest scale. Halifax's Pounds 18m, for example, is expected to rescue about 350 home-owners, and Nationwide's pilot scheme about 100. A variety of techniques is being used in the schemes. They include: Mortgage to rent. The borrower sells his home to either a housing association or the lender and becomes its tenant at an affordable rent. Equity sharing. This is the route favoured by the Leeds Permanent. It is spending Pounds 100m on injections of cash that will, in effect, buy a part-share in a house and so reduce a customer's debt burden. Advice and counselling. This costs little and could be the most effective rescue technique of all. More schemes are on the way from other lenders. But how many people will they save? The lenders seem to think about 20,000. On Desert Island Discs, prime minister John Major gave the impression that the government thinks it has solved the repossessions' problem. This is not quite the case. Last year, there were 75,500 repossessions and, on present trends, there will be around 80,000 this year. A much larger number of people - around 275,000 - have mortgage arrears of more than six months.</p>

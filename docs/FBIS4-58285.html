			<p>BFN     [Text] The two-year sanctions imposed by the US in May,  1992, on the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) created  only minor inconvenience and that none of the country's space  programme schedules were affected, Mr R Kasturirangan, new  chairman of ISRO said here on Friday.    "The sanctions will be automatically revoked and that we  have  no information on the thinking of the United States government,"  ISRO chief added. The sanctions will be expiring next month.    Even after the US clamped sanctions on ISRO and Glavkosmos,  the Russian rocket manufacturing company for signing the  cryogenic engine deal, India was able to launch two satellites  -- Insat-2A and Insat-2B and two more in the same series --  Insat-2C and 2D are on schedule. "We were able to procure  components from other sources," Mr Kasturirangan said.    Though the sanctions are still in force, ISRO and Glavkosmos  renegotiated the cryogenic engine deal last month, whereby the  Russian company would be shipping seven engines at no fresh cost  to ISRO. Apparently, the Russian government got the deal cleared  by the US State Department.    The countdown for the fourth development test flight of  Augmented satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV-D4) has begun and is  expected to tae off during the early hours on May 4,1994.</p>

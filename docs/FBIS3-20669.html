			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hu Chengchun [5170 2052 2504], vice chairman, </F> China Energy Resource Research Society New Energy Resources  Special Committee, Beijing: "China's Abundant Marine Energy  Awaits Development"]    [Text] China's continental coastline is over 18,000  kilometers long, and we have over 6,500 large and small islands  with coastlines about 14,000 kilometers long and a marine area  covering over 4.7 million square kilometers. China is a country  rich in marine energy resources. Based on current technical  levels, China has about 400,000 to 500,000MW of renewable marine  energy including 100,000MW of tidal energy, 70,000MW of wave  energy, 30,000MW of marine current energy, 150,000MW of seawater  temperature differential energy, and 110,000MW of salinity  differential energy. Currently, with the exception of a few  small tidal power stations and miniature wave power generators,  the utilization of China's marine energy is basically nil.    In the present situation of energy resource shortages and  continual development of new technologies, many countries are  extremely concerned with developing marine energy. In the long  term, mankind will march toward the seas and will inevitably  make full use of marine energy. For tidal power generation  alone, France completed the 240MW La Rance Tidal Power Station  in 1967; its operational condition so far has been excellent.  Subsequently, the former Soviet Union completed the (Jisiluo)  Tidal Power Station with an installed generating capacity of 2MW  and Canada completed the Annapolis Preliminary Tidal Power  Station with a single unit capacity of 20MW in 1983 to develop  large-scale tidal power generation for the 4,000MW of power in  the Bay of Fundy. England, India, Korea, and other countries  also plan to build large-scale tidal power stations. The United  States, Japan, France, and others are now speeding up research  on marine temperature differential power generation and are now  conducting MW-grade power station experiments. Norway and  Denmark, as well as England and Japan, which are renowned for  marine research, have also established several wave power  generation devices of varying sizes.    China has built seven small tidal power stations along its  southeastern coast with a total installed generating capacity of  8.3MW. They include the Jiangxia Tidal Power Station in  Zhejiang's Wenling County, the most representative, which now  has five generators with a total capacity of 3.2MW having an  operational arrangement utilizing bidirectional power generation  for rising and falling tides using bulb-type generators. Their  operating situation has been excellent since they were placed  into operation in 1980. Besides generating electricity, this  power station has also facilitated communication on both sides  of the bay, enclosed over 5,000 mu of farmland and orchards for  reclamation, and developed the reservoir breeding industry, so  the overall economic benefits have been significant. For this  reason, after a Korean delegation visited Jiangxi Tidal Power  Station in 1991, they immediately decided to study China's  experiences in developing tidal power stations, and in 1992,  following several civilian technology exchanges between the two  countries, the Koreans finally requested that their government  approve the long-planned (Jialulin) Bay Tidal Power Station  (400MW) program be turned over to a group of Chinese experts for  a feasibility discussion, and they plan to utilize Chinese  technology and equipment. This is the world's biggest tidal  power station to date.    The situation outlined above shows that China has a rather  good hydropower technology foundation and tidal power station  practice and experience and that accelerated development of  tidal power generation, especially in the economically developed  coastal areas that have relative power shortages, is essential.  Through integration with the state's improvement of our national  territory and preferential development of coastal islands,  resettlement to develop barren islands with no permanent  resident population must first of all provide them with supplies  of energy resources and fresh water. If we can rationally  utilize all types of marine energy and renewable solar energy,  wind energy, and biomass energy, adapt to local conditions, and  persevere, this will benefit our nation and our people.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Romanian railways crippled by strike ROMANIA's railway network was brought to a near standstill yesterday after a train drivers' strike over pay continued into a second day. Only 26 services were operating normally yesterday morning and no international trains ran throughout the day, according to the Ministry of Transport. The western and southern parts of the country were particularly affected, Radio Bucharest said. The SNCFR, the state-owned railway administration, said it would seek to have the strike declared illegal at a court hearing scheduled for today. Romanian regulations stipulate that even during a general strike at least one third of trains must run. A Bucharest court recently ruled that the train drivers' previous strike in June was illegal on these grounds. The strike is the latest in a growing number of labour conflicts, mainly over pay as workers try to cope with three-digit inflation and without subsidised food and energy. Romanian road workers have said they too will go on strike next week if their pay demands are not met. A warning strike last week blocked Romania's border points with Hungary and Bulgaria for two hours.</p>

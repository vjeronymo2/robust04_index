			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: That 'vision thing' again - Technically Speaking WHO needs technology 'vision'? Certainly not International Business Machines, according to Lou Gerstner, the computer giant's tough new chairman and chief executive. 'The last thing IBM needs is vision,' he declared last month, in a statement that is stirring widespread debate throughout the computer industry. The 'vision thing' is a hot topic among those who like to wax lyrical about their views on the path that technology developments will take in coming years; 'information highways' and 'industry convergence' are their favourite topics. All seem to see their companies playing a critical role as these visions unfold. Yet apart from drumming up enthusiasm for technology in general, is there any value to this star gazing? Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, founded his company on a 'vision' of how microprocessor chips would put 'a personal computer on every desk and in every home,' and the opportunities that this would create for selling software programs. 'Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder) and I wrote that down on day one,' Gates recalls. Eighteen years, and several billions of revenue dollars, later Gates still sets aside a few 'think weeks' each year to 'figure out trends that are going to affect us and what we ought to be doing about them. It is something you have to give a lot of thought to.' What does Gates make of Gerstner's apparent disdain for vision? 'It depends what you mean by vision,' he responds. 'In the broad sense, it is not sufficient or necessary. But having a technology strategy, figuring out the industry direction, the factors that are influencing the business and the synergies between them is very important.' According to Mike Maples, Microsoft executive vice-president: 'Vision is knowing where to go'. Picking the technologies that are going to be important and then being willing to invest in them is a key ingredient of industry leadership, he maintains. Vision can, however, be blinding. In the past, IBM was prone to seeing the information industry through Big Blue-tinted glasses. Hence, the company mapped out a grand strategy called SAA that pulled all the disparate pieces of its technology together, but failed to recognise that the market was taking a different path defined by industry standards. Lew Platt, Hewlett-Packard chief executive, takes a more pragmatic approach to 'vision'. 'While we're excited about our vision of the future and how HP can participate in its creation, we don't intend to get blinded by 'the vision thing',' he recently told customers. 'Computer makers must keep sight of a 'basic truth'. We build things customers want. They are the architects of our vision.' However, customers with a vested interest in today's technology are not always the best seers. Users of H-P computers no doubt foresee a great future for Unix, but it is a fair bet that buyers of Microsoft's programs look forward to new versions of Windows. Similarly, users of IBM mainframes are unlikely to tell the company to get out of that business. Too much vision can also be a dangerous thing, as Apple Computer has discovered. While putting its energies into long-term innovative projects, such as Newton, Apple has failed to maintain the momentum of its core Macintosh personal computer business. Computer companies cannot afford to become so excited about the future that they lose focus on near-term issues and priorities. Many high-technology visions also turn out to be pipe dreams. Steve Jobs's Next Computer, which he had hoped to build into a computer company repeating his success at Apple, is one of the most celebrated examples. Indeed, there are many reasons to avoid technology vision. It can be blinding, expensive, misleading and fleeting. Yet companies without it must inevitably rely upon the foresight of others, becoming technology followers rather than leaders.</p>

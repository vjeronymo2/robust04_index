			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- Minority  representatives from Central and East European countries "must  unconditionally" take part in the stability pact talks aimed at  settling questions concerning postcommunist countries, Hungarian  minority representative Miklos Duray told CTK today. Duray is  chairman of Egyutteles, a Hungarian minority party which is part  of the Slovak Government coalition.    Egyutteles would not seek participation at the starting  conference to be held next week in Paris but would like to enter  into discussions as part of the process already under way, he  said, adding that Egyutteles had been lobbying for the idea in  Slovakia and Hungary as well as in other European countries.</p>

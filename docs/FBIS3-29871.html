			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, Feb. 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the  United States met at the United Nations headquarters on Tuesday  to discuss holding a third round of high-level talks and nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    After the working-level contact, North Korean representative  Ho Chong said it would resume one and a half hours later, but  his U.S. counterpart Tom Hubbard was uncertain if they would  meet again the same day. Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North  Korean mission to the United Nations, led his country's  delegation while Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of  state for Asian and Pacific affairs, headed the American team.    Hubbard said he hoped the contact would resume, adding that  issuing visas to the IAEA inspectors was yet to be worked out by  North Korea and the nuclear watchdog. Hubbard said he urged  North Korea to allow nuclear inspections as soon as possible,  which means Pyongyang should issue visas for the inspection  team. He said the issuance of visas was unlikely to be a big  problem.    Apart from the visa issue, the two sides held serious  discussions on the future direction of U.S.-North Korean  dialogue, according to Hubbard. He said that holding the third  round of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang  depends on whether or not the IAEA is allowed to inspect North  Korea's nuclear sites. He added that the United States would  continue to strive for the high-level talks, but said unsolved  problems remained.    Ho, for his part, said he must discuss something with his  home government in Pyongyang.    C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea desk officer at the U.S.  State Department, accompanied Hubbard while Han Song-yol,  councilor at the North Korean mission to the United Nations,  attended with Ho.</p>

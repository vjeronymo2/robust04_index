			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / HK falls to China's market force: The fallout from Beijing's row with colony's governor THERE is one word, and only one, that has been the force behind the Hong Kong stock market this year: China. The promise of the riches expected to flow from China's embrace of market economics pushed the Heng Seng index to an all-time high of 6,447.11 three weeks ago. The fear of China's retribution for what it, and many in Hong Kong, see as Governor Chris Patten's impudence in promoting democracy, is what brought the index down to yesterday's close of 4,978.12 - a fall of 8 per cent on the day and nearly 23 per cent down from the peak on November 12. For a brief period last month, when the market kept on rising in the face of daily, tougher rhetoric from China, it was possible to ask the question: had the Hong Kong market been fundamentally re-rated because economics, not politics, had come to matter more? Attractive as that was to contemplate, the events of the past two weeks have shown that Hong Kong is as 'political' a market, subject to the tenor of relations between Britain and China, as ever it was. So the questions being asked in Hong Kong's financial circles now are: Where is the bottom? And what are the implications for Hong Kong's economy? What has unsettled the market most this week is that no one knows the boundaries of the conflict in which Britain and China are now locked. History may be a guide. Past crises - such as the October 1987 stock market crash, and the more localised reaction to the June 4 1989 Tiananmen massacre  -suggest that the market reaches bottom when its prospective price/earnings ratio as a whole reaches 6 to 7 times future earnings. According to Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, a local brokerage, that would, in the worst case scenario, put the Heng Seng index somewhere between 4,000 and 4,500, assuming 20 per cent earnings next year - a fall of a further 10 to 20 per cent on yesterday's close. 'That's the real base if all hell breaks loose,' he said. Investors who bought Hong Kong equities at the beginning of the year were, by yesterday's close, still more than 15 per cent ahead. If the political atmosphere enveloping the market continues to deteriorate then many of them may decide to take their profits. Today the market may well have judged that all hell had broken loose. Late yesterday China again raised the issue of future adherence to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration - the cornerstone of Hong Kong's security. In spite of the palpable uncertainty in Hong Kong, not a few analysts were pointing out the artificiality of it all. Nothing, they said, has changed the fundamentals. Corporate earnings growth this year is expected to be between 20 and 25 per cent; the market is working on 20 per cent for next year. The reason is simple: the Hong Kong economy is expected to grow by 6 per cent in real terms next year, up from 5 per cent this year. China - that word again - is the main reason for this bullish outlook. It is expected to grow by more than 10 per cent in 1993. Guangdong, the province bordering Hong Kong and the most dynamic economy in China, may grow by 12 per cent or more. As Mrs Janice Wallace, head of research at Goldman Sachs, pointed out: 'The fundamentals are still very strong. Unlike June 1989, corporate earnings are on an upswing and GDP growth is accelerating. Also, this is a political dispute; there are no tanks in the street.' She is not alone in expecting a surge in share prices when the political dispute is resolved. Mr Hart said Crosby is advising long-term funds to stay in the market, although short-term performance-sensitive funds are being encouraged to quit Hong Kong for Malaysia and Thailand. Mrs Wallace said: 'I still believe that, 12 months out for those who buy now, the rewards will be great.' However, 'no one wants to catch a falling knife'. But the real risk to the market and business is a protracted brawl between Britain and China. No one has yet downgraded earnings or economic growth forecasts on the basis of the current crisis, but if it continues for long they will. The market is already pointing to potential problems in the industrials and retail sectors. Both have fallen faster relative to the overall decline in prices this week. The reason, analysts say, is that people will be less likely to buy flats, consumer goods and cars if the row is maintained at its current level for much longer. The property sector in Hong Kong was worst hit in 1982-83 when Britain and China went through a similar trial of strength and the markets took the strain. The difference now, analysts say, is that the financial strength of the property companies could not be better. In the early 1980s these companies were highly geared and had to dump property to raise cash. This time, property companies have virtually no debt and are well placed to weather a fall-off in transactions.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUMAN WINS FINAL SPRINT-CAR RACE AT ASCOT  </P> <P> After all the speeches and all the tears, they finally ran the final sprint-car  race at Ascot Park Saturday night, and Ron Shuman's victory seemed as  inevitable as the closing of the little track.  </P> <P> Shuman, the California Racing Assn. points leader from Tempe, Ariz., won the  13th annual 50-lap Don Peabody Classic after passing leader Mike Kirby of Long  Beach on the 42nd lap.  </P> <P> Cary Faas of Yorba Linda finished second.  </P> <P> About double the average attendance -- 8,224 -- was on hand and they stayed  well after midnight. The feature race didn't begin until 11:37 p.m. and was  slowed by two caution periods.  </P> <P> The Peabody wasn't the track's last event. The curtain is scheduled to come  down for good with Thursday night's running of the 50th 100-lap Turkey Night  Grand Prix for USAC midget race cars.  </P> <P> After 34 years, Ascot's lease expires Dec. 31.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following is a comprehensive review  of all items in the 14 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic  issues.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Chief Editor on Islamic Awakening In Turkey    2. Chief Editor Notes Destruction of Liberties    3. Lawyers Moderation, National Unity Underlined    4. Writer Views Middle Eastern Market From Islamic  Standpoint    5. Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Preaches Islamic Values    6. Columnist Highlights Situation of Muslims in Africa  <H5>  CHIEF EDITOR ON ISLAMIC AWAKENING IN TURKEY </H5>   Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn publishes on page 2 a  2,500-word article in which he reviews Turkey's history before  and after Kamal Ataturk and just what led to its secularism.  The writer then explains how Islamic awakening started slowly  after Ataturk's death and concludes: "The Arab and Islamic  world is witnessing a common intricate process to retrieve its  Islamic identity. The clever rulers -- if they do exist -- must  not uselessly burden the nation with conflicts and shocks.  While Turkey seeks to include the Islamic movement in its  democratic process, the very clever rulers of Egypt still think  that they can liquidate the Islamic movement, thus making us  suffer from internal attrition for a while longer and making  sure that Islamic victory is born only through pain, suffering,  and bleeding."  <H5>  CHIEF EDITOR NOTES DESTRUCTION OF LIBERTIES </H5>   Page 2 also features a 1,000-word article by Chief Editor  Majdi Ahmad Husayn in which he draws attention to the erosion of  the democratic system in Egypt. He notes that at the beginning  of "our lame democratic experiment" the regime applied democracy  little-by-little because the Egyptian people were not advanced  and could not adapt to democracy all at once, the situation has  worsened since the president's third term. The regime has moved  to "exclude liberties from the democratic system  little-by-little." The writer also criticizes the government's  mishandling of the case of the millionaire Ishaq Hakim who  swindled the banks and individuals of tens of millions of pounds.  <H5>  LAWYERS MODERATION, NATIONAL UNITY UNDERLINED </H5>   A 1,500-word article by Qutb al-'Arabi on page 3 discusses  the lawyers' crisis. The writer says that despite the heated  debate that took place during the meeting of the general lawyers  syndicate council and the branch syndicates last Wednesday  evening, the final resolutions were moderate, aimed at finding a  "peaceful solution to the crisis." The resolutions called for  sending a letter in the name of the branch syndicates to the  president of the republic and forming a delegation of the  syndicate council to meet with the prime minister to demand an  immediate investigation of the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani and the quick release of the detainees.    The writer adds that while the lawyers syndicate displayed a  measure of flexibility in dealing with the crisis and gave the  government a chance to solve the crisis peacefully, the  government did not show any flexibility and escalated its  measures against the lawyers by continuing to detain the  lawyers' leaders, including some members of the syndicate  council, and maintaining the media campaign against the  syndicate.    A 500-word unattributed article on the same page notes that  the lawyers' crisis has enhanced national unity among the  lawyers. The article says "the recent lawyers' syndicate crisis  has highlighted the genuine unity among the lawyers, despite  differences in their political and religious affiliations."  During the lawyers demonstration, Sayf-al-Islam al-Banna  (Muslim Brotherhood) stood next to the Nasirist Samih 'Ashur,  the Wafdist 'Abd-al-Halim Mandhur, and the communist Nabil  al-Hilali. Three Copts were among the lawyers and citizens  arrested by the police. Coptic lawyers also took part in  defending their arrested brothers.  <H5>  WRITER VIEWS MIDDLE EASTERN MARKET FROM ISLAMIC STANDPOINT </H5>   AL-SHA'B publishes an 500-word article by Dr. Husayn  Shahatah  on page 5 in which he views the proposed Middle Eastern common  market from an Islamic economic standpoint. He notes that the  purpose of the Islamic economy is to develop the land to achieve  a good and dignified life for the people to worship to God.  Economy in Islam is linked to moral and religious values. God  has prohibited monopoly, fraud, and exploitation. But, the  writer continues, the proposed Middle Eastern market will not be  like that. It will be a crusader, Zionist market dominated by  the Jews. "A study and analysis of everything that has been  published about the purpose and objectives of this market  reveals that the aim is to control the resources of the Arab  Islamic nation and bring it under the hegemony of the Jews  (Israel), the United States, and the West." This is economic  exploitation. They want to subordinate the Arab Islamic states  to non-Muslims to "control their political, educational, social,  and economic decisions."  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE PREACHES ISLAMIC VALUES </H5>   Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur publishes an  1,800 word article on page 5 in which he attempts to promote  Islam. He begins by citing passages from a book by Imam  al-Banna, founder of the Islamic Brotherhood movement, entitled  "The Brothers Under the Banner of the Koran," in which he  explains the purity, honesty, and universality of the Islamic  faith. Mashhur notes that the prophet began his mission alone.  He faced great difficulties. But God's light descended on him  and dispelled the darkness of ignorance within a few years,  clearing the Arabian Peninsula of idols and infidels.    He then explains how the invasion of materialistic cultures  left their effect on the Islamic countries, prompting the  Muslims to deviate from the essence of their religion. He  quotes the following passage from Imam al-Banna's book: "Our  duty is to face this wave of materialistic culture until it  recedes and our nation becomes free of its afflictions. We must  not stop there, but pursue it in its own country until the  entire world shouts the name of the prophet, may God's prayers  and peace be upon him, and the canopy of Islam spread over the  earth."    Mashhur adds: "All Muslims have a responsibility before God  to spread this true religion and to save humanity from the  darkness of materialism, its tyranny and oppression, and to  bring humanity to the light of Islam, its justice, security, and  peace." Islam, he says, is a complete and comprehensive  religion, because it is from God, who is complete.    Mashhur then moves on to refute the claim of some "defeated  writers that the Islamists want to establish a religious  government with divine authority as in the middle ages. He also  refutes the claim that the Islamists are "seeking to overthrow  the present regime." He says this is a false claim, refuted by  reality and facts. "We believe in pluralism and democracy that  adheres to the teachings of Islam, which is the official  religion of the state. We do not believe in violence or  anything of that sort. We do not seek power for ourselves."  Those who work for Islam, he concludes, will not relax or  weaken as their reward will be with God.  <H5>  COLUMNIST HIGHLIGHTS SITUATION OF MUSLIMS IN AFRICA </H5>   In his 200-word regular column "This is Our Religion" on  page  12, Muhammad al-Ghazali brings attention to the situation of the  Muslims in Africa. He notes how European colonialism  partitioned Africa in such a way as to deprive the Muslims of an  independent state. He concludes that the "Muslims south of  Egypt and Sudan, and around the Horn of Africa are facing strife  and loss. Plans are being implemented to liquidate them and  their religion. Zionism and the crusaders are behind this new  offensive. An unjust and treacherous threat is facing the  Muslims in this area, and those of us in the Nile Valley and the  Arabian Peninsula must be aware of what is happening and probe  its dimensions. If it does not hit us today, it will not miss  us tomorrow."</p>

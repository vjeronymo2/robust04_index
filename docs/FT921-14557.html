			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / British Gas to decide on inquiry THE BOARD of British Gas meets today to decide whether to submit to a far-reaching investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The meeting comes after Ofgas, the industry regulator, expressed reluctance to accept one condition the company asked for when it agreed to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995. British Gas has agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to cut its industrial market share from 90 per cent to 40 per cent and hive off its transport division into a separate company. In return, the company expects Ofgas to review a tough new formula for domestic prices which was agreed last year and is due to come into force in April. British Gas wants the MMC to act as final arbitrator for that review if the company fails to agree changes with the regulator. While Ofgas says it would be illegal to use the MMC for such a function, British Gas says it would not. The difference of opinion hinges on an interpretation of the Gas Act, under which British Gas was privatised in 1986. Ofgas yesterday stood firm on its refusal to give British Gas further assurances over the tariff review. 'It's a matter of principle as well as a legal matter,' it said.</p>

The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Trust is a registered open-end investment company that offers ten series: The Jamestown Balanced Fund, The Jamestown Equity Fund, The Jamestown Bond Fund, The Jamestown Short Term Bond Fund, The Jamestown Tax Exempt Virginia Fund, FBP Contrarian Balanced Fund, FBP Contrarian Equity Fund, the Alabama Tax Free Bond Fund, The Government Street Bond Fund, and the Government Street Equity Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Advisors are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Each Fund is advised by one of the Advisors. One or more of the Advisors (or a successor entity) will serve as the investment adviser to the Future Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Each series of the Trust is authorized, and the Future Funds will be authorized, by their investment policies to invest in repurchase agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Each Fund has or may be expected to have uninvested cash balances with its custodian bank which otherwise would not be invested in portfolio securities by its Advisor at the end of each trading day. In the normal course of business, such assets are or would be invested in overnight repurchase agreements with a bank or major brokerage house collateralized by U.S. Government securities in order to earn additional income. Every morning each Advisor, on behalf of the Funds it serves, begins negotiating the interest rate for repurchase agreements for that day and lining up securities required as collateral. Generally, some portion of the assets in the respective account of each Fund is received too late, or is too small, to be invested effectively in a separate transaction. Further, because each Fund must separately pursue, secure, and implement such investments, there is a duplication of effort that results in certain inefficiencies and may limit the return which some or all Funds can achieve. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

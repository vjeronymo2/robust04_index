			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TURNER STATION SKIPS THE BRAVES  </P> <P> TV viewers who hoped to see Dale Murphy and Will Clark start the baseball  season were seeing Herman Munster and Jed Clampett instead, thanks to a spring  thunderstorm and programming decisions at SuperStation TBS.  </P> <P> Ted Turner's television station, WTBS, decided not to show the opener of  Turner's baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, this afternoon.  </P> <P> The season opener, against the National League champion San Francisco Giants,  was scheduled to be televised from Atlanta Tuesday night, but a strong  thunderstorm washed out the game.  </P> <P> A 5:10 p.m. EDT double-header was then scheduled for today, but a TBS Sports  spokeswoman said there are no plans to change the programming to televise  either game.  </P> <P> The TBS lineup tonight: "The Munsters," "The Beverly Hillbillies" and the  Atlanta Hawks-Milwaukee Bucks basketball game.  </P></p>

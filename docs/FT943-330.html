			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Short covering, Wall Street lift bourses Short covering lifted bourses in the morning, and Wall Street offered support in the late afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS started well, the CAC-40 index peaking at 1,925.99. It ran into trouble after lunch, rumours of a big seller in futures taking the index down fast to a low of 1,889.16, but rallied thereafter to close 3.67 higher at 1,904.95 in turnover of FFr3.19bn. Rumours also produced the main individual feature, LVMH rising FFr38 or 4.2 per cent to FFr889 on talk that a bank was buying the shares for the Christian Dior holding company. Other winners included Peugeot, up FFr9 to FFr781, as analysts revised their forecasts following this week's figures, said Mr Frederick Sauvegrain at broker Ferri International. Among financials, Societe Generale rose FFr6 to FFr540 after a good first-half report, and Credit Lyonnais recovered FFr8.20 to FFr382.20 after its report on first-half losses. Losers included Lafarge Coppee, down FFr4.40 to FFr419.50 after a satisfactory first half; GAN, the insurance company, off FFr11 at FFr290 on a profits warning; and Vallourec, the metal fabricator, down FFr30 or 9.4 per cent at FFr290 after barely breaking even in the first six months. FRANKFURT followed its pattern of recent days, with share prices led by bund futures and activity restrained by the pending German elections. The Dax index rose 9.39 to 2,068.11 as turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.3bn. Metallgesellschaft staged one of its occasional rebounds, closing DM11.50 higher at DM130 following its drop from DM211 at the end of August. In pharmaceuticals, Schering's rise of DM17.50 to DM964.50 fitted into a pattern of recent share price volatility. The star performer, once again, was SAP in computer software, up DM25 at a new closing high of DM899 after a DM24 gain on Tuesday. The stock had risen by more than 200 per cent in the past year, noted Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, adding that it was now looking expensive with a high market capitalisation to sales ratio. MILAN remained in mostly confident mood in response to the cabinet's approval of 1995 budget measures, and the Comit index rose 12.64 or 1.9 per cent to 693.55, shrugging off the general strike called for October 14 by unions opposed to pension cuts. Prices edged back from their best levels late in the day, however, after the Northern League, one of the coalition partners, gave notice of its opposition to elements of the proposed pension reforms. Hopes of improved first-half figures from Fiat today also provided support. Fiat rose L53 to L6,825 and Olivetti was up L75 at L2,150. Telecom Italia was up L157 at L4,560 after Tuesday's positive first-half results and Stet climbed L250 to L4,935 ahead of its first-half figures, due out later that day. BCI was L122 higher at L4,095 on barely changed first-half results, while Credito Italiano rose L42 to L2,250. ZURICH edged higher, the SMI index rising 9.0 to 2,590.0. Banks, under pressure in recent sessions, were the biggest beneficiaries of the easing worries about interest rates, with SBC up SFr4 to SFr370. Among insurers, Swiss Reinsurance was up SFr12 at SFr638, lifted by some bargain hunting after being sold earlier in the week on uncertainty ahead of Friday's first-half earnings announcement. Swissair picked up SFr17 to SFr852 amid recurring talk that it might soon announce an alliance with another European carrier. AMSTERDAM recovered on the back of German bunds, the AEX index rising 4.45 to 405.11. BolsWessanen picked up Fl 1.70 or 5.1 per cent to Fl 35.00 after the company announced it had reached an agreement to acquire at least 33 per cent of the Italian drinks maker Davide Campari Milan. Gist Brocades, the biochemical group, added 90 cents at Fl 45.00 on the sale of its unprofitable yeast making activities in the US. DSM gained Fl 3.10 at Fl 154.60 following a positive presentation to analysts. MADRID's relief on interest rates took the general index back through 300 with a rise of 4.74 to 301.98. ADR stocks reflected a good morning on Wall Street, with Telefonica up Pta45 at Pta1,760, Repsol by Pta85 at Pta3,950 and Edndesa Pta100 better at Pta5,590. BRUSSELS drew inspiration from the Fed's decision to leave US interest rates unchanged and the Bel-20 index rose 13.52 to 1,398.47. Arbed, the Luxembourg steelmaker, rose a further BFr230 or 4.8 per cent to BFr5,000 in response to its announcement on Tuesday that it had priced, and sold a 1m-share private international offering at BFr4,550 a share, and on news of its positive earnings outlook. TEL AVIV followed Sunday's 2.8 per cent fall, and two days' holiday, with a 2.7 per cent drop, the Mishtanim index falling 5.12 to 186.68. On Sunday afternoon, Israel's central bank raised its basic lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to 15.5 per cent.

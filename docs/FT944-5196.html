			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Observer: Taking a bath Observer's learned readers spy greater depths of significance in Bill Rooney's decision to stage his comeback - just over a year after being kicked out of Spring Ram - via another bathroom goods supplier called Atreus. A doomed family of classical antiquity it may be, this House of Atreus, but it looks as if Rooney did his research. After all, where did Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus choose to murder the queen's husband, Atreus scion Agamemnon, on his return from Troy? In the bath, of course. Another reader, meanwhile, believes the choice is not just symmetric, but prophetic, too. For it was to the House of Atreus that Hermes gave a Ram (Golden rather than Spring, but still) which conferred kingship on its possessor. In one version of the myth, Atreus carelessly loses the Ram to his brother Thyestes and, endeavouring to get it back, hits upon the idea of feeding Thyestes with the flesh of his own children. Which has to signify that Rooney is planning a bid for his old company during which he will make mincemeat of the current directors. Doesn't it?</p>

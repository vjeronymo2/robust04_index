			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bombardier to launch 70-seat Dash 8 airliner BOMBARDIER, the Canadian transportation group, announced that it is set to launch the 70-seat turbo-prop de Havilland Dash 8-400 airliner early next year. The Dash 8 family will then include 37-, 50- and 70-seat aircraft designed for short distance service. The company said that nearly 400 Dash 8 aircraft have been sold to 60 airlines in 22 countries. The new 400 model will integrate with existing Dash 8 fleets. At 350 knots, the aircraft will carry 70 passengers 500 nautical miles in 107 minutes. Maximum range is 1,240 nautical miles. The first flight is due in July 1996, and Canadian certification in September 1997, with deliveries starting a month later. Bombardier is also well advanced with developing a 70-seat version of its 50-passenger Regional Jet, now in service in Europe and North America. The CRJ-X will have commonality with the smaller RJ and use the same flight simulators. Range will be up to 1,365 nautical miles.</p>

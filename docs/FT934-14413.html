			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: What to do if you're flooded THE ASSOCIATION of British Insurers has published some guidelines on how to cope with floods, minimise the damage, and ensure your insurance claim can be processed smoothly. If a flood seems imminent, move as much as possible to upper floors including food, clothing, drinking water, battery radio and torch. Put sandbags in front of doors and air bricks. Do not use gas, electricity or tap water until you are told it is safe. Once the water has subsided, leave windows, doors and cupboards open and lift one or two floorboards to allow air to cirulate. Pull furniture away from walls and keep rooms heated. Check the building for new cracks. If temporary repairs could prevent further damage, go ahead as soon as possible, rather than waiting for the insurer to approve. Do not throw away anything damaged irreparably for which you might need to claim: the insurer could want to see it. Keep all receipts for repairs, temporary accommodation and so on. These also will help to back up a claim. Many insurers have emergency telephone helplines. Check your policy documents for a number.</p>

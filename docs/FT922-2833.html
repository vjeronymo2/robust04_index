			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: German bonds take over as star performers IN THE aftermath of the Danish referendum, Bunds have been the star performers of the European government security markets - but only in relative terms. At the end of last week, the yield on 10-year benchmark government bunds was in the range of 7.90-7.92 per cent, compared with a yield of around 7.95 per cent on June 2, the day of the referendum. This small increase in absolute price terms translates into a considerable outperformance when compared with soaring yields in other European bond markets. The reason? There has been a flight to quality as investors sold high-yielding bonds which were supposed to benefit from the Maastricht convergence process. Against the background of uncertainty, bunds offer a haven. But the cash realised by selling peseta or lira bonds was not automatically switched into the bund market: as Mr Reiner Back, senior analyst with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt says, there would have been a more definitive rise in bund prices if this had been so. 'The massive overweight positions in so-called 'convergence plays' - the story of the last six months - have been unwound,' says Mr Mark Houghton-Berry at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'But there has been a general shift in sentiment away from Europe altogether.' It appears the cash has gone into high-yielding D-Mark bank accounts - to the short end of the yield curve - or switched to US or Canadian dollar bond markets. The fact is that on strictly fundamental grounds, bunds are no more attractive than they were a month ago - when investors were worried about the outlook for German money supply figures, inflation and public spending. There is no more likelihood now that interest rates will be cut soon - the fond hope of overseas investors who bought heavily after rates were lifted to historically high levels last December. Economists remain convinced a cut is unlikely to happen until the latter part of the year at the earliest, and perhaps not this year at all. Mr Back predicts a wave of buying later this month and next as the headline inflation figures show a definite drop. He forecasts year-on-year inflation will be 4.2 per cent this month and 3.3 per cent for July, against 4.6 per cent in April. Mr Robert Barrie, European economist with BZW Securities in London, says the sharp drop in the inflation rate expected for next month is largely due to last summer's mineral oil tax rises dropping out of the calculation. The outlook for underlying inflation is still poor, and this, not the headline rate, is likely to influence the Bundesbank's interest rate policy.</p>

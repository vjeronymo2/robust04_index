			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified official spokesman on the call by </F> French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao and Home Minister S.B. Chavan on 4 April]    [Text] While briefing newsmen, the official spokesman  stated that the French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, called  on our prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, today morning.  Both sides emphasized the traditional affinity between India  and France. The French foreign minister stressed the need for  increased economic cooperation in the light of economic reforms  in India and said that it was their intention to attend the  joint commission meeting at the ministerial level later this  year. A visit by a French business delegation is also envisaged  this year.    Our prime minister briefed Mr. Juppe on our relations with  neighboring countries and underlined the challenge to our  territorial integrity on account of Pakistan's interference and  support to terrorism on Indian soil. The prime minister  indicated that India was open to bilateral discussions with  Pakistan. Mr. Juppe said that France opposed  internationalization of the Kashmir dispute. He said that they  understood India's position and hoped that bilateral discussions  between India and France [as received] would soon be resumed.    On NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty], our prime minister  mentioned that the NPT review conference of 1995 provided  suitable opportunity for a genuine review of the treaty to make  it universal and nondiscriminatory. In this context, the prime  minister pointed out that India's action plan presented an  approach which was exemplary.    While briefing newsmen, the official spokesman stated that  the French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, met our home  minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, today. The discussions focussed on  terrorism and fundamentalism aided and instigated by Pakistan.  He briefed Mr. Juppe extensively on the J and K [Jammu and  Kashmir] situation and the problems posed by Pakistani support  in the context of our efforts to revive the political process in  Jammu and Kashmir. The home minister said that the phenomenon  of terrorism was not something faced by India alone and a global  approach was necessary to counter this menace.    Mr. Juppe said that France also had been a victim of  terrorism at different periods of its history and would welcome  an exchange of views and information through bilateral channels.  The home minister mentioned that India was awaiting the visit  of the French interior minister, Mr. Charles Pasqua, who has  been invited by our home minister and the invitation has been  accepted.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is clear from the RSPA's analysis of information and data obtained in conducting the March 1991 EFRD study, that spillage from a pipeline failure can be significantly reduced by RCVs only where a modern SCADA system is equipped with a well-designed leak detection subsystem. The type and sophistication of the control system, installed as part of an existing SCADA system, depends on the age of the control system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March 1991 EFRD study contained a number of proposals to address the issue of EFRDs. One of the proposals was that the Department conduct a research study on whether SCADA systems, including well-designed leak detection subsystems, should be required on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to enhance the safe operation of the pipelines. Enhanced safety requirements would include provision for more rapid response following accidents, including valve spacing criteria and initiating the closure of RCVs. This study is presently being conducted by the Volpe National Transportation System Center (VNTSC) and is discussed later in this ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another proposal from this study was for the RSPA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to require, on hazardous liquid pipelines with SCADA systems installed, that existing manually operated main line block valves <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in urban areas be retrofitted to make them RCVs and install RCVs when new valves are installed in urban areas. This ANPRM seeks data on valves located in urban areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A valve which provides a positive shut off of commodity flow both upstream and downstream of the valve is generally known as a ``block valve'' because it blocks the flow in the pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other proposals in the study suggested public input on whether the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR part 195 should be revised to require valve spacing criteria for EFRDs at the following locations: (1) Where the valves could most effectively reduce the likelihood of the escaping liquid entering the water at water crossings that are more than 100-feet wide, and on either side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption; (2) At other critical areas affected by commodity release; and (3) At specific locations outside of urban areas on hazardous liquid pipelines in proximity to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the questions posed in this ANPRM are designed to provide data on which the RSPA will decide on a further course of action concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs in these locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Past Data Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To broaden the data base for the March 1991 EFRD study, the RSPA solicited information from the public, including gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators and equipment manufacturers, through a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (54 FR 20945; May 15, 1989). A series of 15 questions addressed a number of EFRD/leak detection-related issues including SCADA technology, establishing a maximum allowable spill value, and criteria for valve spacing. The 72 responses to the notice are contained in Docket PS&hyph;104; Notice 1 and are available for review in the Docket Unit, room 8421.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice included a series of questions about leak detection subsystems which are part of operators' SCADA systems. The responses to the questions indicated SCADA systems are becoming more sophisticated and leak detection subsystems are becoming more common on hazardous liquid pipelines. The sensitivity of leak detection subsystems on hazardous liquid pipelines was reported to range from 0.5 percent of flow to 5 percent of flow over a 1- to 2-hour period. Once a leak is suspected, the time for the dispatcher to respond by closing valves ranges from a few minutes for an RCV to an average of about 2 hours for manually operated valves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters to the notice were also asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a valve spacing requirement based on a maximum spill criterion. Two advantages cited by commenters to support establishing a maximum spill criterion on a hazardous liquid pipeline were: (1) Reduction in the exposure to the public of the possible hazard created by a spill and (2) improved contingency plans since the plans could be based on a spill of a set volume. However, commenters cited more disadvantages than advantages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

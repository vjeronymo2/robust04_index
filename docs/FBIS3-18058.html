"Italy has taken part with great commitment in international  actions, not only with the European diplomatic and political  negotiations, with the Americans, Russians, and the sides in  conflict, but also by putting its bases at the disposal of NATO  for air action and with the naval patrols and the management of  the embargo," he said in an official statement.    "The truce at Sarajevo is certainly an important success for  peace action, but it must not make us lose sight of the primary  need to help the sides to find concrete and lasting solutions  that respect the many human and political needs of populations  that have suffered and which face a dim and uncertain future.    "That is why the Italian reaction -- preliminary, since  Yeltsin's ideas have still to be made known -- must be very  reserved, if not actually negative: the formula proposed by  Russia excludes Europe, just when the European Union peace plan  has acquired -- again yesterday at the Bonn meeting with the  Americans and Russians -- a truly central place in the common  peace effort.    "Even the United Nations, whose legitimacy in the conscience  of the international community is a basis for the more peaceful  post-Cold War world, would be excluded from the so-called  5-nation summit.    "It certainly strikes us as negative that Italy was not  cited  as one of the participants, but we do not know if the summit  will take place, given the aforementioned incongruities. Our  role, and our action for a cause in which we believe, with the  full support of Parliament and the country, would certainly not  be diminished by it: but the effectiveness of international  action would certainly be diminished by a prevalently  inter-posed, misplaced and hurriedly prepared event, just when  the hopes of tortured populations were beginning to find some  concrete elements to express themselves."</p>

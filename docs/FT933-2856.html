			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: General Dynamics pays out Dollars 372m GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which has been shrinking through the sale of large parts of its business, yesterday announced plans to distribute Dollars 372m, or Dollars 12 a share, of the disposal proceeds to its shareholders - the third such cash disbursement this year. General Dynamics said that the total represented substantially all of the cash available for tax-advantaged distribution from sales of businesses to date. The company paid out Dollars 20 a share in April and Dollars 18 a share in July. The latest distribution will be made on October 12 to shareholders of record on September 28. General Dynamics shares closed Dollars 2 7/8 higher at Dollars 99 1/2 . Mr William Anders, chairman, said the move underscored 'our continuing belief that the most efficient way to convert surplus defence assets to productive non-defence uses is to return funds in excess of our financial and reinvestment needs directly to our investors'. The company also increased its quarterly dividend by 50 per cent to 60 cents a share, reflecting the board's confidence in the stability of its strong cash flows.</p>

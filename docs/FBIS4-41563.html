			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, 25 Jun -- Lithuania's foreign policy  blueprint, the forthcoming Riga meeting between the heads of the  Baltic states and the U.S. President on 6 July, the progress of  the talks with the CIS, and the recently formulated draft law on  the diplomatic service were discussed in the Seimas on Friday at  a session of the coordinating council on foreign affairs. Its  head is Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas.    According to a report from the republic's media,  presidential  adviser Justas Paleckis told journalists that Lithuania's  foreign policy blueprint has been drawn up and will shortly be  submitted for discussion by the members of the Seimas.  "Lithuania must more actively integrate itself into West  European economic, political, and military structures, while  maintaining good relations with all countries in the world, and  primarily with its neighbors, purposefully play the part of an  East-West `bridge' and become a country of international  transit. That is, perhaps, the essence of Lithuania's foreign  policy blueprint," he stated.    It was also noted at the session that, at the meeting with  the U.S. President, it will be necessary to seek a reinforcement  of the moral support for independence by economic and social  measures, by attracting U.S. investment and also through  cooperation in the economic and scientific domain.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Radical monetarists under fire SENIOR figures in Russian politics and industry yesterday mounted a series of attacks on the government in the run-up to the Congress of People's Deputies next Monday, aimed at forcing a change of the course of economic reform. They are demanding a relaxation of credit to prevent the collapse of industry. The attacks came as Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister and a close aide to President Boris Yeltsin, announced his resignation. He claimed that deputies were trying to squeeze out Yeltsin supporters from the congress by stripping him and other ministers of their parliamentary seats. They had used a Russian law prohibiting deputies from holding government positions as a cover to 'exclude us all from active work at the coming Congress . . . and thus decrease the numbers of the supporters of Yeltsin and his reforms'. Yesterday's attacks on government policy were from 'critical supporters' - but showed that the constituency for the kind of radical monetary policies which the government maintains has shrunk to virtually zero. It seems likely that other figures may have to follow Mr Shakhrai into retirement in order to placate the deputies. However, an announcement on Russia's admission to the International Monetary Fund, which may come next week, would give the government a much needed boost. The heaviest salvo was fired by Mr Arkady Volsky, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists, who has so far maintained a critically supportive position towards economic reform. In an article in the daily Rabochaya Tribuna, Mr Volsky said industry was in a parlous state, with huge unsold stocks and vast debts. Western specialists working in the agricultural sector fear that a lack of reform will mean a continuing deterioration, and greater dependence on western aid. A rise in oil prices - scheduled for May or June  - would cause 'serious upheaval', Mr Volsky said. Admitting the need for a rise in prices to stem the uncontrolled outflow of oil through the Baltic states at low prices, he called for a three-stage, three-year transition to world prices. The cause of the industrialists was further supported by Professor Yevgeny Yasin, recently appointed as a plenipotentiary to explain the government's economic policies to parliament. Professor Yasin, who said his slogan was 'criticise, but support', said that enterprise debts to banks and to each other stood at Rbs600bn, against about Rbs40bn a year ago. Working capital had fallen in real terms by 10-12 times. 'The price rises were higher, the squeeze on the money supply was stronger and the extent of the payments crisis greater than the government expected. There must be more flexibility on credit policy: the government must learn that it cannot both liberalise and stabilise the currency, and that liberalisation is now the most important thing.' Leaders of the two separate chambers of the Russian parliament warned of 'disintegration' if economic reform continued on its present course.</p>

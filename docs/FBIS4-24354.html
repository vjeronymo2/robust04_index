			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] French troops have been in our country for the  last [word indistinct] days. The French defense minister  reportedly has arrived in Cyangugu, southwestern Rwanda, to  inspect his troops, and is accompanied by the French official in  charge of humanitarian affairs. [passage omitted]    On 27 June the French carried out so-called patrols, up to  20  km from the battlefront, in Gikongoro [words indistinct]. It is  worth recalling the RPF's conditions for avoiding fighting  between the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] and the French Army  [words indistinct]. First, the French Forces must not overstep  their humanitarian mission. Second, French troops should not  cross the borderline of the western region. Third, the French  presence in Rwanda must end in July, as announced by the French  Government itself.    Some of these three points, which should govern Operation  Turquoise, have already been overstepped. As we have just told  you, French (?troops) have started to approach the combat zone.  Their mission has also started to show its nonhumanitarian  character. How can one assess the fact that French soldiers  abandoned 100 Tutsis they found being pursued in Kibuye Forest  by the Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy  and Development militia], who had just killed one of the Tutsis?  Is that not a reconnaissance mission being carried out by the  French soldiers on behalf of the militias responsible for the  genocide of the Kibuye region? [passage omitted]    Briefly, the French military operation in Rwanda is just  meant to explore mass graves [words indistinct]. If the French  mission is really humanitarian, why can't they disarm the  killers found at crime spots. [passage indistinct] A wise man  said you can fool some people some of the time, but not all the  people all of the time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At 12:02 Moscow time on Saturday the military-space  forces of the Russian Defense Ministry launched a reusable  booster Zenit-2 with a space craft Cosmos aboard.    Commenting this event, experts of the military space forces  point out that in the framework of the state military space  program Russia continues to supplement the grouping of  satellites used in the interests of the Defense Ministry.    The reusable booster Zenit-2 is used to boost into orbit  different space crafts with the disposable weight about 12.5  tonnes to the height of 200 kilometers (it was designed by the  design bureau Yuzhnoye, the city of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine).  In accordance with the Russian state order which is in force  till early 1995 the scientific-industrial association Yuzhnoye  in Dnepropetrovsk will produce 3-5 reusable boosters Zenit-2  annually.    Zenit-2 was created in the frameworks of the program  Energiya- Buran to be used as a side-mounting booster.    In addition, there are certain plans to use Zenit-2 instead  of the returnable booster Soyuz to boost manned space crafts  into orbit. In addition, scientists are considering the issue  to launch space crafts of the type Soyuz-TM into the near-earth  orbit with a decline 51.6 grades from the Russian cosmodrome  Plesetsk. The construction of a launching site consisting of  two launching devices of the reusable booster Zenit is being  completed here. The first launch from the cosmodrome Plesetsk  is scheduled for 1997.    Experts also do not rule out possibility to use the boosters  Zenit in the program of the international space station on the  project Alfa. At present only one launching site situated on  the cosmodrome Baykonur is used to launch Zenit boosters.  Another one was completely destructed during the explosion of a  rocket on October 4, 1990. There are no plans on its  restoration.    Experts of the military space forces assert that Zenit-2  booster is an ecologically pure rocket (its fuel -- kerosene,  liquid oxygen is the oxidizer). The over-all weight of the  rocket is 259 tonnes. Until now Zenit booster was used only to  boost space crafts into orbit in the interests of the Russian  Defense Ministry. A new modification of the rocket Zenit-3 is  being developed on the basis of Zenit-2. It will be used to  boost space crafts into geostationary and planetary orbits.</p>

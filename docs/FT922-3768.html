			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland holders turn tail MORE HEAVY selling of Midland Bank by arbitrageurs, mostly from the US, who have been disappointed by last week's turn of events in the battle for control of the bank, and in particular by the withdrawal of Lloyds Bank from the contest, saw Midland shares under severe pressure again. They closed 27 down at 419p, having been as low as 414p. Turnover reached 12m. A leading trader in the shares commented: 'There was a panic to get out first thing and the stock has barely recovered.' It was suggested that arbitrageurs were not keen to take on Hongkong and Shanghai Banking scrip and had sold their stock into the market. HK Banking shares were believed to have met considerable selling pressure in the Far East after London closed last night. The rest of the banking arena was littered with sizeable falls, specialists taking the view that the market would now concentrate on the bad news that is still overshadowing the sector. A growing feeling that a Lloyds Bank move against other so-called bid targets is now most unlikely left TSB 7 lower at 144p and Royal Bank of Scotland 9 off at 193p. Standard Chartered, surrounded by worries that its exposure to hefty losses in India may be way above the Pounds 50m figure already factored in by the bank, dropped 12 to 464p. Lloyds, belaboured by the weekend press, lost 6 to 430p. Utilities fall The regional electricity companies were the major casualties in a generally unhappy utilities area of the market, with SG Warburg Securities, the leading UK brokerage, said by dealers to have instigated some substantial selling of the individual stocks and the Electricity Package. The broker was said to have highlighted the increased likelihood of Professor Littlechild, the electricity regulator, launching an attack on the profits achieved by the regional electricity stocks over the past year. These were up 40 per cent on average, well above expectations, with dividend growth expected to be some three times the rate of inflation and substantially more than other utilities which have already been exposed to the power of the regulatory bodies. Warburg is thought to have adopted a particularly cautious stance on East Midland (7 lower at 295p), Northern (3 off at 327p), Seeboard (5 easier at 323p) and Yorkshire Electricity (11 down at 362p). The Electricity Package fell 48 to Pounds 3165. A squeeze and full-year results in excess of market expectations combined to cause a strong advance in UK airports operator BAA, making it the day's best performing FT-SE Index stock. The shares climbed 15 in early trading and were up 20 at the day's best after the company reported annual profits of Pounds 192m, down 22 per cent from the previous year's but better than market forecasts. Trading was further enhanced by an accompanying statement predicting annual growth in air travel of between 5 and 8 per cent. Mr Christopher Will at Lehman Brothers said: 'This is a solid result in a year that was difficult as the company recovered from the effects of the Gulf war and the continued recession.' Mr Will maintained his forecast for the year to March 1993 at a high Pounds 315m, which even he believes is 'a little demanding'. Cazenove was among leading brokers reported to have quickly moved to upgrade forecasts. The shares eventually came off the top to close at 679p, up a net 14, with turnover rising to 2.4m. ICI stood out with a 15 fall to 1312p amid concern that the European Community's farm policy reforms would have an adverse effect on the company's important agrochemicals business. Wellcome, sustained by a bullish article on its Zovirax anti-herpes drug, managed a minor rise against the market trend to close at 947p. Vodafone eased a fraction to 370p ahead of today's preliminary figures, which are expected to show profits of Pounds 265m, against last year's Pounds 244m. Excellent preliminary results with profits up 10 per cent helped Electronic Data advance 12 to 525p. The recent BZW buy recommendation continued to stimulate support for GEC, 2 firmer at 224p. Trading in property issues was subdued ahead of this week's clutch of results, with analysts saying that in the present depressed circumstances dividends are likely to be of particular importance. Great Portland Estates dipped 4 to 153p ahead of today's figures, while Regalian, with results tomorrow, weakened 5 to 20p. British Land gave up 2 to 204p as the market awaited Thursday's data from the company. Cadbury Schweppes was one of the brighter spots in the market, but in light turnover, rising 6 to 475p. Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst at Nomura, said that although he had not changed his profits forecasts for this year or next, he regarded the present share price as being attractive on fundamentals alone. He pointed out that the present price/earnings ratio is at a premium of only 6 per cent to the market, which historically is low for such a quality stock. Mr Short added that the company appears to be doing well in spite of the recession and that the underlying situation is good. This also discounted the ongoing bid speculation centring on suggestions of a possible offer from US tobacco group Philip Morris. Regional brewer Marston Thompson and Evershed, in which Whitbread has a 36.6 per cent stake, gained 5 to a year's high of 264p ahead of today's results. The shares continue to attract bid speculation on suggestions that the national brewer's interests could be served best by selling its entire holding in Marston. Boots remained under a cloud, losing 12 to 447p, following disappointment with the results announced last week and negative comment in a Sunday newspaper about the company's long term strategy. BPB retreated 6 to 180p after another profits downgrading, while Pilkington, the glass manufacturer, dipped 5 to 132p ahead of Thursday's preliminary figures, which some analysts say may see the company cut the dividend. Euro Disney fell 20 to 1083p in thin trade as the stock continued to be hurt by last week's disappointing results and Friday's reported credit rating lowering by Morgan Stanley of Walt Disney, Euro Disney's US parent company. Transport Development Group declined 12 to 280p. Downward profit revisions are in the air after the company was reported to have indicated to City analysts that current year expectations around the Pounds 43m mark may be a little too high. Lucas Industries receded 7 to 130p. There was talk that James Capel, which cut its profits estimates for the company last week, was taking a further look at the figures with a further downgrading a possibility.

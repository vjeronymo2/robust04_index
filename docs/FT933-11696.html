			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Peace made in tunnel dispute EUROTUNNEL and the contractors building the Channel tunnel yesterday announced an agreement to end their long conflict, paving the way for a phased opening of the tunnel next year. The 20-page agreement between Eurotunnel and Transmanche-Link, the Anglo-French consortium of contractors building the tunnel, is aimed at settling the bitter dispute over which of the two should be responsible for heavy cost overruns. The contractors have claimed about Pounds 1.2bn. The deal does not settle the claim, but disentangles it from the task of completing, testing and commissioning the tunnel so that the opening can go ahead unimpeded. A target date of December 10 has been set for TML's handover of the project to Eurotunnel. The parties have agreed on how the remaining commissioning tests should be carried out. Between now and the handover, Eurotunnel will advance Pounds 235m to TML as a downpayment on the settlement of its claims, providing TML with an injection of working capital. Eurotunnel is arranging a stand-by facility of Pounds 120m so that the extra payment does not cause it to run out of cash before a rights issue expected next spring. The deal will require the approval of 220 banks in the syndicate, led by National Westminster, Midland, Credit Lyonnais and BNP. They have to approve the Pounds 120m facility and changes to construction agreements. Bankers said they expected the changes to be agreed without difficulty. The Pounds 120m standby facility would be syndicated within the current bank group. Mr Neville Sims, TML co-chairman, said yesterday that the Bank of England had 'held the ring' at five meetings attended by a representative of the main banks. Without Bank of England help, it 'could have taken several months rather than weeks'. The deal means that freight trains and shuttles carrying lorries should start passing through the tunnel early next March, with shuttle trains for cars by the beginning of May and passenger services by October. Eurotunnel's share price gained 27p yesterday to close at 434p. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Egyptian minister escapes attack Mr Safwat el-Sherif, Egypt's minister of information, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt yesterday in which his driver and bodyguard were both wounded, writes Roger Matthews, Middle East Editor. Gunmen with automatic weapons opened fire on the minister's car as he was leaving his home in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis. Mr el-Sherif escaped with a cut hand in what appears to be the latest attempt by Islamic extremists to destabilise President Hosni Mubarak's government. Mr el-Sherif, the longest-serving minister in the cabinet, is responsible for efforts by the official media to counter the growing influence of Islamic groups.</p>

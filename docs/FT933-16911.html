			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / News At Ten to stay put after wave of political protest NEWS AT TEN, ITV's flagship television news programme, is to keep its traditional slot for the foreseeable future after political protests at suggestions that it might move to an earlier time. The ITV companies that were suggesting the programme should be moved, possibly to as early as 6.30pm, backed down yesterday in the face of firm opposition from the Independent Television Commission and growing parliamentary pressure which included a letter from Mr John Major, the prime minister, expressing concern. Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, wrote to the chairmen of all 15 regional ITV companies, warning them that they risked being in breach of their broadcasting licences if they moved the main evening news without ITC permission. Eight of the companies had proposed in their bids for franchises running the main evening news at 10pm, and the ITC legal advice is that those commitments represent core obligations of their broadcasting licences. Earlier, Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, had suggested that hostile parliamentary opinion on the News At Ten issue might have flowed over to ITV ownership issues. A number of large ITV companies want a relaxation of the rules to allow the nine largest companies to take over each other. Such a move, if the government goes ahead with it, would require a resolution in both houses of parliament. Although the ITV companies could challenge the ITC interpretation of its powers in the courts, that is now unlikely to happen. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV council, last night said ITV would take into consideration 'the full range of programming, public-interest, commercial and legal issues, and it will only consider changes which are permissible within the law'. Mr Dyke said the issue was now unlikely to be resolved as planned at a meeting on Monday. ITV executives conceded last night that the idea of moving ITN to the early evening had been an 'own goal', and a detailed business assessment had never been prepared. LWT staff petition, Page 7</p>

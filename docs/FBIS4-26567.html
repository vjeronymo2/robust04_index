			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, former Foreign Secretary Lord Howe  observed on a recent visit, is a "magnificent living plant." It  is an organic, changing society, which has continued to develop  since he negotiated the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and  set the seal on the territory's return to Chinese control. Yet  some members of China's Hong Kong transition team, the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), seem to assume the  territory's legal, political, and social development should have  been frozen at the moment the treaty was signed and to regard  any changes that have taken place since as a breach of the  agreement.    The PWC Legal Affairs Subgroup, however, is made up of  experienced lawyers and should be a forum where such opinions  are out of fashion. That they are not tells us much more work  has to go into persuading some Chinese officials and pro-China  figures here that the territory has changed over the past 10  years and its laws can, and should, reflect the changes.    Shao Tianren, the group's mainland co-convenor, and his  local  counterpart, former Appeals Court judge Simon Li Fook-sean, have  warned that planned amendments to the Public Order Ordinance and  the Societies Ordinance, aimed at relaxing controls on freedom  of assembly and the ban on links to organisations overseas,  would violate the Joint Declaration's provision that "the laws  currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged".    Article 3 (3) of the Joint Declaration, from which that  phrase is taken, was not intended to embalm the body of Hong  Kong law exactly as it stood in December 1984. On the contrary,  Article 3 sets out the basic policies of the People's Republic  of China for the Special Administrative Region (SAR). It should  be clear that the agreement to leave the laws basically  unchanged applies to laws currently in force at the time of the  creation of the SAR on July 1, 1997. The article is intended to  reassure the people of Hong Kong that China has given legal  backing to its promise that their way of life will continue  after 1997.    The PWC is on stronger ground if it argues that the  government's proposals relaxing the Societies Ordinance are in  conflict with the Basic Law. Article 23, introduced as an  afterthought into the second draft in the light of Hong Kong's  strong reaction to the June 4, 1989, crackdown on the Chinese  democracy movement, bans subversion against the Central People's  Government, prohibits foreign political organisations, and bans  local political groups from establishing links with foreign  organisations. It is harder to attack the revisions to the  Public Order Ordinance, since the Basic Law guarantees "freedom  of association, of assembly, of procession, and of  demonstration."    It is for the SAR government to decide if the changes that  have taken place before its establishment should be reversed to  conform with the Basic Law. But it will have to reflect, as the  PWC should be reflecting today, that the changes in Hong Kong  society are not imposed from the outside by the British  administration but have often been forced from the  administration with great reluctance in response to organic  changes within society. Hong Kong did not begin to change with  the arrival of Chris Patten but long before. That development  was recognised and encouraged by the Joint Declaration, which  called for the legislature to be constituted by elections and  guaranteed the same freedoms later enshrined in the Basic Law.  China seems to have begun to regret those enlightened and  farsighted policies in 1989. But it is in Beijing's interests,  and Hong Kong's, to return to the views that helped shape the  Joint Declaration.</p>

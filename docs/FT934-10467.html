			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Charities' funding code to be examined A CODE of practice for government departments funding the voluntary sector 'merits serious consideration', Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said yesterday. Such a code was recommended in a report resulting from discussions between charity representatives and government departments. The report, published by three charity umbrella bodies, warned that the government should not place extra demands on the voluntary sector without providing adequate resources. The proposed code would cover such matters as the time-scale of grants, the need to support voluntary organisations' staff training and development, and the importance of contributing to central overheads as well as funding specific projects. Mr Howard told the Charities Aid Foundation conference in London yesterday that he would ask the government's Ministerial Group on the Voluntary Sector to examine the possibility of a code when it meets later this month. Controversy erupted last month over another report, by three former advisers to the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit, which recommended that charities should lose tax relief now that many receive public funds to deliver services. Mr John Major, the prime minister, moved quickly to stress that tax relief would be retained, and Mr Howard yesterday distanced the government further from the report. A widening income gap between the biggest charities and others is revealed in the latest edition of CAF's Charity Trends, published yesterday. The top 200 fundraising charities increased their total income by 4 per cent in real terms, and expenditure rose by a similar amount. But income of the next 200 largest charities fell by 9 by cent, forcing them to cut expenditure by about 8 per cent. Total income of the top 400 charities was Pounds 2.8bn in 1991-92 - an annual rise of only 1 per cent, compared with an 8 per cent increase the previous year.</p>

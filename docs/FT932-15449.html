			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel buoyed by exceptionally strong first term INTEL yesterday consolidated its position as the world's leading computer chip maker with exceptionally strong first-quarter earnings and revenues on the back of brisk sales of PCs using its microprocessors. The unexpectedly robust results, and a bullish forecast for the second quarter, lifted shares across the semiconductor manufacturing sector. Intel firmed Dollars 4 1/2 to close at Dollars 117 1/2 , Motorola climbed Dollars 2 to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 3/8 and Advanced Micro Devices hit a year-high of Dollars 25 3/4 , up Dollars  3/4 . For the three months to March 27, Intel posted net profits of Dollars 547.9m, or Dollars 2.48 a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.02bn. This compares with earnings of Dollars 184.1m, or 86 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn a year earlier. Wall Street had expected Intel to report earnings of about Dollars 2.13 a share, and few analysts had expected per-share earnings to exceed Dollars 2.40. Mr Andrew Grove, chief executive, said: 'It took us 22 years to get to the Dollars 1bn a quarter in revenues and, thanks to the explosion in demand for the Intel 486 chip, less than three years to get to Dollars 2bn a quarter.' Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips which form the brains of more than 70 per cent of the world's PCs. The company recently unveiled plans to add a Dollars 1bn expansion to its New Mexico plant. MOTOROLA, the US electronics manufacturer, also exceeded expectations by posting 63 per cent improvement in underlying first quarter earnings to Dollars 204m, or 75 cents a share, on sales which rose 19 per cent to Dollars 3.63bn. Wall Street had expected earnings of 64 cents a share. A year earlier, Motorola reported underlying earnings of Dollars 125m, or 47 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.05bn. A change in accounting standards reduced last year's net income to Dollars 2m, or 1 cent a share.</p>

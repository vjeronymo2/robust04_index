			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man arrested hours after a La Jolla robbery may be the Beachcomber Bandit,  authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> FBI agents dubbed the gunman in three robberies committed in the last month the  Beachcomber Bandit because of his penchant for robbing coastal banks.  </P> <P> James L. Savage, 42, was arrested at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday after a witness to the  La Jolla robbery at 10:30 a.m. gave police a partial license plate number for  the getaway car, a gray Mercedes-Benz, San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson  said Thursday.  </P> <P> More than $2,000 was taken from the Security Pacific Bank at University Towne  Centre, Robinson said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a witness to the robbery of a Del Mar bank told police of a gray  Mercedes heading for the coast, Robinson said. Police began searching coastal  motels and found a gray Mercedes stolen from Van Nuys at the Village Motel, 944  Camino del Mar in Del Mar.  </P> <P> The motel's manager told police a man matching the description of the La Jolla  bank robber had been living in Room 7 for about a month, Robinson said.  Officers waited for Savage to come out of his room and arrested him. Armed with  a search warrant for his room, they found a pistol, cash and clothing matching  the description of those worn by the robber.  </P> <P> Savage was turned over to FBI agents and is being held at the federal  Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego.  </P></p>

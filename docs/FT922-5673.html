			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 20% of Wellcome equity expected to be held in US after Jluy flotation ADVISERS TO Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, expect as much as a fifth of its equity will be held in North America after July's flotation of up to 50 per cent of its stock. The company is applying for a 'big board' listing on the New York Stock Exchange to encourage US investors. Both Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham have such listings. Their US shareholdings are 27 per cent and 35 per cent respectively. The proportion at Wellcome, which is only on the pink sheet and is not quoted live, is only 2 per cent. Wellcome is preparing a series of roadshows in Europe and the US, and possibly the Far East to generate interest in the flotation. The company believes that after the offer about 5 per cent of the stock will be held in the Far East and about 5 per cent on the Continent. Last month Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of Wellcome, was given permission by the Charity Commission to sell up to 417m shares, reducing its holding in the company to as little as 25 per cent. The issue could raise more than Pounds 4bn. Meanwhile, the company announced yesterday it has set up a co-marketing agreement with Wyeth-Ayerst, a subsidiary of American Home Products, to promote Zovirax in the US for the treatment of chicken pox. The move is part of Wellcome's strategy of supplementing its own sales forces though co-marketing agreements to exploit its marketing weakness. It has already set up agreements to market Zovirax with Hoechst in Germany, Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan. Wyeth-Ayerst will be responsible for selling the drug directly to paediatricians, while Wellcome's American subsidiary, Burroughs Wellcome, will focus on other primary care physicians. Burroughs Wellcome has about 780 sales representatives. About 3.4m people contract chicken pox in the US each year. Before the agreement, SG Warburg, the company's broker, estimated additional sales of Zovirax for chicken pox would be about Pounds 15m by 1994. This assumed 20 per cent of patients would use the drug which costs between Dollars 35 and Dollars 50 per treatment. Merck of the US has developed a chicken pox vaccine, but it has not yet been licenced. Glaxo, the UK drugs giant, yesterday opened a Pounds 16m research and development centre at the Madrid high technology park north of the Spanish capital. The centre will be staffed initially by 75 scientists and technicians and will eventually have 200.</p>

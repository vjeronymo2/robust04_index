			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: US banking results offer evidence of recovery SHARES in Wells Fargo, the California-based banking group, jumped 14.9 per cent yesterday after it reported first-quarter financial results which dipped from a year ago but were better than Wall Street had been expecting. Several other leading US banks - Chemical Banking, Banc One, Mellon Bank and Bankers Trust - yesterday reported results that also underlined the gradual recovery in the industry from the severe difficulties of the past two years. Wells Fargo, which was hit hard by losses on its real estate portfolio in 1991, reported earnings of Dollars 119m, or Dollars 2.09 a share, in the first quarter, down from Dollars 152m, or Dollars 2.86, in the same period of last year. However, some analysts had been expecting earnings per share as low as 80 cents, and in trading on the New York Stock Exchange the company's stock closed in New York at Dollars 76 1/8 , up Dollars 9 7/8 . The company's loan-loss provision was Dollars 215m, compared with Dollars 700m in the fourth quarter of last year, and Dollars 85m a year ago. Net interest income increased 8 per cent to Dollars 680m, compared with Dollars 631m a year earlier. Substantially all the increase was due to its higher net interest margin - 5.70 per cent, compared with 5.06 per cent - partially offset by lower earning assets. Mr Carl Reichardt, Wells Fargo's chairman, said that 'economic recovery around the nation is still fragile and in much of California we are still waiting for some clear signs of a turnaround'. Chemical Banking, which at the end of last year merged with Manufacturers Hanover, a rival New York money centre bank, reported a 44 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 260m, or Dollars 1 a share, from Dollars 181m, or 84 cents. Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said there had been strong results in many key earnings components: higher net interest income; an increase in trading revenues; and improvements in several fee-based banking businesses. The provision for losses was Dollars 375m, compared with Dollars 450m in the fourth quarter of last year and Dollars 279m a year ago. Net interest income rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.115bn, while non-interest revenue rose 16 per cent to Dollars 810m. Banc One, the rapidly expanding Ohio-based super-regional bank, reported record first-quarter earnings of Dollars 179m, or 86 cents a share, compared with Dollars 130m, or 67 cents, in the same period of last year. Mr John McCoy, chairman, said that continued strong retail loan demand and core deposit growth had boosted the net interest margin, which rose from 6.17 per cent last year to 6.82 per cent. Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank reported net income of Dollars 86m, or Dollars 1.36 a share, in the first quarter, compared with Dollars 68m, or Dollars 1.25, a year ago. The figures reflected increases in net interest revenue, trading and other revenue, and service fee revenue. These gains were offset in part by increases in operating expense and a Dollars 60m provision for loan losses, up from Dollars 45m. Bankers Trust, the New York investment banking group, reported a 9 per cent increase in earnings to Dollars 175m, or Dollars 2.02 a share, up from Dollars 160m, or Dollars 1.85m, in the first quarter of last year. Mr Charles Sanford, chairman, said a broad range of businesses had contributed to the increase, including asset management, fiduciary and global finance. Trading revenue was down 42 per cent from the Dollars 370m earned in last year's first quarter. Fiduciary and fund management revenue rose 15 per cent to Dollars 162m; fees and commissions rose 18 per cent to Dollars 142m; and other non-interest revenue rose from Dollars 9m to Dollars 63m, helped by gains from equity investments. Non-interest expenses dropped 8 per cent to Dollars 535m.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Britain looks for help fromFrench MR JOHN MAJOR'S 90-minute meeting at the Elysee Palace this afternoon could determine the success of the emergency European Community summit in Birmingham next month. The UK prime minister's discussion with President Francois Mitterrand is, one insider said, 'designed to enable him to start trying to shape the consensus'. 'It's about squaring the circle' was the perhaps more realistic phrase of another. Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Mr Major has a good relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whatever the view about briefings from officials of the Bundesbank, and said that the two often spoke on the telephone. With the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders before the mid-October summit looking remote, however, France is increasingly significant as a possible ally on the way forward on the dispute over the exchange rate mechanism and on Maastricht. Mr Mitterrand will urge Mr Major to reduce recent Anglo-German tensions. He will also back the UK leader's plan to inject more democracy into the Maastricht process in an attempt to get Britain to ratify the EC treaty this year, say French officials. France recognises Mr Major's internal political problems in pushing treaty ratification, but believes the January 1, 1993, target date for the treaty to enter into force can be met. In the short term, France is worried about the possibility of the UK government taking irreversible steps away from the Maastricht treaty, following sterling's departure from the parity grid of the European Monetary System and consequent British bitterness at lack of Bundesbank support. For their part UK Foreign Office officials say that while the close result of the French referendum has some side benefits for the UK's agenda, such as its reinforcement of the importance of retaining each country's national identity, other aspects could add to Britain's difficulties. Though some of the damage to Anglo-German relations may have been undone at this week's EC finance ministers meeting, Mr Mitterrand is still expected to counsel Mr Major not to let himself, or his cabinet colleagues, give vent to anti-German rhetoric. French officials say they realise, from the way relations with Germany figured large in the stormy French referendum debate on Maastricht, that such rhetoric can prove popular. But they warn that Britain needs co-operation with Germany if it is to bring the pound back into the ERM.</p>

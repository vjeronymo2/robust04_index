			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Nikola Kljusev by M. </F> Jovanovski; date and place not given: "Social Endurance Like the  Sword of Damocles"]    [Text] It seems that there is a tendency her for us  to get used to the deficit in public spending; any effort to  find a solution for getting out of the crisis, if it is  realistically weighed, should be accepted; we do not have any  institutions for measuring social endurance.    These days the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia --FYROM] Government's stabilization program is a  frequent topic of discussion, both in the Assembly where it was  adopted, and outside the parliament, at professional or less  professional meetings. A large number of economists have also  expressed their own opinion of it; they have evaluated the  solutions envisioned for various sections of the program, each  from his own standpoint. In several reviews, however, it seems  to have been forgotten that we already have experience in  creating our own program. This has to do with the Anti-Inflation  Program, as it was officially called, or the "Easter" Program,  as the people later called it. We talked about stabilization in  1994, but also about other things, with one of the creators of  the "Easter" Program, and at that time the head of the expert  government--Academician Nikola Kljusev.    [Jovanovski] Mr. Kljusev, we are at the end of 1993, when  results in various fields are being summed up. How do you assess  the past year, viewed in economic terms?    [Kljusev] This year was also a very critical one, both in  terms of events in Macedonia in the area of interethnic  relations, and on the economic level. From the economic  standpoint, several qualitative changes occurred in the economy  and in general in the standard of living. The assessment is that  we are still sinking toward the bottom of the crisis. On the  other hand, several significant economic indicators are showing  negative tendencies--the social product and employment are  declining, there are no investments.... The losses are much  larger than the modest capital formation. In spite of that,  consumption is growing. Personal consumption has grown by about  26 percent, and public spending is showing an enormous deficit.  We also appear to be getting used to that deficit. If public  spending is swallowing up 10 percent of the social product, the  fact that it will fall to 6 percent in 1994 cannot make us happy.    [Jovanovski] The deficit will be covered from foreign  sources, however.    [Kljusev] Those indicators are bad signals, because we do  not  have resources of our own to cover the deficit. It is an  extremely complex problem. Thus, the economy is showing a  structural atrophy, as well as declining trends--by 15 percent  in industry, by 20 percent in agriculture (with the drought also  having an effect), but also in other sectors. All of this  induces caution, with the aim of opposing those trends and  stopping consumption. The intentions of neutralizing the  unfavorable effects of the declining trends are therefore noble  ones.    [Jovanovski] In your opinion, what are the stabilization  program's chances of success?    [Kljusev] Basically, any effort to find a solution for  getting out of the crisis, if it is realistically weighed,  should be accepted, if it is not based on illusory and  exaggerated optimism. In that regard, it can be said that the  program, as an effort to get out of the unfavorable situation,  undoubtedly constitutes an expression of positive aspirations.  If one studies it thoroughly and looks at its anatomy,  however--the pillars on which it is based--one will see that its  goals and ambitions are in conflict with the center of gravity  that it does not have. It is simply not catching up.    [Jovanovski] What center of gravity do you have in mind?    [Kljusev] The center of gravity here is not the real economy  and its potential; it is not the productivity and capital  formation capacity of the national economy; instead, it has to  be financial support from abroad.    [Jovanovski] What are the similarities and differences  between the stabilization program and your Anti-Inflation  Program?    [Kljusev] The theoretical postulates are the same. At that  time we did not have a chance of expecting financial aid, since  relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World  Bank had not been settled, but the anchors were clearly  emphasized: the foreign exchange rate, wages and the freeze on  them, and prices and the monetary sphere, in which we  established discipline. The "Easter" Program, however, fell  precisely over what this program is going back to, namely the  regulation of relationships in consumption. At that time,  however, several frivolous deputies proposed a law on wages that  the government did not support. The president of the Assembly  also raised his hand in accepting such an idea.    [Jovanovski] In your opinion, what was the real reason for  the adoption of the law on wages?    [Kljusev] There were probably manipulations by several  parties that wanted to come to power. We reduced inflation of 74  percent a month to 6 percent in August. The program fell,  however, and so did the government. Let's not go into that. The  essential thing is that those who voted against the program then  have sobered up. They are beginning to realize that  relationships in public and private consumption should be  settled, and that a justifiably restrictive approach should be  established.  <H5>  Under the Conductor's Baton </H5>   [Jovanovski] Will the people be able to endure that  restrictive approach?    [Kljusev] Well, that is the key question. Actually, the  program was worked out under the conductor's baton of the IMF  and the World Bank. It is not our invention. How much it is our  wish is even questionable. We are in debt to these institutions,  but also to commercial banks. The IMF, however, has strict  criteria regarding the repayment of loans, it does not allow  rescheduling, but the IMF gives the green light for financial  relations with the rest of the world. We are undoubtedly under a  strict conductor's baton. The IMF's criteria are aimed at  creating the conditions for repaying of the debt to the World  Bank, and so actually a bridge arrangement is being established,  a bypass arrangement to settle the obligations to these  financial institutions, in the amount of $137 million. We are  also prisoners in that respect.    [Jovanovski] We will have to face repayment of the debt at  some point. Now we will have to repay the old debt, but we will  receive new loans. What is the best thing to do in this  situation?    [Kljusev] We should utilize the situation rationally. We  should achieve creditworthiness abroad and initiate our projects  that will be attractive to world financial institutions and the  world industrial sector. We have to focus on joint investments,  and not establish ties only with financial institutions on a  credit basis. That would be fatal.    [Jovanovski] The loan approved by the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development for our Electrical Industry is a  good sign, of course?    [Kljusev] It is a good chance. We have to make sure that all  that money is utilized efficiently and fully in the economy. Not  one dollar should go into consumption.    [Jovanovski] Let's go back to the stabilization program. How  much can the completely unachieved but sought-after consensus  affect implementation of the program?    [Kljusev] In this case we have to have a realistic attitude  in assessing the partners. It has to do with the relationship  among all the partners--the government, employers (i.e., the  chamber), and the trade union. All three partners are not clear  representatives in the role that they are supposed to play. The  government, through the parliament, is not expressing the will  of all the deputies, and, one might say, of the people as a  whole. That is indicative, as the criticisms being made of the  program and the criticisms being made of its adoption are  refuted. Employers are unknown. Traditionally they are owners,  but in our country a quasi-role is played by the chamber,  reluctantly. The trade union likewise does not fully represent  the working class, in conditions in which other independent  trade unions exist. It does represent the lion's share of  employees, however, and they should have been prepared for the  price of depriving the working class of its subsistence. That  price was recognized after the fact. That lack of preparation is  making employees into potential opponents of the program. If the  government wanted the program to be a national one or a state  one, then all the entities should have been prepared while it  was being coordinated.  <H5>  Exaggerated Optimism </H5>   [Jovanovski] But you have also developed your own program?    [Kljusev] We drafted it only because of the fact that along  with the anti-inflation program, we also introduced our own  currency. That is the biggest secret. The journalists' prior  announcement of the introduction of the denar resulted in  damages of several million marks, in just two or three days.    [Jovanovski] At the beginning you mentioned a  term--exaggerated optimism. What do you mean by that?    [Kljusev] I mentioned it because significant areas have not  been regulated here. In the first place, a systemic approach has  not been completed in economics and in the economy. It is  sufficient to mention the lack of a law on firms, i.e.,  enterprises. With respect to the development of the tax system,  however, I agree on this. In this case the state should  demonstrate its honor, its dignity, and its responsibility. If  it gives in on taxes, then it cannot be a law-governed state,  since in the West, the basic attitude of the citizen toward the  state is viewed in terms of taxes.    [Jovanovski] Yes, but here the state has bought social peace  by not collecting taxes.    [Kljusev] Well, it is an extremely significant issue. Why  did  we have that much of an increase in wages, 26 percent? Why do we  have an enormous deficit in the public sector? Isn't that an  answer to your question, that social peace is being bought? If  that spiral continues, nothing will be left of this program.    [Jovanovski] The program provides for a real reduction in  wages. How far can social endurance be stretched?    [Kljusev] I don't know how much the program is interfering  with social endurance. Won't it collapse through several  unwanted incidents? It is like a sword of Damocles hanging over  the program. Who is studying social endurance in our country?  There are institutions in the world that research it. All of the  shifts and conflicts are giving signals that the government  measures are being modified. There are also many other  unresolved issues, however--political tolerance, slow  privatization, rehabilitation of the banking sector, which is of  exceptional significance and should be carried out as quickly as  possible....  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  Clearing Up Banks' Bad Debts </H5>   It is very important to reexamine the entire banking system,  which is perhaps the most problematic aspect now. It is sinking  in various bad debts which are carried over from year to year,  and if that trend continues, it will affect the entire economy.  The government assumed a big obligation by specifying that the  rehabilitation would begin in four months. The unrehabilitated  banks can be a weak point in controlling financial flows and  financial services provided by the banking system to the economy  and the populace.    I am not completely certain whether a Bank Rehabilitation  Agency should be formed or whether they should be rehabilitated  bank by bank. If, for example, Komercijalna Banka has carried  out some sort of rehabilitation itself, for which it has  received certification by an international institution, it  should be allowed to operate. One or two healthy operational  branches should be taken away from Stopanska Banka and the  headquarters and the rest of the branches, for example, should  be rehabilitated. It is a difficult process that will require  both time and money, and personnel changes at the banks.  <H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5> <H5>  Limiting Factors </H5>   [Jovanovski] What factors can have a limiting effect on  successful implementation of the stabilization program?    [Kljusev] In addition to the uncompleted economic system and  social endurance, disruptions may also occur because only the  social sector is being taken into account in personal  consumption. But how much does the private sector share in that  consumption, and how much does the gray economy? The latter is  distorting the scale of the so-called effective consumer. There  are people with uncontrolled sources of income who are exerting  pressure on that sphere. There is nothing on them if they buy a  modern type of automobile, and so forth. And an enormous part of  the population is below the poverty line, on the brink of  subsistence. The program did not take into account how much of  total consumption consists of uncontrolled income from the gray  economy. Balance-sheets should have been prepared for that, just  as balance-sheets should have been prepared for all the debts  and for all the obligations, both those abroad and the domestic  debts, and then it should be stated what relationships will be  like in the economic consumption sector, in public consumption,  and in personal consumption. That leads into the issue of social  endurance. We are also very vulnerable in the area of political  tolerance. To what extent does it exist? A consensus has not  been reached on issues that should naturally link us. Next,  there is the slow transformation of ownership. Is there any  insight into the positive and negative effects of the slow  transformation model? In addition to those internal factors,  there are also several external ones, which primarily have to do  with our surroundings.</p>

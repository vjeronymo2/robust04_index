			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Seasonal deficit at Rhino increases to Pounds 263,000 IN LINE with directors' expectations, Rhino Group, the USM-quoted novelty products and giftware merchandising and distribution company, showed pre-tax losses of Pounds 263,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with Pounds 150,000. The Future Zone Stores and Downpace subsidiaries are highly seasonal and the directors explained that the second six months 'should benefit substantially from Christmas trading'. The group also announced an Pounds 850,000 placing of 2.5m new shares by Panmure Gordon. Proceeds will be used to bring forward the Future Zone opening programme enabling the group to have more than 40 stores open for the Christmas season. First-half turnover expanded from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 3.6m and operating losses came to Pounds 326,000 against Pounds 131,000. Interest receivable was Pounds 63,000 (Pounds 19,000 payable). Losses per share were 0.52p (0.97p). The group said it was planning a capital reconstruction in order to eliminate losses and allow dividends to be paid in due course. Future Zone, which started the year with five stores, now has 26 trading, and Rhino has entered into a conditional agreement for Future to acquire six leasehold stores in prime locations. Consideration is Pounds 100,000 cash for one of the properties while the agreement includes rent-free periods for each of the others. Downpace, the distributor of licensed merchandise, was trading well with turnover up 29 per cent. Directors said that Downpace had the UK distribution licence for certain items of Jurassic Park merchandise, which was making a 'positive impact in the second half'.</p>

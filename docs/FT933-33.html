			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (13): Bottomless pit for national wealth - The public sector has turned from a vision of progress into a nightmare THE private sector, says a leading Indian businessman, is the people's sector while the public sector is the government's sector. Given the millions of shareholders that large Indian companies, such as Reliance, have been able to attract, the judgment is not entirely unwarranted. The public sector was intended to be the cutting edge of Indian socialist development. It became the plaything of politicians, bureaucrats and, at least by Indian standards, a relatively small and pampered labour force. Now it is an incubus, expensive to the government and damaging to the economy. At the turn of the present decade, the Indian public sector absorbed 44 per cent of gross domestic capital formation and used 46 per cent of the capital stock. But it generated only 27 per cent of gross domestic product at factor cost and 7 per cent of gross domestic savings. It contributed 18 per cent of manufacturing value added, but 41 per cent of value added in transport, 82 per cent in banking and insurance and 100 per cent in communications. Yet, even though 71 per cent of the people working in so-called 'organised' activities were employed by the public sector, that was only 19m people, a mere 6 per cent of India's labour force. The huge sums invested in public enterprises have brought not merely negligible employment, but paltry economic returns. A study by Vijay Joshi and IMD Little of Oxford University shows that even on relatively favourable assumptions the real return on investment in the public sector, including manufacturing, has been about a quarter of that in the investment-starved private sector (see chart). 1 In 1991-92 approximately 300 central public sector enterprises achieved a net return on capital of only 2.1 per cent. Their net profits were just Rs24.8bn (Dollars 970m), with the losses of the 102 loss-making enterprises, at Rs36.7bn, weighing heavily against the profits of the profit-making enterprises, which themselves amounted to only Rs61.5bn. 2 In addition, some 700 or so enterprises were owned by the states, among them the economically vital, but mismanaged, state electricity boards. The disaster of the public sector enterprises occurred for two reasons. Under the Sick Industrial Companies Act the government acquired unprofitable companies from the private sector, thus, in the words of two distinguished Indian economists, 'extending to private enterprises the disincentives that operate on public enterprises'3. In addition, even those public enterprises that started as such have generated large losses. This is all a very long way from one of the earliest justifications for the pivotal role of public enterprises, that their profits would help raise the overall savings rate. This degree of waste cannot last. India has to find ways of using the capital invested in the public sector units more efficiently, of conserving its scarce budgetary resources for more essential uses and of financing the expansion of the infrastructure essential for fast development. Hitherto, however, it has moved only a few gingerly steps in the needed direction. The post-reform policies have the following principal elements: The number of industries reserved for the public sector has been reduced from 17 to eight. Performance is to be improved by means of performance contracts or Memoranda of Understanding, by which managements are to be granted greater autonomy, but also to be held accountable for their results. Budgetary support in the form of loans to loss-making enterprises, other than those within the Plan, is to be phased out after 1994-95. Up to 49 per cent of equity in profit-making enterprises may be 'disinvested', that is, sold to private investors. Enterprises are being allowed to form joint ventures and raise fresh equity to finance expansion. 'Sick' public enterprises have been brought within the jurisdiction of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, which is to decide whether units can be restructured or should close down. Pricing decisions affecting, in particular, steel and petroleum and coal products, are being taken more flexibly. A National Renewal Fund has been established to fund compensation, retraining and redeployment of workers affected by restructuring. Finally, for the future, the government plans to press ahead along the lines it has already indicated, as was recommended by the Rangarajan committee on 'disinvestment of shares in public sector enterprises'. 4 By Indian standards, these changes are revolutionary and should, if adhered to, bring about at least some improve finally, ment in the performance of these enterprises. By the end of the last financial year, for example, disinvestment in three successive sales had raised Rs49bn (Dollars 1.9bn). In 1991-92 between 5 and 20 per cent of the equity in 31 companies was 'disinvested'. In 1992-93 up to 5 per cent of the equity in 13 companies was similarly sold. The new shareholders should impose greater pressure on management. At least equally significant as such sales could be the introduction of competition. By its own admission, for example, competition has galvanised the notoriously indifferent Indian Airlines, which had lost almost a quarter of its passengers to new entrants, to unprecedented efforts aimed at regaining the loyalty of its customers. For all that, the government is doing little more than nibble at the problem. It is all very well for it to pat itself on the back for reducing budgetary finance for the planned investment of public sector enterprises from 22.2 per cent of the total required in 1991-92 to 18.6 per cent in 1992-93. But it is far from certain that the budgetary stringency of the finance ministry would prove the intended immovable object against the hitherto irresistible force of public enterprise losses. Fundamental problems also remain with management of the public enterprises, while the introduction of competition is still at best only halting. Paradoxically, India's poverty is being used as a justification for policies leading to a huge and persistent waste of resources. This sacred cow needs to be slaughtered. Reservation to the public sector should cease and competition actively encouraged. There should be separation of responsibilities for regulation from those for the production of goods and services. Given the vitality of the Indian capital market and the interest of foreign firms, complete privatisation can and should be pushed forward. Finally, the shedding of redundant workers and the closing of hopelessly unviable firms must be made feasible. The drawback of the current approach is not that it will make no difference to the problem. But it will take far too long and change much too little. India cannot afford to waste so much of its capital, use up so much of its scarce budgetary resources and provide so little of the essential infrastructure it needs, all in order to support a sector that offers employment to so few and loads the costs of its poor performance on so many.

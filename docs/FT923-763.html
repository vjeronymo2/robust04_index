			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: Back in fashion in the City - The Bottom Line AS THE wet weather was driving women into shops to give a good start to the autumn season, two of the best known high street names - Next and Laura Ashley - were warming City hearts with the latest chapters in their recovery stories. Both have come through the fire of losses and debt reduction and both boast that they have returned to their roots in terms of customer appeal. Next has once again caught the eye of the middle-market British woman (who no longer goes off fashion in her 30s) and of the trendy young man. It achieved a 14 per cent sales increase in its high-street shops. Laura Ashley is reproclaiming its English country heritage in garments and home furnishing and calling itself a 'lifestyle brand' rather than a retailer. It also highlighted its international profile - only 40 per cent of sales lie in the UK. Next has made far more progress on the road to recovery. It returned to profit last year, making Pounds 12.3m pre-tax compared with losses of Pounds 40.7m. Its first-half figure bounced back from a mere Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 8.3m. Laura Ashley, which lost Pounds 9.1m pre-tax last year, more than trebled its first-half profit to Pounds 1.68m. However, the bulk of this was contributed by its associates - bed linen in the US and Laura Ashley Japan. North America lost money, offsetting a turnround in the UK and a profit breakthrough on the continent. Next, on the other hand, has finished its fire fighting (other than final damping down in the credit operation Club 24) and reported a jump in its operating margin from Next Retail and Next Directory to nearly 4 per cent, after a small interim loss last year. A further step up should come in the seasonally stronger second half. A stark illustration of where the companies are in terms of restoring their fortunes is provided by the dividend. Next restored its interim and Lord Wolfson made encouraging noises about shareholders' prospects of sharing in future proserity. Laura Ashley omitted the payment again. Jim Maxmin, the chief executive, said: 'It's too early in the recovery cycle.' Both companies confirmed the health of their balance sheets after much restoration work. Next will have cash in hand at the year-end even after an Pounds 87m repayment of Eurobonds. Laura Ashley continued to reduce its debt, which is down to Pounds 6.5m. Against a background of financial comfort in both camps, the questions revolve around future prospects and the extent to which the prognosis is in the share price. Next's fine set of figures sent the share price back above 100p for the first time since early 1990. It settled at 101 3/4 p last night. Upgraded pre-tax profit forecasts of Pounds 26m for the full-year put it on a prospective price-earnings ratio of about 16. Next year's figure could top Pounds 30m as the full benefits work through of pruning the shop-chain - from 348 to 316 in the year to July - and re-establishing the brand's reputation. Investors who piled in at the low point of 12.5p in January 1991 must be laughing all the way to the bank. Anyone thinking of buying now has largely missed the boat. Laura Ashley presents a more tantalising picture, but must be accompanied by a health warning because of the North American problem. The first lure is the fall in its share price from nearly 100p in July to around 60p for the past month. Even at this level, however, the prospective p/e is well over 30, assuming more than Pounds 6m profit this year. Some support is offered by the Japanese Aeon group's 15 per cent interest. (Sir Bernard Ashley, chairman, has 53 per cent and sold some shares at 82p late last year). The second is that there is still a lot to improve. For instance, it fails to deliver 40 per cent of goods to the right place at the right time. The third is the recovery potential, including the scope for the group to push its profit margin before tax and interest well above the 7 to 8 per cent that a UK high street chain like Next might achieve. Even the cynics might start to buy if the share price slipped nearer to 50p.</p>

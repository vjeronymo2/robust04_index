			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> WYLIE TAKES SECOND LOOK AT SKATING PRIORITY  </P> <P> Barely had Paul Wylie a chance to reflect upon or savor his surprising  10th-place finish at the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary when he began to hear  the sighs and whispers that presage the end of a career at sport's upper  levels.  </P> <P> And, although the Olympics had been his first major competition at skating's  senior level and his finish was more than respectable, Wylie began to listen to  the talk.  </P> <P> "I think people are really inclined to do that," Wylie said Sunday before the  free-skating final at the Olympic Festival here. "People are living off other  people's mistakes in this sport. You just have to live above that.  </P> <P> "That's how people are. I probably was like that when I was younger. They won't  miss you as a skater, they see you as a notch out. A space for them to move  into."  </P> <P> Wylie, 24, was tacitly erased from contention by some observers in the sport  when he placed third at the national championships in February, thus failing to  qualify for the U.S. team that was sent to the World Championships. In a sport  based on subjective judging such as skating, it is simply that easy to lose  standing.  </P> <P> Thus, Wylie chose to skate in this competition -- out of season and partially  out of shape -- to proclaim his return and reclaim his place behind Christopher  Bowman.  </P> <P> The decision to skate here has proved to be a gamble. Wylie muffed the landing  on the first jump in his long program Sunday and still managed to get a 5.9 (on  a scale of 6) from one judge. However, that mistake was enough to give Mark  Mitchell of Hamden, Conn., the gold medal.  </P> <P> Wylie, who is from Denver and lives in Boston, was a distant second. Shepherd  Clark of Atlanta won the bronze.  </P> <P> In addition to losing ground to a younger skater, Wylie showed a vulnerability  to judges, who will not likely forget.  </P> <P> Wylie, however, is determined not to forget what he is here for.  </P> <P> "I told the media before the short program (at nationals) that it might be the  last time I skated," Wylie said. "It was really awful. I didn't enjoy it. The  questions still were there."  </P> <P> Wylie reassessed his priorities after that competition. As skater Debi Thomas  had done at Stanford, Wylie had steadfastly refused to cut back his class load  at Harvard, where he is a second-semester junior. That stance has changed,  however.  </P> <P> "My plans are to take my school schedule easier and make sure that I'm taking  care of skating for the next three years," he said. "I don't know exactly the  load I will carry but it will not be a full load. Before I wasn't sure of the  priority skating held for me. I know that it does mean something to me."  </P> <P> Wylie has been experiencing the dual guilt pangs associated with years of  compromising his studies and compromising his training.  </P> <P> "I've never practiced on a Wednesday, for example, because of school," he said.  "To take one day off a week may not seem like a big deal. But I was skating  five days a week and my competitors were skating six. There was a lack of  continuity. I'd walk in Thursday and say, 'I should have been here yesterday.'  There was guilt and there was a feeling of helplessness. I thought, 'When am I  going to school?' "  </P> <P> The conflicting emotions collided at the national championships last February  at Baltimore, where Wylie admitted he was not prepared.  </P> <P> "I figured that I could train and go to school full time and make the World  team," he said. "I was wrong."  </P> <P> Wylie also experienced a singular moment during a performance when he failed to  complete the first jump of a combination and -- because of pride and obstinacy  he said -- he refused to even attempt the second jump. This, from a skater who  molded a career as an expert and facile jumper.  </P> <P> "In Calgary I missed the first jump in my program and the rest the program was  way better," Wylie said. "That's what was missing, that tenacity and  perseverance that I expect from myself."  </P> <P> Wylie knew that some sort of change was in order. He said he didn't rule out  quitting, but sought other solutions first. He tried new equipment,  experimenting with all manner of boots and blades, finally going back to his  old equipment. He took weeks off to refresh his mind.  </P> <P> The change that seemed to click was a move at the end of June to train in Vail,  Colo. with coaches Mary and Evy Scotvold. There he has stripped his skating to  its basics and, in the process, discovered the joy he used to know.  </P> <P> "It took me until Vail, until I saw the old jumps coming back," he said. "They  weren't old, really, they were rejuvenated. I found how fun it is to do things  well, how much I enjoy it."  </P> <P> It is too soon to tell if the reconstitution of Paul Wylie is complete. It is  too soon and figure skating is too unpredictable to raise hopes of even the  optimistic.  </P> <P> It is even too soon to report that the talk of Wylie being washed up is over,  yet. All that can be said with any assurance is that he is no longer listening  to anything but his inner voice. And he is happy with what he hears.  </P> <P> Kristi Yamaguchi, 18, of Fremont, Calif., won the gold in women's figure  skating, ranking first with all seven judges.  </P> <P> "The program wasn't fully in, with all the choreography, until three weeks  before this competition," she said. "I just wanted to come and try out the new  program and see how it worked. I'm pretty happy with it, but I know I have a  lot of work to do.  </P> <P> Other gold medalists were April Sargent, of Ogdensburg, N.Y., and Russ  Witherby, of Cincinnati, in ice dancing and Calla Urbanski, of Chicago, and  Mark Naylor, of Harrisburg, Pa., in pairs competition.  </P></p>

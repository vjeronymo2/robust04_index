			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: NFC For a logistics company that survives on getting goods to the right place at the right time, the recent comings and goings at NFC have been particularly painful. The group has now lost a chairman and chief executive within 10 weeks of each other. That said, the rapid appointment of Sir Christopher Bland as NFC's chairman is to be welcomed. It allows him a significant role in the most urgent problem confronting this once glamour stock - the choice of a new chief executive. Perhaps the presentation skills that Sir Christopher picked up at LWT will also help NFC to avoid such elementary errors as consistently giving over-optimistic impressions of trading performance. The longer-term challenge is daunting. NFC suffers from lack of direction, poor morale, and a sagging share price - down 40 per cent since this time last year. There also seems to have been a degree of complacency among NFC's management. Investor disillusionment is near complete. A substantial rights issue and a big restructuring programme have been followed by repeated profits downgrades. If the group is to recapture investors' confidence it will need rapidly to implement its UK restructuring programme, demonstrate some ability to harness the economic recovery, and begin to replicate its logistics successes in the US and continental Europe. But no matter what the new management achieves, it will never recreate NFC's lost mystique.</p>

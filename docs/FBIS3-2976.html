Its per capita GNP amounted to 3,675 yuan  in 1993, higher than the country's average. Thus, the  province's overall economic strength has reached a new level.  At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC], this reporter interviewed NPC Deputy Chen Huanyou,  secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and governor  of the province.    Chen Huanyou said: Jiangsu Province has made new planning  for  reform and development. We have set forth a reform objective  according to local conditions that the basic framework of a  socialist market economic structure should be built in about  five years. Then, we must effectively perform our work  particularly in several aspects in order to achieve this  objective and push Jiangsu's economy to a new level.    Chen Huanyou said: First of all, we must continue to deepen  reform. The state has announced more reform measures this year  than in the past. Reforms are more difficult to carry out, and  they need to be conducted in more depth and breadth and with  more intensity. All the announced reform measures involve the  key aspects of establishing a socialist market economic  structure. We have decided according to Jiangsu's conditions  that we should carry out various reforms while concentrating on  establishing a modern enterprise system and reforming the  macroeconomic management system. We should perform our work  carefully and practically, do a good job in publicizing and  explaining reform measures, organizing and coordinating their  implementation, and strive to achieve actual results.    In dealing with the reform of the foreign trade and foreign  exchange systems, Chen Huanyou said: We should seize this  opportune time to open to the outside world in an ever broader  scope and more fields and at an ever higher level in order to  integrate our economy with the international economy at a faster  pace and with better results. We should expand our import and  export trade and increase our ability to earn foreign exchange  through exports. We should make vigorous efforts to attract  investment by foreign businessmen and make more use of foreign  funds. Our planned use of foreign funds this year is to increase  30 percent as compared with last year. Meanwhile, we should  vigorously develop our economic and technological cooperation  with other countries. We should also build various development  areas according to high standards.    Chen Huanyou said: This year we will not follow the beaten  track of blindly going after the output value and expanding the  investment scale and will put the stress of economic work on the  quality, efficiency, and level of high economic growth [gao jing  ji zeng zhang 7559 4842 3444 1073 7022]. We should foster the  idea that "development is the last word." Enterprises whose  exports are marketable and with good economic returns should  develop their production as fast as possible, and those which  cannot do so should not be forced to do so. Everything should  be done according to reality. We should attach importance to  scientific and technological progress and the improvement of  workers' quality, make vigorous efforts to readjust the economic  structure, raise the quality and overall level of economic  growth, and improve overall economic results.    On the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic  industries, Chen Huanyou said: Jiangsu has made tremendous  progress in building key infrastructural facilities and basic  industries over the past several years. But there are still  some weak links in these regards. This year we should  concentrate our efforts on building key projects, optimize the  investment structure, and use our limited financial and material  resources for such key projects. We should strengthen  agriculture as the foundation of the national economy;  vigorously readjust the structure of agricultural production;  stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and oil- bearing  crops; develop export-oriented and foreign-exchange-earning  agriculture, as well as village and town enterprises and  diversified economic undertakings, and make every possible  effort to increase farmers' actual incomes and to promote an  all-round development of the rural economy.</p>

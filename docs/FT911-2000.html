			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: An uncertain future in Brazil - A report on the effects of economic instability SUGGESTING someone invest in Brazil these days has all the connotations of asking, 'Would you buy a used car from this man?' about a dubious character in a scruffy raincoat. The country, which in the 1970s was 'the' place to invest, with annual growth rates of 10 per cent and in the 1980s was a place to sit tight and occasionally reap very high profits, has in the 1990s become a sour taste in the mouths of many multi-nationals. After five economic shocks and price freezes in as many years and an inflation record resembling a series of heart attacks on an electrocardiograph, foreign companies operating in Brazil have grown used to uncertainty. But, as a result of President Fernando Collor's tight monetary policy and the ensuing 4.6 per cent contraction in the economy, this year for the first time has seen a wave of multi-nationals putting the blame for poor results worldwide largely on their Brazilian subsidiaries. There is little sympathy to be found in the corridors of Brasilia. Mr Marcos Azambuja, director-general of Brazil's Foreign Ministry, protests: 'Multi-nationals have got too used to expecting Brazil to lay them golden eggs every year.' But, as recession deepens and Brazil reels from its latest economic stabilisation plan, the situation is expected to worsen. After years of faith in the future, many multi-nationals are now thinking seriously about whether to stay. Some have already gone - generally those with smaller investments or with factories elsewhere in Latin America. Those who have stayed are currently slashing investment projects and laying off employees. 'It's wartime in Brazil,' said Mr Folke Asell, head of Electrolux Brazil. So bad is the situation that in February a group of multi-nationals claiming to represent 90 per cent of their colleagues presented a scathing report to the economy minister, describing why Brazil was no longer an attractive investment. It concluded: 'It is not possible to integrate with the first world through third world policies.' What happened last year to make multi-nationals so angry? Most, publicly at least, had welcomed the free market ambitions of President Collor, who took office last March promising a new Brazil and his ending of price controls, even if privately some jibed at the idea of losing long-held monopolies. The 41-year-old president's first mistake was to seize remittances of foreign companies along with 80 per cent of national assets frozen in a drastic liquidity squeeze, raising more than an eyebrow in headquarters worldwide. Only after intense lobbying were the remittances freed last autumn. By then, the economy seemed to be moving again, after three months of almost standstill. But an over-valued cruzeiro ruined competition of exports, and by the last quarter the tight monetary policy, which is an integral part of President Collor's anti-inflation plan, was having its effect, bringing results most described as catastrophic. Published results to November showed 38 per cent of companies were suffering losses, and since then sales have fallen dramatically. By the end of last year, when inflation was running once more above 20 per cent a month and industrial activity in Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, had fallen by 11 per cent, the Collor plan seemed all bad effects and no good results. Real interest rates were, at more than 10 per cent a month, perhaps the highest in the world. The unfavourable exchange rate meant companies could no longer use the traditional escape route of exports and those committed to contracts took a beating. When this was finally adjusted with a rapid devaluation in November and December, it was too late for many. In search of a scapegoat for the failure of their policies, the government turned on multi-nationals, particularly Autolatina, the holding company for Ford and Volkswagen, and the pharmaceutical companies, and summoned them unceremoniously to Brasilia to explain 'abusive price-rises.' Mr Edson Musa, president of Rhodia, Brazilian subsidiary of the France's Rhone Poulenc, called the move 'economic terrorism.' The final blow to the government's credibility was the introduction of a plan in February freezing wages and prices, despite previous insistence this would not happen. A repeated criticism by foreign companies is the uncertainty of the exchange rate. Last year, devaluation at 1,333.8 per cent failed to keep up with inflation of 1,794.9 per cent. One company hard-hit by this was Autolatina, which ended last year with losses and has been shedding workers in reaction to a 20 per cent fall in sales since November. Mr James Donaldson, the company's managing director, is fed up: 'Brazil has gone backwards. Car production has dropped 25 per cent since 1980. So far is Brazil from the solid export base we expected that we are now shifting some production to Kentucky.' Also affected was General Electric's subsidiary in Brazil - their second biggest. With 40 per cent of its business made up by exports and most of the rest by government contracts, the company suffered both sides with the cutting of state spending. According to its financial director, Mr Don McBride: 'We broke even with probably enough in dollar terms.' Owed Dollars 27m by the government, the company has cut production in three divisions and Mr McBride said there may soon be lay-offs once it finishes its backlog of orders. Mr McBride is not optimistic about the future: 'We will restructure to the size of the market and must at some point in the future decide if we want to be in the market at all. . . It's a big market. It's hard to throw away.' Black &amp; Decker, Phillips and Parker are among those companies which have closed some operations. Parker finds importing pens from Europe cheaper than producing in Brazil, while Black &amp; Decker can source the market from elsewhere in Latin America. Foreign banks, such as First Chicago, hit by the global recession, turned to Brazil first when it closed offices. Others with large investments are holding on. The US company, Caterpillar, the world's largest producer of earth-moving equipment, says it will stay, though it is suspending investments and blaming its Brazilian subsidiary for its 58 per cent fall in profits worldwide. The company's report stated: 'If the current situation continues, return of our Brazilian operation to profit is unlikely in 1991.' Oil companies, too, suffered because the government kept fuel prices low as part of its anti-inflationary policy. Shell, Esso and Atlantic have all been operating in the red since November. Shell has cut investment plans this year by 40 per cent. Price controls are not the only government intervention multi-nationals complain about. Brazilian tax on foreign investment is, according to the multinationals' report, the highest in the world. The Brazilian subsidiary of the Swedish company, Electrolux, is planning to challenge in court the high tax on its profit, which in dollar terms translated to losses. Even the lure of cheap labour and 152m potential market are no longer seen as enough attraction. There are frequent complaints about shoddy workmanship and General Electric, for example, has to use seven quality control checks on just one production line. Focusing all on defeating inflation at the expense of growth, Brazil is losing out to other countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela and eastern Europe. Foreign investment for the first half of 1990 was a negative Dollars 168m. The situation has not been helped by Brazil's foot-dragging on negotiations of its foreign debt. Mr Joel Korn, president of Bank of America in Brazil, warned: 'The longer Brazil takes to get back on track and project more credibility internationally, the worse it will be, because some investment decisions cannot wait.' A sign that Brazil may finally be waking up to this came last month in the form of new central bank measures allowing companies to remit profits without going through the bureaucratic process of registration.</p>

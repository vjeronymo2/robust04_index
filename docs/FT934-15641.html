			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Blair tipped for premiership MR TONY BLAIR, Labour's modernising shadow home secretary, receives encouraging support today from an unexpected quarter - a panel of 105 top industrialists, bankers, business executives and other opinion formers. The panel, half of whom come from the business world, tip Mr Blair as the person most likely to be prime minister in the year 2000. They put him ahead of Mr John Major, other Conservative leadership contenders and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. More surprising, Mr Blair is also the panel's preferred choice for Number 10 Downing Street. He attracts three times the support of the prime minister, and more than twice the support of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is favoured by many to succeed Mr Major. The endorsement for Labour's foremost moderniser emerged from a poll by Opinion Leader Research asking Britain's most influential opinion formers for their views on the UK in the year 2000. In general panel members are pessimistic about the future, expecting the UK's decline in world influence to continue. China will gain the most in influence, says the panel, followed by Japan, the US and Germany. Russia and India are also expected to become more influential by the year 2000. The opinion formers say their main concern for the UK over the next few years is the economy - both general economic performance and loss of international competitiveness. There is also concern over continuing high levels of unemployment. More than two thirds think the total is likely to remain at more than 3m by the end of the decade. Britain in the Year 2000.

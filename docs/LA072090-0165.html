			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUDAS PRIEST DEFENSE TO DENY HIDDEN SOUNDS  </P> <P> Attorneys defending the heavy metal band Judas Priest plan to challenge the  credentials today of an expert witness on subliminal messages, who contends  hidden messages in the group's music drove two young men to suicide.  </P> <P> The song "Better By You, Better Than Me" blared through speakers in a federal  courtroom Thursday as witness William Nickloff Jr. played the song forward,  backward and speeded up with quick changes in volume to demonstrate his belief  that the song contains the hidden phrase "do it" at least seven times.  </P> <P> The messages on the album allegedly say, "Try suicide ... let's be dead ... do  it, do it."  </P> <P> District Judge Jerry Whitehead, who is presiding in the non-jury trial, stared  at the elaborate audio equipment, but gave no indication that he heard the  alleged subliminal messages in the heavy metal band's music.  </P> <P> Nickloff was to undergo cross-examination by defense attorneys during a  half-day court session today.  </P> <P> Outside the courtroom, Judas Priest lead singer Rob Halford charged that  Nickloff has no credentials to be considered an expert in the field. When  playing the music in reverse, Halford said, anything can be made of the sounds.  </P> <P> Glenn Tipton, a member of Judas Priest, said the so-called "do it" message was  merely breathing with the sound of a grunt.  </P> <P> Kenneth McKenna, an attorney for one of two families suing Judas Priest and the  record label, said of the alleged subliminal messages, "We demonstrated they  exist."  </P> <P> Attorneys for the parents of Raymond Belknap and James Vance are trying to  persuade the court that subliminal messages in the band's "Stained Class" album  led to the shootings.  </P> <P> Belknap, 17, was killed by the self-inflicted gunshot. Vance, 19, survived his  suicide attempt, but was horribly disfigured and died three years later of  complications possibly associated with the incident.  </P></p>

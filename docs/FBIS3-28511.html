			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program"] </F>   [Text] Australia has promised its support for any United  Nations decision on air strikes. However, Foreign Minister  Gareth Evans says there are still reasons for caution. Senator  Evans told Radio Australia's Linda Curtis in Canberra that the  decision on air strikes is getting closer.    [Begin recording] [Evans] Well, clearly, we are a lot closer  to that than we were just 24 hours ago and that is sending,  equally obviously, a very clear message to the Bosnian Serbs,  who are now talking yet again about the voluntary  demilitarization of the area. If that result can be achieved  without opening up the potential downward spiral of violence  that might flow from air strikes and which has been worrying  everybody up until now, then that is, of course, a very good  result indeed.    [Curtis] So, there are still fairly strong reasons for  caution on air strikes?    [Evans] That is the problem. There is a tremendous urge,  which I certainly feel and I am sure people around the world  feel, that we ought to be doing something to respond to this  carnage and to stop it happening again in the future, but the  problem is that it is very difficult to guarantee that result  through military operations of this kind.    You have got the effectiveness problem that is actually  winkling out the batteries around the city; you have got the  problem of keeping them silent when the military analysts say  that it would take up to 50,000 troops permanently stationed  there to do that; you have got the problem of retaliatory  violence occuring elsewhere around Bosnia. There is only 11,000  UN troops there at the moment and they are supervising the  feeding of some 2 million people at the moment. And, if it  makes it impossible for them to do their job, you may well at  the end of the day be creating even more misery, implausible as  that sounds, than has been generated by the continuing attacks  on Sarajevo. So, it is a very difficult finely balanced  equation, and what we have been saying is that we just simply  can't make those judgements from this distance without our own  people on the ground, but we will back the judgements of those  that are closer to the action.    [Curtis] Is it time for NATO to back up its rhetoric? It  has threatened air strikes in the past?    [Evans] Well, undoubtedly it would. But the question you  have to then ask is what happens next. Will it plunge the  country into a cycle of retaliatory violence which will end up  creating net additions to the sum of human misery in that  country? There was tremendous enthusiasm for rushing in in  Somalia -- you may remember in the middle of last year, and  shooting up that awful General Aidid for the terrible things  that he was doing -- and the net result of that was to create  three months of absolute chaos on the ground, many, many deaths  being caused and absolutely no advance in the overall  politico-military situation. And those lessons have to be  learned carefully and those around the world who are rushing  into print with robust commentary about how wimpish everyone has  been, I think very often they are just not making those kinds of  calculations. They are very tough, they are very finely  balanced. [end recording]</p>

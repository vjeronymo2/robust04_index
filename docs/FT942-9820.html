			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tomkinsons shares fall 11% to 280p Tomkinsons, the carpet manufacturer, saw its shares fall 11 per cent after reporting pre-tax profits down from Pounds 430,000 to Pounds 332,000 in the six months to April 2. The shares fell 35p to 280p. The company said that there had been considerable volatility in the carpets market and concerns about increases in personal taxation had depressed consumer sentiment. The trading outlook remained difficult, the company added, and the full year trading was expected to be below that of last year. Turnover was Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 10.4m). Earnings per share were 3.6p (4.7p). The interim dividend is being maintained at 3.5p.</p>

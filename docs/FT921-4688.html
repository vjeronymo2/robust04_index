			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / US eases telecom sales curbs for CIS THE US has reversed its opposition to the sale of fibre-optic telecommunications equipment to the Commonwealth of Independent States, paving the way for greatly expanded sales to the former Soviet states, writes Nancy Dunne from Washington. Formal agreement to ease multilateral export controls on telecommunications is expected at the next meeting of Cocom, the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls based in Paris, which is due in June at the latest. The US had opposed the introduction of these changes during the 'shaky period' after the Soviet coup. It is now US proposing an easing rather than an end to telecommunications controls. Sales would be allowed of medium-speed systems for use between CIS cities and of top-speed systems for international communications. Controls would continue for technology for use near military and nuclear facilities. This would rule out the proposed trans-Siberian fibre optics transmission system.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: ITT may sell off its Sheraton franchises The prospect of further asset sales by ITT was raised yesterday by Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of the US conglomerate, which reported virtually flat net income in the latest quarter. Mr Araskog said the most likely candidate for sale or a spin-off was the Sheraton hotels franchising business. Of the 270 Sheraton establishments in North America, 207 are franchised rather than owned by the company. In total, hotels accounted for Dollars 18m of the group's operating net income in the latest quarter, and Dollars 913m of sales. ITT is selling its financial services businesses, other than insurance, in part to help finance the purchase of Viacom's Madison Square Garden business. ITT is undertaking the Dollars 1.1bn deal in association with Cablevision, a cable-TV operator. The group has come under pressure from shareholders to dispose of various operations which could be worth more as stand-alone businesses. The group's ongoing businesses as a whole recorded operating income of Dollars 399m, up 22 per cent from a year before. Net income as a whole was Dollars 257m, Dollars 5m higher than in the 1993 quarter on sales up 10 per cent at Dollars 5.67bn. Earnings per share rose 5 per cent, to Dollars 2.01.</p>

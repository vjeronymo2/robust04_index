			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Inquiry to probe Welsh agency AN INDEPENDENT inquiry is being set up to look at the management practices of the Welsh Development Agency, which were castigated last month by the Commons public accounts committee. A panel of three, headed by Sir John Caines, former permanent secretary at the Department for Education, will carry out the inquiry. Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, who took over in July as agency chairman and has set up the investigation, said yesterday: 'The issues raised by the PAC report are serious. It is important they are considered in detail and that prompt and effective remedial action is taken as appropriate.' The panel will decide whether further disciplinary action is needed. Mr Rowe-Beddoe said the inquiry would be carried out with 'thoroughness and speed' and would 'professionally close a troublesome chapter in the agency's history'. The committee's investigation came after concerns raised by the National Audit Office on the agency's 1991-92 accounts. The MPs said management practices at the government agency, which was then chaired by Dr Gwyn Jones, had fallen 'well below' what parliament had a right to expect. These included a redundancy scheme which had not been approved by the Welsh Office, the appointment of a fraudster as marketing director, and an 'Operation Wizard' to consider privatisation in which consultants were paid more than Pounds 300,000. In the wake of that report, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, last week warned chairmen of non-departmental public bodies to insist 'on the highest standards of conduct'. Mr Redwood's speech coincided with a report by the National Audit Office criticising the Development Board for Rural Wales over the way it had allocated housing under a set of rules separate to those made public. Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West and a critic of the agency's management, said yesterday: 'I am very pleased that David Rowe-Beddoe is not attempting to brush the criticism under the carpet. I took it for granted when he was appointed that he would make vigorous efforts to sweep clean and I will be pleased to supply evidence I have got to the inquiry.'</p>

Common stockholders' equity currently includes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) common stock, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) common stock surplus, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) undivided profits, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) capital reserves, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) net unrealized losses on noncurrent marketable equity securities. The net unrealized losses are those recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 12, ``Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities'' (FAS 12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> FAS 115  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 115. This statement superseded FAS 12. FAS 115 required that all securities be grouped into one of three classifications: held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Most significantly, FAS 115 established net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities as a new component of common stockholders' equity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAS 115 defines available-for-sale securities as those securities that a bank does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, and does not intend to trade actively as part of its trading account. FAS 115 increases the number of securities that banks must account for at market value. Consequently, numerous securities previously reported by banks at amortized cost will now be reported at their market value. In August 1993, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) announced the adoption of FAS 115 for regulatory reporting purposes, effective January 1, 1994. Accordingly, all national banks follow FAS 115 for reporting purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On April 18, 1994, the OCC proposed to adopt FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes (59 FR 18328, April 18, 1994). The other Federal banking agencies published similar proposals to adopt FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes. See 58 FR 68563 (December 28, 1993) (Federal Reserve Board); 58 FR 68781 (December 29, 1993) (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation); 59 FR 32143 (June 22, 1994) (Office of Thrift Supervision). The OCC issued the proposal to promote greater consistency of regulatory capital rules with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). At the same time, the OCC wanted to understand the industry sentiment regarding the costs and benefits of adopting FAS 115, and to determine banks' assessment of their ability to manage the potential volatility in regulatory capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Review of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

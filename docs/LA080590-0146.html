			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DIPLOMAT SEEKS CHINESE COOPERATION  </P> <P> A senior Bush Administration expert on Asia arrived in Beijing on Saturday for  a hastily arranged visit aimed primarily at seeking Chinese cooperation in an  international arms embargo against Iraq.  </P> <P> The official, Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, also will brief  Chinese officials about the meeting last week in the Siberian city of Irkutsk  at which Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze served notice of their desire for unprecedented  U.S.-Soviet cooperation in Asia, U.S. officials said.  </P> <P> Solomon's mission indicates that the United States is seeking both to enlist  China's support against Iraq and, at the same time, to reassure the Chinese  regime that it need not feel threatened by the closeness with which U.S. and  Soviet officials are now working together.  </P> <P> "The Chinese are big players, and they ought to be in on these decisions," one  Administration official said.  </P> <P> "We probably would have thought about doing this (sending an emissary to  Beijing) anyway, but (the Iraqi invasion of) Kuwait put it over the edge," the  official said. "You can't have a situation where you appear to be working only  with the Soviets. You've got to include China in the action here."  </P> <P> Although the Soviet Union and France have been Iraq's two leading arms  suppliers, China also provides significant amounts of arms and military  equipment to Baghdad. In addition, China is a permanent member of the U.N.  Security Council, and its cooperation would be necessary to pass any council  resolution imposing sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> Asked two days ago whether China might go along with an arms embargo against  Iraq, Solomon told The Times, "The Chinese are going to have to decide how  isolated in the world they want to be."  </P> <P> Shevardnadze told a news conference Friday night in Moscow that the Soviet  Union had not been in direct contact with China concerning the international  efforts against Iraq. U.S. officials at the time declined to say whether they  had talked with Chinese officials, but made clear they expected to do so.  </P> <P> Solomon accompanied Baker during the secretary's just-completed visit to Asia,  including the meetings in Irkutsk, at which Baker and Shevardnadze spoke of the  importance of having Washington and Moscow work together in Asia on Cambodia,  Afghanistan and other issues.  </P> <P> On Friday night, while Baker stopped in Moscow for an emergency meeting on the  situation in Iraq, Solomon left the secretary's entourage to catch a flight to  Beijing.  </P> <P> Solomon is the highest-ranking Administration official to visit China since  National Security Adviser Brent A. Scowcroft made two secret trips to Beijing  last year.  </P> <P> Officially, the Administration still maintains the policy it adopted after  China's 1989 crushing of its pro-democracy movement. The United States has  banned "exchanges" with China by any officials at the level of assistant  secretary or higher.  </P> <P> However, the Administration has explained that it defines exchanges narrowly as  meaning a reciprocal trading of visits between Beijing and Washington.  </P> <P> One senior Administration official said he is quite hopeful that China will  join the U.S.-Soviet arms embargo and other international efforts against Iraq.  </P> <P> "My guess is that the Chinese will be cooperative," he said. "The Chinese  generally don't like it when one country invades another country. They really  got mad at us over (the U.S. invasion of) Panama" last December.  </P> <P> However, over the past decade, China has carried out an extremely active effort  to develop close friendships in the Middle East. A willingness to supply  low-cost weaponry has been the key ingredient in China's diplomatic effort.  China made huge arms deliveries to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war.  </P> <P> Over the past three years, U.S. officials have been extremely concerned about  the possibility that China would supply newly produced M-9 missiles to several  countries in the Middle East, including Iraq. The missile is still believed to  be in the development stage.  </P></p>

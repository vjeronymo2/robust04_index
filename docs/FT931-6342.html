			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Personal View: The beauty of a vote - Reform of bankruptcy law could help revive ailing companies On both sides of the Atlan-tic, a debate is taking place about bankruptcy law. There is a lot at stake. When a company needlessly goes to the wall, the overall health of the economy is threatened - to say nothing of lost jobs and wrecked lives. Bankruptcy law should play an important role in resuscitating financially distressed companies that are inherently sound. But current procedures are failing to deliver. A recent Coopers &amp; Lybrand report concludes that, despite reforms in 1986, UK insolvency procedures too often 'bayonet the wounded'. In the US, Chapter 11 is thought to be slow, costly and too soft on debtors. Practitioners have suggested ways of amending current procedures. While many of these changes are sensible, there are more fundamental problems that no amount of tinkering will solve. A radical restructuring of bankruptcy law is needed. We propose a new procedure, which is simple and quick, and gets the balance between liquidation and reorganisation right. Almost all existing procedures can be crudely classified into two types. In the first type, a bankrupt company's assets are sold off for cash, and the proceeds distributed to creditors according to the seniority of claims. This type of procedure - in essence a cash auction - is how Chapter 7 operates in the US, and how most liquidations and receiverships work in the UK. Cash auctions are attractively simple. The worry is that they lead to the piecemeal liquidation of healthy companies. Of course, in principle, there is nothing to stop someone from making a cash bid for the company as a going concern. The problem is that it is costly to buy the whole of a large company for cash. So even viable companies may be broken up. To overcome the danger of inefficient liquidation, a second type of procedure has been developed. In the UK, this is the administration order; in the US, it is Chapter 11. Although the details of the UK and US procedures are very different, both can be viewed as forms of structured bargaining. The idea is to encourage creditors to agree on a reorganisation plan for the company, including a restructuring of their claims. Crucially, a plan can be agreed by a suitable majority of the creditors: unanimity is not required. Creditors may of course decide to liquidate, and this is how most cases end up. Reorganisation is a laudable objective, but there is an inherent problem with structured bargaining procedures. Creditors are being asked to make two decisions. First, what should happen to the company - should it be reorganised or liquidated? Second, who should get what - whose debt should be forgiven, and by how much? Serious conflicts of interest arise when these two matters are decided together. Senior creditors may push for rapid liquidation since they will certainly get paid. Junior creditors and shareholders may want to gamble on the reorganisation process, since they enjoy the upside gains if the company's prospects improve, but do not suffer the downside losses. In structured bargaining, people are not only squabbling over how to divide the cake, they are also fighting over which cake to divide. This mixing of decisions is a recipe for failure. We propose a procedure that has the simplicity of a cash auction, but which is flexible enough to allow for reorganisation, without conflicts of interest. At the outset of bankruptcy, an insolvent company's debts are cancelled. The accountant or judge supervising the process then solicits bids for the company. The crucial difference from a cash auction is that bidders can offer to buy the company using as means of payment securities in the post-bankruptcy company. Suppose the company's managers believe that the bankruptcy was owing to bad luck rather than their bad management. They want to continue running the company, but do not have the cash to buy it outright. Under our proposal, they could bid to retain their jobs by offering equity in the post-bankruptcy company. Another possibility would be to make a bid comprising cash and equity, where the cash is raised by borrowing against the company's future profits. An outside management team could make the same kinds of bids. And of course anyone is free to make a purely cash bid. The difficulty in evaluating these various bids is that they are chalk and cheese. How does one compare a cash bid to a non-cash bid? The answer is to transform the former claim-holders into shareholders, and then let them vote on the bids. There are a number of ways of doing this. One market-based mechanism gives all the equity initially to senior creditors. Junior creditors have the right to buy out the senior creditors once the bids are announced: someone owning 1 per cent of the junior debt is given the option to buy 1 per cent of the equity from the senior creditors at a price equal to 1 per cent of the senior debt. Similarly, former shareholders are given the option to buy back the equity from the creditors as a whole. The merit of this scheme is that it preserves the seniority of claims without requiring an external valuation of the company. No junior claimant need feel short-changed, since he or she can always buy out the senior claimants if he or she thinks their equity allocation is worth more than what they are owed. Once the new shareholders have been determined, they vote on which bid to accept. If the vote goes in favour of a cash bid, the company is in effect liquidated or sold. If a non-cash bid wins, then the company is in effect reorganised. The advantage of a vote is that it leaves the decision over the company's future - whether to liquidate or reorganise - in the hands of the (new) owners. And at the moment of decision, these owners' interests are aligned, since they are all shareholders. Moreover, there is no squabbling over the division of the company's value, since the procedure determines this mechanically via the options. We think our procedure strikes the right balance between liquidation and reorganisation. Unlike a cash auction, the procedure gives claim-holders the option of maintaining the company as a going concern if the company's bad fortunes are the result of bad luck rather than bad management. Unlike administration or Chapter 11, the procedure avoids conflicts of interest. It is quick and cheap. And it is not biased in favour of incumbent management. Managers must persuade the new shareholders to vote them back into office, presumably against a competing cash bid. The threat of losing one's job provides a strong incentive to avoid bankruptcy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 May (MTI) -- The National Election  Committee has received no applications for legal remedy  concerning the elections so far, the Interior Ministry's  Election Office informed MTI on Wednesday [11 May].    The election office has stated that the second round of the  elections may be entered by individual candidates who received  at least 15 percent of the vote in the first round.    If there is no such candidate, the three with the most votes  will be in the running. In this way, there will be  constituencies where candidates can enter even though they may  have only acquired seven percent in the May 8 round.    In the first round, two individual deputies received enough  votes to win straight out of the gate, and 125 party-list  mandates were decided. The race for the other 259 (out of the  total 386) seats is to continue in the second round. This  includes 174 individual mandates, and a further 85 resulting  from leftover votes.    The deputy contest is thus heating up in 174 of the 176  individual constituencies. Balloting will be valid if voter  turnout exceeds 25 percent by even one person.    What are leftover votes? -- 27 mandates will be distributed  among parties winning more than 5 percent of votes cast for 152  regional lists. National party-lists will determine 58 mandates  to be allotted by complicated mathematical calculations on the  basis of leftover votes for individual candidates. This means  that a total of 85 parliamentary seats will be awarded on the  basis of fractional votes cast for the six parties.    An order was previously established by drawing lots for the  six parliamentary parties on the national list in the event that  two parties get the same number of leftover votes. In this  case, the mandate will go to the party that ranks higher on the  national list.</p>

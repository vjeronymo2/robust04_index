			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, </F> president of the United Arab Emirates, by unidentified  correspondent in al-Jarf [as transliterated], between Abu Dhabi  and Dubai, "yesterday"]    [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] The United Arab Emirates [UAE] is  the only continuing and prosperous Arab unity. In your view,  what are the reasons for its success, and how do you view the  UAE's future?    [Al Nuhayyan] The UAE union will remain eternal, especially  after the success of its experiment and the continued efforts to  safeguard it. Nothing fragments and destroys a building except  failure to look after it and failure to continue to give and  build. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Your Highness Mr. President, do you believe that  the time has come to end the serious Arab split caused by the  Gulf crisis and achieve Arab reconciliation, and what do you  believe is the means to achieve that, given that you have  frequently called for Arab solidarity and supported the Arab  League secretary general's initiative in this connection?    [Al Nuhayyan] The Arab nation's split and fragmentation  existed before the Gulf war, but this war has aggravated and  deepened this split. However, if there is now an inclination  and a change of ideas for the sake of correcting the Arab march,  eliminating disputes, and seriously and sincerely bolstering the  unity of Arab ranks and linking the brothers' destiny, it will  be a good thing.    As for the union some people believe should be established  from the east to the west of the Arab world and which should  have one leader, that is unacceptable, impossible, and never  happened anywhere in the world before, neither in the East nor  in the West. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Do you agree with the view that reconciliation is  unlikely as long as President Saddam Husayn is still in power,  as the wounds of the Gulf crisis in the Arab body still have not  healed? Saddam is still in power, and the international embargo  is inflicting a great deal of suffering on the Iraqis. How do  you see a way out of this suffering?    [Al Nuhayyan] The Iraqi people's suffering is not caused by  us; Saddam Husayn is responsible for it. We pray to God to show  Saddam Husayn the right way one day. If the Arabs agree with  one another, he might change his opinion and follow the right  path that pleases him, the Iraqi people, and the Arab nation.  Maybe that will be achieved. We should not give up hope.  [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] What stage has been reached in the problem of the  UAE islands (Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa)  occupied by Iran, and are you contemplating a new step that may  restore the claimants' rights?    [Al Nuhayyan] We want something new. But when we hear  Iran's statements, we find them remote from what we are  contemplating. How can we negotiate with or get anything from  someone who seizes a right and alleges it was his in the past?  But if someone says this is mine and I have the evidence,  others can provide their own evidence too. If their evidence is  stronger, the right is theirs. If our evidence is stronger, the  right is ours. If Iran's statements are made in such a manner,  we would say: Yes, that is good and correct. But if we are  told, we have our evidence and do not know whether our brothers  and neighbors have any, the truth of this evidence can only be  established through arbitration.    If we submit our evidence and they submit theirs to  arbitration, it is arbitration which will decide which is  correct and which is wrong.    [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean turning to the International Court of  Justice in The Hague?    [Al Nuhayyan] Yes.    [AL-HAYAH] The U.S. Administration accuses Iran of  supporting terrorism and stresses its concerns over Iran's  endeavors to possess a huge military arsenal. Do you share these  concerns with the Americans? What is your opinion of the "dual  containment" pursued by President Bill Clinton's administration  toward Iraq and Iran? How do you see the future of relations  with Iran?    [Al Nuhayyan] The United States knows the truth about Iran  just as it knows the truth about Iraq. And Iran too knows the  truth about the United States. Each knows the other. Every  state wants equality, justice, and reconciliation with its  neighbors and friends, and it has its own methods. But if a  state wants to achieve something for itself and deny it to  others, it is pursuing methods that moves it away from its  neighbors, especially the states with which it has issues.  [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] How would you assess the peace process between  the Palestinians and the Israelis, and what are the requirements  for ending the Middle East problem? It has been reported that  Abu-'Ammar will visit the UAE soon. Did he request a visit or  did you invite him?    [Al Nuhayyan] We did not invite him. He wants to come, but  we postponed his visit. We told him: You have something more  important to do now. Your visit to us is not the important one.  What is important is for you to correct yourself, your people,  and homeland, then visiting us is open to you.    [AL-HAYAH] Is there a specific date for the visit?    [Al-Nuhayyan] No.    [AL-HAYAH] In view of the Gulf war experience, some Gulf  states decided to sign security agreements with major states.  Are you thinking of concluding a similar agreement, especially  after the ruling out of the formation of a unified  100,000-strong Gulf army?    [Al Nuhayyan] That depends on the situation and the need.  If someone needs to build a home to protect him from rain, he  begins to build it. If he needs an airconditioned house, he  begins to build it. The UAE acts according to its needs, and  nothing at all can stop us from doing what we believe achieves  our security, existence on the ground, and respect. [passage  omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Oil prices have slumped -- which affects the  income of the producing states, including the UAE. At the  recent meeting the UAE proposed a production ceiling. Is that  still your position, given that you have always urged  cooperation between producers and consumers so that everyone can  get his rights?    [Al Nuhayyan] The UAE is one of several fraternal states,  and it will support what makes its sisters happy. It will not  move in front of them or stay behind them. This is the UAE's  position.    [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that the UAE is coordinating with the  fraternal states?    [Al Nuhayyan] Yes. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Is there a possibility of a cabinet reshuffle  soon?    [Al-Nuhayyan] Yes.    [AL-HAYAH] You criticized the position of both East and  West. Do you believe the Arabs and Muslims have in one way or  another disappointed the Bosnian Muslims, and what are the means  of building new Arab and Islamic support for these people?    [Al Nuhayyan] The Arabs cannot be blamed in any way. The  blame should be pinned on the major states talking about justice  and human rights. You heard a great deal about these states'  talk about human rights. They are interested in the human  rights of people who are far from them, not those of the people  in their region. They talk about human rights, and yet the  Bosnians are being murdered, expelled, and deprived of their  territory and children. Human rights have not helped them at  all.    There is a lot of talk and little action. Anyone who talks a  lot does little. It is the major states' responsibility, not  the Arab states' responsibility. Because the Arab states are  still in the process of building themselves and have not  achieved anything, and so are the Islamic states. May God  enable us to achieve what we want for our Arab and Islamic  nation.    [AL-HAYAH] Do you believe that the Gulf states can surmount  the complications of the occupation and liberation of Kuwait,  hence enabling the Arab states to return to unified action?    [Al-Nuhayyan] If all the Arab states have the desire and  seriousness, the Arab nation -- Kuwait and others -- will be  fine. If we remember what we have lost in the past, avoid the  methods that harmed us in the past, and think about the methods  that benefit, strengthen, and unite us as an Arab nation, the  Arab nation will restore its glory. Our unity is our strength  and the Arab nation's eternal asset. If we believe in that,  every good will be achieved.</p>

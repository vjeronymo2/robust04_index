			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected receivable and passed through to certificateholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Parties to Transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> originator <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a homeowner or automobile purchaser, or leases property to the lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell it to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course of their business, including finance companies for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations, financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations. Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of the receivables may also function as the trust sponsor or servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  8. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sponsor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be one of three entities: (i) A special-purpose corporation unaffiliated with the servicer, (ii) a special-purpose or other corporation affiliated with the servicer, or (iii) the servicer itself. Where the sponsor is not also the servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables to the trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  9. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> trustee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in favor of certificateholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to ABS, the trust sponsor or the servicer. ABS represents that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust company experienced in trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the servicer, sponsor or the trust as specified in the pooling and servicing agreement. The method of compensating the trustee which is specified in the pooling and servicing agreement will be disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  10. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> servicer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service'' the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted, a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to ABS. In other cases, however, affiliates of ABS may originate or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor a trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Where the sponsor of a trust is not the originator of receivables included in a trust, the sponsor generally purchases the receivables in the secondary market, either directly from the originator or from another secondary market participant. The price the sponsor pays for a receivable is determined by competitive market forces, taking into account payment terms, interest rate, quality, and forecasts as to future interest rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives certificates representing the entire beneficial interest in the trust, or the cash proceeds of the sale of such certificates. If the sponsor receives certificates from the trust, the sponsor sells all or a portion of these certificates for cash to investors or securities underwriters. In some transactions, the sponsor or an affiliate may retain a portion of the certificates for its own account. In addition, in some transactions the originator may sell receivables to a trust for cash. At the time of the sale, the trustee would sell certificates to the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the sale to pay the originator for receivables sold to the trust. The transfer of the receivables to the trust by the sponsor, the sale of certificates to investors, and the receipt of the cash proceeds by the sponsor generally take place simultaneously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Felipe Farias] </F>   [Excerpt] The Bahia State branch of the Brazilian Social  Democracy Party [PSDB] has decided to support Workers Party  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.    The decision was made during the 8 May convention that  officially nominated former Minister Jutahy Magalhaes, Jr., as  the party's gubernatorial candidate for Bahia, Deputy Sergio  Gaudenzi as vice gubernatorial candidate, and Waldir Pires as  candidate for the Senate.    The position of the Bahia branch of the PSDB is deemed  irreversible. Jutahy Magalhaes, Jr. said: "The decision has  been made. Everywhere I go I say that my presidential candidate  is Lula. We have already reported our decision to the party and  to Fernando Henrique Cardoso." [passage omitted]</p>

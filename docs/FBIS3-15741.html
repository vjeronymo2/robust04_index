			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov and KAZTAG </F> correspondent Gennadiy Lunev]    [Text] Almaty March 9 TASS -- There was a strong turnout at  the elections to the Kazakh Parliament and local bodies of  self-rule, which were held in Kazakhstan on March 7. According  to preliminary results, some 75 per cent of the electorate went  to the polls, or five-six per cent more than most bold home and  foreign forecasters predicted.    According to chairman of the Central Electoral Commission  Karatay Turysov, organisers of the elections were especially  worried over northern regions in the republic, where  Russian-speaking population and opposition politicians,  especially among Cossacks, prevail.    They tried to dampen the high spirits of Kazakh voters.  However, there was no boycott of the elections there. On the  contrary, the percentage of voters who participated in the  elections, was higher in the north than the country-wide average  -- over 80 per cent.    As for allegations by some Western mass media that there  were  numerous violations of the election procedure, Turysov dismissed  them as groundless. No serious complaints have been sent to the  Central Electoral Commission for the time being.    Those which have been filed, will be thoroughly examined,  Turysov stressed, adding that appropriate conclusions will be  made on each case.</p>

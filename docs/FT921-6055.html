			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property results blow THE FIRST property company report of the season left little doubt that the sector is facing some grim news in the near future. Capital &amp; Counties revealed a halving of profits to Pounds 27m and a 29 per cent fall in net asset values at 283p. The shares tumbled on the results, down 14 to 166p, on a stock 73 per cent owned by Transatlantic Corporation of South Africa. Capital specialises in out-of-town shopping units and has been particularly badly hit by the downturn in the retail sector. 'With consumer spending unlikely to pick up for some time, some retailers will still have to be offered rent-free units until 1993 at the earliest,' said Mr Ray Jones at Paribas. He added that the company faced a further fall in profits this year. Other analysts agreed, with Mr Chris Turner at BZW looking for Pounds 18m profits this year, and Mr Michael Padley at Strauss Turnbull on Pounds 23m. The results come after a bad week for the sector, with three houses - UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, County NatWest and Panmure Gordon - issuing negative reports and selective company downgrades. Falling office rental values, particularly in central London, remain the chief cause for concern. However, for some property issues, the bottom may have been reached, according to UBS which is turning buyer on stocks it was recommending a hold or sell at the beginning of the week; namely MEPC, Slough Estates and Hammerson. MEPC tumbled yesterday on a negative trade press report, down 5 at 338p, while Hammerson Ordinary slipped 2 to 467p and Slough was steady at 201p. Great Portland pleased the market with its sale of its stake in Bride Hall, another property group, the shares rising 6 to 160p. Wellcome ahead Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome jumped before an announcement by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it had approved the Zovirax herpes drug for treatment of chicken pox in children. The shares were marked up sharply at the start of trading with some dealers offering stock at as much as 1,150p. The shares continued firm following confirmation of the FDA approval by the company. However, analysts pointed out that the news had already been included in most profit forecasts and the enthusiasm dwindled. Wellcome closed 11 up at 1,126p with 1.7m shares traded. ICI bounce Chemicals giant ICI bounced back by 9 to 1,293p as a number of securities houses reiterated their buy recommendations on the stock in the wake of its full-year results on Thursday. Both County NatWest and Hoare Govett were pointing out the company's strong points to clients, although County's 1992 profit forecast for ICI of Pounds 950m is at the lower end of the analysts' forecasts. Hoare Govett predicts Pounds 1.04bn. A news report that its breast cancer drug might cause liver cell damage came too late to affect the shares. BP uncertain Shares in BP eased 1 to 266p, on turnover of 15m but managed to shrug off news that Moody's, the US credit rating agency, may downgrade Dollars 6.2bn of outstanding long-term debt. Short-term debt of BP's guaranteed subsidiaries is not under review. The shares were helped by a long-term buy note from Merrill Lynch. Moody's view appears more in line with recent warnings from London sources than with the more optimistic opinions of Wall Street analysts: Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers have also recommended the shares this week. The debt rating agency yesterday cited concern that BP's earnings will remain under pressure, which could stress its operating cash flow and result in increased borrowings to support exploration and development expenditures. Still suffering from its poorly-received results, Royal Insurance Holdings continued its downward spiral, the shares losing a further 7 to 183p, on top of Thursday's fall of 36. Sun Alliance also slipped 7 to 264p, but General Accident regained some of its previous day's losses, rising 6 to 432p. Bear raiders were once again in evidence at P&amp;O. The shares tumbled 20 to 366 as market hints resurfaced of problems at Chelsfield, the private company with which P&amp;O runs the Pall Mall Properties group. Profit-taking combined with negative sentiment left Tiphook 18 down at 378p. British Airways gained five to 270p as Lehman Brothers recommended the stock to both US and UK clients. Turnover at 8.2m included a block of 2.5m done at 267 1/2 and another at 265 1/2 . Among aerospace and engineering stocks, British Aerospace took centre stage. The shares jumped 9 to 317p boosted by speculation that the company would soon come into the lucrative Al Yamamah 2 Saudi Arabia defence contract. Turnover reached 5.2m. Analysts upgrades on Midland Bank, following its well-received figures on Thursday, helped the shares add 7 to 267p in busy turnover of 8m. Lloyds Bank basked in favourable comments from most corners of the market, gaining 8 to 413p. A feeling that National Westminster Bank had put the worst behind it helped it add 3 to 311p. More cautious notes on Barclays, however - Credit Lyonnais Laing, for example, recommending a switch into NatWest - saw the shares slip 7 to 368p. Ranks Hovis lost 5 to 202p after Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court cut his 1992 profit forecast to Pounds 105m from Pounds 115m, following a presentation by the company. Worries about the UK bread industry were behind the downgrading. Associated British Foods fell 2 to 430p and Hillsdown Holdings gave up 1 to 152p on the referral of Hillsdown's planned acquisition of AB Food's canning and ambient stored meals division to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Disappointment at Unilever's results have hit the shares this week, but the price rebounded 7 to 941p, helped by a recommendation from Smith New Court. A profit downgrading by Kleinwort Benson left food retailer Kwik Save 12 lower at 566p on turnover of 3m shares. Two trades totalling 5m shares provided most of Whitbread 'A' turnover of 6m. The shares fell 5 to 460p, with Allied-Lyons also losing 5 to 642p. USM-quoted property company Union Square was the heaviest traded stock with a recorded turnover of 26m shares. Smith New Court had carried out an agency cross in 6.6 per cent of the company's shares. The shares closed a halfpenny better at 4 1/2 p and the company said it would be making an announcement on Monday. Lloyds Chemists lost 12 to 327p after announcing that it will make a recommended offer for chemist Macarthy, valued at Pounds 93.6m, or 337p per share. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Wednesday gave approval for Lloyds to proceed with an earlier Pounds 79m bid, as well as allowing rival UniChem to make an offer. Macarthy, which had risen sharply the previous day, partly on hopes that the Lloyds bid might be worth around 360p, eased 2 to 327p. Unichem gained 2 to 204p.

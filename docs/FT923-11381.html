			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A STRONG squeeze towards the close of yesterday's session helped the September FT-SE contract regain some of its recent losses in an otherwise uneventful day in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the contract was struck at 2,405, which led some dealers to hope for a firm session. However, with both independent traders and large institutions choosing to remain on the sidelines, the September contract soon drifted lower. Sporadic mid-morning buying led to a brief rally, but this petered out after the few orders were filled and the contract returned to its downward direction, reaching the day's low of 2,382 just after lunch. Bargain hunting, together with a good initial performance on Wall Street, saw a reversal in the fortunes of the contract which gathered momentum in the last hour of trading, leading to a squeeze and a strong final burst. September closed at 2,422, up 21 from its previous close and around 6 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover returned to a modest 7,588 lots. Dealers reported a dull session in traded options. Turnover totalled 29,118 contracts, of which the FT-SE option accounted for 10,581 lots. BP was the most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 2,108 contracts.</p>

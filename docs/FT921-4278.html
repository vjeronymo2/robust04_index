			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts firm as Bank details Pounds 500m in tap stock issues UK GOVERNMENT bond prices firmed yesterday, helped by the strength of the US Treasury bond market on Friday and the Bank of England's decision to issue a further Pounds 500m of tap stocks across a wide range of maturities. The Bank announced yesterday it was issuing: Pounds 100m of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 1994; Pounds 100m of 9 3/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1998; Pounds 200m of 9 per cent conversion stock due 2000; and Pounds 100m of 9 1/2 per cent conversion stock due 2005. It has also issued Pounds 100m of the 8 1/2 per cent stock due 1994 and Pounds 100m of the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 1998 to the National Debt Commissioners. Some traders interpreted the tap announcements as a sign that the Bank expects the gilt market to pick up again in response to today's Budget news. Last week saw a sharp fall in gilt prices on worries about the government's heavy borrowing requirement, and volumes in the Liffe gilt futures contract were low yesterday as the market awaited the Budget announcement. The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from its opening of 96.18 to 96.21, up from Friday's close of 96.12. Meanwhile, the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 114 7/16 to end the day at 114 13/16 . US TREASURIES firmed through the day, but trading was thin in the absence of any significant economic news. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  23/32 higher at 101 15/32 , yielding 7.86 per cent. The two- and three-year notes posted gains of  7/32 , while intermediate issues were up about 15/32 . The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 4 per cent. The operation, which adds reserves to the banking system, was widely expected and did not indicate a change in monetary policy. It was needed to redress a drop in vault cash and increases in required reserves and currency in circulation. Treasuries are expected to be quiet through most of this week. The first important economic data is scheduled for Thursday, when retail sales figure for February will be released. Although this is not usually an important figure, the market is trying to gauge the strength of the economy and a strong increase would be seen as a clear sign that it was recovering. JAPAN'S benchmark No 129 issue weakened yesterday - moving against the market's general direction - with dealers attributing the fall either to a single large trade or to selling ahead of the World Bank's large global yen bond issue. The No 129 due 2000 ended with a yield of 5.43 per cent, having opened at 5.42 per cent. The yield ranged between 5.4 and 5.45 per cent. In the futures market, the price of the front-month June futures contract for 10-year government bonds ended up 0.14 at 102.12. Traders said there were market rumours that the dip in the No 129 could have been the result of an exercised option on the bond. However, it could also have arisen from selling of the issue ahead of the World Bank's global bond issue, which is due to be priced off the No 129 today. GERMAN government bonds closed slightly higher in dull trade as the market waited for further news on the wage rounds. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.46 and closed at 88.52 on a volume of about 20,000 contracts. Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch bonds closed higher.</p>

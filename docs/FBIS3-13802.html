It has generated various reactions from political  quarters and key figures in the Kingdom [of Jordan]. [passage  omitted]    Salim al-Za'nun, acting speaker of the Palestine National  Council, has said the UN Security Council resolution condemning  the Hebron massacre is disappointing because the negative impact  of U.S. pressure or the abstention from voting on Jerusalem  outweighs the positive points contained in the provisions of the  condemnation. This indicates a U.S. retraction in Israel's  interest.    Al-Za'nun said the UN Security Council's condemnation of the  Hebron massacre is just for appearance's sake. Nothing in the  resolutions confirms Israel will take any steps to protect the  Palestinian people from the settlers' terrorism. He added: The  delay in the adoption of the resolution has cost it much of its  importance.    Al-Za'nun said circumstances on the international level are  not in our interest. This calls for a comprehensive Arab  assessment of the peace process. He said he hopes the four Arab  countries participating in the peace process resume their  meetings and coordination in an accurate manner at this critical  stage.    PLO Executive Committee Member Bishop Iliya Khuri said the  UN  Security Council resolution has dashed the hopes pinned on it.  The United States blocked the resolution for three weeks. When  it was issued, it did not contain anything new with respect to  the demands the PLO submitted to the United States in the wake  of the horrendous massacre.    On the U.S. abstention on the two paragraphs, Bishop Iliya  Khuri said that by abandoning its previous stand that Jerusalem  is occupied territory, the United States has failed itself  before failing the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic  nations. We see it changing its stand in this era where the  Arab nation continues to be fragmented despite the sincere calls  his Majesty King Husayn makes to reunite this nation.</p>

Ernesto Samper, former economic development minister under  President Cesar Gaviria, and favored to win his party's  nomination for the presidential candidacy, said a fast one was  pulled on the president and he asked himself if the one who did  it was the U.S. Government or the Defense Ministry.    He added that "fast one pulled on the president was  unfortunately pulled on all Colombians, who feel we have been  harmed by this undue interference by the United States."    As for the reiterated official explanation that the largest  contingent of troops, made up of 156 men stationed in Juan Chaco  on the Pacific coast, came to build a school and a health  center, he said it is "simply outrageous and no Colombian is  willing to believe that story."    Another Liberal Party presidential hopeful, Humberto de la  Calle, much closer to Gaviria, said that "since before the Juan  Chaco situation emerged, I asked for the suspension of the  operation because just as I feared, it created an atmosphere of  inadvisable suspense and suspicion."    He pointed out that work on social projects can perfectly  well be in the hands of the Colombian Army and he added that  Gaviria's explanations for the case have created an atmosphere  of confusion.    "What I believe should be condemned are the half truths, the  quasi clandestine way of handling it, and the absence of clear  information for Colombians," he added.</p>

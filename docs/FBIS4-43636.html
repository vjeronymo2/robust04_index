			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Vienna, June 20 (AFP) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korea for visas for  two new inspectors, following Pyongyang's concessions to former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter, IAEA spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer  said Monday [20 June].    He said the delivery of visas would be a test of North  Korea's will to resolve the latest crisis, sparked by its  refusal to allow IAEA inspections of a nuclear reactor suspected  of diverting fuel for military use. [passage omitted]    Two inspectors are already in North Korea at the Yongbyon  experimental reactor, but they must be replaced after having  worked under difficult conditions, the Agency said.    Yongbyon had discharged some 8,000 nuclear waste rods before  the inspectors could get there to supervise the process, but  they are still too hot for any extraction of plutonium, Meyer  said.

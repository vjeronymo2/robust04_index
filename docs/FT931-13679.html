			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Yes, but no sax appeal Here's a thought that may have cros-sed the mind of Britain's prime minister: there are 2,535 days, or just over 83 months, to go to the turn of the century. Who will be in the important seats of power then? I can think of just three incumbent politicians who may reasonably fancy their chances of holding on until at least January 1 2000. They are: President Bill Clinton, Mr John Major and, of course, Mr Saddam Hussein. Very well, strike out the latter. The notion is too depressing. What is certain is that by the end of this decade France will have a new president, Germany a new chancellor, Italy a fresh prime minister and the European Commission a president other than Mr Jacques Delors. Even Spain will probably have a different head of government. Most of the above changes are likely to take place within the next two or three years. That would clear away the present generation of continental west European leaders - and with it the Kohl-Mitterrand duet. A different cast would be in place comfortably in advance of the next British general election, which need not be held until 1996 or 1997. The new US president and the relatively new British prime minister might, however, sit in their present chairs until the millennium. When writing such words you should always keep your fingers crossed, throw a pinch of salt over your left shoulder, chant a few spells, and pepper the air with phrases about not tempting fate. It is far too early to start guessing whether Mr Clinton will win again in 1996. Yet while Wednesday's inaugural speech may have sounded corny to British ears (it was corny), only crusty old cynics can fail to have envied the wide-eyed optimism in Washington. The new president may turn out to be a disaster, but he should at least be given his first 100 days of grace. Mr Major is another story. Memories of the mishaps of 1992 are still fresh. The conventional wisdom is that, one way or another, he will be tripped up before long. I think not. The prime minister has started the new year in combative form, as his performance in the House of Commons shows. He seems revitalised. This is not self-delusion. He faces no challenger today, and looks set to win in the future. He can hope for a modicum of ec-onomic recovery in spite of yesterday's increase in unemployment to nearly 3m. He can rely on the redrawing of constituency boundaries in the Conservatives' favour. He can reasonably calculate that Labour will fail to renew itself. Meanwhile, he can work hard in 1993 to regain the authority he lost in 1992. That is what he is doing. To understand his methods, we must look back. When he arrived in Number 10 Downing Street just over two years ago, Mr Major was young, well-liked, and good on television. He would have done well to celebrate by playing a saxophone and talking of change. Yet he could not then make Clintonesque speeches about a younger generation. He was disbarred by political necessity from invoking the spirit of renewal. He was obliged to speak of continuity, and publicly to honour his predecessor. His first task was to maintain the unity of the Conservative party. It remains his first task. The Tory schism over Europe, which destroyed his predecessor, has almost devoured him. On one crucial Maastricht vote, on November 4, his majority was reduced to three. He must maintain the delicate balance achieved on that terrible night until the bill is safely through. Then he may relax, but just for a moment. If he is prudent he will avoid talk of rejoining the exchange rate mechanism until after the next election, in spite of his preference for managed exchange rates. If he is lucky, the ERM will have im-ploded before he has to make a choice; if he is ill-starred, all circumstances save the condition of the Conservative party will be favourable to re-entry. Meanwhile the debate on the political structure of the new Europe could change in his favour. A review of the Maastricht treaty is due in 1996. In theory that could reopen Tory wounds. But Mr Major is taking out insurance this year. He is preparing papers that envisage a loose government-to-government structure and an open Europe, stretching from the Atlantic to the Russian border. When the 1996 inter-governmental conference comes along, and all the faces except Mr Major's are new, he can try to move the European Union further along that Thatcherite trail. Call it good tactics, or call it perfidious Albion. The result is the same. There is little that the prime minister can do to meet the criticism that he is not leading us anywhere. He inherited a 13-year-old administration. He did not create a new one from scratch. He did not have the luxury of a period of opposition in which to invent new slogans, new strategies, new constructions of the liberal market economy. Yet all is not lost. 'Placing Britain at the heart of Europe' has had less of a ring to it since Black Wednesday, but it may still be serviceable if the European debate moves along the lines suggested above. Anyhow, seen from Mr Major's point of view, his government is doing a lot. The health reforms are bedding down. Far-reaching education reforms are being put in place, albeit not smoothly. The structure of local government is being rationalised. (But the establishment of larger units does not strengthen local government if at the same time its finances are constrained and its powers over housing, education and possibly the police are removed.) Contracting out of white-collar civil service jobs is moving ahead. The prime minister will insist, until the cows come home, that the Citizen's Charter is improving publicly financed services. His latest initiative, which will be promoted as a 1990s 'bonfire of controls', is a welcome search for industrial regulations that can be scrapped. The budget will probably include supply-side initiatives that can be said to favour manufacturing. Mr Major has acknowledged that he has not found the words to depict this collection of programmes, most of which I applaud, as a grand campaign. I wonder if it would do any good if he did. Mr Clinton could announce without shame that 'Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people'. Are the British?</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An offer by IBM Corp. to pump millions of gallons of water with low levels of  industrial solvents to Santa Clara Valley households has been met with  skepticism by environmentalists and water district officials. IBM says the  treated water from its South San Jose property, now being dumped, contains low  levels of chemical solvents, but is well within the state limits for drinking  water supplies. Under the proposal, IBM would pump from 600 to 1,300 acre feet  a year into the Snell Pipeline, which carries water for the Santa Clara Valley  Water District. "I am not comfortable with the citizens of Santa Clara County  drinking that water," said Joe Judge, chairman of the district. But Steve Morse  of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board said, "As far as  we can see, there's little or no health risks."  </P></p>

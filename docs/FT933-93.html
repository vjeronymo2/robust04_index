			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Third-term earnings flat at Marriott MARRIOTT Corporation, the hotels and food services company, yesterday reported flat third-quarter earnings and said its board had voted to go ahead with its planned demerger on October 8. After a year of battling with angry bondholder groups, the company is splitting into two. Its main operating interests - lodging and food services operations, accounting for about 80 per cent of the unified company's revenues - will be known as Marriott International. Its property assets and its Host/Travel Plazas business, as well as the bulk of the group's debts, will be known as Host Marriott. Marriott International, the company whose shares will be distributed to Marriott Corporation shareholders in the form of a special dividend, will report its third-quarter results in mid-October. For the three months to September 10, Marriott had net income of Dollars 27m, or 21 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.03bn compared with net income of Dollars 26m, or 21 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.95bn a year earlier. Operating profit before corporate expenses and interest rose to Dollars 134m in the quarter from Dollars 124m a year earlier. Stripping out the impact of income tax adjustments and lodging dispositions in both years, Marriott said its operating profits rose 7 per in the latest quarter on a comparable basis, while net income was 20 per cent higher. On Wall Street, shares in Marriott closed Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 30 7/8 . Analysts had expected earnings of about 26 cents a share in the latest quarter. The company's lodging operations turned in an 11 per cent improvement in third-quarter operating profits including profits from the disposition of an equity interest in an international hotel. Sales were 3 per cent higher. The company said comparable unit sales and occupancy rose solidly in all four hotel brands. The Host/Travel Plazas division, which will be part of the Host Marriott company, reported higher sales in the quarter but operating profits declined.</p>

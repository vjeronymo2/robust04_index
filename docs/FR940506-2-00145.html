			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The General Partners of the Partnership will consider the desirability of the exchange from the point of view of the Partnership and must conclude that (a) the exchange is in the best interests of the Partnership and its partners and (b) upon the exchange, the interests of the partners of the Partnership will not be diluted as a result of the exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Fund's board of trustees will consider the desirability of the exchange from the point of view of the Fund and a majority of the trustees, including a majority of the non-interested members, must conclude that: (a) The exchange is desirable as a business matter from the point of view of the Fund; (b) the exchange is in the best interest of the Fund; (c) upon the exchange, the interests of existing shareholders of the Fund will not be diluted as a result of the exchange; and (d) the terms of the exchange as reflected in the Plan have been designed to meet the criteria contained in section 17(b) of the Act. The trustees will consider each aspect of the exchange, including: (i) The method of valuing the portfolio securities to be acquired from the Partnership, (ii) the value of the shares to be delivered to the Partnership, (iii) the procedure for selecting among the portfolio securities of the Partnership, (iv) the possibility of incurring excessive brokerage costs, (v) the allocation of the costs of the exchange, (vi) the possibility of adverse tax consequences to future shareholders of the Fund, (vii) the benefits from the exchange accruing to the Adviser, and (viii) the benefits from the exchange accruing to the General Partners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The exchange will not be effected unless: (a) The registration statements of the Fund have been declared effective, (b) the limited partners of the Partnership have approved the Plan and an amendment to the partnership agreement authorizing the General Partners to take such actions as they deem necessary or appropriate to effect the exchange, (c) the requested order has been granted, and (d) the limited partners have received an opinion of counsel that: (i) The distribution of shares from the Partnership to its limited partners, which will be in liquidation of the Partnership, will not cause taxable gain or loss to be recognized by the limited partners, (ii) the basis to the limited partners for the shares will be equal to the adjusted basis of the limited partners' interests in the Partnership, and (iii) the limited partners' holding periods with respect to the shares will include their holding periods for their Partnership interests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Partnership, the Fund, and the Adviser will each pay their respective costs in connection with the forming of the Fund and completing the exchange. No brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from selling to or purchasing from such investment company any security. The Fund and the Partnership may be affiliated persons of each other because they are under the common control of the Adviser and the General Partners. Thus, the proposed exchange may be prohibited by section 17(a). Section 17(b) authorizes the SEC to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company, and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 17(b). They contend that because the Fund and the Partnership have similar investment objectives and policies, the Fund will obtain portfolio securities that initially will be substantially identical to those held by the Partnership. The Fund will acquire the Partnership securities at their independent ``current market price.'' Applicants believe that this price will be as advantageous to the Fund as open-market purchases. In addition, by acquiring suitable securities from the Partnership, the Fund will avoid incurring brokerage and other transactions costs. Applicants believe that the exchange can be viewed as a change in the form in which the assets are held, rather than as a disposition giving rise to section 17(a) concerns. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

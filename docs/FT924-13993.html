			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Heavyweight borrowers concentrate on the D-Mark SOVEREIGN and supranational borrowers with growing funding needs to meet are focusing their attention on the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market, one of the few where large financings can still be completed. Sweden announced a DM2bn offering of five-year bonds, due to be priced today at an indicated yield spread of 45 to 50 basis points over the German BOBL (short-term government bond). The fixing of the price by consensus between underwriters is a new mechanism for the German market, and is designed to help improve the market's transparency. In addition, the European Investment Bank launched a DM1bn issue of 10-year bonds, and Compagnie Bancaire, the French financial group, launched a DM250m five-year deal via Commerzbank. The flow of issues in the D-Mark market is expected to continue through the coming weeks. A number of sovereign borrowers, including Norway, Finland, Italy and Spain are also considering tapping the market. In addition, the UK has been in discussions with German banks about a D-Mark financing, as part of its Ecu10bn international financing package announced last month. The flight of capital into the safe haven of the Bund market last month has benefited D-Mark Eurobonds, but the sector must now convince international institutional investors that it can offer adequate liquidity. 'This is just the beginning of the era of D-Mark Eurobonds,' said one German syndicate manager. 'The market will supersede the Ecu sector.' The capacity of the market could be tested by an onslaught of paper, but demand seems to be holding up so far. Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley, joint lead managers of Sweden's offering, reported strong demand from central banks, international institutions and domestic fund managers. The indicated spread over German government bonds reflects worries about Sweden's economic problems, according to bankers. In addition, the bonds offer a spread of about 15 basis points over Schuldscheine yields, which should help attract German investors. Sweden has an ambitious SKr110bn funding programme, although there is no set time limit for raising this amount. The Kingdom is already increasing the size of its US commercial paper programme from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 9bn and its Euro-commercial paper programme from Dollars 3bn to Dollars 6bn, according to Ms Christine Holm, a director of the Swedish debt office. In addition, Sweden's shelf registration for the issuance of bonds in the US market is expected to be increased from its current size of Dollars 1.2bn. However, today's offering is the first bond issue since the funding target was set. 'We will not be in the market every week, but our ambition is to return for further funding,' said Ms Holm. The pricing of the EIB's 10-year issue arranged by WestLB was more aggressive, having been based on competitive bids by banks. The bonds offered only a slight yield pick-up over the 10-year Bund yield. Even then, the deal illustrated the increase in funding costs for the EIB, since it lost its tax-exempt status in Italy last month. The cost of the deal, in floating-rate terms, was around 38 basis points below the London interbank offered rate, an increase of 50 basis points. Both the Sweden and the EIB deals are expected to become trading benchmarks in the sector. Elsewhere, the World Bank is preparing to launch its long-awaited Y200bn global bond offering later this week. The deal is arranged by Daiwa, Goldman Sachs and Nomura. In the domestic sterling market, the Housing Finance Corporation, which funds housing trusts, added a Pounds 80m tranche to its existing issue of 11 1/2 per cent bonds due 2016.</p>

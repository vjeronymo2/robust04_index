			<p>BFN     [Text] Asuncion, 15 Apr (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina met with government, legislative, and political  party representatives during a working visit here made at the  invitation of the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry.    The high-ranking Cuban official met first with acting  Foreign  Minister Oscar Cabello, to whom he explained the available  options regarding the island's economy.    The two also discussed the issues that will be addressed at  the extraordinary National Assembly meeting on 1 May, the  recently concluded debates by the Cuban workers on the economic  situation, and other matters in the country.    Robaina then met with members of the local legislature's  health committee, who expressed interest in the possibility of  securing products from the Cuban pharmaceutical industry since  the value of such products was determined during a recent visit  to Havana.    The visiting foreign minister then met with the following  political party leaders: Manuel Benitez, Radical Authentic  Party; Eugenio Sanabria, ruling National Republican  Association-Colorado Party; Guillermo Caballero, National  Encounter Party; and Senator Victor Sanchez, February  Revolutionary Party.    Robaina was also received by acting Senate President Carlos  Romero, who was accompanied by members of the legislature's  foreign relations committee.    Reporters and photographers from local media covered the  arrival of the chief of Cuban diplomacy in this capital, and  Robaina granted exclusive interviews to many of them.</p>

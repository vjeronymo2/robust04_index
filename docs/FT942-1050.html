			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK set to veto Dehaene as EC president: Summit deadlock over successor to Delors Mr John Major signalled early today he was ready to veto the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, in spite of a Franco-German bandwagon in favour of the Belgian premier. Leaders of the 12 European Union countries failed to reach agreement on the key Brussels job on the first day of their summit in Corfu, but will reconvene later today for further discussion. Senior British officials said there were 'no circumstances' in which Mr Major would accept Mr Dehaene. The officials said the Belgian premier did not command the necessary consensus within the EU. 'In our view he does not fit the bill,' one high-ranking official said. If the present Greek presidency of the EU continued to press Mr Dehaene's candidacy, Mr Major was ready to use his government's veto to block it, officials indicated. He would stick to this line if the issue was deferred to another summit next month. The British stand threw into confusion the whole question of who will take over from Mr Delors. After a day of behind-the-scenes argument, a clash at a summit dinner and a brief recall for emergency talks in the early hours of this morning, only Britain and the Netherlands were still holding out against Mr Dehaene. Spain and Italy initially joined the Netherlands in backing Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch premier, but later switched to Mr Dehaene. Mr Lubbers refused to withdraw from the race even though 10 member states were eventually supporting Mr Dehaene. Mr Major, under intense pressure from Tory Eurosceptics in the UK to veto the appointment of the avowed Belgian federalist, was isolated in promoting the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner. British officials said that if Sir Leon withdrew, Mr Major was ready to support Mr Lubbers. Mr Dehaene's candidacy was overshadowed by widespread irritation at the way Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany had sought to control the succession to Mr Delors and by the confused handling of debate by the Greek presidency of the EU. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, attacked the handling of the negotiations and, in a thinly veiled rebuke to Bonn and Paris, commented: 'There is a lot of poison around. The atmosphere is not good. The problem is not so much with the three candidates but with the way the whole issue has been handled.' German officials insisted that Mr Dehaene was the overwhelming favourite and that this left the UK and the Netherlands no option but to withdraw. Mr Kohl has threatened a second summit next month if the deadlock continues beyond the Corfu meeting, which is due to end this afternoon. But he predicted yesterday: 'We'll be able to settle this problem.' Other member states were more reserved, underlining that the candidate required unanimous backing and that front-runners in previous successions have been vetoed. Mr Delors himself owes his job to a veto by Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister, in 1984 against the then French foreign minister Mr Claude Cheysson.

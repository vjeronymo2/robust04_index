			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installments No 146-149 of the serialized memoirs of Xu </F> Jiatun: "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs"]  <H5>  [27 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] The Situation Was Unusual (Part One of Four)  -- Zhou Nan [0719 0589] Transferred She Mengxiao Back Through  Creating an Excuse, Thereby Removing the Obstacle To Persecuting  Me; A Friend Advised Me: "Be Careful Because Their Eyes Are  Watching You"    In April 1990, as I was attending a session of the National  People's Congress [NPC], the CPC Central Organization Department  asked She Mengxiao, deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, to come to Beijing to have a talk. He  was summoned to a meeting on the day of his arrival in Beijing,  and was criticized for not reporting Xu Jiatun's three  "unauthorized trips to Hong Kong" which he had known. It was  said that the criticism was based on Zhou Nan's report to  responsible persons at the center, and that Zhou Nan had learned  the three trips to Hong Kong only from Hong Kong's newspaper  reports and had been "greatly astonished."    She Mengxiao had been notified that he would be transferred  back to Beijing immediately and be assigned another job.    Actually She Mengxiao had told Zhou Nan about my three trips  to Hong Kong before there had been reports in publications. And  the Taiwan Affairs Office at the center had also sent a telegram  beforehand, which Zhou Nan had seen.    She Mengxiao's reaction was: "Incomprehensible,  unacceptable." Those who were talking to him were unable to do  anything about such a situation, and said that decision would be  made after reporting to the Standing Committee of the CPC  Central Committee.    The next day they talked to She Mengxiao again, saying: "The  responsible persons of the center have decided that the decision  on the transfer back to the hinterland be not changed." However  they changed their tone, saying: "A normal transfer. Not related  to Zhou Nan's report." She Mengxiao continued to argue that such  would be even more incomprehensible, and that if a normal  transfer was involved, then his term had not expired according  to regulations on personnel stationed abroad for he had been on  the job for only a little over a year. Those who were talking to  him then brandished the big "organization" flag, criticizing She  Mengxiao for having a bad attitude. Under the high pressure, She  Mengxiao could not but comply.    She Mengxiao had previously been deputy secretary general of  the Central Political-Legal Steering Group and the Central  Political-Legal Commission of which Qiao Shi had been head and  secretary respectively. Many of Qiao Shi's speeches had been  drafted by She Mengxiao, who had been a talented "scholar." He  was wrongly accused in such a manner just a little over a year  after he came to Hong Kong. This case caused widespread  indignation among some senior cadres in Beijing, who believed  that it was just intolerable that some people at the center had  gone so far in disregarding the party's spirit of seeking truth  from facts and organizational principles and in turning matters  of right and wrong upside down. Feeling that She Mengxiao had  been treated unfairly, some people went to see Qiao Shi. Qiao  Shi said that he sympathized with She Mengxiao but could get no  audience when arguing She's case in the Standing Committee, and  that there was no way of protecting She. I felt very sad upon  hearing the story.    Then Song Ping [1345 1627] "talked" to me. After a few words  of greeting at the beginning of the meeting, he officially  notified me: "The Standing Committee has decided that you come  back to live in Beijing." In this way it was finally made clear  that I was not permitted to stay in Shenzhen. I already knew  that Zhou Nan had asked a responsible person of the center not  to allow me to live in Shenzhen, arguing that his work would be  affected. Therefore I had already been psychologically prepared.  I said calmly: "I understand the Standing Committee's decision.  I don't want to come to Beijing. It is better to let me go back  to Nanjing." Song Ping first said that he personally agreed to  the suggestion, but that it was necessary to seek the Standing  Committee's approval. Then he indicated that he would  immediately tell Jiangsu to prepare housing for me, and he also  said: "The CPC provincial committee will welcome you back."    Then Song Ping changed the subject, and said, showing his  "concern" for me: "I would like to make some personal, critical  observations of you." It was normal for the head of the  Organization Department to show concern for cadres and to  criticize cadres. I nodded and listened attentively. Song Ping  said: "Some people have criticized that article on renewing our  understanding of capitalism. Might it not be advisable that you  reconsider the article?" He also asked: "Was it Ren Zhongyi  [0117 0112 1138] who put forward the idea of renewing our  understanding of socialism?" I was surprised to see that they  had been so annoyed by Ren Zhongyi also. I made no reply to the  question.    I expressed my appreciation of his good intention in warning  me, and replied: "Thank you for you concern. To this day I still  believe that while the language in a few places perhaps should  be reconsidered, the article as a whole is not wrong." I also  said: "I have already heard that a member of the Standing  Committee of the CPC Central Committee has specially assigned  people to write criticizing articles. I am already prepared to  be publicly criticized." Song Ping hurriedly explained: "Such is  not true."    In passing I also mentioned the case of Zhou Nan's  distorting  the facts to make false accusations against She Mengxiao and of  the Organization Department's transferring back She Mengxiao  anyway in a failure to uphold justice, and expressed my opinion,  indicating my resentment. Song Ping listened in a gracious  manner, and made no explanation at all. This talk made both of  us unhappy.    It was only later that I realized that Zhou Nan's  transferring back She Mengxiao through creating an excuse had  been for the purpose of removing an obstacle to "preparing"  material on me.    Some of my friends asked about the contents of my "talk"  with  Song Ping. After learning the contents, they earnestly warned:  "Be careful. Their eyes are watching you!"    Those several friends were rather informed of the "situation  at the top." I figured that if even a man who had already  decided to retire would not be tolerated, then I would not live  in Beijing after going back to Jiangsu but rather be a hermit in  my native place Rugao County, and that as I would not be  involved in any "worldly affairs," you must then be willing to  leave me alone. I still entertained this naive illusion. I  cancelled the plan to visit Jiuzaigou, Sichuan, after the NPC  session, and immediately went to Nanjing. After getting approval  from the CPC Jiangsu Provincial Committee, I immediately went  back to Shenzhen in order to get prepared to move back to my  native place.    After Zhou Nan took over in early February, one "strange  thing" after another happened. The more I thought about them,  the more they appeared to me to be related to "the eyes watching  you."  <H5>  [28 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Thee Situation Was Unusual (Part Two of Four)  -- Zhou Nan Submitted "Material" On Me, Resulting in My Fear of  Becoming a Second "Liang Xiang" [2733 3276].    In February Zhou Nan stopped paying my salaries and my  wife's  salaries in Hong Kong. My wife was very angry but I just  responded with a smile. According to normal practices, salaries  would be paid by the receiving unit only after the  organizational introduction letter reached the receiving unit. I  would not leave office until mid-February, and the CPC Hong Kong  and Macao Work Committee had not yet written my organizational  relation introduction letter to the receiving unit. And the  letter could not be written then because the center had not made  clear where I would live after being transferred back to the  hinterland. It was laughable that Zhou Nan was in such a hurry  to drive me out of Hong Kong.    Before Zhou Nan assumed his office, I had already moved out  of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency Building, and  my personal belongings had also been shipped to Beilingju (the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY'S base in Shenzhen), Shenzhen. Among the  belongings were dozens of cases of books, journals, and  documents (mainly copies of the texts of my speeches at some  meetings, of which the general office kept the originals or  transcripts on file). But, while I was attending meetings in  Beijing, Zhou Nan had the general office order my secretary "to  sort out" the documents, and had my documents taken away,  including the drafts of my statements made at the  "heart-to-heart talk" meetings in Beijing and the transcripts of  their statements at the meetings. The secretary resignedly told  me on the phone: that Zhou Nan had insisted that these had all  been "state secrets" documents and must be take away to be  "placed on file." As they were now in power and as I was then in  Beijing, I could not but tell the secretary to let them take the  documents. I intended to reason with them once I was back in  Shenzhen.    In early March many colleagues in the branch told me that  toward the end of February Zhou Nan had set up a task force  headed by Xu, director of the general office, "to prepare"  material on me. Zheng Hua was in overall charge of the task  force, which had already begun "investigations" into my  "personal, financial, and material" situation in Hong Kong. At  first I did not believe the rumor, but later, after many of  those investigated told me about the investigations directly or  indirectly, I realized that all this was true. According to the  rules made by the CPC Central Committee, "investigations" on the  number one men of the provincial and ministerial level could  proceed only with the approval given collectively by the  Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee or by the  general secretary. Obviously Zhou Nan had received from the top  leadership in Beijing instructions on or approval for taking  this unusual action shortly after taking office. Although I had  a clear conscience, I still sensed: that I probably would not be  allowed to have a "safe landing."    On 22 April I returned to Shenzhen. In the early hours of  the  next morning, the director of the Shenzhen Office of the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY came to Beilingju. With a look on his face saying  that he was powerless regarding the matter, he told me that the  general office had transmitted Zhou Nan's "instruction" to have  the car used by the "director" taken back to Hong Kong in the  afternoon. I said, giving a forced smile: "It is all right if  the car needs to be taken back." I gave a special dinner to say  farewell to the driver Master Xu, thanking him for his service  over the several years. I realized only afterwards that the car  had a license plate allowing it to go to Hong Kong and Macao and  come back freely. Zhou Nan was preventing me from passing Man  Kam To (the checkpoint for automobiles going between Hong Kong  and Shenzhen) so as to prevent me from going to Hong Kong  "privately" again.    On the 24th I was informed by a reliable source that Zhou  Nan  had written an official report on my "problems" based on the  "material" on me and submitted the report to the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. Zhou Nan's "decisiveness" and  "high efficiency" in accomplishing this task and the various  signs detected over the several months suddenly woke me up and  shattered the illusion about a "safe landing," waking me up from  my dream of living in my native place. Becoming a "second Liang  Xiang" or even meeting a worse fate than Liang Xiang was no  longer impossible, but would become the reality facing me! How  to handle the situation? I went into very complicated and  painful thinking.    In the name of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council, Li Peng used the excuse of studying the development of  Yangpu Port of Hainan to have Liang Xiang, governor of Hainan,  and Xu Shijie [6079 1102 2638], secretary of the CPC Hainan  Provincial Committee, fly to Beijing on a special plane.  Immediately after getting off the plane, Liang Xiang was put  under house arrest, thereby losing his freedom. It was only then  that Li Peng sent a task force headed by Supervision Minister  Wei Jianxing [1414 0256 5887] to conduct investigations in  Hainan Province. Three months later the results of the  investigations showed that Liang Xiang had not been the main  initiator and leader in the so-called "anticenter" incident in  which a telegram in the name of the CPC Hainan Provincial  Committee and the Provincial Government of Hainan had been sent  to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to show  support for Zhao Ziyang's policy on handling the student  movement, and that the accusations about Liang Xiang's "economic  problems" brought by some people to the center were also flimsy.  As he had been unable to find the "criminal evidence" needed by  Li Peng, this minister complained privately to some responsible  persons of Hainan Province, before returning to Beijing to  report on his work: "The result would not be acceptable to my  superior."    There was then a rumor in Beijing: that in view of Liang  Xiang's achievements in implementing the reform and opening  policy and developing the special economic zones, Deng Xiaoping  had instructed Jiang Zemin and Li Peng "to do everything  possible to spare" Liang Xiang. But in the end Jiang and Li  still relieved Liang Xiang from all his duties inside and  outside the party on the basis of the unwarranted charge of  "using office for personal gains." And they would not let the  matter drop, but continued to have a task force conduct  investigations in Hainan and Shenzhen. As those knowledgeable  people told me, in the "investigations" even the "chickens  produce eggs and eggs produce chickens" method for settling  accounts with landlords which had been considered wrong even  during the land reform was used in an attempt to uncover Liang  Xiang's so-called "problems" over the years. It was completely  an act of using office for personal gains to use such a method,  based on the total disregarding of facts as well as the party's  discipline and the state's laws, for treating a senior cadre of  the party and state who had joined the revolution for many years  and who had worked diligently and made achievements! It was  unfortunate that the erroneous practice of ruthless struggle and  mutual persecution in the party reemerged after the June 4th  Incident, making me feel greatly pained.

The Situation Was Unusual (Part Three of Four) </H5>   Xu Jiatun reveals how he left his country secretly: I  kept the secret from my wife. When passing the checkpoint at Lo  Wu Bridge in the course of leaving Shenzhen, I was recognized by  a guard. An old friend used his "sedan" to help me, picking me  up halfway so as to avoid my getting off at Kowloon.    It was only after thinking over the matter again and again  for a whole day on the 25th that I made up my mind: in order to  ensure my right to defend myself and to make it possible for me  to use my remaining energy in my later years to do some work for  society, I would "put up with light punishment but leave in the  face of severe punishment"; I would let everything I had now be  lost for the time being. I decided "to leave my country" and to  wait for the opportunity to return. I did not lose hope about my  country and nation, neither was I totally disappointed in the  Communist Party of China. I was just forced by the situation to  make this "bad move."    On the afternoon of the 25th I telephoned a friend whom I  had  known for many years and whom I could trust, asking him to come  to Shenzhen for farewell-saying purposes on the ground that, "I  would leave Shenzhen for Nanjing right away." On the 26th he  crossed Lo Wu Bridge and came to see me early in the morning. He  listened sympathetically to my decision, and expressed his  willingness to help me "leave my country." On the morning of  the same day he returned to Hong Kong and applied for a tourist  visa on my behalf to the U.S. Consulate-General in Hong Kong. I  requested that efforts be made to enable me to leave on the  28th. After applying to the U.S. Consulate-General, the friend  telephoned me, saying: "The thing cannot be bought on the 28th  and has to be bought on the 30th." I was worried that the delay  could result in my plan being detected by the Hong Kong Branch  of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, thereby making me unable to leave.    That old friend also telephoned Master Hsingyun of the  Hsilai  Monastery in Los Angeles for my sake (Hsingyun was then in  Hawaii), telling him that at his invitation Xu would come to the  United States shortly. Hsingyun readily expressed his warm  welcome and indicated that he would ask Lu K'eng to meet me at  the San Francisco airport. Hsingyun expressed his understanding  of my request that "there be no contacts with anybody" and that  "the stay be purely for the purpose of having a rest," replying:  "Mr. Xu will not be forced to do anything he does not want to  do." On the phone that old friend told me only: "The matters  involving friends have all been settled. The details will be  related on the 30th."    After Zhou Nan came to Hong Kong, my wife Gu Yiping  immediately left Hong Kong and lived in Shenzhen afterwards. She  had been busy packing for several days, and had decided to go to  Nanjing by train on the 30th together with the luggage. In order  to avoid any unforeseen problems caused by emotional factors and  to try to prevent her from being implicated later, I had kept  the "secret" from her throughout the process of making this  momentous decision. As my bodyguard had some personal matters to  deal with at home, I also took the opportunity to ask him to go  to Nanjing ahead of me.    Having made appropriate arrangements on everything, I  decided  to leave Shenzhen for Hong Kong on the 30th and "to leave my  country" for the United States on 1 May. My old friend had  already purchased the plane ticket to Los Angeles.    On the evening of the 29th I said "farewell" to my wife and  my daughters in Shenzhen. They did not detect in any way my  emotional agonizing at the imminent departure. I said to them:  "In the future you should live well by yourselves!" They still  failed to detect any implied message. I was sleepless for  another night.    At about 1900 on the afternoon of the 30th, my wife embarked  on her train journey to Nanjing as previously planned. I lied to  her, saying: that I would take a civil aviation plane to Nanjing  in two days. Recalling this episode would make me feel very  guilty!    Two hours later I left Shenzhen, crossed the border at Lo Wu  Bridge, and boarded the train from Lo Wu to Kowloon. In the past  I would always be accompanied by people when crossing the  border. As I would have to pass the Customs all by myself, I was  worried for a time that there would be suspicions. As expected I  was recognized by a border guard when passing the checkpoint. He  even said: "Director, are you going Home? You look even younger  than on television!" I nodded to greet him smilingly, and  successfully passed the checkpoint.    My old friend used his "sedan" to pick me up at Sheung Shui  (the first stop for the train from Lo Wu to Kowloon). For if I  should get off at Kowloon, I might be detected by people.  Therefore I specially asked my old friend to personally drive a  car to pick me up halfway. Some friends in Hong Kong also got  into trouble for being suspected by the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to have helped me leave my country. After  learning that I would publish my Hong Kong memoirs, that old  friend asked me many times about how my departure would be  written, requesting that I not mention his name. I replied that  I would never requite kindness with ingratitude, asking him to  set his mind at ease. Only when a "clean" political situation  should emerge in China would I reveal his name. My old friend  laughed heartily and said: "Very good. I hope you will then  connect my small name to your `leaving the country' so that I,  an ordinary person, may have a place in history." I also laughed  and replied: I will obey your command and this mystery will have  to be solved later. (The last segment will be seen tomorrow.)  (148)  <H5>  [30 Sep 93 p 1] </H5>   [Text] IV. The Situation Was Unusual (Part Four of  Four)    Xu Jiatun would not have been able to escape if his  move had been delayed for two hours! Correct judgment and  thrilling departure.    That night, at my old friend's home I wrote a letter to Deng  Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, and the CPC Central Committee. In the  letter I stated: This time I have been forced "to leave my  country" because of a storm in Beijing. But the stay will be  temporary and I will return. I will declare publicly that I am  "taking a rest by making a tourist trip."    Although I "left my country," I still believed in Marxism  and  in the Communist Party of China, and still respected Deng  Xiaoping. I just did not trust some members of the Standing  Committee of the CPC Central Committee. I related the incidents  in which Li Peng, Zhou Nan, and others had tried to conduct  "post-autumn-harvest account settling," saying that I had made  this painful choice because I would not want to be a "second  Liang Xiang." I also made four promises: no attempt to seek  political asylum; no disclosing of state secrets; no openly  published articles and no public speeches; and no contacts with  the democracy movement elements.    Finally I asked some members of the Standing Committee of  the  CPC Central Committee not to persecute my family so as not to  force me to make further choices that I did not want to make  after "leaving my country."    As I was unable to have the letter copied, I made three  handwritten copies. One was sent to the Hong Kong Branch of the  XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to be transferred to Beijing; one was sent to  the General Office of the CPC Central Committee in Beijing; and  one was sent to a friend who was in touch with a top leader in  Beijing and who was asked to deliver the letter to Beijing.    A few days after arriving in the United States, there was a  report from a source in Hong Kong: that after I had left  Shenzhen for Hong Kong, at around 2030 on the afternoon of 30  April Qin Wenjun, deputy secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal  Committee, had come, under instructions, to the place where I  had been staying in Shenzhen to relay the telegram order sent by  the CPC Central Committee which had asked me to go to Beijing  immediately. Qin had arrived at my place of lodging two hours  after my departure. Seeing that I had left, he had waited until  very late into the night and than begun making inquiry phone  calls to every place hurriedly. This episode had proved that my  earlier judgment had been correct.    At 9:25 [AM or PM not specified] U.S. western time on 1 May,  the plane arrived at the San Francisco airport on time. Lu K'eng  and Ts'ui Jung-chih were already waiting at the airport. Lu  K'eng then immediately flew with me to Los Angeles. In this way  I became Master Hsingyun's guest. Their warm and attentive  reception made me feel grateful.    After arriving in Los Angeles I immediately contacted Ma  Yuzhen, Chinese consul general in Los Angeles, and met with him  in the Hsilai Monastery soon afterward. I told him face to face  my reason for "leaving my country," and repeated the four  promises. Ma Yuzhen had already been instructed to persuade me  to return home, and promised that there would be no "trouble"  after my return to China. I thanked him for his good intention.  Not long afterward Zhu Qizhen, Chinese ambassador to the United  States, was also instructed to meet with me in Los Angeles. He  made further efforts to persuade me to return home, promising  that there would be no "trouble" after my return to China. Could  I believe the promise that there would be no trouble after my  return to China? In reply I told Zhu Qizhen that I would not be  going back for the time being but would keep the four promises,  asking him to tell Beijing to set its mind at ease. I also  indicated my attitude toward Beijing's "promise": "With Li Peng  in power, who can ensure that promises are kept? Even if Li  Peng would not make any trouble, who will be able to ensure the  keeping of the promises when some people should proceed to make  troubles?"    During this period, on three occasions I took the initiative  in having meetings with the consul general and the vice consul  general in Los Angeles. Zhu Qizhen had been instructed to meet  with me, and I did not take the initiative in this instance.    During Yang Shangkun's visit to four Central and South  American countries, Zhu Qizhen transmitted the messages  contained in the phone call made by Yang Shangkun from Mexico,  which expressed the hope that I would go back to China together  with Yang Shangkun on the same plane at the end of his trip.  There was also the promise that "I would be treated well." I  thanked him for his kindness, and indicated that I had no  confidence in the promise about the way I would be treated after  going back to China.    In late February 1991 I asked Consul General Ma Yuzhen for a  meeting (I already knew by then that Jiang Zemin and Li Peng  would take further "actions" on my leaving the country), and at  the meeting I asked Ma to transmit my message: "Whatever they  say and do, I have the right to publicly defend myself, and  history will reach a correct conclusion." Ma Yuzhen might not  have known then the situation, and asked me if I had heard  something. He said: "This may not necessarily be true."    As expected, making use of the power in their hands, Jiang  Zemin and Li Peng destroyed my way home. On 19 February the  Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Guangdong  Province dismissed me from my post as a deputy to the NPC; the  Xinhua News Agency's news on 2-3 March also contained the  announcements that I had been dismissed from my post as a member  of the NPC Standing Committee, that I had been expelled from the  Communist Party of China, and that I had been dismissed from my  post as a member of the CPC Central Advisory Commission. I had  already expected that this would happen, and was psychologically  prepared. Friends would say that I had been unfairly treated,  and suggested that they would raise the issue. After thinking  over the matter again and again, I decided to write, firstly, "A  Preliminary Analysis of Peaceful Evolution," and, then, my  memoirs.    History, I believe, will use facts to show that it is true  that some people have betrayed the people and Marxism, but that  I have not done so. Even if I will not be able to see the beauty  of China, the mother who has experienced all kinds of  tribulations--the motherland--will let the soul of a son who has  shared her worries and happiness return.

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Belgrade's hopes ride on report of UN monitors Belgrade is holding its breath as it awaits news of a delayed report by a United Nations team on whether Serbia's President Slobodan Milosovic has fulfilled his promise to close the border with the Bosnian Serbs to everything but food and humanitarian goods. If the report is positive, this will clear the final hurdle to suspending some of the 28-month-old international sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, the two remaining constituents of Yugoslavia. Belgrade's airport will be reopened to foreign flights, and sporting and cultural exchanges will once again be allowed. Expectations are running high and many Serbs hope a favourable report by the UN monitors will be the beginning of the end of their country's pariah status. Eighty-five UN monitors have been set the Herculean task of patrolling the 550km border for the past 10 days to see if military and other strategic supplies are still slipping through. Working in small groups, they move from one border crossing to another with an English translator to observe Serbian police and customs officials checking outgoing traffic. Over the weekend at the Zvornik border crossing on the main road from Belgrade to Pale, the Bosnian-Serb capital, two tight-lipped Finnish monitors watched a light stream of cars cross the Drina river to Bosnian Serb-held territory. Some 40km north, another group was monitoring the Sremska Raca crossing through which heavy vehicles carrying food and medicine waited to pass. Drivers' identities were checked and car boots and lorry trailers were briefly surveyed by the Serbs while the UN monitors looked on, occasionally taking notes. One Serbian lorry driver carrying potatoes and smuggled petrol for Serb-held Krajina admitted that 'the inspections are not as tight as they could be. But we get through nothing compared to before'. more than two months ago, some of these border posts were the main supply route to Bosnian-Serb fighters on the front line. Often the roads would be packed with everything from Yugoslav-made T-55 tanks to cars stuffed with light weapons and grenades. Mr Milosovic said he would stop this traffic in early August when Dr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, refused to follow him in accepting the peace plan devised by the so-called contact group of nations. Diplomats in Belgrade say they believe Mr Milosovic is committed to closing the border with his former proteges. 'He has been let down and embarrassed by Karadzic and must now concentrate on getting his own house in order. This means getting sanctions lifted,' says one. But a comment by Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, at the Nato summit in Seville over the weekend suggests the Americans, at least, are not convinced Mr Milosovic has closed the border completely. 'We have incomplete reports that indicate that (the blockade) has been partially, but not fully, complied with. (There is) certainly not a complete stoppage,' he said. Even the UN monitors on the ground admit that the difficulty in monitoring such a long border with so few men means that their report will be by no means definitive. A final decision on whether the sanctions will be suspended rests with Dr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, but he is unlikely to risk undermining Mr Milosovic's attempt to co-operate. The sanctions under review, however, will not drastically effect economic life in Serbia. Few Serbs can afford air tickets, and any international sporting and cultural links will only provide a much-needed psychological boost. As they wait for the report to be finalised and made public, they are surviving the blanket economic sanctions through massive smuggling operations. Most goods are easily available in Belgrade - at a price - and there are thousands of cars in the city running on smuggled petrol. Economists say that the smuggling is severely damaging the country's fragile economy and until sanctions are completely lifted, the threat of economic collapse is never far away.</p>

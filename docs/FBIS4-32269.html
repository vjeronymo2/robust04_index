			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 22 (CTK) -- Several dozen thousands of  Romanies who are living in the Czech Republic, but are not Czech  citizens will probably be viewed as foreigners as of July 1,  1994, the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY writes today.    It quotes Igor Nemec, the head of the Government Office and  chairman of the Council for Ethnic Minorities, as telling it  that under the Law on Czech Citizenship, the people who would  not apply for Czech citizenship by the end of June, will get the  statute of foreigners as of July 1, and will become subjects to  the alien regime.    In 1993, the Czech Government charged district authorities  to  appoint advisers to people wanting to acquire Czech citizenship.  For long months, the Romany press has been urging Romanies to  settle the question individually, Nemec said.    People can also ask for Czech citizenship after June 30, but  only as foreigners.    Foreigners have neither the right to social and health  security, nor the right to vote. They are not obliged to serve  in the Czech Army, and are allowed to run businesses only under  special terms, the paper writes.    Nemec told the daily that the Romanies had found themselves  in an absurd situation. In the past decades their problems were  settled by the paternalistic state and they became accustomed to  it. It is impossible for this trend to continue, Nemec stressed.    The daily also quotes Vaclav Trojan from the Romany section  within the Helsinki Civic Assembly as stating that many Romanies  will not be able to meet the conditions set by the law for  acquiring Czech citizenship, mainly that of a five-year clean  record.    LIDOVE NOVINY quotes the Czech Republic's Alien Police as  saying it would later specify the steps to be taken towards the  Romanies without Czech citizenship after June 30.    Some 200,000 Romanies are estimated to live in the Czech  Republic, but they are migrating between the country and  Slovakia, a habit surviving since the times of the Czechoslovak  Federation.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Protectionist countries have become pollution havens SCANT evidence exists that pollutive industries migrate to countries where environmental standards are lax, the study concludes. Closed, protectionist countries have become 'pollution havens', it says, contradicting environmentalist views that economic growth and free trade lead to environmental degradation. The report shows developing countries have seen rapid growth of pollutive industry, due to the stage of industrialisation these countries are going through, rather than to investment targeted to escape tough environmental rules. Pollutive industry, that spends heavily on controlling or treating resulting pollutants, is still concentrated in First World countries. Industrial countries account for three-quarters of trade in products of 'dirty industry', with the EC accounting for 40 per cent. While North America has in the past 25 years cut its share of environmentally dirty goods by a third from 20.5 to 14 per cent, rapidly industrialising countries of south-east Asia more than doubled their share from 3.4 to 8.4 per cent. Concentrations of dirty industry are greatest in eastern Europe, where they accounted for more than a quarter of exports. 'There is clear evidence of a relative decline in the importance of these products in industrial countries' exports, while increases are observed in eastern Europe, Latin America and West Asia.' The report traced no evidence of investment decisions influenced by variations in environmental standards. Research in Chile, which has no controls on industrial emissions and is open to trade and foreign investment, shows the opposite. 'Openness to foreign investment and absence of barriers to technology imports encourage multinationals to invest in Chile, and ensure domestic producers will have to compete with them. Openness in Chile is associated with, if not contributing to, the opposite of the pollution haven effect.' Companion studies of Latin American countries show more open economies end up with 'a cleaner set of industries'. 'Developing countries selling their environment cheaply have little to offer investors, against those offering a cheap, efficient labour force, to take one example'. By contrast, east European protected economies show 'the extravagant carelessness with which the environment has been treated there'. Less than 5 per cent of Poland's river water is drinkable, with 40 per cent so polluted that it cannot even be used in industry. Czechoslovakia, east Germany and Poland have nitrous oxide emissions twice those of France, Italy or west Germany, with sulphur dioxide emissions 10 times higher. 'Environmental degradation of eastern Europe is mainly explained by political suppression of consumer choice.' Four reasons are given why dirty industry migration is not a matter of environmental concern: Scant evidence exists of such migration; Costs of compliance with environmental regulations are low as a proportion of total costs, so do not influence location; Legal liability and reputation in a company's home market weaken the temptation to cut environmental costs in a world of rising environmental standards; Companies anticipate rising environmental standards in developing country markets by introducing state of the art technology in the first place. To test whether tariffs should be used to induce countries to raise environmental standards, the report examines US industry demands for a 'pollution tax' on Mexican exports subject to laxer environmental regulations. It finds total pollution abatement costs across US industry amount to 0.54 per cent of total costs. The cement industry carries highest costs, at 3 per cent. The report concludes: 'It is not obvious that the threat or imposition of trade restrictions will have a positive effect on environmental quality.' The US policy would be flawed because it would be 'driven by considerations of competitiveness, not environmental quality'. That would amount to 'bad environmental policy and bad trade policy'.</p>

"The  Hebron massacre forces us to accelerate this process," Beilin  declared to the press after his meeting with Secretary of State  Jakob Kellenberger. The latter assured him of support from  Switzerland, which will open an office in Jericho soon to assist  in West Bank reconstruction.    Mr. Beilin also met with Flavio Cotti, head of the Federal  Department of Foreign Affairs, for 45 minutes. In the  afternoon, he was scheduled to meet with the presidents of the  Foreign Affairs Committees of both Chambers.    The deputy minister reconfirmed Israel's commitment to  peace,  six days after the slaughter in Hebron in which 52 Palestinians  were killed by a Jewish settler. In the near future, the  release of 900 Palestinian prisoners and the disarmament of  Jewish extremist settlers should help calm the situation.    In the long term, the establishment of a Palestinian police  force in the territories will enable the reinforcement of peace  and security, the Israeli deputy minister stated.  <H5>  The Settlers Will Stay </H5>   Mr. Beilin, however, declared himself opposed to the  withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Occupied Territories. He  also said that he considered Switzerland a "model" state,  particularly for its military organization and its experience in  the field of humanitarian commitment. Inspired by Switzerland,  Israel plans to open a hospital in Angola.    For his part, Jakob Kellenberger assured Beilin that  Switzerland would support Israel's efforts toward peace and  economic development in the West Bank. Both men discussed the  allocation of 60 million Swiss francs, promised to Israel last  year, for reconstruction in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank.  <H5>  Office in Jericho </H5>   Moreover, Mr. Kellenberger and his guest agreed to open a  Swiss office in Jericho in the near future which will coordinate  efforts to develop the region economically.    Mr. Beilin and Mr. Kellenberger also "reached an agreement"  concerning Israel's request to access records on Jewish refugees  who were expelled from Switzerland during World War II. An  agreement also was reached on opening an information office in  Israel on the European Eureka research project.    In conclusion, Mr. Kellenberger said that many questions  pending since his visit to Israel last May were settled. The  secretary of state will travel to Syria and Egypt next May.</p>

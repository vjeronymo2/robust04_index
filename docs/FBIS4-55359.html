			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 13 (BTA) -- Today Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov filed with the Secretarial Department of the National  Assembly the cabinet's programme of intent concerning the  structural and personnel cabinet changes. The MP's may be  expected to discuss the programme next week.    Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov is very likely to take  office as one of the deputy prime ministers, Prof. Berov told  reporters in parliament. He denied that the post of deputy  prime minister had been ever offered to Prof. Todor Vulchev,  governor of the Bulgarian National Bank. The negotiations are  still going on, the prime minister said, adding there would be  no meetings with representatives of the parliamentary groups  today.    This week Prime Minister Berov held consultations with the  parliamentary groups of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS), whose mandate he used to form a cabinet at  the end of 1992, and with the parliamentary Bulgarian Socialist  Party (BSP), which supports the government. The DPS had  parallel talks with the New Union for Democracy (NSD), a  parliamentary group set up by expelees and breakaways from the  Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), and with the Civil Alliance  for the Republic, which unites the MP's who split from the BSP  parliamentary group.    After his yesterday's [12 May] meeting with Prof. Berov, BSP  leader Zhan Videnov said that the new project for cabinet  changes was better than the first one. Yesterday DPS leader  Ahmed Dogan said he had stressed at a meeting with Prime  Minister Berov that the DPS wanted the formula of expert  government be reckoned with when carrying out the cabinet  changes. On Wednesday [11 May] the parliamentary SDS moved for  a vote of no confidence in the government. At an extraordinary  meeting today, the NSD MP's considered the prime minister's  programme for changes and revised their initial position on not  taking part in any negotiations on the cabinet's overhaul. The  NSD revising its position made NSD co-chairperson Stefan  Bozhilov resign as a leader of that parliamentary group.</p>

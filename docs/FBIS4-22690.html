			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Zorkin by Aleksandr Prokhanov; place </F> and date not given: "Instead of Depression--Will to Action"]    [Text] [Prokhanov] Russia has had so many troubles since we  saw each other last summer, so much blood and tears have been  shed. Even now there is one alarm signal after another. Entire  regions are dying out, every hour thousands of motors are  grinding to a halt. The fields have not been planted, the  children in certain settlements are eating manufactured  concentrated animal feed. How are we to cope with this  catastrophe? And in August 1993 again there were rumors of a  state of emergency, more use of violence against the people,  opposition....    At this crisis moment we signed the declaration "Accord in  the Name of Russia"--a kind of broad coalition that unites  people with various ideological views and values. You, Valeriy  Dmitriyevich, were at the source of the idea, the main initiator  of this movement. I signed the document but I still have secret  doubts--is it possible to have "Accord in the Name of Russia"  under conditions where we, judging from everything, are  "rushing" to the peak of a systemic crisis?    [Zorkin] You are right: The crisis is accelerating and at  extremely rapid rates. During January and February of this year  the decline of industrial production considerably exceeded last  year's indicators. Economic, social, and regional antagonisms in  the country are being aggravated. One can already say quite  definitely that the current higher-ups of the regime do not know  exactly what to do. The state power is becoming increasingly  ineffective. Therefore certain little groups in the upper  echelons are again trying to place their bets on power methods.  But that will help the regime now in the same way that it did in  October.    In this situation it is no wonder that the declaration  "Accord in Name of Russia" was proclaimed. I would even say that  it is not only a movement of left-wing forces but a movement of  all people of sound mind in our country.    After all, all sober-minded people, regardless of their  political differences, understand that there is trouble in the  country, and in order to overcome it we need some form of social  consolidation. The alternative--civil war--will be suicide. We  are suggesting that we conclude a social contract of all those  forces for whom the Motherland is an enduring value. We must  recognize that perhaps the most dangerous threat of the 20th  century has been hanging over our Motherland. In the face of a  threatening catastrophe, political antagonisms and differences  must recede into the background. At least for a certain amount  of time. In our declaration we have formulated the most  important and common goals that both the liberal and the  communist, the entrepreneur and the worker really do have in  common.    [Prokhanov] Last autumn showed that good intentions can be  counteracted by obtuse rigidity and gross military force. And  all the perpetrators of the violence in October understood quite  well that force in and of itself cannot resolve any  contradiction in society, and this was clearly demonstrated  after the October events. The crisis was exacerbated.    And again scenarios involving all-out violence are being  worked out in the narrow interests of the present regime, whose  social base in becoming ever narrower. What prompts your  intuition? Is it possible to have a repetition of bloody October  of 1993?    [Zorkin] I would say that the October events were the  culmination of a clash of two tendencies. One of them was  capable of bringing Russia to peace under the condition that we  took advantage of the small chance of proceeding step by step to  build a foundation that would provide for the rule of justice  and law. Nobody can transgress this law. Any violator--from the  rank-and-file citizen to the president--would be specifically  liable for this.    Another tendency was working against this chance and,  although it officially declared the priority of democratic  values, it was aimed at establishing absolute rule, a  totalitarian regime. They were preparing a scenario that has  been played out in Russia's past--both during the past 70 years  and even before that, when no law, no rights, and no justice  were taken into account. And arbitrary behavior occupied first  place in all of this baseness.    These two tendencies were stirred up in October, but it is  now clear that they lay considerably deeper and had been  manifested repeatedly in the past. Each was defended by people  who had their own goals.    Did the people share these so-called "consumer" goals? Great  doubts arise here. After all, there is no need to rely on  violence if the citizens agree with the ruler.    The people live in peace with their ruler and the ruler with  his people when they have a consensus, agreement, a basis of  legitimacy. This has been the case in various periods of  Russia's history. Even in that peak situation when Minin and  Pozharskiy liberated Moscow, national accord was established.  And when the great Aleksandr II, the Liberator, began the  peasant reforms. He had prepared a platform. Yes, there were  those who resisted, there were backlashes, but there were no  pogroms or big fires or uprisings or civil wars. And Russia  began a great reform. "Accord in the Name of Russia" is the  effort of patriots to overcome the catastrophic course of  development.    [Prokhanov] Yes, they were quite special impressions--during  those days beginning on 21 September...the candle ends on the  deputies' desks, the barbed wire, the barricades made of pipes,  the smell of the fabric of soldier's uniforms. The machine gun  fire and the explosion. What struck you most at that time?    [Zorkin] People were unable to believe that such a thing  could happen. When they started talking in front of this  terrible barbed wire, when they began to absorb the information  that the president had resorted to the extreme scenario, the  members of parliament still could not believe it! Khasbulatov  could not believe it. I met with him and I can assure you of  this. The people refused to believe it because all of this was  beyond the limit. It is one thing to make a political mistake,  to show a lack of professionalism, but here everything was  accompanied by such terrible cruelty, immorality, corruption....    This was indeed the apogee of the politics of evil. And,  moreover, I was shaken by the easy justification of the  potentates who committed the gangsterism. Because the people  invested them with this very power, the defenseless people  trusted them with their souls. And all this was trampled upon....    Before my eyes passed all these gentlemen in a row, court  politicians asserting that there simply was no other way in  Russia, the president, speaking against the Constitution, was  purportedly defending justice...all this left a memorable  impression: On the one hand, a lack of acceptance of all this  cynicism and immorality, and on the other--dumb amazement: Why  is this so, what for?    The question arises: How can we motivate those who do not  even know the concept of repentance to return to the law and  legal behavior?    I do not think that today we are faced with the dilemma of  "adventurism-democracy" at all. That was the way things stood  before the October events, when political scientists close to  the president told him: "You must switch to authoritarianism as  quickly as possible." Now because of the efforts of these  "founders" and even practical workers who have armed themselves  with these theories, we have ended up in a situation that is  considerably worse, from which it will take a very long time to  extricate ourselves.    [Prokhanov] After our first meeting I asked myself what kind  of political thinking I had encountered in you. I told myself  that you were apparently a type of liberal statesman who is  absolutely rare in Russian political practice.    What happened in October was, in my view, a surfacing of  ancient, morbid political forces linked to the idea of  totalitarianism. They pushed through again as water does through  delicate crystals of ice, through that brief, apparently unique,  liberal period that began with Gorbachev and lasted through  these two "Yeltsin" years, the period that you frequently embody  with your way of thinking and ideology.    History, after all, passes through individuals and actions.  And the drama of what happened is not just a drama of the  destroyed liberal period; it lies elsewhere as well. The Russian  national tradition was initially oriented toward the Orthodox  monarchic ideal, a kind of authoritarianism ordained by God.  This situation was destroyed by the Bolshevist revolution.  Another situation appeared--a different authoritarianism that  was linked to the idea of the leader, the elimination of all  that was mystical and hence justifiably eternal.    The liberal approach in which we have all ended up has  destroyed the red-Bolshevist dominant and crushed all the  principles by which our nation lived. Now Yeltsin has also  destroyed the liberal plan. Throughout this century enormous  violence has constantly been committed against the national  consciousness. The national archetypes have been turned into  trash, to dust. Today the public consciousness, in my opinion,  is not capable of any kind of construction. It is impossible to  build anything on trash, on powder, on dust. And the drama that  occurred, in addition to all the legal, social, moral, and  ethical aspects, has this one as well.    [Zorkin] You have touched upon a very important question  having to do with the character of power. It seems to me that  above all it should be fair and based on that which from ancient  times has inhered in Russia, which is called upon to unite  freedom and legality. The citizens must finally feel that they  are free people, not slaves to a despot, general secretary, or  another Boris. But this can be achieved when the primacy of the  Constitution is established, when the demandingness of authority  is combined with restrictions which are placed on it by the law,  that is, the principles of a rule-of-law state are included in  the system of social values and we accept them.    First of all let us agree: Do we need order? Or would we  live  under conditions of arbitrariness, lawlessness, mafia rule, and  corruption?... Yet order cannot be effective unless it is  accompanied by development and progress. Order and  development--join these two words together. But this, in turn,  is possible only with the achievement of stability. Any reforms  will simply collapse under the conditions of the present chaos  and arbitrariness. What kind of entrepreneur is prepared to  anticipate or guarantee anything today if he does not know what  could happen in the country in a couple of months? That same  entrepreneur of ours, as sociologists from legal protection  institutions assert, will "fork over" to bureaucrats  approximately four times more than the mafia structures will.  All this is a cancer that is afflicting society. But why is it  growing? Because we have neither order nor stability.    And with all the loud declarations of our intention to fight  crime, with all the bloody shooting up of parliament, also under  the guise of striving for order, we are actually being thrust  into anarchy and chaos. And the authorities are undermining  themselves because stability in society can be provided only by  relying on law and legality. And authorities who resort to  unconstitutional measures for the sake of immediate political  advantage will become ineffective in the future. Can they really  introduce order into the country if they themselves are  professing the principle of grabbing as much as they can and  taking advantage of force and lawlessness? Such authority dooms  itself to inevitable failure, and society--to chaos.    Let us begin with the extremely important question of  relations between the center and the regions. We live in a  federative state--we must take this into account! After all,  since ancient times the monarch has taken action when the  territories resisted. But here, conversely, the territories said  on 18 September: We are in favor of order, in favor of  stability, Boris Nikolayevich. And on 21 September he began  these misdeeds and then brushed aside the Soviet of the  Federation, which for a month before that had been set against  the Supreme Soviet.    What is this? Friends, do I like it when everyone around me  is trembling and at each other's throats? That is what happened.  There was squabbling everywhere: the regions with the parliament  and with one another, and the executive chief with the chiefs of  the legislative power. Will this not actually lead us away from  order and stability?    Essentially we have had no transformations. Public wealth is  being plundered under their guise. And instead of systematizing  and applying everything positive in the world for changing from  a centralized system to new principles and giving people  incentive to work, everything is being done to extinguish these  incentives.    First we devalued the investments, thus eliminating  potential  small and medium-sized property owners who, on the basis of  cooperation, could have bought bakeries, small productions,  shops, etc., and could have created labor joint-stock companies.    Then they began to "give away" all the enterprises according  to the mafia-bureaucrat principle. For instance, in Omsk or some  other city immense plants are being sold to people at a symbolic  residual cost. The next day the new owners issue stocks and the  prices of them are immediately raised to the real market prices.  A gang of people get fat at state expense this way. And this is  called transformation? Why did they not take advantage of the  experience of Spain or America or even our home-grown communal  principles?    If the labor collective itself owns the enterprise and if  the  worker is no longer hired but is part owner, he will work quite  differently. It has turned out this way for us: People's  psychology regarding work has not changed--we have the same  nihilism, the same alienation, although we have a different  owner; the private property owner has taken the place of the  state.    For me the main thing is this: Regardless of what method of  privatization may be applied, it is necessary for the people to  become the owners. Otherwise after a certain amount of time we  will inevitably arrive at a point where things are divided up  once again.    In order for the people to enter this new economy, the  underprivileged strata must definitely have insurance. Here  again it is impossible to avoid assigning the state an immense  social-regulatory role. But our levers and incentives are first  weakened and then restored again in a new mafia-criminal  form--they intervene, they redistribute, and they direct....    We must get away from the past, but not to a new disgrace  but  to a normal, healthy, regulated economy that benefits the  workers. I think the owners of capital are interested in this as  well. They do not want to be protected by barbed wire or  defended with automatic weapons from the furious crowd.    But what has the government done? Instead of taking this  reasonable path, it has used force to impose its own version of  shock therapy, and now they are saying that it is not over yet.  No, it was not carried out fully, but its elements were launched  in the most primitive and egregiously criminal form. As a  result, we ended up with a gang of rich people, and instead of a  middle class the foundations for democracy and rule of law are  made up of an impoverished crowd. The people have simply been  deceived!    The main point of the transformations is justice. If certain  people take but they do not give to others and those that have  even take away more--this is highway robbery. Justice and truth  are not simply words, they are not simply our age-old Russian  values. They contain something like what issues from universal  reason. Because if values are rejected and society is divided  into thieves and those who are robbed, it will ultimately fall  apart.    I think that this is the main lesson we must draw from the  October tragedy. And if the ship of immense Russia is to be led  further along the path of this narrow-minded, egoistic  understanding of privatization or if it follows instructions  from the West, we will end up with a country of beggars, a  desert country. It will become a foreign colony, a region for  labor therapy.    [Prokhanov] We have just experienced the most severe  structural crisis in which the political machine in the form of  the Supreme Soviet was broken. Speaking metaphorically,  destructive energies were introduced into it and it exploded  from within. Some different kind of mechanism is being created  now. What is this, this new Constitution?    [Zorkin] The process is contradictory. In order to  understand  we must turn to the past, to what we have lost. We had the  rudiments of real transformations and there was the sense that  step by step we could arrive at democratic transformations, at  an adjusted course in the economy.    But when the people in power got a sense of this, what did  they start saying? That the Constitution was Brezhnevian and all  our institutions were obsolete. This was out-and-out deception.  The Constitution was changed radically in April 1992 and all the  institutions were adapted to the new conditions. But the  tendencies that were developing did not favor the absolutism of  the executive power.    The social problems have been aggravated. Mafia and criminal  elements have developed to such a point that they have actually  buried the hope of any law and order under the people who are  now in power. There has been further degradation of the culture  and the moral condition of society.    There has arisen the question of how we can escape from this  systemic crisis. It was possible on the basis of consensus and  accord, not some spineless compromise but a real one accepted by  society in order to escape from a condition verging on civil  war. Instead of this, they began to use force to impose their  own position, which actually led to the collapse of the  state--economic ties were broken and disintegration gripped not  only the nearby foreign countries but also the Russian regions.  Transformed into a minority and defending previous catchwords,  they were simply forced to destroy even the fragile chances of  democracy and to switch openly to totalitarianism.    But what next? To say that there will be another upheaval  like the one in October--these are all conventionalities. But  still we can escape this possible bloody future if society  recognizes that the authorities have deceived and betrayed the  people and that it is necessary to consolidate in order to  emerge from the crisis peacefully. But look at what is  happening. Today the ruling regime is again dressing itself up  in foreign clothing and raising a foreign flag. During 1990-1992  they dressed themselves up as democrats even though they had  nothing in common with them. Now they are dressing in the  clothing of patriots, centrists, and statesmen, that is, they  have seized upon ideas that quite recently they called fascist.  When they understood from the results of the election that the  people were in favor of these ideas in a healthy, reasonable  version, they immediately decided to change colors. But what  about their insides? In general do they understand the essence  of what is involved with the Motherland and patriotism?    In October our society experienced a shock, there was a  rebellion. As long as the people's soul is alive, it will never  put up with the situation, it will gather its forces and  consolidate. And if the regime does not degenerate, it will  prepare for this national action. These signs are in evidence:  They are apparent above all in the reorganizations in the power  structures making them directly subordinate to the president.    Of course, the crisis will also develop further. And the  task  is for all positive forces that do not want the destruction of  the society to consolidate. Which forces? All those that are in  favor of preserving the Motherland--that immense state, not some  monster, but a state as a living organism. I think that these  positive forces will include not only the dissatisfied masses  but, for instance, entrepreneurs as well. For the present  entrepreneurship under conditions of a thoroughly corrupt mafia  regime is simply impossible. Only criminal economic activity can  succeed.    All this is objectively leading to a situation where unless  consolidating forces arise, this regime will fall. But the  problem is to make sure that all this occurs in a more or less  civilized framework. All this must not be overcome by crude  force or universal war. The task is to restore constitutional  order and stability and to make real transformations with the  least possible losses. If these positive forces are  consolidated, we will be able to hope for a successful solution  to the crisis. But we must not forget that during 3-4 October  with the firing of weapons against parliament a crude force was  placed on the political scene, the road was opened up to it. And  if we do not conduct a maneuver, if we do not restore the  constitutional system, I do not think we can rule out the  possibility of military coups.    [Prokhanov] This idea of consolidation is at large in  society. And the question of how to unite power with justice,  law, and the Constitution, of course, is one of the most crucial  ones today. If it were possible to have a broad coalition of all  who are in favor of such immediate strategic goals as  restoration of constitutional order and transformations on the  basis of stability and justice, I think it would be possible to  escape all this hell.    [Zorkin] Such a coalition cannot exist today unless it  becomes a coalition of all the people, a kind of popular  agreement. There can be various paths to it, but it absolutely  must be based on all the strata, classes, and  structures--entrepreneurs and workers and cultural figures and  the church etc.    We are speaking not simply about economic reform but about  rescuing civilization in that space that is called Russia.  Therefore this must be not a party but a kind of popular  congress based on general agreement, above all spiritual.  Unification into a coalition has a specific purpose--to change  the regime. Then, after that purpose is accomplished, secondary  interests will appear, various ones, and pluralism will arise.  Society must have various interests, they must compete, and  there must be a certain amount of struggle, for otherwise there  will be stagnation and a swamp. But it must be carried out  according to certain rules.    A two-party system corresponds to the natural physical  bipolar model, to symmetry, and the Americans, for example, have  simply intuitively adapted it to political life. Or we can make  sure that those who oppose this coalition are transformed into a  civilized opposition.    Yeltsin's problem is that he is striving for autocracy and  he  should have provided for an effective two-power system. For is  it not understandable that from the very beginning it was  necessary to support the construction of a strong presidency and  a strong parliament? This was the guarantee of preservation not  only of the Russian political organism but also the presidency  as an institution. The gunfire directed at parliament certainly  did not make the president strong. On the contrary, he became  extremely vulnerable. Tomorrow force could be used to eliminate  not only the president but also the institution itself. And the  where will they look for a legal mechanism to protect them?...    What will the general agreement consist of? Unless we are  aware that, for example, miners cannot receive normal wages  while the entire organism is sick, nothing that makes sense will  obtain. The upper echelons are manipulating: Today they give  something to the miners, tomorrow--to the teachers, next--to the  newspaper workers. But we need an entirely different system of  coordinates: A society in which miners and engineers and  entrepreneurs and teachers will all live well.    We must also recognize that Russia is a unified living  organism. If the regions are concerned only about seizing as  much sovereignty as possible or finding a special entry into the  halls of centralized power and gaining credit--this is fatal  too. This can work from time to time, but then it will fail  nonetheless. We need a new federalism.    In a word, a renewed Russia--this is what the coalition must  rally around, what we have been discussing, what we have called  "Accord in the Name of Russia."    [Prokhanov] You speak about the possibility of moral and  political resistance. But for now everything is in the hands of  the present power: means of suppression, intelligence,  finances....    At the same time during the past five years of confrontation  society has been restructured--at the psychological, social, the  most fundamental level. And to come together and smoke the peace  pipe once again will require colossal efforts--moral,  philosophical, perhaps efforts of some group of irreproachable,  respected people in society who could unite the un-unitable. How  are we to overcome this social dissension?    [Zorkin] Yes, it is difficult to do, but what are we talking  about? We are giving a diagnosis: If we cross over this last  threshold we will die. We must arouse in ourselves an ability to  understand the rational, if you will, an instinct for  self-preservation. For example, I have no problem engaging in  dialogue even with people I do not like, who have ended up in  the other camp. If we agree not to allow the collapse, the death  of Russia, we must pass over emotions, antipathies, and mistrust  for the sake of general survival. I hope that the majority of  people are prepared for this.    Of course the coalition must not be merely an abstraction:  People say, let us create a program and we do not need power. I  think we have already passed this stage. It must be prepared to  take responsibility on itself: to adjust the course, to earmark  a strict transition period, both in the sense of demandingness  and in the sense of clearly worked-out stages and deadlines. If  we come to power as Gaydar did--transformations are needed; let  us give freedom to the market--the same thing will happen, that  is, nothing specific and tested, and it is better not to take up  the cause at all.    I think the people must respond to conviction,  professionalism, honesty, and devotion to justice. Because if  this coalition of intellectuals, pragmatists, and practical  workers intends to change our present course and do it without  truth--that is all, they are defeated. The truth is needed so  that people will believe. And this is precisely where we must  begin.    Here is a team that is suggesting to all of us citizens of  Russia that we take our destiny into our hands. That we not  place our hopes in mythical help from abroad, in another  leader-savior, in the idea that suddenly everything will work  out of its own accord, but try ourselves to drag the country out  of this quagmire. We are uniting so that the force that  strengthened the present power during 3-4 October will not be  used for general destruction but will be used for something  else. Against what will the first drive of our struggle be  directed? Against everything criminal in society. Unless we do  this, no transformations will help, because criminals in power,  in the economy or in any other sphere, will always act in a  criminal way.    The question arises: How can we overcome everything that is  criminal that has become so terribly overgrown in our society?  We need a very strong, I would say, strict power that is based  on the law. But the law in this case must be an absolute  expression of the principle of justice, that is, it must stand  on the side of the people, statehood, and Russia.    Power and the law can be used for good only if they are not  used to satisfy personal ambitions to provide personal  well-being. As soon as the struggle begins, the devilish  elements will be on the watch. When I say that we need truth,  this means not only to pronounce it. After all, we have seen how  those who gave the commands on 3-4 October suddenly started  talking about saving the people, about patriotism, and even  about accord.    [Prokhanov] I recall a theory developed by one noble  professor, an old man who had been wounded in battle. He divides  human types into two categories: rulers and harmonizers. They  are distributed in all spheres of life.    The ruler is the person who wields power in the state, the  family, the design bureau, or production in order to savor it,  to experience it, to enjoy it, to use it for his own good. The  result is almost always the same--destruction and  impoverishment. He exploits the environment and leads it to  disaster, conflicts, wars, repressions, and ultimately  degradation.    But the harmonizer is a special person of a religious  disposition. When he ends up on the throne or at the head of a  family or in a garrison or the environment is entrusted to him,  he enriches it, brings it to prosperity, even in war he  preserves and minimizes losses. By nature this is the pastor,  the tiller of the fields. This is Marcus Aurelius, this is Tsar  Aleksey Mikhaylovich...these two types have figured very  frequently in Russian history and they are noted in religious  and philosophical thought.    But now that we have experienced this period of obvious  rulers for whom power is a goal in itself and its achievement  can threaten the nation and the state with collapse,  self-destruction, apparently the time has come for the other  type of leaders. God forbid that this regime be replaced by  another one headed by a general with a thick skull and the  enormous fists of a paratrooper. In fact Russia is waiting for a  harmonizer. And this does not mean that in the period of  restoration, which will be severe and demand sacrifices, that  this new leader will be soft, vapid, and blissful. No, he will  be very firm, but he must embody that super-task of the  harmonizer, the savior, the healer.    How do you envision the typological features of the future  leader? What qualities must he have?    [Zorkin] It seems to me that he must combine several  extremely important qualities. First, I agree with you, he must  not come to power for its own sake. They say that such negative  qualities can be registered on modern lie detectors. But I think  the Russian political elite, when it was viable and led the  country to greater heights, conducted that kind of testing of  leaders.    Just take the election of Mikhail Romanov. There is the  opinion that he was a weak ruler. But in that stage, when Russia  was fragmented, dispersed, when every local ruler was laying  claim to higher power, who was needed? A unifier. He could not  lay claim to very much, but had to listen to opinions, be able  to get everyone to sit down at a roundtable, as we say today,  and say: Let us decide--either we die or this is the first rule  of behavior, this is the second, this is the third....    Figuratively speaking, it goes like this: Since we are all  in  the same boat, let us agree to row in the same direction, nobody  has the right to stand up, to go wherever he wants to, or hit  his partner on the head with the chess board because he has put  him in checkmate. The modern leader must have a sense of what  unites people, he must comprehend the ultimate task of the time.    His second quality is the will and resolve to carry out this  task. For instance, Andropov. He by nature seemed to be soft, in  general he reminded one of a professor: He had such a calm look  in his eye. That is the impression I got of him. And it seems to  me that when he was in power decisions were made in this same  intelligent manner. But he had an immense will.    Third--a leader must be in tune with the people. People must  understand that this person has taken on the burden of power not  out of selfish motivations: He lives and makes decisions in the  name of some higher goals.    Why did Yeltsin come to power? He was perceived as one of  our  own. Why was he not perceived like Ryzhkov? I communicate with  him--I assure you that he is an excellent person. But people did  not know him well and after he raised the price of bread--quite  insignificantly by today's standards--his enemies skillfully  took advantage of this and turned him into an alien who wanted  to multiply the people's unhappiness. And then there appeared a  person who said: "People, I know your needs. I know that you are  not driving Mercedes but Moskviches--I entered the Kremlin in a  Moskvich. The majority of you ride buses, and I also ride with  you. I know that you want peace, confidence in the future, and  no waiting lines."    The next extremely important quality is uniqueness. A leader  without an idea is nothing. Therefore any elite strives to put  forth a leader with his own image and ideas, or at least they  create such an appearance for him. All this is because the  calling of the leader is to take people forward. He must have  professionalism, he must be able to anticipate and calculate his  steps. If he has said that by autumn he will achieve such and  such, he must do it.    [Prokhanov] But then there is another quality that has been  implied in all of your postulates. The leader is in tune not  only with the times and the nation, but also with what we have  become accustomed to calling the spheres. He must be fully in  tune with Providence and understand that he was called at a  tragic moment for his Motherland as a person who has been  entrusted by fate to save the country from disaster. This sense  of purpose, this absolute harmony with the historical and divine  has made great Russian people real popular leaders. They were  not simply politicians singled out by the elite, generated by  civil wars and strife. They were spiritual personalities....    [Zorkin] I do not know whether they felt this themselves but  they were definitely in tune with the people. The leader and the  group of people around him virtually led everyone forward so  that instead of depression there was hope, a general will for  action. This heroic conduct has always been based on  spirituality and morality. I am convinced that if base material  interests rule the person, he is not capable of contributing to  the development of society. A noble idea moves the leader. In  this sense I agree: This could be called a sign from the heavens.</p>

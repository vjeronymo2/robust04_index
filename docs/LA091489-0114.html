			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COAST CHRISTIAN STAR EARL RHODES THROWN FOR LOSS BY INELIGIBILITY  </P> <P> Coast Christian running back Earl Rhodes, the two-time CIF Eight-Man Small  Division Player of the Year, is ineligible this season because he has already  completed eight semesters of high school, the school's athletic director said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Randy Robinson said Rhodes attended Pasadena High School as a freshman in the  1984-85 academic year. That makes this the fifth year of high school for the  18-year-old Rhodes, considered one of the top college football prospects in the  South Bay.  </P> <P> "He took some bad advice," Robinson said. "Someone should have explained the  consequences to him."  </P> <P> Rhodes was listed as a junior last year when he led Coast Christian of Redondo  Beach to its second consecutive Southern Section Eight-Man Small Division  title. In terms of eligibility, though, he was a senior.  </P> <P> Without the 6-foot-2, 205-pound Rhodes, Coast Christian had its 24-game winning  streak snapped Saturday in a season opener against Victor Valley Christian,  50-0.  </P> <P> Robinson said he discovered that Rhodes was ineligible after receiving an  anonymous phone call last week. He checked the tip with Pasadena High, which  confirmed that Rhodes had attended the school as a ninth-grader but did not  participate in football.  </P> <P> Robinson said when Rhodes transferred to Coast Christian the following year in  1985, he was listed as a freshman instead of a sophomore. The fact Rhodes  repeated the ninth grade came as a surprise to Coast Christian officials.  </P> <P> "Our records showed he had attended Pasadena Junior High before coming here,"  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Dan Pride, who coached Rhodes the last three seasons at Coast Christian and  drove the student to school from his home in Pasadena, said he was shocked by  the news.  </P> <P> "Coming into Coast I thought he was a freshman," said Pride, now the football  coach at Webb in Claremont. "I don't know if he wanted to forget (his year at  Pasadena High) or what. I don't think he knew about the rule."  </P> <P> Rhodes could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Southern Section administrator Bill Clark said the only way Rhodes might have  been eligible to play this season would be if he had been physically unable to  play football during his freshman year at Pasadena High.  </P> <P> "He doesn't have much ground for an appeal," Clark said. "From what I  understand, when he was at Pasadena he had the opportunity to play. We're not  in the business of red-shirting people."  </P> <P> Robinson said Rhodes is attending classes at Coast Christian and hopes to play  college football next year.  </P> <P> "We're still going to try and get him a scholarship," Robinson said. "He wants  to pick up his (grade-point average) and be able to play football again next  year. In spite of this setback, he wants to go on."  </P> <P> Rhodes dominated his division, the lowest in the Southern Section, each of the  last two seasons, rushing for 3,829 yards.  </P></p>

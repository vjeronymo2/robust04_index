			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Third way to the top of the pile: David Goodhart weighs the debate on UK competitiveness in the light of disparate global economic models Rarely can the UK's industrial shortcomings have come under such scrutiny. Today, six months of analysis and debate culminates in the publication of the government's white paper on competitiveness. It follows a multitude of other reports on how to sharpen economic performance from government departments, the Labour party, two parliamentary select committees, countless think-tanks and academics, and most employers' associations. Various factors help to explain the timing of this stock-taking, the most important being the continuing long-term weakness of UK economic performance. The improvements in the 1980s in industrial relations, productivity growth and manufacturing exports helped to narrow the performance gap with several of the UK's closest economic rivals such as France and Germany. But after a long recession the gap still looks stubbornly wide from manufacturing productivity to income per head (see charts). The reports may also express a deeper change of mood among business leaders and policy makers. Mr Ken Mayhew, a former economist at the now defunct research body, the National Economic Development Office, says: 'When I joined Nedo in 1988 most leading business people I met thought we had cracked the UK's economic problems. 'When I left in 1991 it was quite different. The recession came as a deep shock to many people, but on top of that it appeared that sacking workers and improving productivity had been the easy part, and that moving on from there was much more difficult.' Many of the analysts concentrate on apparent failures in external economic performance - such as trade and the value of sterling  - which they fear could deteriorate further in the face of increasing competition from developing countries. They point to the forced exit of the UK from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 and the UK's persistent current account deficit even during recession. Much of the evidence comes from the pro-manufacturing lobby which has been given a new lease of life in the post-Thatcher era. This has been underscored by the arrival of Mr Michael Heseltine as Department of Trade and Industry secretary, and by the perception that the manufacturing sector is now too small to sustain a strong recovery. It is the performance of manufacturing and services and the growth rate of overall productivity which is the key determinant of national economic welfare. Performance in world markets is only part of the picture, says Professor Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the growth in UK living standards has been 'disappointing', according to the government, with the country slipping to 18th place in gross domestic product per head among the main industrial countries. And the UK had a misery index (annual unemployment and inflation rates combined) which was second only to Italy in the Group of Seven main industrial nations over the period 1971 to 1992. The individuals and committees seeking to diagnose and reverse these trends are easy to mock with their grandiose ambitions and long wish-lists. But it is not enough to dismiss them by saying that companies and not countries compete, says Dr Ann Robinson of the free-market Institute of Directors. 'The national framework of laws and regulations is important in helping or hindering companies,' she says. Further, the manner in which the problems are being discussed provides some grounds for optimism. 'There is a consensus about the nature of the problems which would have been unthinkable even a few years ago,' says Sir Geoffrey Owen, a director of the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance and a former editor of the Financial Times. There is widespread concern about education and vocational training; about the relationship between finance and business and the 'short-termism' this is said to generate; about the failure of innovation; and about the lack of a layer of thriving medium-sized businesses comparable with those in Germany. There is also a long-standing belief that 'change happens less easily in the UK than in comparable countries, because we are less well structured', as Mr Geoff Robinson, an IBM executive and former adviser at the DTI, puts it. These 'decline of Britain' themes generate a sense of deja vu. But there is a hard-headed tone and an attention to detail which would not have been apparent 10 years ago. The variety of academic, government and business reports acknowledge strengths where they exist - in pharmaceuticals and financial services, for example - and puzzle over the 'long tail' problem: if some companies can do it, why do so many fail? The old industrial policy agenda of government support for industry and 'picking winners' is noticeable by its absence. The Labour party document scarcely mentions the unions, much to the chagrin of some union leaders. There is even some agreement on the measures required to create more of the high-performance companies of which the UK has too few. Several reports recommend reforms to the tax system to encourage more investment and training. Less straightforwardly, there is broad interest in establishing a more supportive financial framework for large companies by making contested takeovers more difficult and dividend payments more closely aligned with profitability. For smaller companies, there is a lobby for the creation of a development bank able to provide long- term loans to growing businesses at subsidised rates. There is also interest in fostering more corporate collaboration on technology transfer. But behind this apparent consensus, a scarcely articulated argument is being conducted over the kind of economic model to which Britain should aspire. The battle is between those who think that many of the problems are endemic and can be solved only through a regulatory and institutional overhaul, and those who believe that the existing liberal system, buttressed by powerful anti-monopoly laws, needs no more than discreet policy reforms and intelligent exhortation. Informing many of the supporters of overhaul are the Germanic and Japanese models of 'organised' capitalism. These are said to comprise corporate institutions which enhance wealth creation through fostering stable, long-term relationships between key economic groups. Liberal critics regard these corporate rules - such as life-time employment and company cross-ownership in Japan, or compulsory worker consultation in Germany - as belonging to an earlier corporatist era. That approach, now under threat in the latter two countries, is one from which Britain is fortunate to be free, they add. If they have a model it is the free-market US, which still has the highest average productivity (and GDP per head) in the world and is the world leader in high-technology industries. The Labour party is happy to embrace the Germanic 'stakeholder' company model, in which workers influence decision-making, and financiers and suppliers are locked in. 'We want to reform the architecture of our company structures to encourage committed owners,' says Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman. The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, in its a recent report on reforming the UK company, Tomorrow's Company, also embraces the stakeholder approach, but without proposing new regulation. 'There's a lot of nervousness about taking the regulatory path,' says Mr Neil Hartley, the society's research head. The trade and industry select committee is similarly sympathetic to 'committed' capitalism, but it is wary about institutional reform and explicitly rejects the German-style supervisory board. 'Lessons learnt overseas cannot usually be transferred to the UK,' says the select committee's report. But where other countries have 'competitive advantage', for example in relationships with financial institutions, the UK must replicate them in its own way. Mr Heseltine takes a tantalisingly ambiguous position in this debate. In his 1987 book, Where There's a Will, he praises German institutions such as employee representation on supervisory boards. He also backs a system of compulsory-membership employer organisations such as chambers of commerce, which help to ensure that almost all employers train to a high standard. But in office this agenda has been scarcely visible. His main accomplishment has been to deliver a reorganisation of government support for industry both at regional and Whitehall level. Judging by the tone of the DTI's own contributions to the trade and industry select committee, and the deregulatory agenda of the Conservative party, today's white paper will not return to the themes of Where There's a Will. Indeed, few new initiatives are expected. At least for public consumption, the DTI admits of no endemic problems except in education and training. Mr Bob Dobbie, head of the new competitiveness division set up by Mr Heseltine in 1992, says that 'there is no conclusive evidence that short-termism is a general problem'; and he denies there is a 'financing gap' for small business. The government, and observers such as Mr Dobbie, believe that as far as there is a short-termism problem, it is one of business judgment rather than market structure. The only role for government is to ensure better information flows. The market, the government might add, is correcting itself; financial institutions are taking a more active interest in the companies they own. Even Hanson, the conglomerate often accused of ruthless short-termism, has decided to lengthen its target payback period on investments. But to economists such as Mr Ewart Keep and Mr Ken Mayhew, this minimalist policy contradicts the government's objectives. They told the select committee: 'On the one hand ministers and civil servants have painted the vision of a high-wage, high-tech, high-skill future . . . the only one that advanced economies can sustain in the long run. On the other hand actual policy has sought to emphasise low wage costs and a deregulated labour market.' If there is a tension here, it does not adversely affect high-technology sectors of the US economy, for example. It is, in any case, a tension in many analyses of competitiveness, including that by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, entitled Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. Management theorists such as Professor John Kay also seem unsure which side of the argument they are on. Prof Kay talked to the select committee about creating high-trust, high-commitment relationships within companies. But under questioning he said that countries should play to their competitive strengths which, in the case of Britain, may mean nurturing US-style high flexibility and low cost. Even Labour-sympathising academics, such as Mr David Soskice, have concluded the UK will not be able to create the conditions for a high-skill manufacturing economy. Policy should concentrate instead on copying US mass higher education to equip young people for the high value-added end of the service industries on which most national wealth will depend. Mr Keith Hampson, a leading member of the trade and industry select committee and a confidant of Mr Heseltine, believes that the German-Japanese and the US models are converging. He also believes that the UK can forge a coherent 'middle way' between them, and that the country's low-cost, deregulatory attractions 'give us a breathing space to get our act together'. Today's white paper will be the testament of that British way.</p>

The new flights will expand  its service to Sacramento, Oakland, Fresno and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Fresno-based WestAir, which currently flies 12 daily round-trips from Orange  County as United Express, said it added the flights because its annual  passenger allocation at John Wayne Airport for the fiscal year ended March 31,  1990, has been boosted 46.6%, to 121,660 from 82,994.  </P> <P> The new allocation gives WestAir almost 61% of the 200,000 passengers that the  five commuter airlines now serving John Wayne Airport are allowed to carry each  year.  </P> <P> WestAir said that its new schedule will add one daily round trip to Sacramento  and to Fresno, two to Los Angeles and three to Oakland.  </P> <P> WestAir, which uses 19- and 30-passenger turboprop planes, now flies three  round-trips to each city from Orange County.  </P></p>

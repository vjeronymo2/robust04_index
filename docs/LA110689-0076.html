			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO CONSIDER SENIOR HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> A proposal for a senior citizen housing development that has angered some  neighbors will be considered by the City Council tonight.  </P> <P> The 179-unit, three-story project, called Valley View Senior Villas, is planned  for 2.8 acres at 12200 Valley View St., south of Chapman Avenue, in west Garden  Grove. Some residents in the area have argued that the buildings would generate  too much traffic, block their views and invade their privacy.  </P> <P> Garden Grove's Planning Commission approved the project Aug. 24, and the City  Council considered it on Oct. 2. At that time, the council voted to reschedule  the matter for tonight.  </P> <P> The city has received letters from both proponents and opponents of the plan.  </P></p>

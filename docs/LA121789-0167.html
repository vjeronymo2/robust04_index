			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: KEEPING A SCORECARD ON WINNERS, LOSERS IN RECORD INDUSTRY WARS  </P> <P> This was the Year of the Comeback, with everyone from the Rolling Stones to  Donny Osmond to Alice Cooper making big splashes.  </P> <P>  But behind the scenes, the record industry was full of tumult, with a flurry  of executive shuffles and company sell-offs (the biggest being A&amp;M, which  PolyGram bought for an eye-popping $500 million).  </P> <P>  Still, most labels remained comfortably in the black, thanks largely to the  continuing compact disc boom. Times are so good that everybody wants to get  into the music business. Topping the list: Irving Azoff, who's starting his own  label, and the Walt Disney Co., which is jumping in with Hollywood Records.  </P> <P>  Is there room for more players in the already fiercely competitive industry?  Will the new labels spark a fierce bidding war as they vie for budding  superstars? Will the CD boom finally go bust?  </P> <P>  While the music business ponders these and other questions over the holidays,  Pop Eye takes a look at how the industry's major players fared this year.  </P> <P> A&amp;M Records  </P> <P> PolyGram Inc. certainly didn't buy A&amp;M based on its 1989 performance,  though the label's lackluster showing over the past year may have been what  finally prompted Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss to sell the company they had  founded in 1962. (The execs shrewdly kept A&amp;M's prized music-publishing  firm.) It was such a bad year that the label's biggest hit until October was a  fluke No. 1 single by soap-opera star Michael Damian. Happily, Janet Jackson  came through late in the year with "Rhythm Nation," her ballyhooed follow-up  album to "Control," which sold a quick two million copies.  </P> <P> Arista  </P> <P> Critics rarely rave about Arista artists, but the label has achieved a solid  track record in recent years by discovering acts with Top 40 appeal, such as  Whitney Houston, Expose and Taylor Dayne. This year's new model is Milli  Vanilli, a pair of poster-boy popsters whose debut album has sold five million  copies (and counting) -- and spun off a trio of No. 1 singles. But despite the  company's high pop profile, the Eurythmics' label debut album has gotten off to  a slow start, and Dion's comeback attempt fizzled.  </P> <P> Atlantic  </P> <P> It was a platinum pajama party as the label's leading ladies all hit the Top  10. Bette Midler landed one of the biggest surprise hits of the year with the  "Beaches" sound track, which spawned her first No. 1 single, "Wind Beneath My  Wings." An even bigger surprise was the Top 10 success of Donna Summer's first  post-Geffen single. Debbie Gibson aged gracefully, landing her first No. 1  album and another No. 1 single. Skid Row (who are even prettier than Gibson)  and Winger (who aren't) also scored platinum albums. Phil Collins and his  Genesis mate Mike Rutherford (with the Mechanics) each topped the singles  chart, but Foreigner's Mick Jones bombed with his debut solo album.  </P> <P> Capitol  </P> <P> After several sluggish years for the label, Capitol's executives were in the  hot seat -- and president David Berman got burned. The industry vet got the ax  in September and was replaced by Hale Milgrim, a touted marketing exec from  Elektra Records. The label's A&amp;R department, which had a poor track record  of discovering new hitmakers, was also reorganized this fall. Many of the  label's 1989 hits were with acts on the comeback trail, notably Bonnie Raitt  (who had her highest-charting album ever), the Doobie Brothers and even Donny  Osmond, who shocked the industry by zooming to No. 2 on the singles chart with  "Soldier of Love." But the label's most cherished comeback bid was its biggest  disappointment: Paul McCartney's "Flowers in the Dirt" album, which didn't even  crack the Top 20. The label nabbed the Beastie Boys, but the rap hotshots'  follow-up to their No. 1 CBS debut stalled at No. 14. Capitol had a platinum  album from rapper M.C. Hammer, and, thanks to its deal with Enigma, hard-rock  hits by Great White and Poison.  </P> <P> Columbia  </P> <P> The industry is crediting new kids on the block with lifting this sleeping  giant out of a lengthy slump. And they're not just talking about teen phenoms  New Kids on the Block, whose "Hangin' Tough" album has sold 6 million copies --  the year's best seller. They're also referring to the arrival of a new  management team headed by former rock manager Tommy Mottola and one-time Arista  hotshot Don Ienner. The label's renowned marketing machinery also sparked  comebacks by Billy Joel and the Rolling Stones. A greatest hits set by Journey  quietly sold 2 million copies; making more noise on their way to platinum were  metal upstarts Warrant and a trio of rap acts from Columbia's Def Jam  affiliate.  </P> <P> Elektra  </P> <P> It's time for label chief Bob Krasnow to light up another victory cigar. The  most artist-oriented label of the '80s continued to prosper with a remarkably  diverse talent roster. Where else could you find speed-metal masters Metallica  rubbing shoulders with silky show-tune crooner Michael Feinstein? Elektra's  across-the-board 1989 successes ranged from metal homeboys Motley Crue (who  landed their first No. 1 album) to post-punk heroes the Cure, who had their  biggest album to date (and headlined Dodger Stadium).  </P> <P> EMI  </P> <P> This label has had more to brag about in recent years than its much larger  sister label, Capitol. Richard Marx avoided the sophomore jinx with "Repeat  Offender," which has already outsold his first album, topping the 3 million  mark. Marx also came through with a pair of No. 1 singles as did Roxette,  Sweden's hottest pop export since ABBA. David Bowie's "Tin Machine" was the  label's biggest disappointment, barely making the Top 30.  </P> <P> Epic  </P> <P> Thanks to a concerted label push and pivotal MTV support, Living Colour made  history as the first black rock band to go platinum since the heyday of Jimi  Hendrix and Sly &amp; the Family Stone. But with the exception of that album  and Gloria Estefan's strong showing, Epic was living on its past laurels this  year. Its other platinum albums (Ozzy Osbourne, Europe and Joan Jett) were all  holdovers from 1988. Company stalwarts Cyndi Lauper and the Jacksons bombed, as  did label newcomers Liza Minnelli and the Jefferson Airplane. One comeback that  did pan out was Alice Cooper, who mined his first gold album since 1976.  </P> <P> Geffen  </P> <P> Talk about a label with momentum to burn. After a few lean years in the mid  '80s, Geffen has built a much-envied track record in recent years thanks to a  shrewd promotion department and a stable of high-profile (and hotly  competitive) A&amp;R execs. The label has had so much success that it's  expected to reactivate Asylum Records early next year to make room for more  young artists. Two smash albums by hometown bad boys Guns N' Roses sold a  combined total of 5 million copies. Aerosmith and Don Henley returned with  platinum albums, while Cher (aided by a revealing video shot on the U.S.S.  Missouri) earned the first platinum album of her career. Edie Brickell &amp;  the New Bohemians rode their 1988 album into the Top 5 in February.  </P> <P> MCA  </P> <P> Is there life after Irving Azoff? Last summer the industry's most colorful (and  controversial) figure left the label he brought back from the dead to start a  new company bankrolled by Warner Bros. The crowning achievement for Azoff and  his team -- which included successor Al Teller -- came in July when MCA became  the first label in eight years to monopolize the top three spots on Billboard's  pop album chart. The label scored with the Fine Young Cannibals (whose album  had the longest run at No. 1 this year), Bobby Brown and Tom Petty. The label's  black music division also had hits with Heavy D. &amp; the Boyz and Guy  featuring Teddy Riley. On the other hand, Tiffany's album fell short of the  phenomenal success of her 1987 debut, and Patti LaBelle's latest flopped.  </P> <P> Motown  </P> <P> In its first full year of operation since former MCA hotshot Jheryl Busby took  over the top job, Motown has been trying to regain some of its long-lost  momentum by going after fresh talent and building relationships with hot  producers. But it still has a long way to go. The one-time hit factory had a  platinum album with teen dreams the Boys, but had the year's most embarrassing  bomb with Diana Ross' "Workin' Overtime," the pop diva's heralded return to her  former home.  </P> <P> PolyGram  </P> <P> As recently as last year, PolyGram was one of the industry's hottest rock  factories, fueled by such bands as Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. This year it  cooled off considerably, perhaps prompting the sudden departure of label chief  Dick Asher last month. The label's biggest album was a multiplatinum holdover  from 1988, Bon Jovi's "New Jersey." John Cougar Mellencamp and Tears for Fears  released eagerly awaited new albums that went platinum, but didn't match past  sales triumphs. Critics raved, however, about a pair of down-home up 'n'  comers, Michelle Shocked and Texas.  </P> <P> RCA  </P> <P> It was a quiet year for ol' Nipper, which didn't have much product from its pop  mainstays and lost respected A&amp;R chief Paul Atkinson to MCA. Apart from a  strong showing by its venerable country division, the label has been living off  profits from its "Dirty Dancing" sound-track bonanzas. In country, K. T. Oslin  and the Judds each had two platinum albums while newcomer Clint Black scored a  gold album. The best news for the rock division came from heavy-metal goddess  Lita Ford, whose 1988 "Lita" album went platinum, and gothic-popsters Love and  Rockets, whose album went Top 15.  </P> <P> Virgin  </P> <P> Wanna bet on who'll be the hottest industry label of the early '90s? We'll put  our money on Virgin, a daring young label run by creative executives with a  shrewd eye for artists with strong visual identity. Two years ago Paula Abdul  was choreographing Janet Jackson's videos. Now she's Jackson's arch-rival as  the princess of dance pop, thanks to a trio of spiffy videos that ruled MTV all  year. All three of those singles reached No. 1, as did Abdul's debut album,  which has sold more than 4 million copies. Virgin also had platinum albums from  the late Roy Orbison and hot newcomers Soul II Soul, plus critical valentines  for hip-hop diva Neneh Cherry and singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz.  </P> <P> Warner Bros.  </P> <P> The Mercedes of the music business, Warners is renowned for its executive  stability, wide-ranging artist roster and comfortable, family-style  environment. This year, the Burbank-based company continued to be the  industry's most watched -- and most imitated -- firm (even if some young Turks  are grumbling that the label is resting on its laurels a bit). Madonna and  Prince, the '80s' most erotic and adventuresome pop icons, were back at No. 1  with double-platinum albums. The label's folksy oldsters the Traveling Wilburys  also sold 2 million, while Karyn White became the year's hottest black female  singer with her debut album. Warners, with its Reprise and Sire affiliates,  also had impressive outings with the B-52's, Lou Reed, the Cult, Elvis Costello  and Eric Clapton.  </P> <P> Mighty Indies  </P> <P> Delicious Vinyl landed the first No. 1 album by a black rapper with Tone Loc's  "Loc-ed After Dark" in April, and has Young M.C. coming on strong. . . .  Priority landed two platinum albums with gangster-style rappers Eazy-E and  N.W.A, whose incendiary anthems on "Straight Outta Compton" were the most hotly  debated pop lyrics of the year. . . . Profile's rap crew, Rob Base &amp; D.J.  E-Z Rock, also went platinum. . . . Def Jam had platinum hits with Slick Rick,  LL Cool J and Public Enemy. . . . Tommy Boy won critical plaudits and gold  sales with its rap rookies, De La Soul. . . . After losing both Robert Palmer  and Steve Winwood, Island was sold to PolyGram. . . . And Rhino had continued  success with its rock oldie reissues.  </P></p>

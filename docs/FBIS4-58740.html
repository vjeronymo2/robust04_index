			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 5, IRNA -- Minister of Finance and  Economic Affairs, Morteza Mohammad-Khan said on Thursday that  the share of taxes in the Gross National Product (GNP) was five  percent.    Addressing a group of Finance Ministry director generals  from  throughout the country, Mohammad-Khan said it was necessary that  simpler methods be adopted for collection of taxes.    He said that in the past calendar year, 1372 (March  1993-March 1994) the Finance Ministry had collected rls. 4,000  billion in direct and indirect taxes and that the figure was  expected to reach rls. 7,800 billion this year.    Mohammad-Khan said in the past year taxes made up one-sixth  of the country's budget, adding that the ratio would rise to one  fifth this year.    Since the country's revenue is provided through oil export,  borrowing from domestic and foreign banks and collecting taxes  from high income people was the best form of economic adjustment  plan. He said that in the course of the 1988-94 economic  development plan, non-oil exports had an eye-catching rise so  much so that it reached dlrs four billion last year.    The emphasis put by the first economic development plan on  production instead of import served to reduce the country's  imports from 15 million tons in 1988 to five million tons  annually at present, he said.    The finance minister predicted that the country will reach  self-sufficiency in petrochemical sector by the end of this year  and will no longer need to import petrochemicals.    Five million tons of steel will be produced by domestic  steel  mills by the end of 1373 (ending March 1995), 1.2 million tons  of which would be exported, the minister said.    The average growth of Gross National Product (GNP) in the  course of the first development plan stood at seven percent, he  said.    The finance minister said that during the first five-year  plan a total of dlrs 107 billion were invested in different  economic areas, adding that oil revenues should be diverted  towards investment so as to boost the country's economy.</p>

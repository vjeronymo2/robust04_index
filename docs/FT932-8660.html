			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Bicycle ride to a revolution The long relative decline of Britain will continue until there is a revolution. What kind of revolution? One answer is given by Professor Stephen Haseler in a new book entitled The End of the House of Windsor - Birth of a British Republic*. Our author is professor of government at Guildhall University, London. 'The dawning truth about Britain in the post-war period,' he writes, 'is that the country seems to be running out of options. We have tried virtually every strategy for survival.' Yes, yes, but what kind of revolution? Well, actually, a cultural revolution. Back to the professor. ' . . . Our culture - the way we think, the way we talk, the values we live by, indeed 'the British way of life' - no longer allows us to compete effectively in the modern commercial world.' As he sees it, the way to change the culture is by reform of our governing institutions and indeed the constitution itself. Turning our monarchy into a republic would certainly achieve that. 'My argument here', writes Professor Haseler, 'is that, over time, new attitudes and aspirations would follow.' Ordinarily, none of this would matter. It could be dismissed as academic pub-talk. Maybe it still can. But it is possible that the professor is pulling at a loose thread of indeterminate length. His book appears at a moment when the competence of the government is more deeply in doubt than at any time since 1945. That would be bad enough, but the opposition is divided and its largest component, the Labour party, presently inspires little confidence. We are heading towards a mid-1990s election in which the choice before us may be between competing B-teams. This is frustrating. It has not led to marches behind republican banners, but the political atmosphere is becoming more hospitable to those who propound systemic reforms. So is the social climate. The behaviour of some of the royal children has eroded loyalties that once seemed beyond question. The Queen herself remains popular. Her position is, deservedly, secure. What comes after her is, however, unpredictable. Visitors to Britain do not have to move very far from the airport to discover that the House of Windsor faces an uncertain future. Just pick up any newspaper, or look out for a clutch of books - some published, some about to be - that seek to catch the tide built up by the tittle-tattle of the tabloids. Professor Haseler does not shrink from exploiting this phenomenon. 'It is fitting,' he writes, 'that the travails of Diana and Charles's marriage should be the catalyst for major change.' The same series of events has encouraged The Times, once a rock of allegiance to the throne, to associate itself with the reformist Charter 88 movement in a forthcoming conference on 'The Monarchy, the Constitution and the People'. This gathering, due on Saturday, will be addressed by staunch monarchists, moderate reformers, and Professor Haseler. We should not conclude that Mr Rupert Murdoch, a suspect republican, is using his posh London newspaper for nefarious purposes. I wouldn't know anything about that. The pertinent point is that a journal that carries the court circular every day is facilitating a debate on the monarchy that 20 or 30 years ago might have been deemed treasonable. That is how far public opinion has moved. It still has a mighty long way to go before there is a republican movement in Britain. In spite of my dreams of a federal republic in these islands I would stop well before that, and settle for a Dutch, Belgian or Scandinavian form of dis-established throne. Professor Haseler dismisses such a solution as certain to fail. But consider the essence of the argument, his and mine, in favour of constructing a new British constitution by removing the crown, the keystone, from the arch of the present antiquated structure. It is the crown that supports, and is supported by, the anachronistic House of Lords; the crown in whose name ministers feel able to sign treaties, such as the one concluded at Maastricht, in the absence of parliamentary approval; the crown that legitimises the thousand and one decisions made in the dark corridors of Whitehall every day. Replace its authority with that of a written constitution, dismiss the House of Lords and elect a senate, and you have quite enough revolution for the average English family to stomach. Europe's little northern monarchies have solved the problem. They do not have hereditary upper houses of parliament, and their constitutions specify exactly what their kings and queens may do. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has 'supreme authority in all the affairs of the realm', but, as with the conclusion of treaties, only with the consent of the Folketing. Likewise Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard of the Netherlands. She may appoint her prime ministers by decree, but does so on the report of a 'formateur' to the effect that he or she commands a majority. No such sliver of ambiguity prevails in Sweden, whose constitution provides for the speaker of the Riksdag to propose a new prime minister. Government decisions do not require King Karl XVI Gustaf's signature. King Baudouin of Belgium has far greater nominal powers (he is the supreme head of the executive). But in practice he does not exercise them. British subjects who see the need for reform but insist that the person of a respected monarch is a focus for national loyalties may thus have their cake and eat it, simply by learning from the Low Countries and the Scandinavians. These are in essence republics, in which authority is derived from the people. For reasons of their own they retain their cycling monarchs. We may have to do the same. Perhaps the Union Jack is not an adequate substitute for a crowned head, as the stars and stripes are in the US, or the abstract notion of the state is in France. Perhaps our revolution, when it comes, has to stop short. The chances of this happening are becoming real. The Labour party's proposals for constitutional reform say little about the monarchy, but if the other parts are enacted, the rest will surely follow. We may be in for permanent Conservative government, but this seems doubtful. One day an electable, reforming, alternative will be on offer. With any luck, the British polity will then become like that of Italy a year or so ago: pregnant with sudden change. *Published by I B Taurus, London. 207 pages.</p>

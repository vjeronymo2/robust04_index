			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: New structure for FT-A World Indices A NEW structure of industrial sector classifications for the FT-Actuaries World Indices has been published in draft form by the World Index Policy Committee, which supervises the rules and operation of the FT-AWI. An outline of the new structure appears below. The new structure will classify companies into six new economic sectors  - resources, utilities, manufacturing, consumer products, services and financial activities. At the more detailed levels, industry sectors and sub-sectors have been reviewed, in some cases redefined, and fitted into this framework. The committee, chaired by Mr Richard Pain, of the Institute of Actuaries, believes that the resulting new structure more accurately represents the pattern of international business. The review leading up to the new structure is the first complete reappraisal of FT-AWI industrial classifications since the World Index was launched in March 1987. It forms part of the Policy Committee's responsibility for ensuring that the indices remain a relevant measure of performance for the international investment community. Under new commercial agreements signed last month by the Financial Times, Goldman, Sachs and NatWest Securities, and the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries, the committee is being enlarged and its independence from the commercial parties has been enhanced by the adoption of a formal constitution. Although the process of re-evaluating individual companies' classifications is not yet complete, the outline will allow investors to judge whether the new system would provide a better measure of evaluating their portfolio performance than the current classification structure. Comments from users of the FT-AWI will be welcomed and should be addressed, together with other enquiries, to Symon Bradford at NatWest Securities, Edinburgh (031-243-4258), or to Mark Zurack or Barbara Mueller at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York (212-902-6777). Adrian Dicks is Manager, FT Statistics, and represents The Financial Times on the World Index Policy Committee.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-AWI INDUSTRY STRUCTURE (1993 DRAFT REVISION)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic Group    Industry Sector                Industry Sub-Sectors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1000 RESOURCES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   1100   FARMING &amp;

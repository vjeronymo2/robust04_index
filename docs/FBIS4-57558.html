			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Liendo] </F>   [Text] Merida -- A guerrilla cell was dismantled by the  National Guard in a mountain area known as "Los Giros," near the  Pan-American Highway, in Merida State. The place is located on  the Tachira State border, in the southern zone adjoining  Maracaibo Lake.    The group was arrested during a security operation  undertaken  by the National Guard against outlaws and irregular groups.  Group members were followed when they tried to implement their  plan to kidnap a cattleman and his son.    Intelligence work by the National Guard and police revealed  the guerrillas' presence south of the lake. The operation led  the police to the mountain area of Los Giros, very close to the  farm owned by cattleman Manuel Maria Guerrero. The criminals had  camped near the farm to kidnap Manuel Maria Guerrero and his  son, who was not identified.    The prisoners were identified as Alfredo Perez Alcina (26  years), alleged member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia, Alvaro Pena Bejas, Carlos Rojas Tarazona, and a minor  whose name was not revealed. The authorities confiscated a  pistol, a revolver, knives, and canned food during the operation.    The four prisoners were turned over to the PTJ [Technical  Judicial Police] in Merida, and authorities are investigating  their possible ties with and financial support from the  Colombian guerrilla groups that operate along the border.</p>

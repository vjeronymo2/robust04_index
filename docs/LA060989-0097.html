			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> DOW ADDS 4.59, RIDES RALLY FUELED BY OFFERS, LOWER INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> The stock market churned ahead Thursday, squeezing a little more mileage out of  its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining interest  rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 4.59 to 2,516.91, bringing its gain  over the past three sessions to 36.21 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 212.31 million shares, against  213.71 million the previous session.  </P> <P> The Dow finished the day just short of last Friday's post-crash high of  2,517.83 and still more than 200 points below its 1987 peak.  </P> <P> However, the index at the American Stock Exchange climbed to a record, topping  its best levels recorded in the summer of 1987.  </P> <P> New takeover bids this week for Time Inc. and Lin Broadcasting touched off  buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible candidates for  acquisitions or buyouts.  </P> <P> Eastman Kodak, said to be a potential target, climbed 3/8 to 50 7/8 in heavy  trading.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mattel Declines  </P> <P> Time stock, meanwhile, dropped 2 to 168 and Lin lost 4 1/2 to 125 in the  over-the-counter market after both experienced dramatic run-ups in Wednesday's  trading.  </P> <P> Mattel shares continued to decline, despite an assurance from the Hawthrone toy  maker that production in China continued without interruption. Mattel closed at  12 7/8, down 1/8, on the NYSE.  </P> <P> The company produces 25% of its toys -- including Barbie clothes and  accessories, Disney preschool toys and P. J. Sparkles doll -- at two factories  1,500 miles from Beijing near the Hong Kong border. Mattel said it could  quickly shift production to factories in Manila, Mexico or Europe, if  necessary.  </P> <P> Burlington Resources, the volume leader among NYSE issues, fell 2 to 44 3/8.  Pennzoil, which had been considered a possible bidder for Burlington, sold its  stake of 11.7 million shares in a block at 45 1/4.  </P> <P> Pennzoil, having reaped a healthy profit on the investment, gained 4 5/8 to 84  5/8.  </P> <P> Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited from signs  this week that the Federal Reserve might be starting to change course in its  credit policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Energy Mostly Lower  </P> <P> After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the Fed is widely  believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by permitting a decline in  the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks.  </P> <P> Energy stocks were mostly lower amid skepticism that members of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere to oil production  quotas set this week.  </P> <P> Exxon dropped 1/2 to 43 3/4; Texaco slipped 1/4 to 49 5/8; Amoco fell 1 3/8 to  43 3/8; Atlantic Richfield dropped 1 3/4 to 91 5/8, and Chevron fell, 1 1/2 to  53 3/8.  </P> <P> Stock prices closed sharply higher in heavy trading Thursday on the London  Stock Exchange amid a favorable economic background and some institutional  buying. The Financial Times 100-share index finished 25.5 points, or 1.2%  higher at 2,143.4.  </P> <P> On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei index closed the day at  33,718.29, gaining 91.40 points.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Grain and soybean futures prices declined on the Chicago Board of Trade because  of continued pressure from favorable weather forecasts and slack demand.  </P> <P> On other markets, copper prices were up while precious metals were down; energy  prices rallied; livestock and meat futures were down, and sugar and cotton  prices rose.  </P> <P> Wheat futures, which have been declining because of the political turmoil in  China, were off for the third consecutive trading session. Analysts say the  problems in China may mean that country won't place new orders for U.S. wheat.  </P> <P> "There was some concern over China and additional wheat sales, but the market  lacked any real direction," Frank Kouba, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton  in Chicago, said Thursday.  </P> <P> Soybean futures were mixed, getting a boost from a threatened sales boycott by  Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about their government's exchange  rate policy.  </P> <P> In addition, dockworkers in Brazil are threatening another nationwide port  strike, which would hamper Brazilian soybean exports.  </P> <P> Corn prices were pressured by light demand and reports of improved growing  conditions in major crop areas.  </P> <P> Wheat settled 0.25 cent to 1.50 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in  July at $3.8175 a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 cents lower, with July at  $2.5325 a bushel; oats were 1.50 cents to 2.50 cents higher, with July at $1.65  a bushel, and soybeans were 5.75 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with July at  $7.14 a bushel.  </P> <P> Copper futures moved higher on New York's Commodity Exchange on speculation  about supply disruptions.  </P> <P> The start of contract talks next week between U.S. producers and their unions,  with the possibility of strikes, and the continued closure of Bougainville  Copper Ltd.'s Papua, New Guinea, mine boosted prices, said Bette Raptopoulos,  an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.  </P> <P> Copper settled 1.10 cents to 2.50 cents higher with June at $1.35 a pound.  </P> <P> Precious metals prices declined as the dollar showed renewed strength.  </P> <P> Gold settled $2.60 to $3.10 lower, with June at $373.50 an ounce; silver was  2.1 cents to 2.7 cents lower, with June at $5.443 an ounce.  </P> <P> Energy futures mostly were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange in  reaction to promises by Kuwait to cut back oil production.  </P> <P> Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah said his country intended to  produce 1.35 million barrels a day in coming months.  </P> <P> On Wednesday the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed a new  production accord that placed Kuwait's new quota at 1.093 million barrels. Its  current output is estimated at nearly 2 million barrels a day.  </P> <P> Livestock and meat futures were mixed in lackluster trading on the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices moved moderately higher as traders grew more optimistic about the  economy ahead of the government's producer price report, which is to be  reported today.  </P> <P> The credit market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/4 point, or $2.50  for every $1,000 in face amount, after rising nearly a full point on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to  8.29% -- its lowest level since February, 1988 -- from 8.31%.  </P> <P> "All of the bias in the market seems to be in an upward direction," said  Elizabeth Ginste Reiners, a vice president with Dean Witter Reynolds.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other for  short-term loans, was unchanged at 9.375%  </P> <P> A decline in the fed funds rate during the past few weeks has been interpreted  by analysts as a sign that the Fed is shifting toward a more generous credit  policy.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies in light trading ahead of  today's release of figures on U.S. wholesale price inflation.  </P> <P> Gold prices moved lower.  </P> <P> The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and French franc but fell against  other major currencies.  </P> <P> Dealers said the dollar rose briefly against the West German mark on rumors  that U.S. citizens were injured or killed in China. The dollar eased after the  U.S. State Department said it had no information to confirm those reports.  </P> <P> Traders were uncertain about how the dollar might be affected by the Labor  Department's report on the Producer Price Index for May.  </P> <P> Cases could be made that either a big inflation increase or a small one was  good for the dollar, said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst at Smith Barney,  Harris Upham &amp; Co. On the other hand, he said, the dollar also could fall  in reaction to a big or small increase.  </P> <P> Gold moved lower in London to a late price of $373.25 an ounce, from $375.65  Wednesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $374.35, down 15 cents from late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 6  </P></p>

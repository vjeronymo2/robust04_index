			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television Keith Floyd presents another entertaining combination of cookery, travel, music and quips in Floyd On Spain (8.30 BBC2). Having made countless gallons of gazpacho as a sometime cook in a Spanish restaurant I find the Floyd method odd (no bread?) but perhaps it tastes fine. Anyway it is the gags with guitarist John Williams and Clive the cameraman ('He's hurt his back, so we're taking things a bit easy - don't bother to send Get Well cards, he'll have recovered long before you see this programme') which keep the whole thing bowling along. AN Wilson's promotion campaign for his new book about the historical Jesus has been superb. Today he adds an entire hour on Channel 4: Jesus Before Christ (9.00). BBC1 launches a new drama series, Civvies, about six former paratroopers attempting to find jobs and settle down after leaving the army (9.30). In Nature Special (9.30 BBC2) Julian Pettifer reports from Zimbabwe on the worst drought in living memory: the crops have failed, cattle have died and 500,000 people face starvation. Omnibus tells the Disney story from 'Cinderella' to the forthcoming 'Aladdin' (10.25 BBC1).</p>

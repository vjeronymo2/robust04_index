			<p>BFN     [Text] The first quarter of this year saw a low growth in  industrial output in Shaanxi Province. The aggregate gross  output value of industrial enterprises at and above the township  level amounted to 12.65 billion yuan, an increase of 7 percent  over the same period last year, indicating a marked slowdown in  the growth rate. Of this gross output value, state-owned  enterprises contributed more than 9.8 billion yuan, a mere  increase of 3 percent. Township-run industrial enterprises had  the highest growth of 39 percent; collective-run enterprises had  the second highest growth of 17.7 percent; and the growth of  heavy industry was still higher than that of light industry. Of  principal industrial products, the output of color television  sets, color television kinescopes, radio sets, washing machines,  and refrigerators increased rapidly. The output of the  following products decreased: cigarettes, white wine, beer, iron  ore, steel products, crude oil, coal, timber, cement, and  heavy-duty trucks. Electric energy production increased by 6.6  percent.    The most prominent problem in industrial production in the  first quarter was that the economic returns of industrial  enterprises declined, more enterprises were suffering losses,  and their profit margin decreased remarkably, with 53.3 percent  of large and medium-sized enterprises, 37.4 percent of  state-owned enterprises, 14.2 percent of collective-run  enterprises, and 50.7 percent of province-run enterprises  suffering losses. The amount of profits of industrial  enterprises decreased by 87.2 percent as compared with the same  period last year.    Some longstanding problems in economic operation have landed  the province's industrial sector in a very grim situation. Now  and in the future, Shaanxi Province needs to vigorously adjust  its production structure and product mix and strive to increase  profits and reduce losses by deepening reform and improving  management.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJANS END REGULAR SEASON WITH ANOTHER FRUSTRATING LOSS  </P> <P> Ryan Drew scored a season-high 21 points, including four three-point field  baskets, to lead California to a 74-62 Pacific 10 victory over USC Saturday in  the last regular-season game for both teams.  </P> <P> Cal, finishing the season 19-11 overall and 10-8 in the conference, trailed,  49-48, with 9:50 left in the game. But the Golden Bears went on a 14-5 run to  take a 62-54 lead with 5:31 remaining.  </P> <P> The Trojans, 9-21 overall and 2-16 in the Pac-10, cut the deficit to 62-58 with  4:31 left. The Golden Bears, who finished fifth in the conference, scored the  next nine points for a 71-58 lead, with 1:09 remaining in the game.  </P> <P> "I'm certainly delighted to finish the season with a win," Cal Coach Lou  Campanelli said. "USC is a tough team, and I mean that. They've played everyone  tough this season, and all their conference games have been close.  </P> <P> "This team shows a lot of character. When USC came back late in the first half  and a couple times in the second, we were patient on offense. That's a good  sign."  </P> <P> For Trojan Coach George Raveling, it was just the latest in a series of  frustrating defeats.  </P> <P> "We've been consistently inconsistent this season," Raveling said. "It's been  the strangest season I have ever been involved in. It seens like our play  fluctuates every five minutes.  </P> <P> "We did do a great job of getting back in the game. Our last timeout before the  half, I told our guys we could tie it up before the half, and we almost did.  </P> <P> "Drew. . . .well, we know he can shoot. He's hot and cold. Today he was hot.  Cal didn't do anything we didn't expect them to do. It's just that they played  a good game."  </P> <P> Cal's Keith Smith broke the school's single-season assist record with nine  against the Trojans, giving him 179. Kevin Johnson, now with the Phoenix Suns,  held the previous mark with 175 assists set in 1986.  </P></p>

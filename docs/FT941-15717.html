			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Framatome state sale under way Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday said that the government had launched the process of privatising Framatome, the nuclear power station group. Framatome, which also has activities in computer services and electronic components, is not on the list of 21-publicly owned groups which the centre-right government has slated for privatisation. It will be sold through a limited tender offer. Officials at the French economy ministry said the government has instructed the privatisation commission, an independent agency which advises it on the sale of public sector companies, to value its 51 per cent stake in Framatome. The likely candidates to take a controlling stake in the group include Alcatel-Alsthom, the engineering, transport and communications group, which currently holds 44 per cent of the shares in Framatome. Mr Pierre Suard, the chairman of Alcatel-Alsthom, has made no secret of his desire to take control of Framatome. He believes the two groups would complement each other, with Framatome's strength in the construction of nuclear power stations combining with Alcatel-Alsthom's presence in conventional power generation. In 1990, Alcatel-Alsthom briefly managed to acquire a majority stake in Framatome, raising its investment from 40 per cent to 52 per cent. But the socialist government of Mr Michel Rocard forced Alcatel to reduce its shareholding. Framatome was formed in 1958 to design and build light pressurised water reactors and nuclear components. It has since diversified and has expanded sales to more than FFr12bn a year. In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, it reported net profits of FFr900m. In addition to the privatisation of Framatome, Mr Longuet said plans were being advanced to establish an alliance between Pechiney, the aluminium group, and Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the hydro-electricity generator. The alliance is aimed at providing Pechiney with a relatively cheap source of energy and a counter-balance to the highly cyclical aluminium industry to render the group more attractive in its forthcoming privatisation. Mr Longuet also confirmed the government's plans to privatise Renault, the state-owned motor vehicle group, later this year.</p>

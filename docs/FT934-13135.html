			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Before looking round, check what your company has to offer - Going early, The health factor / The cost of retaining the protection of private medical care, just when you may need it most, is high, and the choice of schemes is bewildering PRIVATE MEDICAL insurance is part of many remuneration packages. But if you have never needed to use it, it may be easy to overlook its value by the time you are offered early retirement. However, this is likely to happen at just the age when premiums start to rise steeply and you are increasingly likely to need to make a claim. Adjusting to the changed lifestyle of retirement can be stressful  - some newly retired people find their health collapses in the first few months. So how can you ensure that you do not lose the protection of private health care just when you may need it most? When you are negotiating your leaving package, avoid being so taken up with cash sums that you forget the fringe benefits. The annual premium for comprehensive private medical cover can be up to Pounds 1,000 for a 55-year-old, and Pounds 1,500 or more for a 65-year-old  - quite a chunk out of your pension if you have to find the money yourself. If your spouse also needs to be covered, premiums will be even higher. One bright spot is that private medical insurance premiums attract tax relief for UK residents aged over 60, though, to be eligible for this, the policy may need to be adapted  - for example, any cash benefits for stays in NHS hospitals are ruled out. When faced with early retirement, the first thing to do is check what your company can offer by way of continuing the medical cover that you have received during employment. Most employers should be able to continue cover until the annual renewal date for the corporate policy, giving you several months to look around for an alternative. Some companies will continue to provide health cover for pensioners in the group scheme, and pay for it throughout retirement, though this is an expensive option which only a few employers still offer. Changes to accounting standards will soon mean that companies have to allow for future health costs for pensioners on their balance sheets, which may make them more reluctant to extend cover. Other companies include pensioners in the company scheme, but only if they pay their own contributions. This can work out cheaper than arranging cover individually. The big advantage to staying with a company scheme is that the older you get, the more likely you are to have existing medical problems. If you join a new scheme, most insurers will exclude existing conditions, while one or two will cover some existing conditions but premiums will rise. Staying with the same insurer means that any problems will still be covered, at no extra cost  - this may be the only feasible option if you have made many claims in the past. A third possibility is that employers may have negotiated special terms with their insurer for former employees, but you have to arrange an individual policy. Check whether cover is treated as continuous, or you are treated as a new applicant and underwritten from scratch. If you have had any health problems, this could make it expensive. Company-arranged schemes can be good deals if you don't want the effort of shopping around, and the type of cover is what you want. However, if you suspect the premiums are higher than for comparative policies, or you think you would be happy with a more basic (and cheaper) level of cover, this could be the time to start looking elsewhere. If you have a husband or wife still at work, check whether it would be possible to get health cover through their employer. If the scheme is non-contributory, this would obviously be worthwhile. However, if your partner is also due to retire soon, you could just be postponing the problem. Going into retirement, you may be more interested in the peace-of-mind aspects of private medical insurance than the luxury hospital rooms and fine food offered by top-of-the-range policies. If you are mainly worried about long NHS waiting lists for non-urgent surgery, such as hip-replacement operations, you may be interested in the many low-cost healthcare policies on the market. However, low-cost policies come in many different guises. The two principal devices for reducing costs are cash limits: ie medical expenses are only covered up to Pounds 15,000 or a similar figure every year, or by limiting private treatment to cases when you would have to wait for more than six weeks for treatment under the NHS. Jan Lawson, of specialist advisers Private Health Partnership, says that both systems have their drawbacks. If there is a cash limit, it can be worrying to think that funds may run out half-way through your treatment should it be more complicated than expected, or that some major surgical procedures may not be covered. The six-week rule should mean that you will always get treatment within six weeks, whether on the NHS or privately. However, the six-week wait is usually counted from the day that a consultant says you need the operation. You may have to wait months, or even more than a year, for a consultant's appointment for some specialities in the NHS. If you opt for a six-week-rule policy, you may have to be prepared to pay for a private consultation yourself, or be faced with a long initial wait. Before you sign up for any policy, make sure you know that what is really necessary is covered, and don't be distracted by extras which aren't really necessary but make a policy look more comprehensive than it is. Jan Lawson gives a final word of warning: if you are choosing a new policy, don't just base your decision on the premiums for your age now. Look at the premium table for people five or 10 years older than yourself. Premiums can rise very steeply after the age of 60 with some insurers, almost doubling by the age of 65, so the best buy now may not be a good deal at all in a few years' time. You could be better off going for a slightly more expensive option now, with premiums which rise much more gradually.  -------------------------------------------------------                  SOME LOW-COST OPTIONS  -------------------------------------------------------                              Age 55         Age 65*  ------------------------------------------------------- Bupa Healthchoice**   Pounds 277.44   Pounds 310.77 Clinicare Club***     Pounds 419.88   Pounds 457.38***** Cornhill Option****   Pounds 592.32             n/a NU PersonalCare***    Pounds 170.43   Pounds 253.26 PPP Value**              Pounds 171   Pounds 242.82 WPA Spruce**          Pounds 195.70   Pounds 357.90*****  ------------------------------------------------------- *net of 25% tax relief; **6-week rule; ****cash limit; ***other exclusions; *****renewal only  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Bank base rates cut to 5.25%: Upbeat view on inflation prompts 1/4-point move - Bonds fall slightly The Bank of England signalled a surprise quarter of a percentage point cut in UK base rates to 5.25 per cent yesterday, as it published a generally positive report on the inflation outlook for the UK economy. Although some analysts were taken aback by the timing of the cut, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said that 'inflation has been lower than expected. Looking ahead inflationary pressures appear subdued. I have concluded that interest rates can be reduced modestly without putting at risk the inflation target'. Banks were quick to lower their base rates after the Bank of England announced a new minimum lending rate, but the quarter point cut, the smallest since 1985, will not be passed on to most homeowners. Leading lenders such as the Halifax, Abbey National and Nationwide said they would leave their mortgage rates, currently 7.64-7.74 per cent, unchanged. UK companies with loans linked to base rates should see some benefit. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the change, if passed on in full, would be worth Pounds 250m a year to British business. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'This step will help to settle confidence and is a move in the right direction.' Shares and government bonds - gilts - initially responded positively to the news. The FT-SE 100 index rose 52.6 points to 3,440.2 by mid-morning, almost eliminating Monday's losses, while long gilt prices rose by a point. But the market fell back as UK traders felt the government had acted unnecessarily and was using up its rate-cutting ammunition too quickly. The FT-SE 100 closed only 21.1 points higher at 3,440.2 and long gilts ended slightly down on the day. Sterling was hit by the change, falling 1 1/2 pfennigs in London from DM2.61 to DM2.595 and easing in New York to DM2.587. It fell a cent against the US dollar to Dollars 1.47 and closed slightly lower in New York at 1.467. The decision to cut rates was taken at the monthly monetary meeting on February 2 between the Bank governor, Mr Eddie George, and Mr Clarke. The timing was left to the Bank of England, which decided late last week that the rate change should coincide with the publication of the quarterly inflation report. The planned April tax increases played a part in the rate cut decision. The main factor, however, was the subdued inflationary outlook. The Bank said its core measure of inflation, known as RPIY, which excludes the effect of mortgage rates and indirect and local authority taxes, had fallen to 2.3 per cent in December. The Bank projects that RPIY will stay low - just above 2 per cent - for the next two years, although headline inflation will rise over the next few months as early 1993 mortgage rate cuts drop out of the index. The government's target measure of underlying inflation, called RPIX, which includes indirect taxes but excludes mortgage rates, will rise to reflect Budget tax changes and is projected at just over 3 per cent by end 1995. However the Bank says the risks to the low inflation view are 'asymmetric - a rise in underlying inflation seems more likely than a fall'. In the circumstances, a quarter point cut was seen as a prudent balance. Analysts were divided about the merits of the change. Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S G Warburg Securities, said there was 'precious little economic justification for a rate cut'. Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Global Economics and Strategy said he 'wouldn't be surprised if we see a series of cuts in Europe'.

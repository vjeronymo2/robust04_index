			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: For Kantor, the Motorola case says it all  -Michiyo Nakamoto and Nancy Dunne on US frustration at Japan's trade surplus For a country that is known for its fascination with high technology, Japan has been remarkably slow to catch on to the mobile telephone revolution that has swept through other parts of the world. Despite being the first country to introduce cellular phone services, Japan has fewer users of cellular phones as a proportion of the population than in any other industrialised country. Germany has acquired more cellular subscribers in the past two years, than Japan in the past 14. Many see the culprit as over-regulation that has led to a stifling lack of competition. The number of service providers has long been restricted and worse still, what competition that exists is largely kept out of the most attractive Tokyo-Nagoya region where population is concentrated. The announcement that the US would start a process of sanctions against Japan comes after an almost decade-long campaign by Motorola, the US industry leader which developed the product with AT&amp;T, to establish itself as a significant force in the Japanese mobile phones market. It follows a decision by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, that Japan had violated bilateral agreements to allow comparable market access to US mobile phones and equipment in the Japanese market. To Mr Kantor, the Motorola case goes a long way towards explaining Japan's Dollars 60bn trade surplus with the US. The difficulty the US has had in penetrating Japan's market, despite previous threats of sanctions followed by concessions on Japan's part, reflects 'a classic case of the determination of Japan to keep its markets closed, particularly to leading edge US products,' he said when he announced the decision to start a process of imposing trade sanctions on Japan. In agreements made over several years, Japan had promised the US to give Motorola an equal chance to compete with NTT, the Japanese telecoms group, by giving Motorola's cellular phone system the necessary radio frequency and infrastructure. But the history of Motorola's experience in Japan has been one of broken promises, the US claims. The dispute goes back to 1985 when the Japanese authorities decided to introduce a measure of competition into Japan's cellular phone market. Until then, NTT, which for long had a monopoly over telecommunications service, was the sole provider of mobile phone services and it was using a proprietary technology. The ministry of post and telecommunications agreed to allow other cellular providers to compete with NTT. But NTT was authorised to provide cellular service through the country, while two competitors - IDO and DDI - had to divide the market between them. The US took this opportunity to pressure Japan into accepting the use of a North American cellular phone technology known as TACS which was being used by Motorola. But while they acquiesced under US pressure and agreed to give Motorola a chance, the Japanese telecommunications authorities nevertheless kept Motorola's activities restricted by excluding the TACS system from the densely populated Tokyo-Nagoya region where growth of cellular phones could be expected to be highest. The MPT's first excuse was that it did not have enough radio frequency in that region to give to the TACS system. Then when it was discovered that frequency did in fact exist, the Japanese authorities devised a rather awkward compromise. IDO, a cellular phone operator which was competing with NTT in the Tokyo-Nagoya region, was given responsibility for building up the TACS system in the Tokyo-Nagoya region and 5Mhz of frequency was allocated to IDO for that purpose. The problem was that, IDO, though competing with NTT in that area, was doing so using NTT's proprietary cellular phone technology. IDO had already committed considerable sums to building up infrastructure based on that technology and therefore had little incentive to invest further in the TACS system. Over the next several years, according to Motorola, a horror story unfolded with IDO refusing to take delivery of Motorola equipment to build up the TACS infrastructure, and, once it did, failing to do anything with it. Motorola handsets in shops spanning the Tokyo-Nagoya region were, meanwhile, hidden from customers' sight, the US company has claimed. Instead of comparable market access, Motorola has faced persistent feet-dragging on the part of IDO in making investments in TACS infrastructure to allow coverage for the TACS system to equal coverage offered by NTT's mobile phones service. Today Motorola's phones can cover only 40 per cent of the Tokyo region, and its subscribers number only 12,900 in the area of 60m inhabitants, compared with over 310,000 customers for the rival NTT-compatible system. While IDO has said it will increase investment in the TACs infrastructure, this will only bring coverage up to 56 per cent in three years, compared with 95 per cent coverage for NTT already, Motorola says. This does not constitute 'comparable market access' that was promised to the US by the Japanese government, US officials say. Given the necessary infrastructure, Motorola is confident that it can compete effectively in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. In some parts of Japan where the TACS system has been able to compete fairly with NTT's system, it has taken 50 per cent market share compared with less than 2 per cent in the Tokyo-Nagoya market. But the issue is not just one of unfair market barriers. As in other trade disputes, the US argues that it is the Japanese consumer that ultimately will benefit from its insistence on fair market access for foreign products. The cost of using a cellular phone in Japan is two to three times that of other developed countries and effective competition is a proven way to bring prices down. While US calls for fair market access may grate on Japanese ears so soon after the collapse of bilateral trade talks, that is an argument that should win the applause of many a disgruntled Japanese consumer. Meanwhile while sanctions are drawn up, negotiations will continue. It is a good bet that Mr Kantor will insist on the kind of 'qualitative and quantitative indicators' Japan resisted in the broader framework talks. If such an agreement had been negotiated in the first place, he said on Tuesday, then it could have specified when the IDO would have infrastructure in place for Motorola's use, and what percentage of coverage Motorola could expect from base stations and switching systems. Mr Kantor will probably settle for such specifics, but will not ask for market share or guaranteed subscribers, thus avoiding charge that he is seeking to impose managed trade.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> 'HARMONIZING' WILL HANDCUFF FREE MARKETS;  </P> <P> THE BUREAUCRATIC PREROGATIVE HAS SHIFTED TO ECONOMIC INTERVENTION, THE NEW  SOCIALISM.  </P> <P> My colleague, Edward Luttwak, says that the waning of the Cold War means the  decline of geopolitics and the rise of geo-economics. The vast bureaucracies  that comprise the modern state and the intellectual resources organized in  universities and think tanks will find themselves "impelled by the bureaucratic  urges of role-preservation and role-enhancement to acquire a geo-economic  substitute for their decaying geopolitical role."  </P> <P> If he is right, it means that the West will experience a new onslaught of  economic intervention by the state. It is ironic that the collapse of socialism  has set in motion two opposite forces. On the one hand, socialist economic  failure has spurred privatization and renewed commitment to a market economy.  On the other, the decline of the communist geopolitical threat means that  Western bureaucracies and strategic thinkers will have to find a new  self-justification. Luttwak thinks that the bureaucratic imperative will shift  conflict to the arena of commerce.  </P> <P> The new socialism will hide behind a patriotic nationalism as foreigner-bashing  moves to the fore. Instead of defusing commercial conflicts in the interests of  geopolitical alliances, politicians and bureaucrats will be quick to politicize  them. The causes and instruments of conflict will become economic. Disguised  import restrictions, concealed subsidies, public funding of commercial  technologies and the manipulation of fiscal and regulatory measures to  disadvantage foreign competitors are among geo-economic weapons.  </P> <P> Much of this has been going on for years, but the decline of the Soviet threat  will unleash geo-economic rivalries within the Western alliance that were  formerly subdued by a common purpose. Industrial policy could come into its own  as bureaucracies, politicians and commercial interests engage in symbiotic  manipulation. As the state manages its geo-economic interests, profitability  will be less determined by market forces. If we are indeed entering an era of  geo-economics, economies will be increasingly characterized by rent-seeking  activities in which people use government to create protected profits that are  not subject to competition. Consumers everywhere will be the loser as  governments manipulate economies in the name of survival in a competitive  world.  </P> <P> The conventional wisdom today is that the Japanese have a head start in  geo-economic strategy and that we must rush to catch up. On the whole, the  policies that are adopted will work to stifle competition and increase the role  of privilege in our economic system. The world economies will suffer, just as  the punitive measures we imposed on foreign purchasers of U.S. real estate have  worsened the savings and loan problem.  </P> <P> Already we can see within the European Community a shift away from reliance on  market forces to harmonize national economic differences. Under the leadership  of the French socialist Jacques Delors, the new emphasis is on social  harmonization achieved through regulatory means. Social regulations designed to  equalize labor costs across national boundaries are a subtle form of  protectionism for the trade unions in the welfare democracies and French and  German business cartels.  </P> <P> Luttwak is right that a diminishing Soviet threat will give wider scope to  rent-seekers. But the battle between privilege and competition is as old as  economics itself, and each generation has to fight it. The other side of  communism's decline -- the failure of state interventionism -- together with  the dismal failure of development planning in the Third World, greatly  strengthens the case for free markets. All over the world people have lost  confidence in government and no longer associate more government with the  public interest.  </P> <P> Geo-economic rivalries could even work to free international businesses from  government controls. Just as international capital markets have made it harder  more difficult for national central banks to control domestic interest rates,  multinational companies are unlikely to come under the sway of national  governments. The free market itself is a powerful force, as the rise of  extensive informal economies in Latin America and the Soviet Union demonstrate.  As a result of 20th-Century experience, no honest intellectual can make a case  for more state interventionism.  </P> <P> As Mikhail Gorbachev recently said, the market economy "has existed for  centuries. It is an invention of civilization."  </P></p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Creditors of BCCI face long delay after ruling THOUSANDS OF creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International may face a delay of several more years before receiving any compensation for the millions they lost when the bank collapsed. This follows a surprise decision by the Luxembourg courts yesterday upholding an appeal against plans by the liquidators for an agreement with Abu Dhabi which could have led to a payout next year. The decision represented a victory for three individual creditors who have argued in the English and Luxembourg courts against the liquidators' agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank. It jeopardises the agreement by which Abu Dhabi would have contributed more than Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.12bn) to the liquidators for distribution to creditors, in exchange for a waiver of all legal claims against it. Mr Brian Smouha, one of three liquidators to BCCI appointed by the Luxembourg courts and the man who negotiated the agreement with Abu Dhabi, warned that the decision might trigger legal actions and delay payments for as much as 10 years. 'We were disappointed,' said Mr Smouha, a partner with accountants Touche Ross. 'This has caused there to be no money in the hands of the creditors. Now they can face only uncertainties.' Mr Keith Vaz, the opposition Labour MP who has championed the cause of BCCI creditors, called for the British government to intervene in bringing about a settlement. But Downing Street said the government was not a party to the hearing, and would not be involved in further legal action. Judge Raul Gretsch told the Luxembourg court of appeal: 'The appeal is justified and the liquidators have no right to sign an agreement.' The ruling has destroyed the prospect of a ballot by the liquidators of BCCI's estimated 530,000 creditors on their plans, which could have led to a payment of 15p in the pound to creditors next August. The Luxembourg liquidators are due to meet today to discuss their options. They will consider appealing the judgment, attempting to renegotiate with Abu Dhabi, or suing it to gain more money. But Mr Julien Roden, one of the Luxembourg liquidators, yesterday appeared to rule out an appeal. Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of the BCCI liquidators under English law, said: 'We think a very large number of creditors are going to be very upset. Those who have money may get more, but the vast number of creditors are suffering very greatly.' A brave face, Page 4</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Arts: Mixed feelings for Wagner as showbiz - Bayreuth Festival The first three offerings of this year's Bayreuth Festival comprise, among other things, a brisk and varied tour of current Wagner production styles. The new Tristan und Isolde (which I described on this page earlier in the week) is staged as a response - in most ways a coolly questioning, distancing, even disaffected one - to text quite as much as music by a modern German theatre intellectual, the noted playwright Heiner Muller. Tannhauser followed, in a revival of Wolfgang Wagner's own briskly efficient but essentially ugly and insubstantial show, a dim, ossified late-1980s reminiscence of the work he and (far more importantly) his brother Wieland were doing here two and three decades earlier. And then the revival of Der fliegende Hollander, produced by Dieter Dorn. This purveys the brand of zany 1990s theatrical legerdemain that we have learned (tentatively) to call postmodern: all flat planes, bright colour-contrasts, sleight-of-hand breaches of conventional proscenium-arch decorum, mobile parts sailing insouciantly around the stage space, and in general an air of 'naive', film-influenced theatricality that creates new modes of Wagner spectacle, entertainment and story-telling. I was put in mind by this Fliegender Hollander of the (sadly aborted) recent Scottish Opera Ring, produced by Richard Jones. The difference - British readers and opera-goers will hardly need telling - is that that was achieved on pence and ha'pence, whereas for Dorn's and designer Jurgen Rose's moving machines, and their Wizard of Oz-style rotation tricks during the Senta-Dutchman duet, mega-Deutschemark expenditure must have been the order of the day. The results are certainly enjoyable, breathtaking even - this is by a long way the most showbiz Wagner I have seen in the august Wagner temple (Peter Hall's elaborately aerial 1983 Ride of the Valkyries not excepted). Unlike the best of Richard Jones's Ring scenic inventions, however, the effects seemed devised only to dazzle. Little light was shed on the characters, who were brought on in countless striking ways (and costumes) but not meaningfully confronted. In Tannhauser Wolfgang at least concentrated his cast on expressive reaction and ensemble relationship; for all their period dress these Hollander figures belong to a world of sci-fi, comic-strip or cartoon video. Encountering in quick succession three such Bayreuth performances, in a theatre designed to aid the spectator in focusing on sounds, sights and meanings, had the consequence of eliciting from me some pretty old-fashioned operatic affirmations. In the end, of course, it is the most potent Wagner conducting and singing that win real results. After a while the whizz-bang visual pleasures of this Fliegende Hollander began to pall, because Giuseppe Sinopoli seemed largely unable to tap the springs of rhythmic vitality and colour in the music - he kept the surface active, left the interior unexplored. (Pit and stage were often out of kilter.) And Bernd Weikl (title role) and Sabine Hass (a blowzy-toned Senta with powerful, sometimes hideously ugly notes at the top of the staff) emitted the text in bits and pieces, bumps and thumps - not lines and phrases. Tannhauser, by contrast, had a conductor - Donald Runnicles - who knew how to keep all the opera's parts in flowing, smoothly interlocked, dramatically acute action, even the opera's inherently cumbersome, creaky, long-winded parts. The singing was acceptable rather than distinguished, apart from a wonderfully rounded, full-grained Landgrave from the veteran bass Hans Sotin (his Daland was also by miles the best thing about the Hollander), but at least it was always directed toward tapping the expressive potential of the musical phrases. Here are a couple more old-fashioned affirmations. The choral singing, trained by Norbert Balatsch, was in both early Wagner operas of incomparably fine quality: robust, resonant, single-minded in delivery. Precisely purposeful, thorough-going preparation characterised it - and, indeed, characterised all three opening shows. The festival ethic remains very much alive and well in Bayreuth: for this reason, and in spite of all the mixed feelings the place and its raison d'etre inspire, a visit here is always a special experience. Festival continues until August 28.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME BOMBS ON THE STREETS;  </P> <P> MENTAL HEALTH: OUR COUNTY JAIL HOUSES MORE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THAN THE LARGEST  HOSPITAL. TREATMENT IS ESSENTIAL.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Jail has become the largest unofficial mental hospital  in the United States. According to professionals who have worked there, 15% of  the jail's approximately 24,000 prisoners -- 3,600 individuals -- are seriously  mentally ill with schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness. Those individuals  total 641 more than are held in America's largest medical facility for the  mentally ill, Pilgrim State Hospital in New York. The 3,600 mentally ill  individuals in the Los Angeles County Jail are, in fact, the same number as the  total held in California's four state hospitals (Napa, Patton, Camarillo and  Metropolitan). Each day, seven days a week, approximately 1,000 new prisoners  are booked into the Los Angeles County Jail, of which 150 are seriously  mentally ill; there is no other psychiatric facility in the world that admits  150 new patients each day.  </P> <P> The situation in Los Angeles is part of a national trend, one of the  consequences of having abolished 80% of all state mental hospital beds since  1955 without adequate follow-up and outpatient care for patients being  released.  </P> <P> America's jails and public shelters have become the new mental hospitals.  Several studies in different parts of the country have shown that approximately  10% of all jail inmates and 30% of all public shelter residents suffer from  schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness. These are now known to be disorders  of the brain, like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's  disease.  </P> <P> The situation in Los Angeles County is more serious because its public  mental-health services have for many years been among the worst in California.  Budget cuts within the last year have decimated outpatient services and pushed  the system to the point of collapse. Even the nationally recognized Skid Row  Mental Health Clinic at Sixth and San Pedro streets has lost half of its staff  within the last year. In October, for the first time, the clinic no longer had  the staff to run outreach teams to treat homeless mentally ill people living on  the streets and in the parks; many of these untreated individuals will end up  in County Jail.  </P> <P> Most individuals with serious mental illnesses are not dangerous if they are  treated; studies have shown that the crime rate for the treated mentally ill is  lower than that for the general population. If they are not treated, however,  some individuals with mental illnesses do become violent. They do so because  they believe that others may be trying to hurt them so they strike first, or  they may be ordered by "voices" -- auditory hallucinations -- to commit violent  acts. Or they may simply be so confused that they are unable to act logically.  </P> <P> In 1983, Dr. Richard Lamb at the University of Southern California followed up  85 seriously mentally ill persons in Los Angeles County who had been charged  with crimes. Of this group, 92% had been arrested for felonies (the majority  for murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery and assault with a deadly  weapon) and 86% had had previous psychiatric hospitalizations. Yet two years  after their arrests, 64% had been released and, in more than half of the cases,  there were no plans for follow-up or treatment.  </P> <P> The situation is significantly worse now than it was in 1983. Each day, seven  days a week, the Los Angeles County Jail releases approximately 150 seriously  mentally ill individuals who have been charged with crimes. There is nowhere to  refer them for outpatient care because the county clinics are already full.  Families are often frightened of them, knowing that these people will  deteriorate without their necessary medications.  </P> <P> The situation in Los Angeles County is on a collision course with catastrophe.  Violent episodes are not merely threats or probabilities, they are statistical  certainties. And the greatest tragedy of all is that such episodes are  completely preventable.  </P></p>

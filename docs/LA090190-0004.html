			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN, WILSON CAMPAIGNS FOR GOVERNOR  </P> <P> The debate over who did what in the S&amp;L debacle is a subordinate issue in  the contest for California's governorship.  </P> <P> My concern is "Republicanism."  </P> <P> Years of promoting and provoking anti-women, anti-minority, anti-civil rights  and liberties, anti-peace, anti-self-determinism, anti-consumer legislation,  policies and attitudes in Washington and Sacramento have solidified my  determination to avoid any candidate, local or national, who choses to label  him/herself Republican.  </P> <P> LOUIS ST.

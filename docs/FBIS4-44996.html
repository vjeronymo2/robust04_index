			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Nabil Fahmi by Muhammad 'Allam in </F> Cairo; date not given: "Israeli Arms Policies Geared for  Conflict, Not Peace"--first two paragraphs are AL-HAYAH  introduction]    [Text] Ambassador Nabil Fahmi, head of the Egyptian  delegation to the arms limitation committee of the multiparty  talks and political advisor to the Egyptian foreign minister,  has confirmed that Egypt will not accept Israeli military  supremacy, from fear of a military confrontation caused by any  dispute that may occur. He indicates that Egypt is monitoring  Israel's weapons policies and notices that they "are still  geared for conflict, not peace."    He warns, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, of the danger of  American arms exceeding the limits of a country's legitimate  security needs, saying, "When we reach the point of supremacy,  and an upset in the balance, then we have reached a point of  danger." He reaffirmed that a continued arms race would lead to  a political shock in the Middle East, and warned of the  likelihood of a confrontation that could result in damaging the  interests of the lesser militarily-superior country.    The text of the interview follows:    ['Allam] What are the ramifications of the peace process on  the armament needs of Egypt and other countries in the region?  Are the factors and motives that defined the quantity and type  of arms in the past now pass&eacute;, with the advent of a  comprehensive peace?    [Fahmi] Neither Egypt nor any Arab state can accept exposing  themselves to danger; this is something we insist upon. The  relevant parties must take whatever steps they see as necessary  in this regard, because the requirements for legitimate defense  are a principled requirement, and absolutely cannot be tampered  with.    I believe there is no contradiction between maintaining the  essentials for legitimate defense, and arms limitation and  regional security. On the contrary, these two movements are  congruent, as the concept of peace is based on the balance of  security needs. The positions and commitments support each  country's securing its national interests, and handling their  security needs, in a framework suitable to its economic and  social requirements. At the same time, we hope that among the  results of peace will be a reduction in the tension in this  region and a curb on the tendency of some countries to compete  in arming themselves, developing arsenals, and introducing  various new weapons systems.    ['Allam] Egypt's motives for arming itself may have changed,  but Israel's policies are not geared to a change in motives or  the possibility of changing in the future.    [Fahmi] We are monitoring Israel's arms policies, and we  hope  that these policies will evolve in conformity with the concept  of peace. We see no logic or justification calling for military  supremacy over a neighbor or neighbors, in the context of peace.  Every party must review its concept of security in a way suited  to the circumstances of peace and the changes that will occur in  this region.    ['Allam] Egypt proposes the principle of equality of  balance.  What is the concept of balance for Egypt--between Israel and  every Arab party individually, or between Israel and the Arabs  as a geographical bloc?    [Fahmi] Prior to the peace process, there were unacceptable  pretexts for the balance of Israel's military power with Arab  military capabilities, as it was an invitation to an arms race.  After the process, and the positive progress it has achieved on  all tracks, albeit slowly, we can find absolutely no  justification for the continuation of these invitations, rooted  in the theory of conflict. The aim of the talks in the committee  for arms limitation is a balance of security and equality of  commitments among neighboring countries, regardless of whether  they are Arab countries bordering other Arabs, or between Arab  countries and Israel or other countries. Egypt does not believe  in the philosophy of balancing blocs versus one state.    ['Allam] There will be, within one year, a conference on  "expanding the validity of the nuclear proliferation treaty."  Will Egypt sign up to expand the validity or link it to Israel's  signing the treaty, as is the case with the chemical weapons  nonproliferation treaty?    [Fahmi] We must look positively about the conference, to  encourage the other countries of the region to join it, instead  of looking upon it as a group to confront. Egypt calls upon the  countries of the region, including Israel, to join the treaty,  as matters will be assessed in light of it in time. It is not  rational or understandable for any country to maintain the right  to obtain a certain weapon or remain outside the system of  banning certain arms, as long as its neighbors also join,  especially as any arms limitation accord in any field would be  based on a balance of power and of rights, and the congruence of  legal commitments among neighboring countries. Egypt's cautious  position as regards joining the treaty for banning chemical  weapons is the result of the failure of a certain country to  move towards compliance with our security demands, or to take  into consideration some things that worry us in the area of  securing our interests.    ['Allam] Is Egypt disturbed by the fact that some countries  of the region are still in the arms race, which could some day  lead to hostile tendencies, and thus a move to build a defense  and deterrent force, meaning that the multiparty talks are  futile?    [Fahmi] Egypt does not accept that a neighboring country be  militarily superior to it, because this increases the likelihood  that that neighboring country would in the future resort to arms  in the event of a political dispute, and lest circumstances or a  limited dispute escalate into a military confrontation ending in  damaging the interests of the lesser militarily-superior  country. Thus the continuation of the arms race would inevitably  lead to instability and weakened security, and expose the region  to a political shock.    ['Allam] Are conventional weapons still Egypt's major  alternative in the event Israel persists in refusing to sign the  nuclear nonproliferation treaty?    [Fahmi] Conventional weapons comprise the basic component in  guaranteed legitimate defense, according to the United Nations  charter. We hope that these weapons will remain the basic  systems, meaning that we do not want things to go farther, with  any country in the region beginning to introduce the nuclear  factor into its security calculations. This would lead to a  security imbalance that would be very hard to correct, and we do  not believe that there is any chance for arms limitation  measures or security arrangements if any country in the region  retains the nuclear option.    ['Allam] Does Egypt think that the United States, the major  supplier of arms to the countries of the Third World, will have  a role in stopping the arms race?    [Fahmi] Some countries obtain their arms from the United  States and other countries, and these are legitimate security  needs. But when when we reach the point of supremacy, and an  upset in the balance, then we have reached a point of danger,  linked not only to the arms a country imports, but to other  factors, such as local production and military capability.    This is the responsibility of the United States, in arms  limitation and regional arrangements in the Middle East, as the  major sponsor of the peace process. I do not, however, agree  with the attempts of some to assess the security of any country  based solely on the arms it purchases. It is not possible to  deal with this topic by banning the importation or sale of arms;  we must look at all aspects, such as the country's capacity to  manufacture arms and what it imports, as well as the types of  these arms, and the arms it exports to other countries.    ['Allam] The Cairo meetings last December, between rounds of  the arms limitation talks, turned up disputes in points of  view--what are they? What are the major topics to be at the Doha  meeting?    [Fahmi] There were differences, but not disputes. This is  natural, as the meetings are part of the first phase of  negotiations in this area. They came up in the area of the  committee's work priorities, as some countries focused on  confidence-building measures such as contacts, exchange of  information, and arrangements regarding military forces. Other  countries, mostly Arab countries, including Egypt, saw no  contradiction between the pursuance of confidence-building  measures and the initiation of the arms limitation process now.    Despite these differences, the Cairo meeting was positive  and  constructive. Progress was made towards agreement on a regional  security declaration, and arms limitation, including special  principles for security and arms limitation, and its priorities  and ultimate objectives. We hope to reach a final agreement on  this declaration in the Doha meetings.    ['Allam] Will the Arab joint defense accord be nullified if  regional security arrangements are reached in the multiparty  talks?    [Fahmi] With the development of circumstances in the region,  we will find ways of reconciling the new arrangements with the  existing ones. There are numerous ways, not only this  agreement--measures that support each other as long as they tend  to defend legitimate and legal positions and principles. The  matter of canceling the agreement concerns only the member  states of the Arab League, and will be studied, as these states  see this in the context of the League and not of the arms  limitation committee.</p>

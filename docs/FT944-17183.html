			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Taking the reins at AlliedSignal Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive and one of the leading executives in the US automotive components industry, is leaving the group to 'pursue career interests' outside the company, writes Kevin Done. He is to be replaced by John Barter, who has been senior vice president and chief financial officer of the AlliedSignal group since 1988 and has headed the company's planning, development and administration functions. Reins has worked for many leading US components suppliers including Rockwell International, ITT Automotive, where he was chief executive from 1987 to 1989, and United Technologies Automotive, where he was president from 1990 to 1991. Between 1989 and 1990 he was chief executive of Mack Trucks, the US heavy truck-maker which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renault of France. Reins has led a significant turnround of AlliedSignal's automotive operations, which had a turnover of Dollars 4.5bn last year accounting for around 38 per cent of total group turnover of Dollars 11.8bn.</p>

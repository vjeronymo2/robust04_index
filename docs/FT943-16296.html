			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Carclo shows 50% advance to Pounds 12.9m Carclo Engineering boosted pre-tax profits by 50 per cent, from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds 12.9m, for the 12 months to March 31 1994. The Sheffield-based steel and specialist engineering concern is raising its final dividend from 6.8p to 7.2p. The sharp rise in profits was due mainly to a stronger than expected performance at Arthur Lee, the steel and plastic products group acquired in June last year. As a consequence, group turnover jumped by 81 per cent, from Pounds 84.4m to Pounds 153m. During the period, which included the pre-acquisition period, the Arthur Lee division lifted operating profit by 66 per cent to Pounds 7.3m on an 11 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 84.3m. The best performance among the Lee businesses was in steel wire, where improved margins contributed to a trebling of operating profit to Pounds 1.5m. Steel profits more than doubled to Pounds 3.9m, but plastics profits fell 8 per cent to Pounds 1.8m. The performance of Carclo's other main businesses was mixed. The card clothing division suffered a 24 per cent fall in operating profit to Pounds 2.4m, reflecting continuing recession in the textile industry. The wire division, in contrast, lifted profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 2m, while general engineering profits improved by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.9m. The increased final dividend takes the total for the year to 9.1p (8.6p), covered 1.73 times by earnings per share ahead from 14.6p to 15.7p in spite of a sharply increased share capital. Year-end net borrowing, at Pounds 2.2m, amounted to 3.1 per cent of shareholders' funds, which increased from Pounds 45m to Pounds 71m during the year. Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the enlarged group's order intake in opening quarter of the current year compared favourably with the same period a year ago, in spite of difficult trading conditions in some markets.</p>

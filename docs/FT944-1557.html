			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Japan makes slow progress Japan's campaign against costly economic regulations is starting to make slow progress for the first time in reducing the jungle of government red tape, William Dawkins writes. The number of official permits and licences needed to do business in Japan, or simply live there, fell by 457, or 4 per cent, to 10,945 in the year to last March, reported the Management and Co-ordination Agency. It is the first drop recorded since 1985. Progress is slow because new regulations emerge nearly half as fast as old ones are scrapped. Last year, for example, 829 permits were abolished, while 372 new ones were issued. However, the pace of abolition may be increasing: 506 were scrapped in February and March alone, under a deregulation plan launched by former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa.</p>

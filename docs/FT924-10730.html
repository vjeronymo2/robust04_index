			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Montreal's exciting 'Musici' - Concert The 14-strong string orchestra, I Musici de Montreal, is new on the international scene - inaugurated in 1983 but only now launched on its first-ever European tour. After a brief visit to its home city last April David Murray relayed his enthusiasm for the band to FT readers. Tuesday's concert at St John's, Smith Square, allowed us to share that enthusiasm: it was a big, heartening success. The name may be silly and pretentious (why the Italo-French mixture?) but everything else about the orchestra leaves an impression of remarkable directness, authority and distinct personality. The performances, all strongly defined, gain their particular character from an unstinting vitality in the fat-free corporate sound and the urgent involvement of every player in producing that sound. I Musici de Montreal were formed by the Russian emigre cellist Yuly Turovsky, who conducts with a baton when not playing as cello soloist. He is a passionately excitable musician: he encouraged his players to deliver Schoenberg's string sextet Verklarte Nacht (in its orchestral expansion) across a dramatically wide dynamic range - from all-but-inaudible soft phrases to vibrant loud - and with a full-frontal boldness of attack that most British groups would find hard to equal. It was all a touch swoony and splurgy, lacking both the soft-grained warmth and the unforced approach to musical unfolding that we tend to think of as natively Viennese; but, taken on its own terms, it afforded a thrilling experience. The account of the Tchaikovsky Souvenirs de Florence can be similarly described - the slow-movement dialogue between solo violin (Eleonora Turovsky, wife of the conductor and leader of the orchestra) and cello was squeezed out with stop-start pacing and throbbingly intense tone, but here the style seemed much more naturally idiomatic. Three arrangements of Bloch pieces (by whom?) for cello solo and strings, in which the rapport between Turovsky and his accompanists was beautifully demonstrated, and a trimly cut Adagio and Rondo by the Canadian Jacques Hetu rounded out an excellently varied programme. European tour of I Musici de Montreal assisted by the Government of Canada and the Culutral Affairs Ministry of the Province of Quebec; St John's, Smith Square concert supported by Teleglobe)</p>

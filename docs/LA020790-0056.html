Larry  Jerome Johnson, 48, was arrested when he arrived at the local Ventura County  sheriff's station to pick up belongings he left after his first arrest, Lt.  Bill Montijo said.  </P> <P> A search of his house uncovered one gram or less of cocaine, Montijo said.  Johnson was jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail, the lieutenant said. Johnson was  first arrested Jan. 31 after his principal told deputies the teacher was  behaving strangely. Johnson, a business and math teacher, said in an interview  after that arrest that he had not taken cocaine at school, but admitted using  the drug off-campus.  </P></p>

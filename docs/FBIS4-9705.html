			<p>BFN     [Text] We have a report from our agency, the Fides News  Agency, on Carmelo Meco Dominguez' testimony that we think our  listeners should hear.    The U.S. Embassy and the DEA tried to involve former  President Jaime Paz Zamora in drug trafficking in 1990 by  violently torturing Carmelo Meco Dominguez, seeking to force him  to incriminate the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left]  leadership in trafficking activities.    This revelation was made public yesterday when MIR Deputy  Mario Rueda Pena released a tape of a recorded voluntary  declaration by Meco Dominguez at the La Paz Departmental Command  of the Special Antinarcotics Force on 1 October 1990.    Meco says in his voluntary deposition that a few days before  1 October he was kidnapped from his home by U.S. agents who  tortured him violently, seeking to get him to accuse the  then-President Jaime Paz Zamora and other MIR leaders of  involvement in drug trafficking.    Could this be just a show organized by the DEA with  information obtained through torture? It is a very serious  accusation. Legislators should ask Meco Dominguez during his  testimony at the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon if the  accusations against Jaime Paz Zamora were obtained through  torture. The press must report everything. We do not want  stories here, and least of all stories about gringos who torture  people. Do you not agree? They can torture in their country if  they want, but not in ours.</p>

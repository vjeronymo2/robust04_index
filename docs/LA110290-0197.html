			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BREEDERS CROWN;  </P> <P> DRIVER COMPETES WITH PEACE CORPS FOR CHANGE OF PACE  </P> <P> Driver John Campbell will get his first look at Peace Corps tonight, and it  could be from farther back than he is accustomed to.  </P> <P> In her last start in the United States, Campbell was in Peace Corps' sulky when  she won the Breeders Crown 3-year-old Filly Trot on Oct. 27, 1989, at Pompano  Harness. In 1988, Campbell drove her to victory in the Breeders Crown  2-year-old Filly Trot.  </P> <P> Tonight, Campbell will drive Free Token against Peace Corps in the Mare Trot,  one of eight Breeders Crown races on the Pompano program.  </P> <P> "If she's anything like last year, she'll be very tough to beat," Campbell said  of Peace Corps, who is owned by Bjorn Pettersson of Sweden and who is driven  and trained by Swede Stig Johansson.  </P> <P> "She's just a great, great mare. She's got tremendous desire."  </P> <P> Johansson bought the New Jersey-bred Peace Corps for a reported $1.6 million in  January, 1989, and kept her in the United States where she became Trotter of  the Year with a record of 16 wins and one second in 19 starts and earnings of  $1,002,701.  </P> <P> After her victory in the Breeders Crown 3-year-old Filly Trot, Peace Corps was  taken to Sweden. In 12 starts this year in that country, Norway and France, she  posted a record of eight wins and three seconds.  </P> <P> In her first start abroad, Peace Corps came off a six-month layoff to finish  second to the great Mack Lobell in Sweden's most prestigious race, the  Elitlopp.  </P> <P> In her last start, Oct. 13 at Sweden's Aby Racetrack, she beat Sorrento, the  leading Soviet trotter.  </P> <P> When she beat colts in the 1989 World Trotting Derby in a time of 1:52 4/5 on a  one-mile track at DuQuoin, Ill., she became the second-fastest trotter in  history, after Mack Lobell.  </P> <P> While Peace Corps tries to become the third horse to win three Breeders' Crown  races, Beach Towel will try to become the first harness racehorse to win $2  million in a single year.  </P></p>

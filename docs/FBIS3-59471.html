The decision, adopted by the Slovenian government  at a session on January 13, means that Slovenia no longer pays  its outstanding liabilities directly to the account of  Commercial Banks in New York, but instead accumulates the money  in its special account.    The government decided to take this step following the  unsuccessful negotiations with the Consortium. The Consortium  was not prepared to accept Slovenia's proposal to pay off 16.4  percent (US $500 million) of the total former Yugoslavia's US  $4,200 million debt. While other financial institutions, such as  the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club, were in  favour of the assessed 16.4 percent Slovenian share in the total  Yugoslav debt, the Consortium insisted on the solidarity clause,  to which the former Yugoslav republics bound themselves when  they took out the loans. The Consortium insists that Slovenia  should pay off $1,200 million, which is 28 percent of the joint  Yugoslav debt. Slovenia will be channeling the money, intended  for repaying outstanding liabilities to the Consortium of  Commercial Banks, to its special account in Luxembourg until the  two parties reach an agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Flavio Cotti, head of the Chief Department </F> of Foreign Affairs, and Kaspar Villiger, head of the Chief  Department of Military, by Thomas Haeberling and Bruno Lezzi;  place and date not given: "`Blue Helmets Strengthen Foreign  Policy Qualities of Neutrality'"]    [Excerpt] On 12 June, the Swiss will decide in a  referendum on the bill on blue helmet missions. In an interview  with NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG, Defense Minister Villiger and  Foreign Minister Cotti explain why, for reasons of security and  foreign policy, the federal law on the participation of Swiss  Forces in peacekeeping operations deserves to be supported. The  interview with the two ministers was conducted by Thomas  Haeberling and Bruno Lezzi.    [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Why should Switzerland participate  with troops in UN and later maybe even CSCE peacekeeping  operations?    [Villiger] Blue helmets do not wage war but give peace a  chance wherever arms remain silent, where there is a truce, or  where a conflict has not yet erupted. UN peacekeeping forces  have been a tried and tested instrument to fulfill this task for  30 years. This is also absolutely clearly in the interest of  our country. I am thinking, for example, of the preventive  stationing of troops in Macedonia; after all, if a conflict were  to break out there, we would be bound to receive large numbers  of refugees. Tasks of security policy, which directly benefit  also Switzerland, cannot generally be left to others in the long  run, particularly since I am convinced that small neutral  countries are destined for credible mediating functions.    [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Mr. Cotti, how do you see this  issue?    [Cotti] From the foreign policy point of view I can only  support what Mr. Villiger said. Blue helmets are a new form of  good services, which has become even more topical over the past  few years -- quite certainly also in connection with the fall of  communism, which I would like to describe as something like a  geological stratum. This geological stratum suppressed latent  conflicts in many parts of the world; they could not erupt. The  danger of a worldwide nuclear conflict has certainly diminished,  but there are many more very cruel local conflicts. This is why  demand for these services has increased.    [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] The opponents to this bill sometimes  claim that in many cases blue helmets are useless. Let us take  Somalia or the former Yugoslavia as examples. It has been  claimed that the blue helmets have even created additional  problems. What is your reaction to that?    [Villiger] This is simply not consistent with the facts. It  is obvious that not every UN action has been successful.  Failures aside, there is an impressive series of successes.  The arguments brought forth by the opponents are biased because  they always mention those countries where something is going  wrong at the moment, whereas they fail to talk of those actions  of obvious benefit. Moreover, blue helmets do very useful work  in the humanitarian sphere, save lives, and secure the supply of  vital goods. Of the current 17 UN missions, only three are  taking place in combat areas. It is symptomatic that successful  blue helmet missions do not make headlines or get any television  coverage because they do not offer any reports that are out of  the ordinary.    [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Mr. Cotti, one subject that always  gives rise to debate is our neutrality. Will Swiss blue helmets  threaten our foreign policy maxim or, put differently, will  neutrality be undermined through Swiss participation in blue  helmet operations, and might not its function as a security  strategy be lost in the event of a change of the strategic  situation?    [Cotti] Not only are blue helmets compatible with  neutrality, but in a new overall political environment,  neutrality even demands a service such as the blue helmets.  That it is compatible with neutrality is more than obvious.  Mr. Villiger has said that before. Swiss blue helmets would  only be sent to places with the agreement of all parties to the  conflict who would have to ask for our presence. We would never  go anywhere against the will of any party. The condition of  nonpartisanship has to be fulfilled. Mr. Villiger quite rightly  said that no country can more rightfully be regarded as  nonpartisan than a neutral one. We have rendered good services  in many instances: with UN observers, election observers, and  with functions such as those being looked after by Colonel  Arbenz or Ambassador Brunner. Against the background of the  great demand for peacekeeping missions, blue helmets are nothing  but the normal, updated implementation of our policy of  neutrality.    [NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG] Does this apply to the sphere of  security policy, too?    [Villiger] I would like to clearly emphasize what Mr. Cotti  said. History proves the importance of this view. Up to 1990,  it was neutral countries that bore the main burden of blue  helmet missions: Sweden, Finland, Austria. And in those 30  years nobody even had the faintest doubts about the neutrality  of these three countries. This allows us to conclude that blue  helmet operations strengthen the foreign policy qualities of  neutrality. [passage omitted]</p>

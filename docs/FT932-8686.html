			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / People: Briton's pivotal Brussels job Responsibility for making the five-month-old single European market work has fallen to a 49-year-old Briton, John Mogg. He has just taken over as head of the European Commission's directorate-general for the internal market and financial services, working under the new Italian commissioner Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi. Mogg replaces Geoffrey Fitchew, another Briton, who had been the man behind the investment services and capital adequacy directives. While Mogg is expected to continue implementing these measures, the responsibilities of the so-called DG15, which used solely to look after financial services, have been extended. The arrival of a new set of Commissioners, together with a reshuffle of the permanent departments, means that the barrier-free single market, which came into effect on January 1, also comes under Mogg's wing. However, he is no stranger to that sector, having spent the last three years as deputy director-general of the old internal market and industry department. Mogg had been tipped to take over the DG15 post since the beginning of the year, but the political complexities of senior Commission appointments meant he could only be confirmed in the position two weeks ago. The UK government, which places great importance on the implementation of the single market and the liberalisation of the financial services sector, had lobbied hard to put a British national in the job. Mogg is a relative newcomer to the Commission. Until 1990, he had been a senior national civil servant in the Department of Trade and Industry and the Cabinet Office, although he served as First Secretary at the UK's permanent representation to the EC in Brussels between 1979 and 1982. Fitchew, meanwhile, has returned to London to head the European secretariat of the Cabinet Office. Mogg was deputy head of the same unit before joining the Commission.</p>

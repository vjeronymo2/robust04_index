			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Foreign investment projects in Hungary top Dollars 3bn The value of foreign investment projects in Hungary topped Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) by the middle of this year, and companies with foreign participation have become a dominant force in the national economy, according to the UN Economic Commission for Europe*. They now account for a fifth of all Hungarian enterprises and a sixth of total value added. However, their overall performance has been poor, with net profits in the latest year down two-thirds from the previous year, the ECE says. This reflected generally difficult trading conditions in Hungary; Hungarian companies without foreign investment suffered an even sharper decline. Most of the losses were in manufacturing, which accounts for 55 per cent of all overseas investment in Hungary, concentrated in the food and tobacco, textiles and clothing industries. The biggest investors in Hungary, which remains the largest single recicpient of foreign capital in eastern and central Europe, are Germany (18.4 per cent), Austria (18 per cent) and Belgium (16 per cent). The US accounts for about 5 per cent of the total. East-West Investment News, No. 3, Autumn 1993. Available from UN Publications, Palais des Nations, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland</p>

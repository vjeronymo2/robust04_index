			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Rome in retreat on steel debts ITALY has bowed to pressure from the European Commission and withdrawn plans to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) of debts incurred by Ilva, the state steel-maker. The Italian government's retreat offers a reprieve to the Commission's ambitious plans to restructure the tottering European steel industry. The Ilva case remains central to the EC-wide rescue plan. Earlier this month, the Commission invoked rarely used powers to order Ilva to suspend its planned write-off of past debt. The Italian government has since informed the Commission that it is withdrawing its rescue plan. Italy has until August 14 to put forward further arguments in favour of state aid, while the Commission has reserved the right to take the matter to the Council of Ministers. EC officials warned yesterday that it is too early to declare victory in the battle to limit state aid to the steel industry, particularly in Italy and Spain. But in an effort to retain the initiative, the Commission is expected to agree today to set up a loan scheme to persuade EC steel makers to cut 30m tonnes in capacity. The Commission has been discussing the scheme informally with steel companies for several months. The loans would be made available at a favourable rate to groups of companies which agree to pool funds to finance capacity cuts.</p>

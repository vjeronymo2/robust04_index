			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Eyes focus on the construction industry - Survey points to an increase in takeover and merger activity over the next 12 months More than a fifth of contractors and building material companies expect to be involved in acquisitions, mergers or joint ventures during the next 12 months, according to an industry survey published today in New Builder magazine. The survey asked managing directors and chief executives of 180 companies about their intentions on staffing, merger activity and financing over the next year. It included most of the 20 largest contractors and building material suppliers in the UK. Twenty nine per cent of contractors, 20 per cent of building material companies and 27 per cent of housebuilders expected to be involved in mergers, joint ventures or acquisitions. Takeover activity is expected to rise sharply as the industry moves out of recession and companies move to widen skills, increase their market share and reduce capacity in the sector by purchasing financially weaker rivals. Travis Perkins, the builders' merchant, yesterday announced the purchase for Pounds 41.8m of the building merchants' interests of AAH - increasing by more than a quarter the number of outlets it operates from. Taylor Woodrow, the large construction and property group, last month paid Pounds 30.8m to buy Heron's housebuilding operations. Chief executives of Wimpey, the contractor and housebuilder, Rugby, the cement group, and Marley, the building materials company, announcing annual results this week, signalled that they are also prepared to make acquisitions - taking advantage of improved balance sheets and better trading conditions in the UK and US. Housebuilders such as Beazer, Persimmon, Redrow and Wainhomes - currently involved in share issues likely to total more than Pounds 700m - have also not ruled out acquisitions as a means of increasing their land holdings. Rationalisation of the brick industry is long overdue with companies like Ibstock Johnsen, which has struggled during the recession, a potential candidate for takeover or merger. Builders' merchants are expected to be particularly aggressive following the Pounds 210m float announced recently by Graham Group, currently part of BTR, the industrial conglomerate.</p>

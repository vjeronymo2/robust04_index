			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Councils hope for rebate over BCCI LOCAL authorities that lost money when BCCI collapsed still hope the government will agree to compensate them for at least part of their loss. Thirty councils in Britain lost a total of Pounds 83m when the Bank of England closed BCCI in July last year. The biggest loser was Western Isles Council, which lost Pounds 23m. The second-biggest was Bury Council, which lost Pounds 6m. Mr David Pine, a solicitor with Eversheds Alexander Tatham of Manchester, which represents the councils and some public utilities affected by BCCI, said his clients took heart from damning comments about the Bank of England in the report about the BCCI collapse from Lord Justic Bingham. Mr Pine said: 'We're hoping that, as in the Barlow Clowes case, the government will recognise that there has been negligence and accept its obligation to pay creditors.' In that case, investors received from the government 90 per cent of the money they had lost. He said he hoped the government would make a compensation payment to the liquidators of BCCI in addition to any compensation received from Abu Dhabi. Mr Rory Mair, chief executive of Ross &amp; Cromarty Council and spokesman for all the affected councils, said the Commons Treasury committee had concluded in its report on BCCI last December that if the Bank of England were found to have failed to discharge its supervisory duties, the losses incurred need not be met by local authorities or their poll tax payers. 'The Bingham report confirms that the Bank has indeed failed in its responsibilities,' he said. However, the Treasury said yesterday that there was no question of special government compensation.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / How To Spend It: Fantasy world of a rebel designer - Koji Tatsuno turns ordinary clothes into specialities WHEN Koji Tatsuno was at school in Tokyo, he wore the same military uniform as every other Japanese schoolboy. From the outside, he looked like his classmates, but inside he had embroidered a red dragon on his jacket lining. Tatsuno now has a broader canvas to draw on. The boy who customised his school uniform in 1970s' Tokyo has become one of the most inventive fashion designers in Europe today. Tatsuno treats fashion as fantasy. His clothes are extraordinary creations of fabulous fabrics, pleated silk jackets and waistcoats in Victorian-style tapestry, finished with shell buttons or tiny pearls. This winter's collection oozes opulence with silks and velvets. For summer, he has used materials on hand - pieces of cloth left over in his studio, leaves from the garden, even strips of salmon skin. The effect is exquisite and individualistic. The designs are not conceived as part of co-ordinated collections, but as particular pieces to be worn by different people. The cast list of his customers - from ascetic art collector Doris Saatchi to entertainer Diana Ross - reflects this. But all his clients will wear, and re-wear, their Tatsuno for years. 'If something is made properly, it should age,' he says. 'I would hate to think of people buying my clothes to wear them for a year and to throw them away. Clothes have lives of their own. The shape of a garment and the feel of the fabric change. Anything I make today should look completely different in five or six years time.' Tatsuno, 29, is a slight man with long, silky black hair, wearing not one, but two, polo-necks and a chunky corduroy jacket against the chill of a drizzly London day. He has lived in London since 1982 when he arrived from Japan, with no money and no English. Born in a Tokyo suburb, his father was an air traffic controller and his mother left home when he was very young. His father remarried and he did not get on with his stepmother. At 14 he ran away to fend for himself in Tokyo. Education is everything in Japan. A high school drop-out is an illiterate outcast with little or no hope of finding work. Tatsuno scraped along until he was sent to London to buy English antiques for a Tokyo dealer. The dust and dirt disgusted him after the spruce streets of Japan. With little money, he made his own clothes from fabrics he found at antique markets. His break came when a buyer from Browns, the designer store, stopped him on the street and asked about the shirt he was wearing. Tatsuno started selling to Browns, beginning his own business, Culture Shock, which enjoyed a cult following before collapsing in 1986 with cashflow problems. A shop on Mount Street followed, backed by Yohji Yamamoto, the Tokyo designer. Finally, in 1990, Tatsuno opened his own label. He now operates from a shambolic studio on All Saints Road, in the heart of Notting Hill. Tatsuno and his partner, Yvonne Sporre, do all the designs and fabric development with a team of five. He has no formal training and designs by instinct - 'I try not to think too much about it beforehand' - draping his fabrics around mannequins. The core of his collection is still couture, but he has also introduced ready-to-wear made by an Italian sub-contractor. Ready-to-wear is a watered-down version of the couture and is also far cheaper. Joseph in London sells his ready-to-wear jackets for Pounds 350 and the couture versions for Pounds 2,000. He shows at the Paris pret-a-porter, which has given him an entree into the international marketplace. His clothes are sold by Barney's in New York and L'Eclaireur in Paris, where he also has his own shop in Saint Germain. But his business is still small by international standards, with Pounds 1m turnover this year. Tatsuno plans to stay in London. 'I am a private person, still very Japanese in some ways. I always keep part of myself hidden and it is easier to do that here. In Milan or Paris, I would be sucked into the fashion system.' So far the system has been good to him. Christian Lacroix and Azzedine Alaia, the Paris designers, both encouraged him when he was launching his label. Didier Grumbach, chairman of Thierry Mugler, has given financial advice. Grumbach's sister, Sylvie, now helps Tatsuno to organise his Paris shows, just as she has helped Vivienne Westwood. Tatsuno finds affinity with traditional Japanese aesthetics. 'There is a simplicity and sense of balance that is very close to my vision. As an outsider, I now see aspects of Japan that I did not appreciate before.' He also shares the Japanese obsession for exploring the extraordinary side of ordinary objects. 'I try to recognise ordinary things that can be turned into something special.' Just as a simple stone is treated as an object of beauty in a formal Zen garden, so Tatsuno makes a stunning silver tunic from 3,000 safety pins or sews strips of salmon skin on to his jackets.

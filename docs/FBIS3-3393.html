			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Special Program on the NPC and CPPCC Sessions"] </F>   [Text] Listeners, there are only three years left before  the Chinese Government begins to exercise China's sovereignty  over Hong Kong. Over 100 years of British colonial rule in Hong  Kong will soon end. In light of Britain's uncooperative  position, and pursuant to a National People's Congress [NPC]  Standing Committee decision, the Preliminary Working Committee  of the Preparatory Committee [PWCPC] of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR] has begun its work.    Speaking about Premier Li Peng's instructions to the PWCPC  in  his government work report, Zhou Nan, PWCPC vice chairman and  director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, said: [begin  recording] The PWCPC has become operational, entering the stage  of practical work. Its main mission is to guarantee Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability in the last stage of Hong Kong's  transitional period, and to ensure a smooth transition in 1997.  This is its major task. The PWCPC will undertake effective  preparations for the SAR Preparatory Committee. The PWCPC  shoulders a grave responsibility. However, I do not envision any  unsurmountable difficulties. As a result of Chris Patten's  fracas, Hong Kong compatriots have obtained a deeper  understanding of Chris Patten's true face. For people across  the country, it is a living education in patriotism. I believe  we can successfully carry out the tasks entrusted to us by the  NPC Standing Committee, live up to the expectations of people  across the country, and complete preparations for Hong Kong's  triumphant return to the motherland and the Chinese Government's  exercise of sovereignty over the region. We are confident of  accomplishing these tasks. [end recording]</p>

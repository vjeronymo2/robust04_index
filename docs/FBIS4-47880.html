			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 4 SAPA -- The African National  Congress will propose that the first session of the new  Parliament deal with a bill for an act to redress the claims of  people who lost land through apartheid laws. Unveiling its  agricultural policy at a Johannesburg press briefing on  Wednesday [4 May], the ANC said the legislation should be  considered in the first sitting of Parliament because of the  urgency and emotions attached to land claims.    The proposed land rights restitution act is intended to deal  with claims arising from the dispossession of landowners caused  by, among other things, forced removals.    The proposed act will require claims to be lodged within  three years of the establishment of a Government of National  Unity.    The ANC proposes claims be lodged with a land claims  commission, which will investigate them and try to negotiate and  mediate settlements. Settlements agreed to will be subject to  scrutiny by the commission to determine their fairness.    A land claims court will be asked to ratify any settlements  reached and also to judge disputed or complex cases.    Some landowners in the Eastern Transvaal were already  negotiating settlements with dispossessed communities and  labourer tenants, the ANC said.    It said the proposed act would promote the reasonable and  constructive settlement of claims by all the parties involved,  in the hope of discouraging landowners from thwarting claims by  evicting claimants and selling the land.    In the event of pre-emptive action by landowners the dispute  would be referred to the land claims court, it said.    As for people who had claims based on their exclusion from  land rights, they would be subject to a policy of land  redistribution backed by a financing mechanism.</p>

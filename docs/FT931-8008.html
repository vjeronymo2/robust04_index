			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Airbus 'has cost American jobs' PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday said the US had just stood by while Europe invested in the Airbus airliner, but now it was time to rethink US policies on developing new technologies, Reuter reports from Santa Monica. Speaking in California, where defence cuts have caused job losses in the defence industry, Mr Clinton said Washington needed to put more investment into the private sector. 'For the last several years we have stood by while Europe invested Dollars 26bn in taxpayer money to build the Airbus,' he said. Development of the airliner served 'to push American people out of work  - not because they won any sort of free market competition, but because Europe had a theory about how to get high-wage jobs going into the 21st century in aerospace'. He said US leaders had refused to undertake similar projects because they felt 'that's industrial policy. We don't do that.' Such views had led to the lengthy recession in the US, he said. Mr Clinton said the US had to invest more in the new technologies of the future, more in helping people to convert from a defence base to a domestic economy. The president, campaigning for his economic package, outlined last week, was also planning to visit the high-tech Silicon Valley, as well as to address workers employed by Boeing, which intends to cut thousands of jobs because of declining aircraft sales.</p>

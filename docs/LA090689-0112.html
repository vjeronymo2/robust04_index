			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEC OIL OUTPUT UP IN AUGUST, AGENCY SAYS  </P> <P> OPEC nations opened their oil taps a bit more in August to boost their crude  production to one of the highest levels so far this year, according to  estimates released Tuesday.  </P> <P> The International Energy Agency said in its monthly oil market report that the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped about 21.6 million barrels  of oil a day last month -- up 200,000 barrels from a revised July figure of  21.4 million and 2.6 million barrels a day higher than last year.  </P> <P> The IEA estimate also is about 2 million barrels more than the  19.5-million-barrel ceiling set by OPEC when it met in June.  </P> <P> Other sources have put OPEC's August production at between 21.5 million and  21.7 million barrels. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a respected trade  newsletter, estimated OPEC's July output at 21.8 million barrels.  </P> <P> Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $5 in West Texas  Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, from $18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the  year's low of $12.60 on Oct. 5. While higher demand has kept prices from  falling as dramatically this year, prices have weakened, and analysts say they  could continue to do so before they recover.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $18-a-Barrel Target  </P> <P> By October, consumers could see a slight decline in retail gasoline prices --  about 2 to 3 cents a gallon, said William Veno, director of oil market analysis  for Data Resources Inc.  </P> <P> "The majority of the higher output came from Iran, which had experienced a  decline in July," the IEA report said.  </P> <P> The 13 OPEC nations agreed in June to try to keep output under control and  prices near a target of $18 a barrel. But despite the promises, the cartel's  supply has remained strong, depressing prices from their highs of last spring.  </P> <P> The average price of a basket of the seven OPEC-monitored crudes registered  $16.44 a barrel at the end of August, compared to $18 last spring.  </P> <P> Prices for West Texas Intermediate have been running in the range of $18 to $19  a barrel, but other U.S. crudes have been weaker. The benchmark crude, which a  growing number of analysts say does not represent the market, had been up to  $24 a barrel in April.  </P> <P> Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York,  said OPEC's production seems to have stabilized. "They've kind of found their  level and the market is pretty much absorbing it," he said.  </P> <P> Higher demand this year -- about 1 million barrels a day more -- is one reason  prices haven't fallen further, Veno said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Raise Supply Cap  </P> <P> Moreover, lower U.S. production and oil rig accidents in the North Sea and  elsewhere have lowered world oil output and enabled OPEC to pump more oil  without serious repercussions, Veno said.  </P> <P> "In order for them not to undermine prices further and precipitate a collapse,  OPEC will have to hold production at about 21.6 million barrels," Veno said.  While fourth-quarter demand is expected to grow, North Sea and other non-OPEC  production also is expected to grow as repairs are completed, he said.  </P> <P> An OPEC monitoring panel will meet in Geneva on Sept. 23 to analyze the market  and decide whether to raise the supply cap to around 20 million barrels a day  in the last quarter of the year.  </P> <P> The United Arab Emirates produced 1.8 million barrels a day in August, well  above its OPEC-set ceiling of about 1 million barrels, the IEA reported.  </P> <P> Kuwait's output last month was estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day, up from  its target of 1 million barrels.  </P> <P> Nigeria pumped about 1.8 million barrels a day last month, higher than its  1.4-million-barrel quota.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, produced 4.8 million barrels a  day, about the same as its target.  </P> <P> Iran and Iraq both pumped at their quota levels of 2.8 million barrels a day,  according to the report.  </P> <P> The report noted that Iraq was nearing completion of a pipeline through Saudi  Arabia that would increase its capacity to export oil to about 3 million  barrels a day.  </P> <P> The output of other cartel members in August was at or near their targets:  </P> <P> Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels a day; Venezuela, 1.7 million barrels; Algeria,  700,000 barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Libya, 1.1 million barrels; Qatar,  400,000 barrels, and Gabon, 200,000 barrels.  </P> <P> The Paris-based IEA is an arm of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, made up of Western nations, including the United States, Japan,  France, Britain and West Germany.  </P></p>

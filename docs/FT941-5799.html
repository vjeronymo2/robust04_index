			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Baltic returns to the black with Pounds 4.38m Baltic, the specialist finance company, yesterday announced its return to the black in 1993, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.38m, compared with losses of Pounds 6.55m last time. At the year end, the company had net cash and investments of Pounds 26m and a net asset value per share of 132p. The turn-around was primarily the result of asset disposals, declining interest rates, and a fall in provisions. Profits included a Pounds 1.54m charge against bad and doubtful debts, compared with Pounds 11.1m in 1992. The lending portfolio was further reduced with advances, instalment loans and finance leases amounting to only Pounds 37.4m at the year end, compared with Pounds 90m a year earlier, and Pounds 200m at the end of 1991. With its lending activity declining, interest payments and similar charges fell from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 534,000. The company substantially cut back on leasing business during the year, through the sale of two asset leasing subsidiaries for a total of Pounds 22.2m. It subsequently invested Pounds 7.5m in a tender offer for 15 per cent of its ordinary shares and 14.5 per cent of its convertible preference shares, capitalising on their discount to net asset value. Fully diluted earnings per share were 8p, against losses of 16.9p. A recommended final dividend of 1p makes a total of 1.5p, a 50 per cent increase.</p>

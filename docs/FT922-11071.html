			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clove hitch for cigarette industry - Indonesia's over-sized and over-priced crop CLOVES IN Indonesia are a national feature falling rapidly into disrepute. Like many of the smokers who annually consume more than 130bn fragrant kretek cigarettes, of which the clove is the essential ingredient, the spice is distinctly out of sorts. Indonesia's 3m-4m clove farmers produce about 80,000 tonnes of the spice but what should have been a boom period has turned sour. Despite a 62 per cent increase in kretek cigarette sales between 1985-89, clove production has outstripped demand. Industry officials say traders should take the blame when in the mid-1980s, speculating on a price increase, they bought large stocks of cloves, creating an artificial demand. By early 1990 traders were holding over 60,000 tonnes but bumper harvests allowed the cigarette producers to purchase requirements. The price of cloves actually fell by half to a low of 2,000 rupiah (Dollars 1) a kilogram and, industry officials estimate, traders faced a loss of over USDollars 65m. Then in January 1991 the government granted a monopoly over the buying and selling of cloves to Badan Penyangga dan Pemasaran Cengkeh, owned 80 per cent by a consortium of five private companies and 20 per cent by Kerta Niaga, a state marketing board. Chaired by Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, the youngest son of President Suharto of Indonesia, BPPC shareholders are reported to include many of the traders holding clove stocks. In early 1991 BPPC's stockpile amounted to about 80,000 tonnes, including Kerta Niaga's stock of 23,000 tonnes. BPPC set a floor price for farmers of Rp7,900 and sold cloves, including its existing stock, to cigarette producers at between Rp12,700-15,000, more than four times the world market price. Bank Indonesia, the central bank, provided Rp759bn in low-interest credit to finance the venture. Economists say state-owned banks supplied another Rp250bn in credit. International donors, including the World Bank, criticised the move as contrary to the spirit of economic de-regulation and predicted a worsening over-supply of cloves. BPPC officials said the agency was necessary to protect the farmers who, they claimed, were exploited by the cigarette industry. BPPC stocks have since risen to over 150,000 tonnes and the company has announced it cannot meet conditions on its loans. Diplomats say some traders have illegally imported a further 30,000 tonnes and that many farmers have not been paid for last year's crop. In February Mr Putra suggested that farmers should burn half their crop or cut down a third of their clove trees. Industry officials say farmers have been reluctant to follow his advice but the Ministry of Agriculture has announced that it will enforce tree-felling, starting with diseased specimens. BPPC has come under increasing criticism with members of the ruling Golkar party expressing disapproval. Earlier this month the government reduced BPPC's role in the procurement of cloves, handing much of the task to local co-operative groups. The floor price has been lowered to Rp4,000, although the co-operative is to receive up to an additional Rp3,900 in retained earnings and compulsory-farmer savings. Diplomats say BPPC has made available Rp120bn for co-operatives to finance purchases. BPPC retains, however, the sole right to sell cloves and Mr Putra says the price cigarette companies must pay will not be reduced until BPPC's existing stock is exhausted. A face-off between BPPC and the cigarette industry, therefore, may be in prospect. There are 120 cigarette companies but just two command about 80 per cent market share. These are reported to be holding sufficient stock for another six months production. The government has technically linked the sale of cigarettes to the purchase of cloves from BPPC, but the latter is likely to face problems running down its stockpile. Economists say cigarette companies have halved the quantity of cloves mixed with tobacco during production. Discord has already been reported within the BPPC consortium as to how sales should be divided between its members. Bankers say the continuing high cost of cloves may force some smaller cigarette companies to close and the larger firms are threatening to cut back tobacco purchases. Industry officials warn, therefore, of a knock-on effect on the tobacco sector. In 1991, tobacco production held steady in at an estimated 135,390 tonnes (dry weight), with about 17,450 tonnes being exported. Domestic demand, however, was affected by a rise of 30 per cent in cigarette prices resulting from the higher cost of cloves and increased excise duty. Consumption of cigarettes fell 5.3 per cent in 1991, breaking the trend of uninterrupted growth. The government is likely to be monitoring the situation closely with the cigarette industry providing 10 per cent - about USDollars 1bn - of total tax revenue. Many industry officials still expect BPPC to fold. Questions remain as to its financial position and to the ability of local co-operatives to finance, collect and store this year's harvest. Bankers say the government may be waiting until after June's general election before wielding the axe.</p>

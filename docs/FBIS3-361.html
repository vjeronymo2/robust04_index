Mr. Ajello told a Maputo press briefing today that  1,144 UN police will be deployed in three phases.    This month should see the arrival of UN police headquarters  staff. Thirty-six police for regional centers and 327 observers  for the 11 provincial capitals. From April to June, 70 percent  of the 720 UN police to be deployed at districts and lower  levels should be in place. A full police contingent must be in  place one month before the country's first multiparty elections  due to be held in October this year. Mr. Ajello said the UN  police would be very useful for the unification of the territory  and the republic's administration. He guaranteed that the  Mozambican police should freely enter Renamo-held areas.    Mr. Ajello found it very encouraging that Renamo leader  Afonso Dhlakama yesterday reiterated his commitment to unifying  the country under a single administration. Mr. Ajello said he  believed that both Renamo and the government were now strongly  committed to implementing the peace process on time. He said  there could be no question of postponing the elections until  1995 because both sides understood that [words indistinct].</p>

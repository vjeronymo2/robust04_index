			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A freighter arrived in Inchon, South Korea, with coal from North Korea, the  first direct merchandise shipment from the north to south since the Korean War.  Previous shipments from the north have gone though third countries. The direct  shipment came a day after Chung Ju Young, honorary chairman of South Korea's  giant Hyundai industrial group, confirmed that he has agreed in principle to  help build a tourist resort, shipyard and railroad plant in the north. Chung,  returning from a 10-day visit to the north, said the projects are subject to  approval by both governments.  </P></p>

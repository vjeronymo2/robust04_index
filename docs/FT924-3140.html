			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: London &amp; Provincial Shop faces receiver LONDON &amp; Provincial Shop, a subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, said it could go into receivership within a fortnight, unless a dispute over an alleged breach of covenant is resolved. The dispute concerns a Pounds 1.4m sale in 1990 of a property that was subject to a first charge as security for debenture stock. The failure to execute a formal release from this charge was seen as a breach of covenant by the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the trustee of the debenture stock. Late on Friday, Law Debenture served a formal notice on the company requiring it to make good the alleged breach of covenant. If their claim is substantiated, they are entitled to appoint a receiver. London &amp; Provincial Shop said it did not believe there had been a breach of covenant. 'The directors remain satisfied that at all times the company has acted, both in relation to this matter and generally, in accordance with the terms of the Debenture Trust Deed,' it said.</p>

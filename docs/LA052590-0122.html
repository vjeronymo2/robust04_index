			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Keating Sues Government: Beleaguered Arizona businessman Charles H. Keating Jr.  and top executives of his bankrupt American Continental Corp. sued the federal  government for $300 million, claiming that regulators wrongly took the  company's property -- its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan subsidiary -- and  destroyed it. The suit, filed in U.S. Claims Court in Washington, is similar to  one American Continental filed a year ago after regulators seized the  Irvine-based thrift.  </P></p>

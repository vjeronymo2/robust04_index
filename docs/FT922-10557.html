			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Women's campaigner steals poll headlines in Pennsylvania THE two big lessons out of Pennsylvania are that Bill Clinton lives and that women scorned can be a potent political force this year. The biggest story was the triumph in the Senate Democratic primary of Ms Lynn Yeakel, who rose from oblivion in the polls at the beginning of the year to a comfortable 44-33 per cent victory over Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel, the initial favourite son candidate. In contrast the Arkansas governor's victory - by 57 to 26 per cent over Jerry Brown and with at least 110 of the state's 169 delegates added to his tally - was not surprising. Doubts may persist about his viability as a presidential candidate, but there can be few doubting now that he will be the Democratic nominee. He came to Washington yesterday to persuade Democratic senators and congressmen, many of them among the 772 'super delegates' to the convention, of this fact. Though he did not ask for endorsements, he reportedly was well received and Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, predicted that 'a sizeable number' would soon declare for him. He said Congress should give the president what is known as line item veto power, reform campaign finance laws, practise better budgetary discipline and pass a national health insurance scheme. The best news for Mr Clinton, who, with approaching 1,500 delegates now, seems to accept he may not finally nail down the 2,145 needed for the nomination until the final primaries on June 2, was that, according to exit polls in Pennsylvania, over 60 per cent of Democrats thought he was honest enough to be president, up from under 50 per cent in earlier primaries. This partly offset the fact that the turnout in the state, as elsewhere, was very small, reflecting lack of enthusiasm for the candidate. In this respect, Mr Clinton is in the same boat as President Bush, who had the admittedly minor mortification of seeing Patrick Buchanan, who hardly campaigned, still win nearly a quarter of the vote. Mr Bush will be assured of the Republican nomination very soon. Ms Yeakel, a successful fund-raiser for women's causes, triumphed in her first ever political race by looking past her primary opponents to the November election against Senator Arlen Specter, the incumbent Republican, who won easily on Tuesday. It was Mr Specter's aggressive grilling of Professor Anita Hill in the hearings to confirm Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court last year that induced Ms Yeakel to run. Her campaign featured commercials replaying at length Mr Specter's hostile questioning, which included his brandishing a copy of the novel, 'The Exorcist,' and asking Ms Hill whether she drew her allegations of sexual harassment from it. As with Ms Carol Mosely Braun, who unseated the Democratic incumbent in the Illinois primary last month, Ms Yeakel tapped a deep well of discontent, among men as well as women, about the perceived indifference, exemplified by the Thomas hearings, of the Washington male establishment towards women's issues. She made much of being an outsider capable of changing that establishment. Mr Specter is, in most things, a moderate Republican. Unlike his president, he believes, for example, in the right to abortion. Pennsylvania's law restricting that right is currently before the Supreme Court, on which Justice Thomas now sits. The man he beat in his primary was the architect of that law, but polls in the culturally conservative state showed over 60 per cent in favour of the freedom to choose abortion. Ms Yeakel's success, allied to that of Ms Braun, will doubtless encourage other women candidates across the country. Particular attention will now focus on California, where Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and Congresswoman Barbara Boxer are bidding for the two Senate seats at stake this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, February 15 (XINHUA) -- French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe said here today that, as far as Bosnia is  concerned, "there are many opportunities" for people to choose  in the days before the NATO's ultimatum deadline which falls on  February 20.    Asked by XINHUA to comment on the latest developments in  Bosnia at a press conference this evening, Juppe said that he  hoped a peace process will take place in the war-torn republic.    NATO agreed on February 9 to threaten Bosnian Serb forces  with air strikes unless they withdraw their big guns from around  Sarajevo within a maximum of 10 days.    Under an agreement brokered by the U.N. Commander for  Bosnia,  Michael Rose, Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo continue to turn  their big guns over to U.N. control and Sarajevo was reported to  be quiet for the fifth day by Monday.    But tension remains high over NATO's ticking ultimatum to  the  Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons by February 20 or  be bombed.    Juppe, who arrived in Israel Sunday for a three-day official  visit, met Monday with Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.    Juppe told reporters at the press conference that a new page  has begun in relations between France and Israel, adding that  there is now an improvement both in the political and military  spheres.    French defense minister will pay a visit to Israel next  month  to advance cooperation in the areas of research, development and  technology.    Earlier today, the French foreign minister also met with  Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories in east  Jerusalem and promised an additional aid of 10 million U.S.  dollars to the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho to be granted  self-rule under Israel-PLO accord signed last September 13.</p>

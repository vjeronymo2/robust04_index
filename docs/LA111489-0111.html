The Hemingway story, about an American expatriate  couple facing the end of their long affair, is the first film in an HBO  trilogy, "Men and Women." Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne will adapt the  story and Tony Richardson will direct the David Brown production. The trilogy,  which also includes stories by Dorothy Parker ("Dusk Before Fireworks") and  Mary McCarthy ("The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt") will premiere on HBO  next summer.

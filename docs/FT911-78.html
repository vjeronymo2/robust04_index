			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Hopes rise for the high street stock shop: NatWest's plans to gear up for the widening of share ownership NATIONAL Westminster knows better than most that timing is everything. The bank has been pondering for sometime how to establish a new market for small companies. It decided to push its proposal forward only when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, called for ideas on widening share ownership. The London Stock Exchange was always going to pour cold water on the concept of a rival market for small companies. Yesterday its chairman, Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, could not resist asking just how NatWest thought it could find buyers for shares in tiny businesses. As he sees it, it is one thing to buy shares from Mrs Brown in Newcastle but it is another to sell them to Mr Jones in Truro. Just who wants shares in penny-halfpenny companies? As far as the stock exchange is concerned, there is no way of answering the question, which is why there is no rival market. NatWest disagrees. It believes there are two possible solutions: it could establish a group of independent agents tied to NatWest, specialising in small companies and buying shares from individual investors; or it could link with a third party acting as a broker marketing shares acquired by NatWest. Since the demise of the Third Market at the end of last year, the bank's stockbrokers have been convinced that they could offer those companies a new home. It also believes it could pick up unlisted businesses, which typically have 1m shares at Pounds 1 each, as well as some of the smaller companies quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market. The USM was set up on November 10 1980 to provide a separately regulated and more flexible market for smaller companies. NatWest believes it could offer many of the smaller USM-quoted companies easier access to the public at an earlier stage of their development. NatWest established a share dealing service in December 1986, for the privatisation of British Gas and it has been thinking of ways of developing its service. In January 1988 it extended its touch-screen share-dealing operation throughout the country. In 278 of the bank's 2,900 branches, investors can buy or sell shares in 550 companies. In spite of the operation's initial success, the branches do an average of only 10 deals a day each. Mr Neil Stapley, managing director of NatWest Stockbrokers, assigned a project team to look at ways to extend that service. The team calculated that a market for small companies would be relatively cheap to establish. When the Treasury issued a press release in March asking for ideas to sell the shares it owns in BT, NatWest Stockbrokers seized on a supplementary question. The chancellor wanted to know how high-street share shops could develop throughout the country - he was not interested just in the BT sale but in widening share ownership generally. That was good enough for NatWest. It is relying on the Treasury to keep to its side of the deal and will come up with the ideas if Whitehall throws its weight behind them in the face of stock exchange hostility. To be fair to Mr Hugh Smith, he has made it clear that the bank is in an ideal situation to establish a market in small shares. If it decides to set up a rival market, Mr Hugh Smith does not think it should necessarily be judged as a challenge to the exchange. Others are not so sure. Mr Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood Securities, which offers a share service in 830 small companies, said NatWest had 'state-of-the-art' technology to offer a first-rate market for small companies. 'It has the capability to challenge the stock exchange,' he said.</p>

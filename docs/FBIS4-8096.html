			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- No humanitarian or  logistical convoys have arrived on the left [western] bank of  the River Drina today, and no convoys went in the other  direction, toward the territory of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, TANJUG's correspondent has learned from the command  of the Zvornik garrison of the Bosnian Serb republic army.    The same source says that several humanitarian and  logistical  convoys announced their arrival for today, and the Serb side  granted them permission to cross the territory of the Serb  republic. However, they have failed to arrive, and officials in  Zvornik have not received any official explanation for this.  [passage omitted]</p>

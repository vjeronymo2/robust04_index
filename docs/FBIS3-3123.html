The Second Session of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] would open soon.    Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, and other  comrades left a reception room amid light-hearted music and went  to the rostrum of the full session. The 10,000-man hall was  lighted by ceiling lights, wall lights, and correspondents'  flash bulbs.    Facing numerous cameras, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin  pulled  Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Li Ruihuan together and happily said:  "Come, let us have a group photo taken!"    Photographic correspondent rushed forward to photograph  their  smiling faces.    Earlier, a reception room in the rear of the main assembly  hall was bustling with noise and excitement as a closed circuit  TV was broadcasting the video recording of Li Ruihuan's visit to  three countries in Southeast Asia. When Vice Chairman Wang  Guangying saw Li Ruihuan coming into the room with a smiling  face, he pointed at the TV and said: "Chairman Li, the TV is  broadcasting you. You are the first person visiting abroad in  the position of chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. It  was very significant to developing foreign contacts by the  CPPCC!" Li Ruihuan said repeatedly: "The achievements of the  CPPCC all depend on your joint efforts."    At a reception room, Ye Xuanping and Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee, were greeting party  and state leaders who came to extend their greetings. Ye  Xuanping held talks with some responsible persons of democratic  parties, and later extended his greetings to Ann Tse-kai, Henry  Fok Ying-tung, and Ma Man-kei, vice chairmen of the CPPCC  National Committee who were elected from Hong Kong and Macao  regions; Wang Zhaoguo asked for advice from Wang Hanbin, vice  chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress, concerning legal matters in contacts between the two  sides of the Taiwan Strait.    Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and other comrades entered  the reception room to express their congratulations to Li  Ruihuan on the opening of the CPPCC session. Li Ruihuan  introduced Zhu Xun, minister of geology and mineral resources  and first deputy secretary general of the Second Session of the  Eighth CPPCC National Committee, to comrades Jiang Zemin, Li  Peng, and Qiao Shi, saying: "This is our newly elected member  and Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources Zhu Xun." Jiang  Zemin shook hands with him and said: "We knew each other long  ago." Li Peng said to Zhu Xun: "The CPPCC can do a lot of  things. You must continue your efforts under the leadership of  Comrade Li Ruihuan."    The preparatory bell sounded, and Zhu Xun requested those  leading comrades to take their seats at the rostrum. When  General-Secretary Jiang Zemin saw Ye Xuanping wearing a  feather-padded coat, he asked the latter: "You will make a  report at the plenary meeting wearing just this?" Ye Xuanping  took off the feather-padded coat and said smilingly: "I wear a  western coat underneath!" Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, and  other comrades all laughed.</p>

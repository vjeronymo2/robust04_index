			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Yarrow chairman warns on future of warship builders AT LEAST one of the UK's four warship builders will be forced out of business, Sir Robert Easton, chairman of Yarrow Shipbuilders, the Clydeside yard, predicted yesterday. Yarrow, part of the GEC group, is competing against the Tyneside yard Swan Hunter, Cumbria-based VSEL and the Southampton yard Vosper Thornycroft to build a batch of up to three Type 23 anti-submarine frigates for the Royal Navy. Lobbying for the order has intensified, with a decision expected next month or in March ahead of the general election. Of the 10 Type 23 orders placed so far, six have been won by Yarrow and the rest by Swan Hunter. Orders in prospect would not be sufficient to sustain all four yards, Sir Robert said in London. 'I believe that there are too many shipyards and that they won't all survive,' he said. 'There are clear indications that three yards might survive at a certain level, but two yards would be able to pick up what is available in the UK.' No other company would challenge VSEL's position as sole UK builder of nuclear-powered submarines, Sir Robert said, because of the high infrastructure costs involved and the lack of export opportunities. But the same did not apply to Vosper Thornycroft's niche in mine warfare vessels made of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). Royal Navy plans for more GRP minehunters were shelved last year. But Yarrow, which has an idle GRP facility, would compete 'very severely' for the contract when it was revived, Sir Robert said. He said that Yarrow alone would be capable of fulfilling the UK's entire surface-ship programme, but did not expect the government to favour a monopoly. To spread the forthcoming Type 23 frigate order between different yards would be 'a nonsense', Sir Robert said. Yards needed sufficient production volume to achieve economies of scale. Yarrow is expected to conclude a Malaysian order for two corvettes worth about Pounds 150m within the next three months, filling an export vacuum. Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, was 'perhaps rather premature' in announcing an imminent deal in September, Sir Robert said. However, problems over the choice of combat system for the vessels had now been 'more or less resolved'.</p>

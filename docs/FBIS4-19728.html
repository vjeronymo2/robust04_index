			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe  was interviewed by "P.S." in the 7 April Paris daily LIBERATION  on the eve of his visit to China, where he accompanied Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur.    When asked why he had decided to normalize relations with  China as early as his April 1993 appointment, Juppe replied that  it is impossible to continue quarreling with China for obvious  economic, political, strategic, and demographic reasons.  Moreover, he said, the dialogue with China had been broken off  in the absence of "major differences in foreign policy," since  the sale of French aircraft and frigates to Taiwan did not  justify a two-year quarrel, and might be compensated by sales to  the PRC. When the interviewer pointed out that no important  contracts are expected from the visit, Juppe noted this was not  a "commercial" trip, and that it was only aimed at improving the  political climate between the two nations. "P.S." then asked  whether Chinese violations of human rights would pose a problem.  Juppe observed that such violations pose no problem for the  United States, which has not revoked most-favored-nation status  for China. While France does not "renounce any of its  principles," Juppe continued, "we must not close the door in  China's face, or else we would quarrel with three-fourths of the  planet." Juppe also contended that China has accomplished "some  progress" in human rights, and that events in that country will  "make the system of repression untenable." When asked whether  France was wrong in supporting Chinese dissidents after 1989,  Juppe said it was not, and noted that while France must let  China know that the present situation is not satisfactory, an  equilibrium must be found between "indifference and excessive  zeal."    Despite Prime Minister Balladur's affirmation that his China  visit achieved his "political objectives," he nevertheless  suffered a "half-failure," because his trip was designed to  combine the "irreconcilable" objectives of restoring relations  and promoting commercial interests, Jacques Amalric writes in  the 12 April Paris daily LIBERATION. By dispatching businessman  Jacques Friedmann to Beijing as early as July 1993 to negotiate  the normalization of Sino-French ties at the cost of ending  military sales to Taiwan, Balladur--egged on by Rally for the  Republic leader Jacques Chirac--placed himself in a "position of  inferiority," appearing as the mere spokesman of large  industrial interests, Amalric continues. Meanwhile, the prime  minister's entourage is arguing "without much conviction" that  France is now on an equal footing with its competitors in vying  for important contracts with China; it is also presenting as a  "semivictory" the fact that no invitation to visit Paris was  extended to Chinese Premier Li Peng. However, these contracts  will be dearly paid for, first by French taxpayers--since France  is only second to Japan in granting "privileged" credits to  China--and also in terms of France's image in an Asia that is  "watching Beijing's least moves through a magnifying glass,"  Amalric concludes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Meciar does not  know why the visit to Slovakia by Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev did not take place. He thought this was a great  mistake because Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's  visit to Slovakia should have been discussed during Kozyrev's  visit.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> HAPPY TO HAVE YOU, HENRY; MEET OZZIE  </P> <P> Your first NFL start, Henry Rolling. This Sunday. In Cleveland. And by the way,  you're covering Ozzie Newsome.  </P> <P>  Gee, thanks.  </P> <P>  Because the Chargers have lost linebacker Billy Ray Smith (abdominal strain)  for at least four weeks, Rolling is the man. A free agent cut after six games  last season by Tampa Bay, Rolling will make his debut at left outside  linebacker covering Newsome, the most productive pass-catching tight end in NFL  history.  </P> <P> Is he ready?  </P> <P> "Was Douglas ready for Tyson?" Charger Coach Dan Henning asked with a smile.  </P> <P> Yes, but what about Michael Spinks, Larry Holmes and the stiffs that did face  plants into the canvas?  </P> <P> Anyway, Rolling is pretty matter-of-fact about the whole thing.  </P> <P> "He's a good player," Rolling said of Newsome. "I'm looking forward to playing  against him because it'll make me a better player."  </P> <P> Rolling faced him once in an exhibition and says he did fine. Besides, Newsome  is known for his quick feet and soft hands but not necessarily his raw  strength. Rolling is 25, Newsome 34.  </P> <P> Steve Hendrickson, the newest Charger linebacker, signed Wednesday courtesy of  the 49er cut list.  </P> <P> Hendrickson, 24, played three games last season for the 49ers, was waived and  picked up by the Cowboys. A few weeks later, he was re-signed to the 49er  developmental squad.  </P> <P> Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard is happy to have him.  </P> <P> "He's a very intense kid," Beathard said. "He's got terrific speed and good  hands."  </P> <P> Receiver Quinn Early's days might be numbered.  </P> <P> "He's fighting," Henning said. "He gives us something that the other guys don't  give us, but there's some speed element that these young guys have." Early, a  six-game starter last season, was displaced by rookie Walter Wilson before  Sunday's loss to Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Rookie tackle Leo Goeas, who missed most of training camp recovering from a  broken foot, says he feels good and is ready to play. He played 20 downs  against the Bengals Sunday. He figures that's a better test than staring at a  coach drawing "Xs and Os."  </P> <P> "It's easy to talk about it on the chalkboard," he said. "But it's a little  different when you're out there with a lot of bodies. The toughest thing is  making it through the whole practice without aggravating the foot. I just need  a lot of reps."  </P> <P> It might be a few weeks before he is fit to compete for the starting position,  now occupied by Broderick Thompson.  </P> <P> Goeas is questionable for Sunday's game. Also questionable is tight end Arthur  Cox (lower back strain). On Cleveland's questionable list: running back Kevin  Mack (finger), cornerback Raymond Clayborn (knee) and defensive tackle Chris  Pike (ankle).  </P></p>

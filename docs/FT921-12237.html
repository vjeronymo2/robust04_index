			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats in thin trading as G7 fails to excite SHARE PRICES retreated in thin trading yesterday, as volume on the first section fell to 137m shares due to the lack of fresh news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 65.04 to 21,007.11 after a day's high of 21,078.87 and low of 20,859.61. The index fell below 21,000 just before the morning close on light selling. Trading volume reached its lowest level since December 9. Declines led advances by 604 to 322 with 195 issues unchanged. A total of 100 stocks fell to their lowest levels since the beginning of last year. The Topix index of all first section shares shed 10.39 to 1,574.47, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.89 to 1,210.93. Market participants, hoping that the outcome of the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting would fuel trading, were disappointed. 'Investors will neither buy nor sell at current levels,' said one trader. However, some analysts see the current low volumes as a positive signal for the market. Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'The inactivity reflects a stall in fund flows, indicating that money has stopped leaving the market.' In the week ending January 17 individuals and corporate investors, who have been net sellers of equity during the past year, became net buyers. Foreign investors, who were aggressive buyers last year, are also expected to commit further funds into Japanese stocks. 'Foreigners' asset weightings in Japanese stocks are still light,' said Mr Paul Muller at Schroder Securities. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y13,000 to an all-time low of Y682,000. Some investors have been discouraged by reports of cuts in long distance telephone rates. Market participants are also worried about an over-supply of shares, as the Ministry of Finance has included proceeds from the sale of 500,000 shares for the year ending March 1993 into the fiscal budget. International blue chips, firm on foreign interest last week, lost ground on light profit-taking. TDK retreated Y200 to Y4,450 and NEC Y10 to Y1,150. However, some bargain hunting lifted Fujitsu Y3 to Y790 and Sony Y40 to Y4,240. Kirin Brewery rose Y10 to Y1,280. The company expects earnings for the current year to reach Y85bn thanks to rising beer sales. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 122.48 down at 22,502.91 in volume of 41.4m shares. Machineries and high-technology issues declined, while some domestic demand-related issues held firm. Roundup PROFIT taking in Hong Kong was the outstanding feature in the region yesterday. Australia was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG saw profits taken again, the Hang Seng index losing 45.35 to 4,554.73 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.02bn to a still-active HKDollars 2.05bn. Utilities suffered the session's biggest falls, followed by banks. Some fund managers were keen to realise profits before next week's Chinese New Year holiday, which will close the market for three days. Volume was diminished by nervousness ahead of the State of the Union address tonight by President George Bush. SEOUL ended higher on renewed expectations of improved relations between North and South Korea. The composite index gained 10.82 to 675.11 in turnover of Won537.9bn, after Won541.1bn. Reports that North Korean leaders had agreed to set up joint ventures with South Korean companies boosted construction and trade-related issues. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, the nation's largest construction company, advanced by its upper limit of Won800 to Won15,800. NEW ZEALAND saw some block trades, but trading was depleted by holidays in Auckland and in Australia, where most local blue-chip issues are also listed. The NZSE-40 Index improved 5.68 to 1,487.02 after a fall of 1.6 per cent last week. Turnover increased from Friday's NZDollars 20.8m to NZDollars 24.7m. White goods manufacturer Fisher and Paykel topped the actives list with 2.3m shares traded and closed steady at NZDollars 2.10 after London-based fund manager Morgan Stanley Asset Management said it had raised its stake in F &amp; P from 17.4 to to 19.4 per cent. SINGAPORE closed mixed in quiet trading. The Straits Times Industrial index put on 3.60 to 1,545.92 in thin turnover of SDollars 114.1m (SDollars 127.2m). Trading in KUALA LUMPUR was also dull, the composite index rising 1.77 to 570.55 in turnover of MDollars 66.7m (MDollars 75.5m). MANILA extended its recent downward correction, the composite index sliding 10.48 to 1,268.20 as profit-takers reacted to President Corazon Aquino's endorsement of Mr Fidel Ramos, her former defence secretary, as a candidate to succeed her in the May presidential elections. Combined turnover on Manila's two bourses was down from 187.5m pesos to 150.4m pesos. TAIWAN focused on small companies as the weighted index climbed 42.50 to 5,341.49, after a rise of 55.39 on Saturday. Turnover expanded from TDollars 55.6bn to TDollars 60.9bn. Observers said the index was boosted mainly by strength in cements and financials, most of which have been lagging. BANGKOK suffered its biggest one-day loss in two months on heavy profit-taking in finance and property issues. The SET index finished 9.70 off at 771.93 after turnover of Bt8.17bn. BOMBAY rose on speculative buying, the BSE index ending 32.78 ahead at 2,172.11 after a day's high of 2,181.35.</p>

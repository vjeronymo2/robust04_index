Yurchak, Tayfun Scientific </F> Production Association; UDC 551.501.89:551.510.42]    [Abstract] Results obtained from the use of passive radar  to study the physics of clouds and the diffusion of passive  components in the lower part of the boundary layer of atmosphere  are the foundation for the use of carbon and graphite chaff to  track planned and accidental emissions of harmful substances by  industry. The cloud of harmful substances is marked with chaff  with a rate of sedimentation closely matching that of the  tracked substance. Several materials with different rates of  sedimentation may be used to track various components of the  cloud.. The chaff is to be installed in the stacks, ventilators,  and other structural elements of the plant and may be released  on command or automatically when the maximum permissible  concentration of a substance is exceeded in the emission.  Figures show how this method was used to track the vertical and  horizontal position and configuration of a cloud of chaff. A  similar experiment conducted in the US with aluminized mylar  chaff is noted. The maximum tracking distance for various  diffusion conditions is determined. Figures 3; table 1;  references 21: 16 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

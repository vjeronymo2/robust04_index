			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Employment data boost dollar THE DOLLAR rose yesterday on news of stronger than expected April US employment data. A surprising fall to 6.6 from 6.8 per cent in the unemployment rate and a smaller than forecast fall of 124,000 in non-farm payrolls, against a revised drop of 241,000 in March, led to demand for the US currency. Analysts were looking for a rise to 7.0 per cent in the unemployment rate and for a fall of about 170,000 in the payrolls figure. The better data were regarded as possibly the first concrete sign that the US economy is moving out of recession. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, a White House spokesman, said it was welcome news, but he was cautious whether the figures signalled an end to the recession. A commissioner for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics warned that the unemployment rate probably exaggerated the improvement. This caution in official circles pulled the dollar back from peaks of DM1.7540 and Y138.90, but it still finished much firmer on the day in London. The currency rose to DM1.7460 from DM1.7240; to Y138.50 from Y138.05; to SFr1.4750 from Y1.4590; and to FFr5.9150 from FFr5.8325. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index climbed to 66.6 from 66.2. The improvement by the dollar was mainly at the expense of the D-Mark, with the German currency weakening in cross rate trading, particularly against the Japanese yen. It finished in London at Y79.30 compared with Y80.05 previously. Figures from the European Commission showed the D-Mark around the middle of the European exchange rate mechanism, but later in the day unofficial figures put the German unit second weakest, just above the French franc. The French currency hit its floor against the top placed Spanish peseta. Sterling remained fourth strongest in the ERM, on data from the European Commission, with the pound holding relatively steady despite heavy losses for Britain's ruling Conservative Party in Thursday's local government elections. These results appear to rule out a UK general election as early as June and have therefore temporarily reduced any political risk in holding sterling. Dealers believe they may have also delayed further cuts in UK bank base rates. The Bank of England endorsed the present rate structure in its operations on the London money market yesterday. At the London close the pound had fallen 2.15 cents to Dollars 1.6950 while declining to Y234.75 from Y237.00 and to SFr2.5000 from SFr2.5050, but was unchanged at DM2.9600 and rose to FFr10.0250 from FFr10.0125. Sterling's index fell 0.2 to 91.2.</p>

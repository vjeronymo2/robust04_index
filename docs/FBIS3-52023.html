			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Jan (EFE) -- Approximately 1,000  people participated in a demonstration today in front of the  Haitian parliament demanding its dissolution and that a tribunal  assume power.    The demonstrators expressed their support for the  resolutions  issued by the so-called "Congress of the Northern Citizens'  Group" [Congres del Colectivo de Ciudadanos del Norte]  recommending a military tribunal assume power.    In its 26 January session, the Chamber of Deputies did not  discuss the resolution proposed by the northern citizens group.  They thought it was "irrelevant" and instead announced the  Chamber is working on a proposal asking President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, currently in exile in Washington, to appoint a prime  minister. Aristide was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a  group of military officers headed by General Raoul Cedras.    Following a traditional practice begun in the days of  Francois Duvalier's dictatorship, the demonstrators were  transported in vehicles from distant parts of the country to the  capital. This time, the groups traveled in state-owned buses.    Commenting on the demonstration, Chamber of Deputies  President Frantz Robert Monde said the fact that Haitians cannot  reach an agreement to end the crisis "is sad." Monde added, "we  will never yield under pressure."    Meanwhile, deputies have asked the leaders of the  demonstration to assume their responsibility to prevent threats  against the parliament. The demonstrators demanded parliament be  closed because, according to them, "it is not complying with its  mission."</p>

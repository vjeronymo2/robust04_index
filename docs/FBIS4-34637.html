			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Summit of Naiveties"] </F>   [Text] The Cartagena de Indias summit, the fourth of its  type in the past few years, concluded uneventfully, as can be  said of events that do not have very much importance. The  tournament of rhetoric could not even electrify the attention of  analysts, as every paragraph is a reiterated condemnation of  affairs, topics, and archaic turns of phrases that are already  very well known. The ceremonial opening and closing sessions  were what attracted the television cameras and photographers.  If we had to mention something other than the ritual speeches  by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Argentine President  Carlos Menem, then we would have to say that Fidel Castro's  stylized shirt was a general commentary on the meeting. Since  just after the Sierra Maestra guerrillas entered Havana, he has  never given up dressing in his green uniform. The Cuban  dictator loped through the summit like a protagonist without a  role. He was barely able to draft a paragraph in which he  "bitterly" complained that the Final Declaration (approved by  consensus) did not contain one line on the "American sanctions,"  a topic on which the Argentine foreign minister informally and  correctly said that "Cuba is in a position to buy what it needs  in Canada, Europe, and a large number of other countries." Of  course, the Final Declaration contains chapters on "integration"  in a hemisphere where words deny facts, and outlines its  opposition to any kind of attempt to cause problems regarding  trade links, transactions, and negotiations linked to  production, exports, and exchange of products between the  hemisphere's nations. Finally, it cannot but mention the  Argentine president's move to propose that the Final Declaration  contain a condemnation of the practice of abortion -- currently  being promoted inappropriately by the United Nations -- a motion  that regretably did not receive the hoped for effect.  Nevertheless a valuable precedent remains: that in  international forums our country defends the life that is about  to be born, which is like saying that we are betting on the  future.</p>

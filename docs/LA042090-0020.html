			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT PREVENTIVE PROGRAMS;  </P> <P> UNCLE SAM, MEET YOUR MOTHER EARTH;  </P> <P> THE NATION'S NO. 1 CONSUMER COULD USE ITS PURCHASING POWER TO PERSUADE  PRODUCERS TO SHIFT TO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES.  </P> <P> With Earth Day 1990, the country's commitment to the restoration of our badly  polluted environment reaches a new peak.  </P> <P> But now, 20 years after the original Earth Day, we also know that the task is  much more difficult than it seemed in 1970. After a massive effort to clean up  the environment -- comprehensive environmental laws have been passed, a  detailed system of regulations has been created and about $1 trillion of public  and private money has been spent to meet them -- environmental quality has  hardly improved. In many respects, it is worse. The very few successes -- among  them, the 94% reduction in lead emissions since 1975 and the concurrent drop in  lead levels in the blood of children -- signal the need for a new environmental  strategy. Pollution must be prevented at the point of origin; the production  process that generates it must be changed to eliminate the pollutant (as we did  by switching to unleaded gasoline).  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency has already acknowledged that the present  strategy -- which is based on tacking controls on automobile exhausts, smoke  stacks and effluent pipes -- has failed and has committed itself to "a  preventive program to reduce or eliminate the generation of potentially harmful  pollutants." But this is easier said than done, for it involves the replacement  of the production technologies, largely introduced after World War II, that  have afflicted us with smog (high-compression automobile engines); with  pesticide-laden fruit and vegetables and ground water laced with nitrate  (agriculture heavily based on chemicals); with mounting stores of radioactive  waste and the threat of another Three Mile Island or Chernobyl (the nuclear  industry); with global warming, acid rain and a growing number of oil spills  (the energy industry); with ozone depletion, plastics being littered on beaches  and festooned on trees, and the hundreds of billions of pounds of toxic  chemicals emitted annually into the environment (the chemical industry).  </P> <P> How can we begin this formidable task?  </P> <P> Economists will tell us that the replacement of one production technology by  another represents an investment decision that, in our free-market economy, is  the efficient response to consumers' demands. In practice, producers choose  whatever technology promises to maximize profits and are therefore likely to  resist a change motivated instead by environmental concerns. For example, auto  manufacturers switched to high-compression engines after World War II because  they were needed to power the larger cars that yielded a higher rate of return  than small ones. (As Henry Ford II put it: "Minicars make mini-profits.")  </P> <P> How, then, can individual consumers persuade the auto manufacturers to market a  smogless car driven by an electric motor or a stratified-charge engine (a  high-compression gasoline engine that, unlike conventional ones, produces very  little nitrogen oxides, the substance that triggers the smog reaction)? What  would persuade the minuscule photovoltaic-cell industry to expand enough to  reduce the cost of this pollution-free source of solar electricity to the point  of replacing the present, highly polluting power plants? What would encourage  farmers to shift to organic agriculture, eliminating the environmentally  hazardous chemicals they now use? How could we persuade the very few  manufacturers of recycling and composting facilities to expand so that we can  actually recover the nearly 90% of the trash stream that is recyclable?  </P> <P> There is, in fact, a readily available, effective -- if little used --  instrument that could bring clean, ecologically sound technologies into the  market: the federal government. The government is the nation's single largest  consumer. For example, it buys about 5% of U.S. auto production annually. Its  purchasing power is great enough to persuade producers -- as small as a farmer  or as large as an auto company -- to shift to clean technologies. In some cases  (for example, photovoltaic cells), a federal purchase would lead to economies  of scale that would sharply reduce prices.  </P> <P> The environmental crisis cries out for leadership. Here is a historic  opportunity for exercising it. If President Bush, a self-anointed  environmentalist, wants to really earn his new title, let him issue an  executive order -- Earth Day, this Sunday, is a good day for it -- requiring  that the vast government purchasing power be directed toward smogless cars and  trucks, solar energy sources, organic fruits and vegetables, recycled paper and  all the other products of the clean, sustainable technologies that are our one  hope for making peace with the planet.  </P></p>

Neither the statute nor the conference committee report mentions individuals diagnosed as mentally retarded. However, States may request the authority to provide these services to the mentally retarded under the broader waiver authority of section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act as ``other'' services. The ``other'' services category has been in existence since the home and community-based services waiver program was established, and HCFA has approved a variety of services under this category that States establish as cost-effective and necessary to avoid institutionalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Provisions of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are adopting the proposed provisions, with minor editorial changes, as final rules. We have also redesignated &sect;441.302(i) as &sect;441.302(j) to accommodate other revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Scope of Respite Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act, a State may provide respite care under its home and community-based waiver services program. Respite care may be provided in institutional and noninstitutional settings. However, under existing regulations at &sect;441.310, FFP is not available for the cost of room and board, except when provided as part of respite care in a State-approved facility that is not a private residence. Because respite care generally should be a short-term service, we have required States to fully document the need for more than 30 days of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed &sect;440.180(b)(7), in accordance with section 1915(c)(4) of the Act, we imposed a 30-day limitation on the duration of institutional respite care services provided during a waiver year to any individual under a waiver program. We indicated in the proposed rule that we were not placing a limit on noninstitutional respite care but that we would closely review all waiver applications that requested noninstitutional respite care in excess of 30 days per waiver year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : We have traditionally used the term ``waiver year'' for any 12-month period for which a waiver applies. While we recognize that the statute uses the term ``fiscal year'', we have not had a problem with our use of ``waiver year'' for ``fiscal year''. Since the term ``waiver year'' is generally understood and accepted by those involved in the waiver process, we are continuing to use it in the Medicaid regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that a switch from the term ``waiver year'' to ``fiscal year'' would cause unnecessary confusion.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsequent to the publication of the proposed rule, section 4742(d)(l) of OBRA '90 amended section 1915(c)(4) of the Act to eliminate restrictions on the number of hours or days of respite care that a State may provide in any period under a waiver as long as the State continues to show cost-neutrality in its waiver program. (``Cost-neutrality'' means that the average per capita expenditures for individuals under waivers does not exceed what the average per capita expenditures for these individuals would have been if the waiver had not been granted.) Section 4742(d)(2) of OBRA '90 specifies that the changes under section 4742(d)(1) apply as if included under OBRA '81, the original legislation for the waiver program, enacted August 13, 1981.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We received the following public comments on this proposal:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Six commenters expressed concerns about the proposed 30-day limit on institutional respite care. Two commenters indicated that room and board should be included under noninstitutional respite care. Three commenters indicated that the 30-day limit is too strict; two recommended a 60-day limit and one a 90-day limit. One of the commenters who recommended a 60-day limit also recommended a 2-week limit on consecutive weeks of institutional respite care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

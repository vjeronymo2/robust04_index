He believes that a request to Washington to supply ground  troops will lack credibility as long as Europe fails to honor  its own agreements.    Lubbers was reacting Friday [7 January] to the call by the  [Netherlands] House of Representatives for a substantial U.S.  military presence in Bosnia because the present force there is  inadequate. The question of Bosnia will feature on the agenda  of the NATO summit to be held 10-11 January in Brussels.    "In principle, the United States must participate," Lubbers  said in the Second Chamber on Friday. "It is more credible,  however, if Europe first provides extra troops itself."    The PvdA [Labor Party] and VVD [People's Party for Freedom  and Democracy] are rallying behind French Defense Minister  Philippe Leotard, who intends to ask Washington to intervene in  order to protect the citizens of Bosnia and to provide them with  more aid. Foreign Minister Kooijmans described the French  statements as hypocritical.    The United States only wants to provide large quantities of  ground troops to the UN force when the warring factions have  concluded a peace settlement. At present, the United States is  only participating in air operations over Bosnia.    National Defense Minister Ter Beek said the Netherlands is  still prepared to send a battalion of the airborne brigade to  the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica. The previously  planned departure was postponed because Serbian troops are  completely blocking access to the "safe areas."    During the extra committee meeting, the House of  Representatives also debated the topic of NATO expansion, with  the government parties CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and  PvdA putting pressure on Lubbers and Kooijmans to bring forward,  during the NATO summit, the date of NATO membership for Poland,  the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. According to the CDA  and PvdA, NATO must speed up its expansion before the Russian  extreme nationalism of Zhirinovskiy takes hold over those  countries.    Under the leadership of the United States, NATO is not in  favor of rapidly granting membership to former East Bloc  countries. NATO does not want to go further than a "Partnership  for Peace," comprising closer political and military cooperation.    Lubbers said NATO should not allow itself to be led by fear  of the far right. He merely wants Russia to have its fair share  of participation in the "responsibilities and opportunities" of  the partnership.    According to Lubbers, the formula for cooperation currently  on offer presents brighter prospects for a "gradual" expansion  of NATO. That process must begin next week, he said, and allow  for the possibility of membership in the long term, "because it  has to sound promising," continued Lubbers.    There is no indication yet how long the countries of East  Europe will have to wait for membership, Minister Kooijmans  said. "The tempo depends on the participation of the various  countries involved. That will emerge in due course."</p>

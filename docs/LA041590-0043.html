			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COURTROOM CRUNCH  </P> <P> Recently you reported (March 28) that San Diego County is considering the use  of collection agencies and private investigators to collect 600,000 outstanding  traffic warrants.  </P> <P> Then you report that many of our judges are shopping-cart judges, moving from  court to court because of lack of space and no money to build new court space.  </P> <P> If you multiply the outstanding unpaid fines by $30, a number I suspect is low,  that amounts to $18 million.  </P> <P> I think we should stop "considering" what to do about $18 million our traffic  violators cheerfully ignore. Our active pursuit of this money should reduce the  number of traffic violations, increase the confidence of our police, and maybe  even provide us with some court space for our overworked judges.  </P> <P> CARTER DARNELL  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

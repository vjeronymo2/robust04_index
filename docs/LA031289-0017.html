			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> BELIEVE IT OR DON'T: Whenever Harry Dean Stanton performs, he draws a crowd.  And his Club Lingerie show last weekend was no exception, drawing such celebs  as Jack Nicholson (wearing his shades and touting the Lakers), Sam Shepard and  Penny Marshall. . . . Who's the last person you'd want flying the friendly  skies of your neighborhood? (Make that the last person after Axl Rose.) Our  vote goes to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, who has been prodding vocalist  Steven Tyler into writing more songs for the group's next album by buzzing his  Massachusetts home in the morning at the helm of his private plane, the  "Warrior." "It's my idea of a wake-up call," insists Perry, who said the band  travels to Vancouver, Canada, in April to begin work on a new album. . . . If  you like Israeli pop, of which Ofra Haza is the latest hip practitioner, then  perhaps you would want to sample the charms of Egyptian pop, which will waft  across the KCRW-FM airwaves Wednesday at 10 a.m. on Tom Schnabel's "Morning  Becomes Eclectic." Special guest Samir Hachim (an entertainment writer) will  offer "New Sounds from the Middle East," with new songs from such Egyptian  popsters Ali Hmida, Mohammad Munir and Ali Hajjar.  </P></p>

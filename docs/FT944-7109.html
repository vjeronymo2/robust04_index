			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Tokyo breaks silence over plutonium stocks The Japanese government disclosed the country's plutonium stockpiles for the first time yesterday in an effort to increase transparency of its nuclear fuel programme. Tokyo has long been secretive about its ambitious plutonium programme on grounds of security. However, concern over its plutonium policy was aired last year by some Japanese MPs, ahead of the British government's authorisation of the controversial launch of British Nuclear Fuel's Thorp plant at Sellafield. They opposed the start of Thorp's operations, claiming that Japan, a leading customer of the nuclear reprocessing plant, would be left holding excessive amounts of plutonium. International concern over global nuclear proliferation and heightened criticism over North Korea's nuclear developments have also prompted the Tokyo government to provide more information to the public. The stocks were listed in the nuclear energy white paper put together by the Science and Technology Agency. Agency officials said the amounts had been disclosed to reconfirm the government's plan of not holding more plutonium than the programme required. The white paper said 1,286kg of plutonium were held in the UK and 4,911kg in France at the end of last year. Since Japan has as yet no fully fledged commercial-use reprocessing facilities, British Nuclear Fuel and Cogema of France are reprocessing nuclear fuel into plutonium. Of the 4,684kg held in Japan, 326kg were situated at reprocessing facilities in Tokai, north of Tokyo, and 3,269kg at the site's fuel fabrication facilities. A further 1,089kg were at the country's fast breeder reactors. The government's announcement comes ahead of the shipment next February of high density nuclear waste originating from Japanese used nuclear fuel processed by Cogema. A total of 28 stainless steel containers of nuclear waste moulded together with glass will be shipped back to Japan from France.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs may see papers on Iraq policy meeting PAPERS RELATING to a ministerial meeting at which it was decided to recommend revising the government's policy on British exports to Iraq may be made available to MPs after Mr Michael Heseltine's reference to them in Monday night's Commons debate. The trade and industry secretary alluded to the papers in connection with a suggestion made by Labour's Mr Robin Cook that the government may never have intended to announce such a change to parliament. He said they showed that Mr Cook was 'diametrically wrong' and that ministers had concluded that any change should be announced. Mr Heseltine's use of the papers prompted interventions from Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, who said that where government documents were quoted 'they must be placed on the table of the House'. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said yesterday that the whole of the document from which Mr Heseltine quoted would be 'laid before the House'. The meeting - on July 19 1990, just two weeks before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait - recommended that policy be revised without permitting the export of lethal equipment. In a separate development, it also emerged that Mr Heseltine asked for changes to the 'public interest immunity' certificate for which he was responsible. It referred to papers the government wanted to be kept secret in the Matrix Churchill trial. His decision to insist on alterations before he signed has further encouraged his supporters to believe he will be cleared completely by Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq affair. But the differences between Mr Heseltine's certificate and those signed by three other government ministers may raise questions about why similar fears were not raised by his colleagues. Mr Heseltine made clear that 'whether in fact all or part of any individual document or documents should be disclosed is a matter for the court'. He stressed it was up to the court to decide if 'there is a counter-vailing public interest that the requirements of doing justice in this case require their (the documents') disclosure'. He also stressed that he believed he had no choice but to sign.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Expected benefits of Uruguay Round may not materialise Sir, Richard Blackhurst (Letters, August 2) reinforces the uncritical assertions made by countless commentators and the media that the signing of the Uruguay Round will result in an income gain of around Dollars 200bn. The implication is almost that 12 months after the ink is dry the benefits of such an order will accrue. The reality of the actual study and the opinions of its critics are very different. The much quoted Dollars 200bn figure comes from a 40-page OECD study which the organisation's secretary-general, Jean Claude-Paye, has called a 'pretty theoretical study'. He was also highly critical of the way the media had made extensive use of the figure while ignoring the corollary that it would take ten years to achieve the gains and that some nations, particularly in the developing world, would be hurt. In a similarly critical article on the study, the Wall Street Journal quoted the authors themselves as saying that 'they've been misunderstood and that people are hoping for the moon'. It has also been admitted that the model used was not an economic forecast model and so could not answer questions about what effect the conclusion of the round could have on the current world recession. At the end of the day, of course, the real question is not how many computer guesstimates can you get on a pinhead, but what the actual effects of a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round will be for the world's poor, its unemployed and for the environment. Outside computer programmes and in the real world, people are increasingly aware that it will make things worse. Their growing response is perhaps best encapsulated by the Indian slogan of 'Home Rule Not Gatt Rule.' Colin Hines, 11 Park House Gardens, East Twickenham, Middlesex TW1 2DF</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / European plug plan 'puts 1,350 jobs at risk' Britain's largest maker of electrical plugs and sockets warned this week that the adoption of European standards could mean a 'dramatic shift' to Far East production, with the possible loss of 90 per cent of its 1,500 UK manufacturing jobs. Mr Malcolm Mullins, technical executive of MK Electric, told a meeting of the Institution of Electrical Engineers that another option for the company would be to stop plug production altogether. Unless the UK applies for an exemption, the system of 13-amp plugs and sockets is under threat from a proposed 'plug for Europe' with two round pins. Documents describing the new system will be sent in September to 18 European countries and will be voted on standards authorities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "Who Won and Who </F> Lost"]    [Text] Who won and who lost yesterday when party leaders  met with the finance minister to discuss the final details of  the bill that creates the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]?  Undoubtedly the taxpayers did not win, and possibly the PPR  [Progressive Renewal Party] lost as well despite Sandra  Cavalcanti's announcement that she was not going to obstruct the  amendment any more because the changes she had asked for had  been accepted. Politically speaking, Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso may also be considered a loser because part of  the agreement with the PPR was not fulfilled, either through  technicalities related to congressional regulations or  misunderstandings by Senator Espiridao Amin. Be that as it may,  unless the effort to increase revenues surpasses that of Dona  Maria I, The Demented, who levied taxes that led to the  execution of Tiradentes [reference to Queen Mary I of Portugal  who ordered a large portion of Brazilian gold be transferred to  Portugal, prompting the bid for independence that led to the  execution of one of its leaders Joaquim Jose da Silva Xavier  Tiradentes in 1792], we are bound to conclude that it will be  difficult to balance the budget if salaries of public servants  and military men are not frozen at 93 levels (in real-terms, of  course) -- the Law on Budget Guidelines [LDO] lifts the  requirement to withhold 20 percent of education-related salaries  -- and at the same time approves housing expenditures three  times above 1992 levels. Balancing the budget under these  conditions will be made especially difficult since the executive  branch agreed to remove from the amendment the article which  empowered the administration to cut the budget whenever revenues  fell short of expenditures.    The administration managed to prove it can control Congress,  although the finance minister was forced to make a few  concessions in the LDO. The congressional advisers of the  military ministries (who acted openly in favor of salary hikes  for public servants in 1994 and 1995) made their objective very  clear -- and they won. Everything has been approved and it is  now up to the banks to pay up and balance the budget, and the  Federal Revenue will carry on. The votes cast last night have  led to a partial success in the effort to correct, during the  next two years, some of the imbalances that the 1988  Constitution inflicted on the distribution of revenues and  services between the Federal Government, the states, and the  municipalities, and to reduce (or eliminate) the allocation of  certain percentages of the revenue to specific expenditures  which slowed down the implementation of any government policy.  It remains to be seen whether, after enduring a lot of pain  from the Budget Investigating Committee, Congress has not  managed -- in a roundabout way without actually setting down  anything in writing -- to change the budget from discretionary  to compulsory by removing from the executive branch the  possibility of cutting expenditures if there are not enough  revenues. Let us not be deluded by the praise that will be  lavished on Congress for its patriotism and on the minister for  his unselfishness. The FSE amendment will come up for the  second vote on 23 February. A formal vote will also take place  on the same day for the promulgation. The finance minister also  hopes to see the final text of the amendment published in the 24  February issue of the official gazette. There is a little  problem that must be solved first before the executive branch  can implement its economic recovery plan without first getting  approval for the budget: Some parties want the Federal Supreme  Court [STF] to decide if it is constitutional to promulgate one  amendment after another. These parties believe the process of  constitutional revision requires that all, we repeat all,  approved amendments should be promulgated at the same time so as  to have a coherent Constitution to which the people can refer at  any time. Should the STF rule in favor of these parties, where  will that leave the finance minister's plan?    Even though the minister obtained a victory at the plenary  meeting, the bill that was approved was different from the  original one -- especially as far as compulsory transfer of  funds is concerned. The minister and his advisers did not  manage to fully reverse this situation, which Minister Cardoso  himself severely criticized in his 7 February speech.  Approximately 80 percent of federal revenues are committed to  compulsory transfers or fixed obligations leaving the executive  branch only 20 percent to carry out its programs. In this  aspect, which was essential for the success of the initial plan,  the minister was defeated. We could also say that the efforts  of General Romildo Canhim, the federal administration secretary,  to institute some discipline in the pay scales of civilian and  military public servants were also seriously jeopardized by the  fact that it is quite possible there will be real salary hikes  in 1994 and 1995 (which was forbidden in the original bill).  The victory of the executive branch, although showing some rays  of hope, should not lead us to believe that the war against  inflation has been won. Several battles lie ahead, the worst  being defining whether it is constitutional to promulgate the  amendment that establishes the FSE before the constitutional  revision is concluded. The road ahead is fraught with surprises.</p>

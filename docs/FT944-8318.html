			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Management: Why do you deserve to be paid so much? / A look at moves to counter recent criticism of big bonuses by establishing a better link with performance The search for an equitable formula for top executive pay has acquired a new urgency this autumn, as pressure mounts on directors to curb embarrassingly high pay rises. This month, it was the turn of Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the Confederation of British Industry, to criticise 'increases and performance bonuses which are not only well above inflation, but also out of proportion with the rewards received by the workforce for the company's performance'. So far, companies have failed to provide an adequate justification for the rewards they pay top executives. The link between pay rises and performance of the UK's largest companies is non-existent, according to a study by Graef Crystal, a US pay expert. Interest in the issue has also been heightened by pressure on companies to remedy shortcomings as many of the 10-year share option schemes introduced from 1984 come to an end. Large, poorly-designed, incentive packages can be a problem, rather than a solution. The provision of performance-related bonuses on top of share options is 'divisive, inflationary and . . . greed-promoting', according to Sir Owen Green, former chairman of BTR. A similar debate is raging in the US, where the rewards to top executives have escalated rapidly in recent years, often helped by multi-million-dollar share option gains. Intense controversy has been aroused by attempts to regulate executive pay more tightly and by proposed changes to the accounting treatment of share options. Salaries are now subject to greater disclosure and higher taxes on that share of the income which exceeds Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year and is not performance linked. Preoccupation with the size of executive rewards seems to be largely an Anglo/American phenomenon, but the popularity of share options has spilled into France, where companies have been quick to spot their tax advantages. 'Options have become practically the most significant element of executive compensation,' says Eduardo de Martino, a partner with accountants Arthur Andersen in Paris. 'You can't really recruit or retain a high-quality executive without them.' In most other European countries, the culture of share options has yet to develop, although bonuses are commonplace. In Italy, for instance, where the small- and medium-sized enterprises which form the backbone of the Italian economy are not listed on the stock exchange, top Italian directors may receive up to 25 or 30 per cent of their remuneration in the form of cash bonuses. The fiercest debates about executive pay, however, are taking place in the US and UK, which both have highly developed stockmarkets and where the influence of any individual shareholder on company directors is relatively weak. Much of the debate stems from the desire of institutional shareholders to ensure that top managers are focused on their investors' interests. The rise of the professional manager means that 'the investing institutions demand a check on the otherwise unfettered power of the executives, who might be tempted to live well at the shareholders' expense', according to Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel Investment Management. Not everyone accepts that shareholders can extract a better performance from senior executives by paying for results. Alfie Kohn, a US management theorist, believes that the motivational theory underpinning this doctrine is 'profoundly wrong-headed'. The Pensions and Investment Research Council, which advises UK institutions on corporate governance issues, thinks that incentives for senior executives are inequitable and encourage short-term thinking. The idea that incentives should be an integral part of top managers' pay packets, however, has become entrenched. Share option schemes, which typically allow senior executives to buy shares (worth up to four times their salary) at today's price in three years' time, are used by 98 per cent of FT-SE 100 and Mid 250 Index companies, according to New Bridge Street Consultants. Even the Labour party's proposal to remove tax concessions from share options is unlikely to dislodge them, it believes. Nonetheless, share options have come under increasing fire. The Association of British Insurers believes that they 'may not provide the long-term motivation to high performance that was intended when they were introduced. Options have not created long-term shareholders, since they are usually exercised, and the shares sold, at the first possible opportunity. The most powerful criticism of share options is that they are based on a fallacious linkage between share price and management performance. In a bull market, executives with options stand to gain no matter how poor the company's relative performance has been. Conversely, in a bear market, a strong performance would not be recognised. Moreover, there is no downside if the share price falls after a disastrous performance; the options simply expire worthless. This inability to punish failure in the same way as they reward success can distort company policy. 'You might decide as a company to make acquisitions to make the share price go up. If it goes wrong you have not lost anything,' says Brian Friedman, head of compensation and benefits at Arthur Andersen. But these arguments do not convince everybody. Brian Main, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, argues that the portrayal of options as lacking downside risk neglects the fact that they have a real value when they are issued, which can be calculated using pricing formulae. Yet this solution depends on finding agreement on an acceptable method of valuing executive share options, which is fraught with difficulty. When the Accounting Standards Board wrestled with the issue earlier this year, it concluded that it was not practical to include a 'meaningful' money value of options in the accounts. In the US, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is mired in controversy as it grapples with the same issue. It, however, is expected to conclude that executive options can be valued and should be treated as a cost that should be set against profits in a company's accounts. This debate about valuation influences another controversial area of the debate about incentives - namely, whether performance criteria should be used as qualifying hurdles when managers exercise their options. The Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds have decided to insist on performance conditions for options schemes to ensure that rewards are for real performance rather than mediocrity. Main argues that hurdles are illogical. Since they merely lower the initial value of the option because of the lower probability of subsequent profitable exercise, it has 'little net effect other than creating a bureaucratic complexity'. M&amp;G, the institutional investor, has resisted the introduction of performance conditions for other reasons. 'We are firmly of the view that performance benchmarks for the exercise of options may not be in the best interests of shareholders,' says Paddy Linaker, then managing director, in February. His arguments rest on the arbitrary nature of a particular performance yardstick and the potential conflicts of interest it can present. 'There is a real danger that some companies, in their search for benchmarks, will choose guidelines that are too demanding and which will result in unwise corporate strategies being pursued,' he says. Over two thirds of the 38 companies which have published benchmarks for their options schemes since July 1993 have opted for earnings per share targets, according to a new study. However, they have the weakness that they can be manipulated through changes in accounting procedures. The other most common measures are based on share price or total shareholder return. Their main disadvantage is that options gains are already linked to the growth in the share price. In a few cases, other types of measures are being considered. Bradford Property Trust, for instance, has plumped for conditions based either on earnings per share or net asset value. BP, which considers that fluctuations in oil prices and exchange rates rule out share price and earnings per share, is considering using a measure that compares its own return to shareholders against that of the other oil majors. Other possibilities, based on concepts such as cash generation or return on capital, have been proposed by compensation consultants. As well as tinkering with their share option schemes, an increasing number of companies are experimenting with an alternative, the long-term incentive plan. These are schemes which reward management for performance over an extended period with cash or shares. Supporters of these schemes argue that they can neatly be tied to performance, without being subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Reuters has announced a scheme which awards shares to executives at the beginning of the performance period, which are released at the end of five years, subject to a strong showing on total shareholder returns. No shares are released if Reuters is ranked in the last 25 companies in the FT-SE 100, but all are released if it is in the top 40, with a graduated release between these two points. Long-term incentive plans are arguably an improvement on share option plans, but risk being discredited if they are introduced as yet another hand-out to top executives on top of what they already got. Benefits are potentially large. 'A maximum award of between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of salary is becoming fairly common,' according to New Bridge Street Consultants. Moreover, all but one of the 76 FT-SE 100 and Mid 250 Index index companies that have adopted incentive plans are using them in addition to their option schemes. Potentially, incentive plans are open to abuse. There is no formal institutional shareholder limit on individual participation and they do not normally require shareholder consent. Moreover, although awards are eventually disclosed as directors' emoluments, this is long after they were awarded and the amounts are often inadequately explained in terms of performance. This highlights the broader case for more rigorous rules about the disclosure of executive pay. In the US, the SEC, the securities regulator, introduced a requirement in 1992 for each firm to disclose its top executives' pay, together with the firm's performance over the last five years, compared with a relative index of a peer group of companies. 'The implications have been far-reaching,' says Peter Chingos of KPMG Peat Marwick. 'It puts a significant amount of responsibility on a company to demonstrate the relationship between pay and performance.' Clearer and more detailed explanation of top executives' pay in the UK would, on its own, do little to calm the public's disquiet. But by putting greater pressure on executives to justify their salaries, it might lead to more restraint on basic pay and more carefully designed incentive packages. In the meantime, however, the escalation of top executives' pay will be seen by many as serving nobody's interests but their own. Additional reporting by Andrew Hill and Andrew Jack.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In our judgment, there is no reason to establish presumptive service connection for ``pigmentation abnormalities of the skin'' because these abnormalities would be obvious from the time of the exposure to vesicant agents rather than occurring many years after exposure, as in the case of cancer. Also, because the usual places for mustard gas burns are areas of the body which are not visible, i.e., moist areas of the body such as the groin and axilla, rather than exposed areas as in the case of sunburn, most pigmentation abnormalities resulting from these burns would not be considered disabling, unless they interfered with the veteran's ability to function. In this regard, there is no mention in the NAS report of vitiligo-type lesions, which are usually considered to be disabling because they are disfiguring. Since compensation is only payable for a disability resulting from an injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty or from aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease contracted in line of duty (See 38 U.S.C. 1110, 1121, 1131, and 1310), and since exposure to vesicant agents does not cause a type of pigmentation abnormality which is disabling, we do not propose to include pigmentation abnormalities of the skin in the regulation. However, we propose to include scar formation in the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the respiratory conditions VA had previously recognized, NAS found that the evidence indicated a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NAS further found that all these respiratory conditions could also result from exposure to Lewisite, another vesicant agent. We are proposing to provide service connection for a chronic form of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as a result of exposure to mustard gas or Lewisite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, NAS determined that the evidence indicated a causal relationship exists between exposure to nitrogen mustard and the subsequent development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Based on that information, we propose to provide service connection for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia as a result of exposure to nitrogen mustard only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAS also found evidence that indicates a causal relationship between mustard gas exposure and the subsequent development of bone marrow depression, immunosuppression, psychological disorders, and sexual dysfunction, but we do not propose to allow presumptive service connection for these conditions. Bone marrow depression and immunosuppression are acute effects that may have resulted in greater susceptibility to infections with a possibility of damage to vital organ systems. Since these acute effects would have resolved within a relatively short period, however, any related infection would have occurred in service or shortly thereafter and an adequate regulatory framework to establish direct service connection already exists. Psychological disorders may result from traumatic or stressful features of the exposure experience, but are not a toxic effect of the agents themselves. An adequate regulatory framework currently exists to establish service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of exposure to vesicant agents. Establishing a presumption of service connection for sexual dysfunction would serve no purpose, since sexual dysfunction is not compensated under VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR Part 4) but rather under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k), which provides special monthly compensation for the loss or loss of use of a creative organ. Special monthly compensation is a benefit established by Congress, not by VA regulation, and is therefore beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were two other categories of findings in the NAS report. NAS found that the evidence was ``suggestive'' of a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and reproductive dysfunction (genotoxicity, mutagenicity, etc.) and exposure to sulfur mustard and leukemia. NAS found insufficient evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and gastrointestinal diseases, hematologic diseases, neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and for reproductive dysfunction as a result of exposure to Lewisite. As NAS itself indicates, further study in these areas is necessary and in our judgment, the scientific and medical evidence on the whole does not support the establishment of presumptions for these conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

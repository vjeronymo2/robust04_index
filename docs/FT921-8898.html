			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock savages PM over jobless figures - Recession MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday seized on the sharp rise in unemployment and home repossessions to tear into the government's failure to take measures to counteract the recession. In a ferocious attack on the Tory leadership the Labour leader used Commons questions to add his voice to a concerted onslaught by his frontbench team aimed at charging Mr John Major and his government with complacency. When the prime minister conceded that the new unemployment figures were 'disappointing', Mr Kinnock replied that for the 2.6m people now out of work the figures were not disappointing but 'absolutely devastating'. Gesturing at Mr Major across the despatch box, he accused the prime minister of crossing his fingers and closing his eyes to the effects of the slowdown. 'Why does he just sit there and do absolutely nothing to combat the devastation?' he asked. His criticism was echoed by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, who said the government, paralysed by the election, 'dodges the issues and does nothing'. Countering the attacks, Mr Major said that worthwhile training schemes were now helping 250,000 unemployed people. He emphasised that 300,000 people were 'leaving unemployment' every month and condemned Labour's proposals for a minimum wage, a payroll tax and a general increase in taxation. Their introduction would 'spell disaster for this economy, disaster for companies and permanent unemployment for millions of people'. The clash came after Labour campaign organisers confirmed that the party now plans to concentrate its pre-election fire on what it sees as the government's dogged refusal to take steps to relieve the impact of the recession. One said: 'First, we must ram home the point again and again that the recession is not letting up, then we will turn to the point that the government is doing nothing about it.' Earlier, senior Labour frontbenchers used a news conference to highlight the continuing rise in unemployment and the mortgage crisis. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said independent analysts now believed home repossessions for mortgage arrears were likely to hit 80,000 this year. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, seized on the new unemployment figures to claim that 'the colossal incompetence of Tory economic management' meant almost 1m people had been added to the dole queues since the recession had begun. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, listed predictions by business associations ranging from the Confederation of British Industry to the Building Employers Confederation forecasting further job losses. Demanding pre-budget measures to boost investment and training, he said the CBI had forecast the loss of about 200,000 manufacturing jobs alone. Indignation at the continued economic gloom could not disguise Labour's conviction that the recession might prove the key factor in the general election. Labour has tabled a debate on the recession for next Wednesday - the second in a month. The Tories look set to concentrate on Labour's links with the unions with a debate on Tuesday.</p>

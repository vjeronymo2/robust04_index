			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Money Markets: Flying futures European markets yesterday made up for the complete lack of certainty about the present by confidently betting on future interest rate cuts, writes Stephanie Flanders. In France, the September Pibor contract rose a full 96 basis points, closing in Europe at 93.72, while in Germany, September Euro-marks gained 13 points to finish in Frankfurt at around 93.47. Less dramatically, perhaps, trading in sterling futures also caught the mood, with September sterling up 8 basis points at 94.42 as the week ended. Pibor contract's giddy rise was driven by the belief that, come what may, interest rates would be lower in France by the autumn. With the French franc still within the ERM at the end of trading, the expectation of lower rates could clearly not be reflected in lower french money market rates, which remained high throughout the day. 'This kind of very sharply inverted curve right down the money market curve is just what you would expect,' said one London-based analyst. 'Forward rates have to be much lower because we know rates will fall. But we're still in the dark about the ERM.' French and German futures were further helped during the afternoon by a Bundesbank council member's assertion that the German repo rate could fall below the official discount rate. In Frankfurt, cash rates were softened by the effect of mass central bank interventions. These have produced vast quantities of liquidity which the German authorities made no effort to remove yesterday in any issue of treasury bills. Trading in sterling futures appeared to be following events in Europe, although at least one London analyst considered the market to be making a mistake. 'If the ERM breaks down,' he said, 'that should mean lower rates in Europe, which will provide a stimulus to economic activity. To the extent that it was lack of demand that worried the CBI earlier this week, I do not see why lower European rates should signal a UK base rate cut before October.' On balance, the UK markets still seem to favour a cut in official interest rates between the September and December contracts, as is indicated by the spread between the two futures contracts. At the end of Friday the gap stood at around 34 basis points, compared to 25 points on Wednesday.</p>

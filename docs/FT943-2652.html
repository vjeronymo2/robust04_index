			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Outnumbered by 30 to one - Rugby Union Complaining about the umpire or referee is one of sport's most enduring traditions. In whatever game, at whatever level, the man charged with the duty of judgment finds himself the scapegoat for everyone else's rage and disappointment. On the village green, the opening bat stares with theatrical disbelief at the man in the white coat who has had the nerve to give him out lbw, then stalks off, muttering and expostulating. I have seen a ref who disallowed a goal in a Slough Industrial League Division Three soccer match knocked to the ground for his troubles. At Wimbledon, a tennis official in a panama hat is expected to smile politely on his stool while some oafish super-ego swears at him over a foot fault. But in no game, I would suggest, is the lot of the referee more difficult than in rugby union. He has to put up with all the abuse and unpleasantness which law enforcement provokes in any game. But in addition, the interpretation of laws and the detection of infringement is particularly difficult in rugby. I know because I have done it, twice. Of the second occasion I can remember little, except that it was disfigured by one of those ludicrous brawls which are a time-honoured characteristic of coarse rugby. I brought it to an end - rather brilliantly, I thought by lifting one of the protagonists off the ground by his collar. The first, though, was a fiasco from start to finish. I was somewhat handicapped because I had left my spectacles in the changing room, which meant that everything happening more than 20 yards from me was little more than a blur. But the chief problem was that, even when I was on hand for ruck or maul or scrum, I could not work out what was going on. Amid the churning mass of bodies, the ball was sometimes visible, sometimes not. At any moment, it seemed that almost everyone was committing some kind of offence. This presented me with a choice between non-stop whistle-blowing  -necessitating an instant choice of whose illegality was the grossest - and quiescent inactivity. I varied erratically between these two courses, and thus fell into disrepute. Whatever I did was wrong, and the entire match unfolded to the accompaniment of an incessant chorus of complaint. Bereft of authority, I became disillusioned and a sad hate-figure on a dank Sunday afternoon. At the end, my own team secured ignoble victory with a try which came - so my own chums cheerfully confided to me afterwards - from a pass which was a good yard-and-a-half forward. I did not know the rules, of course. Nor was I in a minority at the lowly level at which I played. We may have had a vague apprehension of the guiding principles which informed the code. But of the detail we were appallingly ignorant. And even when we did know a particular rule, we had no inhibition about breaking it, nor about protesting long and loud if we were detected. Now the laws are even more complicated than they were then, and the game is afflicted more than ever by this combination of ignorance and wilful lawlessness. And who gets the blame for the resulting shambles? Is it the players, who trample on the rules, or the lawmakers who dreamt them up? No, it is the man charged with enforcing them. Thus we had the preposterous spectacle of the players from Bath and Wasps excoriating the referee for ruining what should have been one of the showpieces of the last league season. His crime was that he had had the nerve to whistle up for a mere 48 out of the uncountable offences committed during 80 minutes of ill-natured anarchy. Pity the poor ref. It is not his fault that the game should have sunk into a grey swamp of well-intentioned but unenforceable regulations; nor that players at all levels should have become so expert in exploiting the vulnerability of his position. The miracle is that rugby union should still be capable of producing moments of clean, incomparable exhilaration. The almost hysterical ecstasy which greeted Underwood's try against Wales, Geoghehan's against England, Quinnell's against France in the last batch of home internationals, is dire evidence of their rarity and the unhappy pass this great game has got itself into.</p>

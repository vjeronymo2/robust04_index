			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Loktev: "They Are Not Striking Against </F> The Good Life"]    [Text] Strike. This alarming and threatening word burst  into our lives during the summer of 1989. It was at this time  that the Kuznets Basin miners, driven to despair, revealed to  the dissatisfied authorities the true meaning of the term worker  solidarity.    Over the past five years, millions of workers in dozens of  branches participated in strikes as an extreme measure of  protest in the struggle for their rights. They gradually became  a common social phenomenon throughout the expanses of Russia and  the CIS, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is increasing in  scale.    An unprecedented "strike flare-up" was recorded by the  Russian Federation Goskomstat [State Statistical Committee]  during the first quarter of this year: these strikes involved  288 enterprises, or 24 more than during all of 1993.    The statistical table included herein enables a reader to  determine for himself the degree to which strike activity has  increased (data for the first quarter of 1993 and 1994).                      Number of             Number of              Losses in                    enterprises that      participants,          working time,                    participated in       thousands of people,   thousands of                    strikes, 1993, 1994   1993, 1994             man-days, 1993,                                                                 1994   Overall           29         288        18.2       114.5      34.2     283.1   Industry          28         137        17.9       87.4       33.2     168.6   Including:   Fuel              27         135        17.5       87.0       30.3     167.1   Education         -          137        -          24.7       -        107.2   Construction      -          7          -          1.3        -        4.7   Transport and     1          4          0.3        0.7        1.0      2.0  Communications   Other branches    -          3          -          0.4        -        0.6      There is no need for commenting upon these figures, since  they speak for themselves. Compared to the first quarter of last  year, the number of strikes increased by a factor of 10.3!    According to data provided by Mintrud [Ministry of Labor],  the indicators for labor conflicts and disputes are even more  striking. Since the beginning of the year, they have been  recorded at 1,356 enterprises, organizations and institutions  throughout Russia.    As for losses, so far this year, as a result of strikes (not  counting enterprise idle time caused by other factors), the  output of the fuel-energy complex declined by 8.8 billion  rubles' worth of product. As a result of deliberate cessation of  operations, 88 enterprises failed to deliver more than 3.5  billion rubles' worth of contracted goods. The greatest losses  from strikes occurred in the Komi Republic, western Siberia and  in Kemerovo, Tula and Tostov oblasts.    The principal causes of these strikes and labor conflicts  are  well known: decline in production volumes, financial crisis,  non-payments in mutual accounts, and particularly --  considerable indebtedness of the federal budget and numerous  delays in wage payments for workers in the "basic" branches.    According to data furnished by the General Trade Union  Conference, the overall wage indebtedness for the CIS on the  whole, for the month of March, amounted to approximately three  trillion rubles. In Russia alone, the workers at 35,000  enterprises failed to receive the money for their labor in a  timely manner.    It must be assumed that, following numerous meetings between  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and representatives of striking  organizations, the government is striving if not to eliminate  entirely then at least slow down those processes which promote  strikes. It was by no means an accident that, on 11 February,  Viktor Stepanovich, during a meeting with miners, stated  directly: wage indebtedness will be eliminated gradually (and  this is being accomplished -- V.L.). And he added: "The question  of whether or not to strike does not disturb me. The problem  lies in the fact that we are unable to handle correctly that  which is at our disposal." It is hoped that this time the  government will keep its word and strive to suppress the wave of  strikes using economic measures. Nevertheless, it is my opinion  that the severity of the strike movement (with varying degrees  of activity depending upon the branch involved) will continue in  the immediate future. This is so, owing to the fact that the  problems being resolved will be replaced by other equally  alarming problems.    For example, one such problem among miners is the threat of  unemployment: the closing down of exhausted and unprofitable  mines, with no new jobs being created. Moreover, work is simply  dangerous at a number of mines: the equipment is worn out to an  extreme and the prices for new items of equipment are ruinous.  Funds are simply not available for maintaining the mines in safe  operating condition. Hence we are encountering one tragedy after  another involving human victims.    Yes, miners are perishing owing to intolerable working  conditions and neglect of the basic safety requirements. In  Moscow Oblast alone, 48 individuals perished at their working  positions over a period of three months -- considerably more  than the figure for last year.    Not only the government, but also all authoritative  structures in Russia should recall one basic truth: a strike is  not waged against the good life. The main question is how life  can be changed for the better in a more rapid, effective and  realistic manner.</p>

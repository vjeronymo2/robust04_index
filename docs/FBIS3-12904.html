			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--MENA has learned that  diplomatic contacts are being held on the "highest level" in  Cairo to work out a Palestinian-Israeli formula to overcome the  obstacles hindering a UN Security Council resolution condemning  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, providing international  protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories, and taking into account the resumption of  negotiations in accordance with a Palestinian-Israeli bilateral  agreement.    Diplomatic sources have told MENA that the current brief  visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's  political adviser Jacques Neriya, comes within these accelerated  contacts. 'Arafat categorically rejected a meeting in Cairo  with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at Peres' request.    MENA has learned that the visiting Israeli envoy is carrying  a proposal to hold an urgent meeting in Cairo or Washington  between 'Arafat and Rabin to reach a formula for an agreement to  resume the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.    The agency has also learned that the Israeli side is willing  to implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement within three weeks from  the conclusion of negotiations in this connection.    The Egyptians and Palestinians are making contacts with the  United States in its capacity as a sponsor of the peace process  to guarantee the safety of the Palestinian people and work out a  new basis for negotiations in the stage to come.    Official Palestinian sources have told MENA that no meeting  between 'Arafat and Peres is acceptable right now and under the  current circumstances, especially as the Palestinian people are  worried and lack confidence in the Israeli Government's promises.    Diplomatic sources told MENA that in light of the  Palestinians' refusal to meet with Peres, Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias, current chairman of the EU's Ministerial  Council, has requested an urgent meeting with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat. In that meeting, held at Cairo  Airport, Papoulias handed 'Arafat Israeli proposals aiming to  overcome the obstacles facing the resumption of the  Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.    The Palestinian side, MENA learned, rejected the Israeli  proposals, which aim to reach a bilateral deal sidestepping the  UN Security Council. The Israeli proposals are in line with the  policy approved by the Israeli cabinet in its 27 February  session.    The main features of this policy are:    - Emptying the Hebron area of settlers.    - Forming a committee of inquiry into the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre.    - Taking tougher measures against "some" extremist Israeli  settlers in the West Bank, such as:    a. The institution of administrative detention.    b. The imposition of military restrictions and control on  the movement of some extremists into the West Bank, particularly  Hebron.    c. The cancellation of the gun licenses of some extremist  Israeli settlers and their disarmament.    d. The Israeli Government's legal adviser is to examine  the possibility of outlawing the Kakh and Kahane groups.    e. The release of 1,000 Palestinian detainees. Eight  hundred were released last week.    The Israeli Government also decided to pay compensation for  the families of the victims of the Hebron massacre.    According to the same diplomatic sources, the massacre at  the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron has created a new reality  necessitating a new form of dealing and communication between  the Palestinians and the Israelis. The Israelis, for their  part, are still trying to prevent the condemnation of the  massacre by the UN Security Council.    According to these sources, Rabin maintains that he cannot  control the domestic situation in Israel in view of the  fragility of the current coalition. It is worth noting that a  wave of anger swept through Israel following the massacre.    The Palestinians, meanwhile, insist on international  protection of Palestinians living in the occupied territories.  Such protection, the Palestinians say, can be provided through  the deployment of international observes working either under a  mandate from the UN Security Council or a Palestinian-Israeli  agreement. Such agreement would specify the number and  nationalities of the observers, along the line of the existing  agreement between Egypt and Israel.    The Palestinians also insist that all Palestinian detainees  in Israel be promptly released. They note that the Palestinian  need for security guarantees matches that of the settlers.    It is worth noting that 9,400 Palestinians are in Israeli  jails and detention camps, in accordance with the latest Red  Cross count.    The Palestinians also seek improved living conditions for  the  Palestinians living in the occupied territories until the  implementation of the self-rule agreement.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican oil reserves rise PETROLEOS Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state oil company, celebrated its 55th anniversary yesterday by announcing a small increase in oil and gas reserves to 65.05bn barrels in oil equivalent terms, reversing a ten-year decline. Mr Francisco Rojas, Pemex's director-general, announced that new discoveries had lifted oil reserves by 1.35bn barrels, which, after excluding last year's extraction, brought a net increase of 50m barrels. Pemex's production and exports of crude stayed almost exactly at 1991 level  -total oil and gas production was 3.1m barrels a day, oil equivalent, with crude oil exports averaging 1.367m b/d. Both President Carlos Salinas and Mr Rojas strongly defended Mexico's constitutional block on foreign oil companies receiving oil in return for drilling work. 'Those obtaining service contracts without exception receive a payment, or an incentive for productivity, in money. No resources, no products will be transferred.' said Mr Rojas. The director-general offered little evidence of progress in the oil company's attempt to divide itself into four separate business units - production and exploration, refining, gas and basic petrochemicals and secondary petrochemicals.</p>

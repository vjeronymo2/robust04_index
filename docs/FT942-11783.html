			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Long hot summer to test the nerve of dollar bulls Dollar disappointment is on the edge of turning into a debacle as the US Federal Reserve is forced to resort to propping up the ailing currency as it sinks against the yen. At risk are many of the global investors who have been almost unanimously bullish about the dollar for more than a year. In 1993 the dollar went down against the yen but at least it went up against the D-Mark. This year it has been soft against most other currencies. What has nobbled the dead cert? After all, with the US economy expanding strongly while most of its G7 trading partners remained in recession, the argument has been that a transformation in interest rate differentials would push up dollar exchange rates. In practice the fall in continental European interest rates has been rather slow, but whereas at the end of 1992 D-Mark three-month rates were more than 500 basis points higher than the dollar equivalent, today the differential is only just over 100 points. Pretty soon the gap could reverse. Has the negative response been irrational? There do, of course, have to be reasons but they vary from time to time. Besides short-term interest rate differentials, currency exchange rates may be driven by long-term investment flows and by political uncertainty. There is also the basic economic factor of trade imbalances, which this year may have become important again. There are some big negatives here. The US current account deficit may be heading for Dollars 140bn (Pounds 96bn) in 1994, pushed up by domestic demand, and generating unwanted dollars overseas. Moreover, far from supporting their local neighbourhood Treasury, US pension funds and mutual fund investors have discovered the virtues of global investment, and poured almost Dollars 130bn into foreign securities in 1993. Offsetting that was Dollars 110bn of net purchases of US securities by foreigners, but the point is that whereas in the 1980s the big investments by foreigners (often, at that stage, Japanese financial institutions) were vastly greater than the US outflows, now there is a rough balance. The underlying US current account deficit is therefore having to be financed by attracting hot money which is more sensitive to the prospects for short-term capital gains through exchange rate volatility than it is to small-scale interest rate differentials. A low rate of domestic saving in the US is forcing the country to draw on savings overseas, especially when the economic upturn is leading to a rise in corporate investment. The mirror image is depressed in Japan, running a current account surplus of about Dollars 130bn, but apparently no longer willing to buy dollar securities as it was in the 1980s. The Americans portray problems with Japan in terms of interference with freedom of trade, but different propensities to save are at the heart of the problem. The immediate difficulty is that Japanese life companies are no longer willing to take risks with the dollar/yen rate which has cost them so much in falling from over 200 10 years ago to scarcely above 100 today. Seen this way, the challenge for Americans is to attract savings domestically and internationally. Last year the banks and the hedge funds were still healthy sources of support for US Treasuries but that game is now over. The simple solution is a sharp rise in long-term dollar interest rates, which has happened, with the 150 basis point rise in the benchmark long bond yield since last October's trough. Apart from attracting foreign money these higher returns will also, eventually, choke off the portfolio outflows. But anybody buying into rising yields is also buying into immediate capital losses. So there is the potential for a hiatus as potential buyers of dollar securities wait for the bond market to settle down. While long-term portfolio investors hold off, the dollar is likely to wilt; and Japanese institutions certainly have reason to bide their time until the yen is not just overpriced but ridiculously priced. At least we learned last week there are limits to the readiness of Americans to encourage devaluation of their currency. But we could be in for an unstable and unpredictable summer as the nerves of the dollar bulls are tested.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: NUM attacks plan as a 'cynical political fix' ALL THE mining unions reacted angrily last night to the white paper in a chorus of denunciation. It was condemned as 'a sham', a 'betrayal' and a 'deliberate deception'. A lobby of parliament is being organised for Monday by the Trades Union Congress to protest at the plans. The National Union of Mineworkers called Mr Heseltine's proposals a 'cynical political fix' designed to deceive the public. The NUM is already holding a 24-hour strike next Friday in protest at the proposed pit closures and further industrial action is expected. The leaders of the moderate Union of Democratic Mineworkers were particularly disappointed by the white paper. For the past four months they have lobbied the government and Conservative MPs behind the scenes to save the threatened pits in their stronghold, the Nottinghamshire coalfield. 'It means closure by stealth. The miners have been conned. It is a short-term fudge,' declared Mr David Prendegast, UDM vice-president. Mr Heseltine said in the Commons that the government could not reprieve pits simply because the moderate UDM was the dominant force and not the more militant NUM. Only three of the threatened Nottinghamshire pits - Bilsthorpe, Rufford and Calverton - are to be saved compared with five in the Yorkshire region. Three more Nottinghamshire pits - Clipstone, Bevercotes and Shirebrook - have been put on a care and maintenance basis. The government has tried to cushion the blow for the coalfield. The headquarters of the proposed Coal Authority will be based in Nottingham, while a regional development authority is to be established for the east Midlands. Even the British Association of Colliery Management (Bacom) expressed strong opposition to Mr Heseltine's proposals. Mr John Meads, Bacom's general secretary, denounced them as 'a sham'. Mr Heseltine announced that the government intended to improve its existing allocation of help up to Pounds 200m for regeneration programmes designed mainly to introduce new industry on to the coalfields. Last week it was announced that the miners' redundancy scheme would continue to the end of the year to help the 5,800 further miners who will be made redundant. About 9,000 have volunteered for redundancy since last October. The decision to give the go-ahead to more flexible working practices designed to make the surviving pits more competitive would mean - subject to consultation - removing the 80-year-old maximum restriction on working hours to allow longer shifts to be worked.</p>

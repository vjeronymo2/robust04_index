			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Jiabin (3769 0163 2430): "China's </F> Technology Trade Exceeds 20 Billion Yuan"]    [Text] Beijing, 1 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The State  Science and Technology Commission today announced that the trade  volume in technology contracts across the country in 1993 was  20.755 billion yuan, a 37.42 percent increase over the previous  year.    According to statistics from the technology markets in 34  provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities listed  separately for development in the country (excluding Tibet and  Shenzhen), the technology transaction volume in 25 localities  exceeded 100 million yuan; Beijing Municipality, with its 3.5  billion yuan volume of technology transactions, ranked first,  followed by Liaoning and Shanghai, each with 2 billion yuan.  They were followed by Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong,  Hunan, Henan, and Hubei, arranged according to transaction  volume.    The statistics show that the overall standard of trade in  the  technology markets across the country has greatly improved, and  that the transaction volume of technological achievements  involved a wide range of areas. This shows that the sense of  technological progress among various quarters in society is  ceaselessly becoming stronger. The statistics also show that at  the same time as the volume of technology transactions has  increased rapidly, the scale of technology transactions has also  expanded continuously. In 1993, on average, each contract  involved a transaction volume of 84,380 yuan, whereas in 1992 it  was only some 60,000 yuan, and this indicates that in terms of  degree of industrialized development, grade, and quality, the  technological goods entering the market have improved to varying  degrees, and some technologies and technological products have  already left the country for the outside world.</p>

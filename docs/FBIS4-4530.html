			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange  said Monday [4 April] it will impose a fine of 21 million yen on  Kankaku Securities Co. for its involvement in dubious stock  trading deals in violation of securities rules.    The Japan Securities Dealers Association also announced a  decision to order the second-tier brokerage house to pay a fine  of 36 million yen for violating securities rules. It is the  third time for the exchange and the association to punish  Kankaku Securities for improper dealings.    In the latest case, Kankaku Securities was fined for its  involvement in a questionable practice known as "tobashi"  between 1990 and 1991 and pledging to compensate clients for  investment losses between 1985 and 1991. The brokerage is also  accused of improperly compensating clients over investment  losses.    "Tobashi" is a term for transactions involving the temporary  transfer of stock that has lost value from one client to another  in an attempt to cover up the first client's losses.    In the latest case, the Finance Ministry has already ordered  Kankaku Securities to suspend operations in its corporate  division for 10 days.</p>

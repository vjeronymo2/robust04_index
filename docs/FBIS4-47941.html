			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 5 SAPA -- Comments by a senior  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] member, Arthur Konigkramer, on the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] were false and  defamatory, the IEC charged on Thursday [5 May] night.    On Wednesday Mr Konigkramer, Inkatha campaign manager,  accused the IEC of colluding with the African National Congress  in alleging massive voting irregularities. "It (is) typical of  IEC bungling which has severely compromised the position of  voters supporting the IFP," he said in a statment.    But on thursday night the IEC said: "The attention of the  commission has been drawn to the statement issued in Durban by  Mr Arthur Konigkramer of the IFP...    "Mr Konigkramer's central allegation is both false and  defamatory, not only of the commissioners and staff of the IEC  but also of the accountants drawn from leading firms of auditors  who have assisted the IEC in the completion of the counting of  the results.    "In this regard, the commission reserves its position.  Doubtless others who feel themselves to have been similarly  impugned, will do the same.    "In the interim, Mr Konigkramer is invited to submit any  evidence he may have relating to his various allegations both to  the commission and to the South African Police as a matter of  urgency."</p>

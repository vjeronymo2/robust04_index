			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Right tax option for President Clinton Sir, It is misleading to argue ('Mr Clinton's Tax Deal', August 9) that labour taxes reduce employment any more than value-added consumption taxes. A rise in either form of taxation reduces the purchasing power of labour income, and thereby has an equivalent impact upon wage demands. Consequently the detrimental effect upon employment is the same, unless you believe that workers are stupid - not being able to realise that a rise in the price of consumption goods means they can buy less of them. To assume so would be inconsistent for a newspaper that was arguing as recently as last year that devaluation would have no lasting effects on competitiveness and employment - on the grounds that workers would simply demand higher wages to compensate for increased import prices. Moreover, an increase in labour taxes can be focused on the rich whereas an increase in consumption taxes cannot. Thus, if the higher tax revenue in the US is to be met by the rich it is to labour taxes, not value-added taxes, that Clinton must turn.

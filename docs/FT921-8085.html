			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / BTG sell-off likely to see only two bids ONLY TWO buyers for the British Technology Group are likely to be left in the field when the government's final deadline for bids expires tomorrow. They are a consortium led by the BTG management and a British-American group headed by Mr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics. A third consortium headed by Sir Ronald Mason, former chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence, and Mr Peter Homer of James Finlay Bank in Glasgow pulled out of the controversial privatisation of the state-owned technology transfer group last night. 'The tortuous, changing and time-limited procedures have now prevented us from bringing together sufficient funds to support the grouping of investors, universities and research organisations as envisaged in our plans,' Sir Ronald said. Mr Homer blamed the Department of Trade and Industry and its financial adviser, Price Waterhouse, for 'withholding key information on BTG'. Under the complex rules of the BTG sell-off, only consortia with at least seven members may submit bids. The BTG management consortium and Mr John Ashworth's Anglo-American group say they will definitely bid. The latter includes Research Corporation Technologies, the leading US technology-transfer organisation and BTG's closest competitor. Neither consortium will reveal its other members. There is still an outside chance of a bid from a group led by Strategy International, a London consultancy. The company refused to comment yesterday on its plans. Other bidders have condemned the process for what they claim is unnecessary secrecy and confusion about the criteria on which submissions will be judged. Price is important - although bids are unlikely to exceed Pounds 50m  -and so is long-term commitment to BTG's business of commercialising university research. The government hopes to complete the sale next month, so that it will not be affected by a general election in April.</p>

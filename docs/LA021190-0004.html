			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> At Close Range (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is strong stuff, but poorly told,  about how two teen-age half brothers (Sean Penn, Christopher Penn) are beguiled  by their dangerous, long-absent father (Christopher Walken).  </P> <P> Miracle Landing (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie starring Wayne Rogers  and Connie Sellecca, is based on a true story of a near-air tragedy.  </P> <P> Paul Verhoeven's 1987 RoboCop (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is ferocious comic-book  fare, starring Peter Weller as a slaughtered Detroit cop whose head and heart  are mounted in a robot, the ultimate crime-stopper.  </P> <P> The 1987 Hamburger Hill (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) pays heartfelt, richly  deserved tribute to one of the Vietnam War's bloodiest battles only to lapse  into a preachy attack on the anti-war movement without ever questioning U.S.  involvement in the war in the first place.  </P> <P> The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage (CBS Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie in  which the regulars of the popular series (Gavin MacLeod, Ted Lange, Bernie  Kopell, Jill Whelan) reprise their roles.  </P> <P> The Jewel of the Nile (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) reunites "Romancing the Stone's"  Kathleen Turner, as the dowdy romance novelist who blossoms when confronted  with real-life adventures, and a dashing Michael Douglas, but it's not as much  fun as the original.  </P> <P> George Miller's 1979 Mad Max (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) tells us how Max's  mythic saga began, as a highway cop defends his family against a biker gang.  It's a crude but energetic Aussie tribute to American International Pictures,  and it launched Mel Gibson as an international star.  </P> <P> The Warriors (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is the ultra-violent 1979 Walter  Hill movie about a gang daring to cross a rival gang's turf; Michael Beck  stars.  </P> <P> Smart, funny, touching and sensual, Dirty Dancing (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), the  phenomenally popular 1987 musical/love story set in the Catskills in the early  '60s, stars Patrick Swayze as as a sexy vacation resort dancer and Jennifer  Grey as the bright student beguiled by him on the dance floor -- and off.  </P> <P> The Princess Bride (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a delightful 1987 heroic  fantasy with bracing humor and foolery, finds beautiful princess Robin Wright  kidnaped by vile prince Chris Sarandon. In hot pursuit are her lover (Cary  Elwes) and one-time kidnapers (Mandy Patinkin and Andre the Giant).  </P> <P> Crimes of the Heart (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Beth Henley's play about  three kooky Mississippi sisters (Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange)  is somewhat more palatable on the screen than it was on the stage, but it's  still a tedious Southern Gothic comic caricature.  </P> <P> Francis Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now (Channel 5 Thursday at 7 p.m.) is a bold,  daring attempt to rework Joseph Conrad's "The Heart of Darkness" as a Vietnam  saga. Even though it finally succumbs to the bewildering madness of war it so  dazzlingly depicts, it is nonetheless a rich, challenging experience. Martin  Sheen and Marlon Brando star.  </P> <P> Krull (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is that lethally ponderous 1983  sword-and-sorcery adventure, a sort of unsuccessful cross between "Star Wars"  and "Excalibur" starring Ken Marshall and Lysette Anthony.  </P> <P> The 1985 American Flyers (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), which told of two  brothers competing in a bicycle marathon, is not nearly as good as writer Steve  Tesich's earlier effort, "Breaking Away," but it does present a Kevin Costner  clearly headed for stardom.  </P> <P> Rent-a-Cop (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) is pleasant, by-the-numbers genre fare  which finds endangered hooker Liza Minnelli hiring ex-cop Burt Reynolds to  protect her.  </P> <P> As in "War Games," Matthew Broderick is once again an impassioned youth taking  on the dastardly military in Project X (Channel 11 Friday at 8 p.m.), but the  1987 film, which deals with a crazy Air Force experiment with chimps,  overreaches and strains credibility.  </P> <P> Susan Seidelman's endearingly hilarious 1985 Desperately Seeking Susan (Channel  13 Friday at 8 p.m.) stars Rosanna Arquette as a repressed New Jersey housewife  who, after a conk on the head, wakes up thinking she may be Susan, a gaudy  adventuress in thrift-shop finery (Madonna, in a sensational screen debut).  </P> <P> Ridley Scott's Legend (Channel 5 Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a gorgeous but  exceedingly slight fairy tale, in need of both humor and invention and starring  Tom Cruise and Mia Sara, both of whom are sweet and brave.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Admiral Davorin Kajic: "We Are Not Afraid of </F> Serbian Gun-Boats!"]    [Text] That a Serbian missile gun-boat detained the tanker  Lido in the Adriatic is an indication that serious incidents  have started occurring at sea as well as on land. This was the  first time that a Serbian warship so decidedly faced the  blockade action of the international peace forces. There have  been many instances of ships being detained or taken away, but  there has never been an action of such marked confrontation.  After a crew of allied commandos disembarked on the Lido, the  Serbian gun-boat appeared -- all this was happening some 40  miles away from the shore, which means deep in the blockade  zone. The gun-boat did not make any provocation, but it tried  to interfere with taking the tanker to Brindisi by its very  presence.    The incident itself may seem a crazy, thoughtless act,  inappropriate soldiers' behavior, but I believe it is not so. I  believe that, too, was part of the general idea of military  pressure and intentional provocation of tense actions, with  fierce confrontation as their aim, in which firmness and  military persistence in the defense of their aims would be  displayed. All this has been seen many times before, lately  especially around Gorazde, in the constant bombing of Croatian  territory from Bosnia, in the accumulation of troops around  Brcko, in the inflexibility at the demarcation lines. In the  so-called UNPA's there regularly appears an odd gun or a tank,  and armed group raids and other attempts to keep the occupied  territory continue. Many incidents involving UNPROFOR also show  that this policy has intensified.  <H5>  An Increasing Number of Incidents </H5>   Now it has started happening at sea, too. The purpose of  such provocations is not to scare the allied frigate or seize a  tanker, but to show that Serbia is prepared to defend the  positions it has occupied, including those at sea, despite the  powerful allied fleet, and to oppose the blockade. This could  also be a form of additional pressure on the allies to stir up  disorder, and perhaps even disunity among them.    Although we do not have the information that would account  for the entire action, we can assume, judging by the logic and  what followed, that other Serbian forces were also on the alert.  For instance, we know that they have a certain number of  warships, including submarines, in operational use. There was  probably another boat ready to sail out, or else there was a  submarine somewhere nearby, its task being to support the  gun-boat.    I believe that one of these submarines is constantly on  patrol a certain distance away from their coast. Naturally, the  blockade forces are doing everything necessary in anti-submarine  protection. However, despite this protection, submarines are  dangerous, and their aim is not only to cause unrest. We must  reckon on the fact that the air forces could have appeared above  the site of the incident in only a few minutes. A factor that  could have added to the complexity of the situation could have  been coast missile divisions. The incident occurred outside the  range of tactical systems, but we know that Serbia has received  extended range anti-ship missiles. At a certain time Italy was  threatened by land-to-land missiles, with the range of about  1,000 km. These are unconvincing things, but they do function  psychologically, within the strategy of provoking incidents. On  the basis of the aforementioned, we can see that the operation  was quite complex, although it seems simple and short-term.  Frustration, anger, or some other emotional outburst of a  commander of the Serbian fleet or some other individual in the  military hierarchy should therefore be ruled out. Although  individuals or navy commanders can incite such actions, this  incident should also be viewed in the context of events in the  air and on land.  <H5>  Tension Stretched to Extremes </H5>   The same things are happening there -- the tension between  the Serb army and the "blue helmets" is intentionally stretched  to extremes, to playing on the edge of the sword. It is a very  risky game, but Serbia has decided that it has turned out to be  profitable so far, as so far Serbia has been left unpunished.  The Serbs have damaged several planes, downed one, killed  several members of the peace forces; they arrest them, hold them  hostages -- about a hundred at a time -- and they are not  punished for it. They are, therefore, making use of the basic  principles of the United Nations actions: no revenge, but  prevention of great destruction, inhumane actions, and so on.  This is deliberate misuse of the UN policies, which are very  considerate, peaceful, and humanitarian, and highly restrained  in resorting to force.    The long-announced political resolution is probably being  prepared. The great powers have completed the final  preparations for the final negotiations, but Serbia, with such  incidents, shows a decisiveness not to withdraw from the  occupied positions, that is, not to return the occupied  territory. This incident shows that Serbia wants to achieve  more at sea, too. The sanctions and the naval blockade have  badly damaged Serbia, so it is looking for ways out at sea, too.  This blockade also has to be broken, the allied fleet made to  go as far away from the shore as possible. It wants to show the  allied forces that this blockade does not mean much either,  although this is not true, but certain negotiating positions are  thus displayed. While positions are being taken, we should not  be surprised if there is another such incident at sea.    The threats will probably recur. This can have negative  consequences for Croatia, too. The issue of lack of safety of  both cargo and tourist traffic in the Adriatic can be raised  again. More such incidents would bring about, for instance, the  raising of the insurance charges for ships and cargoes, and our  waters would be proclaimed an unsafe zone, which means that  there would be a decrease in profit from tourism and traffic.  There have been no open attacks in our seas, but there is a  constant danger of naval terrorist actions. The fact that there  have not been any does not mean that we are not prepared to  protect our sea. On the contrary!</p>

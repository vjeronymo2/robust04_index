			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MURPHY'S FAULT' HAS FAULTS  </P> <P> "Murphy's Fault" (citywide), the first film to open in 1989, is sure to rank  among the year's worst. It's a contrived, pointless, numbskull comedy, the kind  in which the spectacle of people constantly losing their tempers and destroying  property passes for humor. Patrick Dollaghan stars as a hot-headed struggling  writer attracted to an equally volatile policewoman (Anne Curry).  </P> <P> After writer-director Robert J. Smawley has run out of ideas as to how to  sustain their combustible relationship, he has Dollaghan take revenge on the  local police chief for his indifference to the fact that Dollaghan's brand-new  van has been stolen.  </P> <P> Dollaghan, Curry and Stack Pierce (as Dollaghan's best pal) are pros, but  "Murphy's Fault" (rated PG-13, presumably for some four-letter words) is  otherwise hopelessly amateurish.  </P> <P> 'MURPHY'S FAULT'  </P> <P> A Triax Entertainment Group release of an Anglo Pacific production. Executive  producers David Barrett, Don L. Parker. Producers Chris Davies, Lionbel A.  Ephraim. Writer-director Robert J. Smawley. Camera Rod Stewart. Film editor  Simon Grimley. With Patrick Dollaghan, Anne Curry, Stack Pierce.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 36 minutes.  </P> <P> MPAA-rated: PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned; some material may be  inappropriate for children under 13).  </P></p>

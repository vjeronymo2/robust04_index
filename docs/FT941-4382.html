			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: The Maid of Orleans - Opera The enterprising Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester launched its spring opera season on Tuesday with a Tchaikovsky rarity, The Maid of Orleans. It is a brave project, boldly realised, with no expense spared. Since the strange decision was made to give the opera in Russian, even surtitles were specially provided. There could have been no question of borrowing them: no Western company has ventured the opera in recent years. At present, Tchaikovsky's historical drama survives only in the Bolshoy's repertory - ironic, since in writing it, the composer was making a conscious bid for popularity. His attempt to copy the conventions of French grand opera won acclaim at the St Petersburg premiere in 1881, but the assassination shortly afterwards of Alexander II led to the curtailment of the theatre season, and The Maid of Orleans was not revived again in Russia during Tchaikovsky's lifetime. Its neglect is not hard to fathom. But even if, as many believe, The Maid is Tchaikovsky's dullest opera, this performance showed it to be more than a mere curiosity, and worthy of the occasional revival. The music is not vintage Tchaikovsky - some episodes bear his distinctive stamp, but too often he falls back on overblown gesture - yet the real weaknesses are dramatic: the opera's chief source, Schiller's tragedy, is diluted by interpolations and the simplified, sentimentalised treatment of Jeanne d'Arc herself. The production by Stefan Janski, the RNCM's director of opera studies, is solid and straightforward, probably the best way of tackling such a sprawling piece. Most of the public scenes are splendid, and only the royal entertainments in Act Two seemed tedious (and the anachronistic acrobats tasteless). Charles Cusick Smith's versatile sets allow for Jeanne's striking angelic visions, and colourful costumes complete the spectacle. In Russia, The Maid of Orleans is reserved as a vehicle for star mezzos, and without Jane Irwin's vocal strengths, the RNCM could not have contemplated staging it. Her performance in the taxing title role was as affecting as the superficial characterisation allows; her rich, lustrous tone which extends to a powerful top makes her a mezzo to watch. With the exception of the tenor roles, the opera was strongly cast, and three other singers stood out: Martin Snell (Thibault), Ashley Holland (Dunois), and the Ukrainian soprano Nataliya Kompaniyets (Agnes), who brought Slavonic authenticity to Tchaikovsky's music. Paul McGrath welded his vast forces - large orchestra, off-stage band, organ, and an excellent chorus - with flair. Sponsor: The Royal Bank of Scotland. Further performances: March 12,16,22, and 25 (061-273 4504).</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESSAGE TO REBELLIOUS ARABS: 'IT'S TIT FOR TAT';  </P> <P> ISRAELI SETTLERS WAGING 'ANTIFADA'  </P> <P> The weapons -- rocks and gasoline bombs -- are familiar, although these crude  arms are often supplemented by submachine guns, rifles and pistols.  </P> <P> In some ways, the message of the violence is also the same: "We are here. This  land is ours. Drive on the highways at your own risk."  </P> <P> But these are not rebellious Palestinians trying to throw off Israeli rule.  They are Israeli settlers trying to draw attention -- and military  reinforcements -- to their homes in hostile territory.  </P> <P> More and more incidents of settler vigilantism are occurring in the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israelis have begun to refer to an "antifada," a  response to the Arab intifada, the uprising that is making the settlers  increasingly nervous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Strike Back'  </P> <P> "We react," said David Ramati, a former U.S. Marine who emigrated 22 years ago  and settled in this hilltop enclave in the West Bank town of Hebron. "If  someone throws a stone at us, we strike back. It's tit for tat."  </P> <P> Ramati has organized vigilante squads that patrol the streets outside the  perimeter of the housing complex and occasionally raid the homes of suspected  stone throwers in adjacent neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "I'm not living in conquered territory," he told a reporter. "I'm at home and  have the right to feel at home."  </P> <P> Kiryat Arba is not the only place where settlers are striking at Arab  communities. On Friday, there were at least three settler attacks on Arab  villages. Settlers raided the West Bank villages of Deir es Sudan, Arura and  Abwein, damaging water tanks, houses and cars with gunshot and stones. In  Arura, settlers shot and wounded at least four teen-agers, according to Israel  Radio. A third resident was wounded in the face by rubber bullets in a clash  with Israeli soldiers.  </P> <P> Earlier last week, settlers rampaged through the village of Eizariya for the  second night in a row in response to a serious stone-throwing attack. A driver  from the nearby settlement of Maaleh Adumim lost control of his car and  crashed; his wife and children were injured.  </P> <P> Settlers from Ariel in the central West Bank have raided numerous villages  along the road from Ariel to the coast in retaliation for rock attacks. They  have smashed windows in Arab houses and hurled stones at Arab-owned cars.  </P> <P> Last Monday, a Palestinian was killed when he was hit in the head with a rock  while driving back to Hebron from his job in Israel. The incident occurred  inside Israel, where stone-throwing attacks began after the body of an abducted  soldier was found in a remote grave near the town of Ashkelon.  </P> <P> Last month in Hebron, a settler shot and killed a 13-year-old boy he said was  throwing stones at his car. The gunman was released after questioning.  </P> <P> Israeli officials are expressing concern at the aggressiveness of the settlers.  Last Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, told a  parliamentary committee that attacks by settlers on Arabs are "a dangerous  innovation."  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Yosef Harish warned settlers that "this phenomenon will be  uprooted."  </P> <P> "Civilians," he said, "will not be allowed to take the law into their own  hands, whether under the pretext of a military action instead of the Israel  Defense Forces or in addition to the actions taken by the military."  </P> <P> In an article Friday in the newspaper Haaretz, military analyst Zeev Schiff  said the Israeli army "is on the verge of losing control over inflamed settlers  in the territories."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leftist Legislators Complain  </P> <P> Two leftist members of Parliament say the attacks by Jewish settlers against  Palestinians in the West Bank are the work of a "very efficient and well-armed"  militia. The legislators sent a complaint to Atty. Gen. Harish last month after  40 settlers stormed into a Palestinian mayor's office to protest rock attacks  on Israeli cars.  </P> <P> "We are calling on the attorney general to break up this militia," said Yossi  Sarid, who drafted the complaint. "Today, we are already talking about a  militia. They are well organized and we are seeing increased cooperation  between settlers in different settlements. They say that as far as they are  concerned, the army is not fulfilling its mission, and they have no choice but  to fulfill the mission."  </P> <P> Agitation among settlers has sharpened in recent weeks as the army has reduced  its round-the-clock presence in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, turning instead  to hit-and-run roundups of Palestinian activists. Only the main roads of the  occupied lands are patrolled consistently.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomacy Discounted  </P> <P> The settlers also view the diplomatic steps aimed at settling the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict as imperiling their stay on the land.  </P> <P> "We would die rather than give up these homes," said Ramati, the patrol  organizer in Kiryat Arba, the first settlement to employ them.  </P> <P> Kiryat Arba is home to 7,000 settlers Ramati described as religious Zionists  who stake their claim to the land on the basis of the Bible. Hebron, for  instance, is the site of the tomb of the Prophet Abraham, a patriarch revered  by Jews and Muslims alike.  </P> <P> Sometimes the settlers patrol in cars and jeeps, often accompanying public  buses. Sometimes they descend on neighborhoods in response to someone throwing  stones or a gasoline bomb. When a fracas breaks out, the army often intervenes  to separate Arab and Israeli.  </P> <P> Ramati, 42, said that since his group began operating, the army has stepped up  its patrols in Hebron -- to his pleasure, because it keeps rebellious Arabs  indoors.  </P> <P> "We made some noise, and the army stopped ignoring us," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Secretary of State James A. Baker III called on Israel to  stop the settlement program. Washington, which wants Israel to give up occupied  land in exchange for peace, considers the settlements an obstacle to peace.  </P> <P> Ramati responded, with a defiance not uncommon in the settler communities, that  U.S. pressure to halt the settlement process should be ignored.  </P> <P> He said: "People have been saying this kind of thing for 2,000 years, that the  Jews don't need a homeland, that they should get along somewhere else. Well,  we're not listening."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Ashgabat 13 April, TASS -- President Saparmurad  Niyazov of Turkmenistan reiterated that he viewed the functional  status of the Commonwealth of Independent States as that of a  coordinating and consultative body. This view will determine  the Turkmen delegation's attitude towards all items on the  agenda of the upcoming CIS summit in Moscow, Niyazov told the  Republic's government last night.    In today's exclusive interview with TASS, the Turkmen  president detailed his approach to the problem of CIS  functioning, ruling out the possibility of any sub-national  ruling body. "I am strongly convinced that any alliance of  states is possible only on a voluntary basis, with economic  autonomy of member-countries preserved," Niyazov noted.  "However, this cannot happen overnight but calls for a certain  period of time which is not to be speeded up by various utopian  conceptions," he emphasised.    The Turkmen leader believes that some advance movement  towards a new model of the Commonwealth does exist, irrespective  of the will of all sorts of politicians who "invent new slogans  instead of going ahead with a laborious negotiating process."  Recently, in particular at the latest CIS summit in Ashgabat,  decisions of great importance were made, which are to give a  concrete shape to the alliance and to pave the way for further  advance movement, Niyazov stressed.    Collective decisionmaking and implementation of these  decisions is "alpha and omega of the CIS," according to the  Turkmen president.    For further development of the CIS as a new international  community, member-states should gradually and patiently move  towards civilized relations and to search for variants  acceptable to everybody.</p>

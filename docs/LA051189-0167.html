			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE SPENDING FOR HEALTH SUPPORTED IN POLL  </P> <P> A majority of Californians want to see additional government funding of health  care programs for the poor and are personally willing to pay more taxes to  support these services, according to a new Gallup Poll commissioned by state  hospital executives.  </P> <P> Nearly nine out of 10 Californians believe that employers should be required to  provide basic health insurance for their employees, and about 75% said the  federal government should develop "some form of national health insurance  program for everyone."  </P> <P> More than 80% believe that additional revenue generated by the state's new  tobacco tax initiative, Proposition 99, should be used to improve health care  programs, not to fund other state services, as proposed by Gov. George  Deukmejian. And, when asked to rate the governor's overall performance on  health care issues, more people disapproved (36%) than approved (28%), with the  remainder undecided.  </P> <P> These were some of the findings of a wide-ranging annual poll that hospital  executives said they commissioned in order "to take the temperature" of  Californians on a variety of health concerns ranging from personal health  habits to political views. The poll results were released Wednesday in Los  Angeles at the offices of the Hospital Council of Southern California.  </P> <P> The most significant trend that emerged, council Vice President David Langness  said, is that "Californians are beginning to be more and more aware and  concerned about the health of the entire state, not just their own . . . and  they are enormously concerned about health care for the poor."  </P> <P> The poll comes at a time when Deukmejian has proposed statewide reductions in  health services, including a huge reduction in the amount of money Los Angeles  County receives for medically indigent patients -- from $204 million to $56  million.  </P> <P> The state's health care crunch was expected to be somewhat relieved by the  recent passage of Proposition 99, which raised taxes on cigarettes and other  tobacco products. The additional $625 million that will be raised in the  upcoming budget year was expected to be spent on new health care programs, but  Deukmejian in January proposed spending most of the money on other financially  strapped state services.  </P> <P> "Californians do not want this money to be hijacked by the governor and used  for other purposes," Langness said. About 82% of the 1,000 people queried by  telephone in April said the money should be used to finance new health care  programs, as the proposition intended. "That's a very high percentage,"  Langness said, "especially considering that only 58% of the people voted for  Proposition 99 in the first place."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) said the poll results "send a very  clear message to Gov. Deukmejian that his health care policies are completely  out of step with public opinion in California."  </P> <P> Margolin said that the poll should also put the business community on alert  that there is "clear support" for a requirement that employers provide basic  health insurance for their employees.  </P> <P> But several Orange County legislators were not so impressed. "You have to  wonder how the questions were phrased," said Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport  Beach). "I found it rather surprising politically in light of local elections,  school bond issues that were turned down decisively."  </P> <P> Added Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach): "Do they know what  they're paying now? . . . I don't think they're informed as to what we provide  already." Frizzelle, who is an optometrist, said he thought "when push comes to  shove and it comes out of their own pocketbook . . . they probably wouldn't do  it (vote for an additional tax for health care)."  </P> <P> By contrast, health care experts in Orange County were delighted by the poll.  </P> <P> Dr. Walter Henry, vice chancellor of health services at UC Irvine, said he was  gratified that "people are so compassionate" on the subject of indigent care  and glad that so many realized that "there is a gap between what it costs to  provide medical care and what the medical agency receives in payment for that  medical care." (UCI's deficit-ridden medical center currently cares for half of  the county's poor patients.)  </P> <P> And Vicki Mayster, vice chair of the Orange County Task Force on Indigent Care,  said she was delighted that so many people indicated that they are willing to  be taxed for health care. "I say 'Amen' to that," Mayster said. "Now what we  need is a way to get people organized in ways that our Legislature will hear it  and take action. That's so often where the problem comes. That's where the gap  is."  </P> <P> The poll found that 65% of Californians believe government is paying too little  money to hospitals to care for the treatment of senior citizens on Medicare,  and 60% feel there is insufficient funding to help defray the cost of treating  people with no medical insurance of any sort.  </P> <P> About 80% said they believe that it is the government's responsibility to pay  for medical care for people who cannot afford it, and 53% said they would  personally be willing to pay up to $38 per month in additional taxes for this  purpose.  </P> <P> If cutting back on other government programs were the only way to finance  health care for the poor, 35% said that defense and military spending should be  cut.  </P> <P> If priorities had to be set singling out the neediest group for care, 41% said  that children should be ranked at the top and 19% pointed to the elderly.  Pregnant women, the disabled, the homeless, and mentally ill followed, in  descending order.  </P> <P> Asked what is the single most important threat to Californians today, 25% of  the respondents ranked pollution at the top. Pollution of the air, water and  general environment was ranked as the biggest threat statewide, with AIDS a  close second. Only 7% of respondents ranked substance abuse and cancer as the  biggest threat.  </P></p>

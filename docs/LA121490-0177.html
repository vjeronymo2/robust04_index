			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STUDIOS, NETWORKS BATTLE AGAIN OVER TV RIGHTS;  </P> <P> PROGRAMMING: REGULATORS HEAR TESTIMONY IN DISPUTE OVER FINANCIAL INTEREST IN  PRIME-TIME PRODUCTIONS. A DECISION IS DUE IN MARCH.  </P> <P> A galaxy of Hollywood studio and television executives made personal appeals  today to federal regulators trying to mediate a bitter squabble over who should  be able to own network TV programs.  </P> <P> Representatives of the ABC, NBC and CBS TV networks urged the Federal  Communications Commission to lift rules that prohibit networks from holding a  financial interest in prime-time programs they obtain from outside sources or  selling them in the U.S. TV rerun marketplace.  </P> <P> "The future of free broadcasting in America is seriously threatened, not just  for the networks, but for our 600 affiliated stations that provide news, public  service and local programming in communities across the nation," said Laurence  Tisch, president of CBS Inc. "Repealing these rules is important because it  will allow us to compete for the best programming."  </P> <P> However, executives from major Hollywood studios and production companies urged  retention of the rules, saying that while the industry has changed dramatically  in the past 20 years the three major television networks still dominate.  </P> <P> "Perhaps whereas they were once 900-pound gorillas, today they weigh in at only  850 pounds," said Richard Frank, president of the Walt Disney Studios.  </P> <P> The financial interest and syndication rule was adopted in 1970. It was  designed to stem network power, encourage independent production of TV shows  and keep the networks from denying reruns to non-network TV stations.  </P> <P> The networks and studios have been locked in acrimonious negotiations over  changing the rules since 1983. The networks claim the rules are outdated in an  era in which ABC, CBS and NBC are not the only outlets for programs and when  they must compete against foreign interests.  </P> <P> But Hollywood studios and independent producers say the networks are still the  only outlet for major, high-quality programs and that the rule is essential to  producers.  </P> <P> "The advertising marketplace is the worst it's been in two decades," said  Robert Wright, president of NBC. "The three-network percentage of prime time  viewing" fell to 58% in November, which Wright said was the lowest in history  as cable television continues to erode network viewing.  </P> <P> The Justice Department has sided with the networks, but a wide array of groups  are on the other side.  </P> <P> "The rule has fueled the growth of independent stations and -- contrary to  network contentions -- has also promoted a substantial increase in the number  of program producers," Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly said. "The networks'  want repeal so that they may use their tremendous leverage to take valuable  financial interests and syndication rights."  </P> <P> Daly, a onetime president of CBS Entertainment, said that if the FCC does relax  the rules, it should adopt minimum safeguards.  </P> <P> Stephen Cannell, whose company produces such shows as "Hunter" and "Wiseguy,"  said he feared that without safeguards the networks would discriminate in favor  of their own programs.  </P> <P> "If I refuse to grant ownership of or an interest in my television series, then  they will be programmed and scheduled in a less desirable fashion than the  shows in which the networks have an interest," Cannell said.  </P> <P> The FCC tentatively decided in 1983 to eliminate the financial interest rule  and narrow the syndication rule to prohibit only network participation in  domestic syndication of prime-time series. But it delayed a final decision  under pressure from Congress and then-President Ronald Reagan and urged the  interested parties to find a solution themselves.  </P> <P> In March, the FCC said, it will decide the issue again.  </P></p>

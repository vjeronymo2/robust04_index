			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities unsettled by profit-taking AN AIR of anti-climax pervaded London's equity market yesterday with periodic bouts of profit-taking eroding share prices despite a wave of good news on the international interest rate front. Adding to a generally uneasy close in London was renewed concern about Wall Street and what is increasingly viewed by many as a faltering US economy. The widespread profit-taking in London share prices saw the FT-SE 100 index give up all its hard won gains that followed the interest rate reductions instigated by the Swiss and German authorities. The FT-SE 100 ended a volatile session a net 11.2 off at 2,888.8. There was more comfort for investors, however, in the performance of the wider market, where the second-tier UK stocks continued to make strong progress. The FT-SE Mid 250 index continued its recent upward move, attaining another record closing high point of 3,241.7, up six points on the session and well below its intra-day high-point. Turnover in London picked up from the rather depressed levels seen earlier in the week. Over 650m shares were traded yesterday, well up on Wednesday's 550.4m. The concentration of turnover in non-FT-SE 100 stocks, where some 410m shares traded compared with 240m FT-SE 100 shares illustrated the underlying strength of the UK market, dealers said. The value of customer business remained above the crucial Pounds 1bn level on Wednesday when turnover was recorded by the stock exchange as being worth Pounds 1.1bn. The market session began on a steady note with dealers reluctant to take on any substantial positions ahead of the news from Leipzig where the Bundesbank meeting was being held. The FT-SE 100 index opened moderately higher and held above the 2,900 level for much of the morning before attracting pockets of resistance in the middle of the morning session despite the cut in Swiss interest rates, seen as a harbinger of a reduction in German interest rates. London's response to the 0.25 per cent reduction in Germany's Lombard rate and the 0.5 per cent fall in the discount rate was immediate, with leading shares moving up strongly. The 100 index reached the day's high, up 6.7 at 2,906.7 within twenty minutes of the news from Germany, but thereafter drifted off, hit by profit-taking, a feeling that the market had probably run too far ahead of itself and on a growing conviction that Wall Street may be due a tumble. Wall Street opened more than six points lower after what was said to have been more disappointing news on the US economy, before stabilising and moving into positive territory as London closed. Financials remained one of the market's best performing areas. Standard Chartered staged a strong recovery after earnings upgrades by at least one of the market's leading brokers. The drugs sector, on the other hand, continued to suffer, with Goldman Sachs, the leading US investment bank said to have upset the international drugs stocks by downgrading its sector estimates. Traders remained happy about the short term outlook for the market. 'It's a test of nerves and the general consensus is that we're at the top of the trading range, but the market still feels OK,' said one trader.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOYAL KIDS DEFEND THEIR NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK  </P> <P> I do not like the (review) about New Kids. It is rude.  </P> <P> It said in the paper a girl threw a stuffed animal at Donnie, and Donnie picked  it up and threw it back and said, 'You oughta stop throwing things." That's not  true because I was at that concert. Danny does not sing bad, and Jordan is my  favorite, so don't talk about him.  </P> <P> CRYSTAL REYNOLDS  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

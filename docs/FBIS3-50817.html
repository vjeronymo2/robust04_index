			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Juan Villarzu, economic adviser to </F> President-elect Eduardo Frei, by Raquel Correa; place and date  not given -- first four paragraphs are author's introduction]    [Text] Although he does not yet have Carabinero [National  Police] guards at the door of his house in Vitacura, he  certainly has the look of a cabinet minister, which he cannot  hide. It is an "open secret" that if Eduardo Frei is elected  president, Juan Villarzu will be his minister of finance.    He feels uncomfortable about this "assumption." However, as  the man in charge of the economic program of the Concertacion  coalition, he was willing to answer our questions. He  emphasized: "There has been no discussion about who will head  which ministry. Eduardo has been very clear about that. First,  we have to win the election."    Villarzu Rohde is 49 years old and is married to Maria  Olivia  Avalos. They have three children of their own, in addition to  two children from her first marriage, and one granddaughter. He  is of Basque and German descent. He thinks that the German blood  which he inherited from his mother, "a German woman born in  Germany," is the predominant force in his character.    He was practically an only child. (His sister died at an  early age.) He was educated in the rigorous program at the  Colegio Aleman [German College]. Hence his sense of discipline  and the demands he makes on himself. He has a calm and  methodical outlook.    [Correa] Are you hard or soft?    [Villarzu] Neither hard nor soft. I am rather firm in my  convictions.    [Correa] Are you more a politician or more an economist?    [Villarzu] "I find that I am more of an economist, although  many people say no." (He laughs discreetly.) "I feel more  comfortable as an economist." Having had broad, executive  experience, he is recognized as having "good leadership  qualities and the ability to direct groups." He is reflective,  "although also rather intuitive." He says that he believes very  much in what he would call "guts"--"what makes me feel things. I  tend to concentrate on the major arguments for or against  something."    [Correa] And when you have made a decision, are you able to  change your mind?    [Villarzu] "I am capable of thinking things over. However,  frankly, I am a little stubborn."    On economic matters in general he says: "I am a great  believer in competition as a very central element in the  functioning of the economy. I believe in efforts to improve the  way markets operate. The only way for Chile to achieve stable  development over the medium term of years is in an economic  structure which is increasingly more open to the world."    [Correa] More open than it already is?    [Villarzu] In the sense of the view over the long term, I  have no doubt about it. That means making greater efforts at  integration with Latin America.    [Correa] Does that mean giving priority to economic treaties  with the Third World?    [Villarzu] Our natural habitat is Latin America. I am not  among those who believe in saying, "Goodbye, Latin America."    [Correa] Would you rather be on the side of the losers?    [Villarzu] "No. I believe that, over the long term, Latin  America will be among the winners. Argentina and Bolivia are  going in that direction. In general, so is the rest of Latin  America. I also believe that we can make much more progress in  opening up the Chilean economy from the financial point of view."    The other principle in which he firmly believes--although he  refuses to consider himself an "original thinker" in this  regard--is stability.    He said: "I believe very strongly in the need to continue  reducing inflation."    [Correa] When do you hope to reach single digit inflation?    [Villarzu] "In 1997."    In his economic credo there is also the view, "that the  people can build their own future with their own resources. This  is the idea of investment in people." "I am convinced that a  mixture of adequate, macroeconomic policies, including opening  up the economy and investing in the people, is the recipe for  success. If you add political and social stability to that, you  have all of the ingredients to turn us into an economic tiger  some day."    He explains meticulously, "When I talk about an open  economy,  I am talking about a market economy where the principal,  productive element is the private sector, in its different  forms."    [Correa] Did you learn that at the University of Chicago?"    [Villarzu] I have always thought that. This is the Christian  Democratic view of things.    [Correa] Did you support the establishment of "a  communitarian society?"    [Villarzu] The concept of a communitarian society  traditionally accepted the idea that private parties were  essentially private. However, then we gave priority to the idea  of companies owned by the workers, and in these the state has  always played a subsidiary role. The social doctrine of the  [Catholic] Church was the first to introduce into Chile the idea  of a subordinate role for the state. Then the Christian  Democratic movement incorporated this idea into its view of  economic development.    [Correa] Are you getting ready to use the stairways to climb  the 12 floors of the Ministry of Finance?    [Villarzu] He laughed openly and said: "I do not think that  I  could. I am a half frustrated sportsman. I always try to engage  in sports. What I do more regularly is play tennis."    He is a good skier and has tried to play golf. He said:  "Chess interests me very much and especially bridge." He makes a  practice of riding his bike through his neighborhood. However,  he is not very determined about sports. He said: "The only  consistent thing is that I always try to engage in some kind of  physical activity."    His favorite weekends are spent at his home in Zapallar,  "which we visit as often as possible."    He is devoted to reading, from technical books--including  books on economic theory--to the poetry of Garcia Lorca. He  misses his university offices (He was chairman of the  Departments of Economics at the University of Chile and the  Catholic University of Chile). Over the past few months he has  spent all of his time on the economic program of the  Concertacion coalition.    He is rather reserved. He prefers to spend his time in the  company of friends and hates gambling. He likes to dance and  says that he is "good at rock and roll dancing." On his list of  "things to learn" he said that he has included the tango. When  he talks about "salsa" music, the methodical, serious, and  inhibited man that he seems to be disappears completely. He is  also devoted to jazz and classical music. His favorite composer  is Mozart.    He is a successful businessman and international consultant.  He believes that, "My heart is more inclined toward economics.  From my involvement in economics I have had close contact with  the business world but, in fact, I have given up being a  businessman. However, although I have done rather well, to tell  you the truth, this is not what has given me the most  satisfaction. I feel much more comfortable in activity connected  to the public service and the government."    [Correa] Would you feel very disappointed if Frei were  elected and he did not offer you the Ministry of Finance?    [Villarzu] This economist, who was born in Arica and is a  graduate of the University of Chicago, spoke very seriously and  was in perfect control of himself when he replied:    "No. Frankly, I would like to be a part of the next  government, but that does not mean doing so in any particular  ministry. I believe that I am in a position to make a  contribution in different areas and as a function of what the  president considers appropriate. I believe that if Frei is  elected, he will set his stamp on the government."    [Correa] And what is the "Frei stamp"?    [Villarzu] Senator Frei gives priority to teamwork. He gives  a great deal of freedom to those who work with him so that they  can fully develop their potential. He listens a great deal and  makes decisions with a great sense of timeliness. It is very  difficult to force him to make decisions.    [Correa] Are you an unusual "Chicago boy"?    [Villarzu] "Chicago boys" here are known as those who  received an undergraduate degree at the Catholic University of  Chile. But some of us also went to the University of  Chile--Carlos Massad, Andres Sanfuentes, and Roberto Zahler. In  general, their view of the role of the economy and of national  development is rather different from the view of those  considered to be "Chicago boys."    [Correa] But the recipe which you brought back to an  economically prostrate Chile was the most "Chicago style" of all.    [Villarzu] There are elements--such as stability, an open  economy, opening up the economy to the world, and  competition--which are considered of very central importance at  the School of Economics of the University of Chicago. Even on  the subject of investment the people at the University of  Chicago were pioneers. This is the neoclassical view of the  economy. However, you have to keep in mind that Jorge Cauas, who  was a key figure in formulating the economic policy of the  Military Government, was not of the Chicago school.    [Correa] Which economist should go down in history as the  leader of that process?    [Villarzu] "There were different phases. Cauas played a much  more important role during a very critical period at the  beginning of the Military Government." During that phase  Villarzu himself was director of the budget. "The opening up of  the economy began in a real way in 1975 when Jorge Cauas was  minister of finance. He had a great deal of support from De  Castro. If I had to list the most important names, I would  mention Cauas, De Castro, and Miguel Kast, three men who were of  the greatest importance in the formulation of what was called  `the model.'"    [Correa] He was more important than Buchi?    [Villarzu] Buchi was important because during the 1982-1983  crisis the "model" was almost completely abandoned. He returned  to the central line of the economic policies begun in 1974. He  succeeded in reestablishing credibility and in redirecting the  economy. He deserves a great deal of credit for that.    [Correa] What was "the great achievement" of Foxley?    [Villarzu] He succeeded in giving form to the model of  growth  with equity which brought in more important elements of  macroeconomic leadership, adding to it, and with great  determination, the component of social justice. The neoliberal  view of Buchi gave priority to growth as the central,  controlling element of the strategy of development,  fundamentally supported by the activity of the private sector  and minimizing state activity to the maximum extent. And the  people profited because the benefits of that growth sooner or  later went to them.    [Correa] And is that not correct? Can there be development  without growth?    [Villarzu] The fact is that in a society like that of Chile,  where great social differences coexist, side by side, it must be  assumed that a third party--the Armed Forces or an authoritarian  government--will guarantee political, economic, and social  stability. In a free society it is very difficult for an economy  to move forward quickly in coexistence with economic sectors  living in extreme poverty. The "Buchi model" presupposed that  social conflict will be regulated in another way.    [Correa] Does this mean that Buchi would not have been  successful in a democracy?    [Villarzu] Exactly. A refusal to raise pensions to allow for  inflation and adjusting the economy by decreasing spending on  health, education, and infrastructure would have generated such  tension that it would have been impossible to succeed in  maintaining growth. In a free society long term growth is  maintained in a framework of political and social stability.  That presupposes that all Chileans clearly perceive that the  benefits of the efforts made are distributed equitably.    [Correa] But that is not the situation today.    [Villarzu] We have made significant progress. And that is  the  fundamental difference between the "Buchi model" and the "Foxley  model." The economy has grown at an average of 6.3 percent over  the past four years. This is practically the same as during the  last five years of the Military Government, when the figure was  6.4 percent. Simultaneously, inflation has declined from about  30 percent annually, which is what we had at the end of 1989, to  about 12 or 12.5 percent in 1993. The external position of the  country is much more solid, so solid that it will make it  possible for us to resolve our international crisis without any  difficulty.    [Correa] But the economy is shrinking, and it is expected  that 1994 will be "a discouraging year."    [Villarzu] I do not think so. Investment, which is what  makes  it possible to maintain long-term growth, has been  extraordinarily high in the private sector. The coefficient of  investment--the proportion between investment and Gross Domestic  Product--will exceed 27 percent. During this election year, when  investment normally tends to stop, private investment will grow  between 15 and 20 percent in real terms. During the  administration of President Aylwin the economy has performed  better than it did during the best years of the Military  Government, the period from 1985 to 1989. And, simultaneously,  notable progress has been made on social matters, such as  reducing the number of the poor to about 1.3 million. Among the  poor about 800,000 are destitute. Between 1985 and 1989 minimum  salaries fell by 2.7 percent in real terms. During 1993 they  will grow by about 10 percent, on the average. The rate of  unemployment has declined to a substantial extent.    [Correa] The average growth rate of 6.4 percent during the  period in office of the present administration will decline to  4.0 or 5.0 percent. Some people say that it will decline even  more.    [Villarzu] During the present administration the economy  grew  at an average rate of 6.3 percent, despite the fact that in 1990  it grew by only 3.0 percent, as a result of the restrictive  measures taken to slow down too rapid an expansion of the  economy, in part caused by the expansionist policy followed by  the previous administration for what were, I believe, electoral  purposes. That situation made it necessary to cool off the  economy.    [Correa] And what will the next administration inherit from  the present one? [Villarzu] Starting in 1993, the Chilean  economy began to feel the full force of the international  situation--a recession in Europe and stagnation in the United  States and Japan. That process began at the end of 1990, and the  greatest impact was felt in the United States in 1991, the only  year in which the North American economy recorded a net decline.  That situation will have less of an impact in Chile in 1993 than  in the past because we have diversified our export base.    And now a third of our exports are going to other countries  in the Americas; a third of our exports are going to Asia and  the Pacific; and a third of our exports are going to Europe and  the Middle East. As the impact of the international  deterioration has not been the same everywhere, that has also  made it possible for us to deal with it more effectively. We are  feeling the impact of the recession now because, in addition to  the decline in demand, the prices of some of our key export  products have fallen. This effect will be with us during part of  1994.    [Correa] Will it be stronger than it was in 1993?    [Villarzu] No. It is difficult to see how prices--such as  that for copper--could deteriorate more than they have up to  this point. The average price will be lower than it was in 1993  but not lower than it is today. I would say that the worst  period of the international recession is already over. We are  feeling its impact, which will continue with us for some time  and then will change as the world economy becomes more active.  Already there are clear signs of recovery in the external  economy. For example, it is expected that in 1993 the United  States will have a minimum growth rate of 2.7 percent. Some  people are talking about a figure closer to 3.0 percent in 1994.  In Europe, where the most complicated case is Germany, it is  estimated that in 1993 there will be a decline of between 2.0  and 2.5 percent in Gross Domestic Product. However, virtually  all of the analysts are talking about a recovery in the German  economy in 1994. That is a situation reflected in all of the  economies of the world. The recovery will be slow, and we will  feel its effects toward the end of 1994 or the beginning of  1995. There be a year of slower growth in 1994 than 1993. The  year 1993 was not a "bad year" for an economy which grows at  that level, when the world economy has grown by an average of  about 2.0 percent.    [Correa] Is there no danger of a new adjustment?    [Villarzu] No. The adjustment has been taking place only  gradually. When an economy like that of Chile--which exports 35  percent of its Gross Domestic Product--encounters weak, external  demand, there is less domestic activity. That is what is  happening.    [Correa] If you were minister of finance, would you favor  expanding or diminishing the role of the state?    [Villarzu] I am for strengthening the state. Not enlarging  it  but giving it the necessary tools to transform itself by  articulating the process of development and the common efforts  being made by employers, workers, and society.    [Correa] You have said that you are in favor of privatizing  "everything that can be privatized." Where would you begin?    [Villarzu] I would begin with companies which are not  private  monopolies and which are engaged in open activities.    [Correa] Would you privatize CODELCO [Chilean Copper  Corporation] under any circumstances?    [Villarzu] Under no circumstances. Candidate Alessandri used  to say that he would privatize CODELCO, but later he changed his  mind. CODELCO is a strategic enterprise. It must be made into an  efficient one. That is the most profitable kind of company that  we could have.    [Correa] Chile has assets worth billions of dollars which  bring in an average return of 3.0 percent. Without CODELCO that  return would decline to 0.5 percent. Do you not consider that  sufficient proof of inefficiency?    [Villarzu] No. Among that group of state-owned companies is  ENACAR [National Coal Enterprise], which loses a lot of money.  The company is engaged in a process of rationalization and  reconversion. State companies should be in a position to operate  as if they were private companies. Therefore, we are preparing a  draft Statute of Public Enterprises. We must insist that they be  as efficient and open in their operations as if they were  private corporations.    [Correa] Regarding the program for modernizing CODELCO, are  you prepared to reduce employment by 4,000, since, according to  some studies, these workers are no longer needed by the company?    [Villarzu] We are prepared to do so gradually, in agreement  with the workers.    [Correa] Do you support a free-floating rate of exchange?    [Villarzu] I am not so much a supporter of a free-floating  exchange rate as I am in favor of moving forward by eliminating  a series of foreign exchange restrictions now in effect which,  in view of the world situation and the level of development of  the Chilean market, are no longer justified.    [Correa] Which of the laws pending approval by Congress are  the most urgent?    [Villarzu] The law on the capital market and the banking law  are of vital importance. I hope that they will be approved by  Congress before March 1994.    [Correa] Do you share the concern felt by Minister of  Finance  Foxley about a free trade treaty with the United States?    [Villarzu] The Bush administration and the present North  American administration have expressed interest in entering into  this kind of treaty with Chile. Conditions already exist for  that kind of initiative to go well. We will have to begin  negotiations on that treaty at some point in 1994. Foxley is  ending his term of office, leaving that loaf of bread, as it  were, ready to go into the oven. However, like Alejandro Foxley,  I think that this is a matter which will have to be handled with  a great deal of patience. Negotiations with the United States  will be difficult. An eventual TLC [Free Trade Treaty] with the  United States would have advantages for Chile. However, during  the process of negotiations we should keep very clearly in mind  which are our own interests over the medium term of years and  which are the interests of the United States. And we must  consider our real possibilities, particularly with regard to the  sectors of our economy which would be affected, positively or  negatively, by that treaty. We have to consider the treaty  calmly. This does not mean that we will not complete the  negotiations as quickly as possible. Rather, we will do so, but  very prudently.    [Correa] You said that public spending should be reduced,  and  your views have been considered to be clear criticism of  Minister of Finance Foxley.    [Villarzu] No. What I said is that to ensure macroeconomic  stability over the medium term, it is important for public  spending not to grow more than the potential capacity of the  economy.    [Correa] But it happens that public spending has been  growing  more quickly.    [Villarzu] Not on a cash basis.    [Correa] How can you say that? During the past three years  public spending has grown more than Gross Domestic Product.    [Villarzu] That happened in 1991 and 1992 and will probably  happen also in 1993. However, on the average, over the past four  years, it has not grown that much. When the present  administration entered office, it clearly pointed out that it  had to deal with a tremendous need to make up shortcomings in  spending, inherited from the previous government, in the areas  of health, education, infrastructure, and housing. And to do  this, it reached agreement with RN [the National Renovation  party] to raise taxes to finance an increase in spending. That  was a campaign promise regarding its program, and it was then  supported by a great consensus in the country.    [Correa] If you should become responsible for state  finances,  in what areas would you reduce spending?    [Villarzu] The team which has been working on the government  program thinks that it is not a matter of reducing spending.  That is the first mistake which must be clarified.    [Correa] Then the program involves increasing spending?    [Villarzu] There will be slower growth in spending because,  in effect, it will not be possible to continue the pace of  growth of spending recorded in the years 1991 and 1992. Among  other things, this is because we will not have new tax reform  legislation to deal with.    [Correa] However, in the view of public opinion it does not  appear that this more substantial level of spending has been  translated into social improvement, particularly in the field of  health, where spending has more than doubled.    [Villarzu] In 1989, $564 million were spent on health. In  the  budget for 1994 we are talking about expenditures in the  vicinity of $1.2 billion. It is the same thing with education.  We have to have a little patience about this. A major effort has  been made to improve pensions, raise minimum salaries, improve  the jobs picture, and increase spending on school lunches. This  has been an effort which will bear fruit over the next few years.    [Correa] Do you not believe that what should be done is to  change the structure of the health system? That is, subsidizing  demand instead of subsidizing supply?    [Villarzu] I believe that what is being spent on health in  Chile is considerable. However, in effect, we have not yet  resolved the problems of providing health care. The overall  health indicators--infant mortality, life expectancy, etc.--show  spectacularly good results, approaching those of a developed  country. Our problem is the inadequate attention which we are  paying, particularly to the poorest element in the country. That  is a fundamental concern of the present and the next  administration. It is not a matter of increasing resources now  but rather using them more efficiently. It is a problem of  management. To do that, we plan to move forward in a decisive  way to decentralize the health system. Here we have to make very  fundamental changes, but the idea of subsidizing demand instead  of the supply of health services has turned out to be a failure  throughout the world. It has increased the cost of providing  health services in an impressive way. We can move forward in a  way which will guarantee greater freedom of choice to the users  of health services. However, we are absolutely against the  simplistic formula of subsidizing the demand for health services  which the right-wing candidacies of Alessandri and Pinera are  proposing!    [Correa] You have not said where you would reduce public  spending.    [Villarzu] There is rather little room for maneuver in  reducing the budget. The most probable outcome is that we will  have to achieve generalized savings in spending which would not  affect salaries and allowances and, as far as possible, would  not affect spending with a social impact. We may be able to  lower spending on the purchase of goods and services and on some  investment programs, by reducing the rate of project  implementation.    [Correa] You have proposed replacing the complementary,  overall tax with a tax on private spending.    [Villarzu] "In our program we point out that it would be  appropriate, while respecting our commitment not to increase the  tax burden, to change the tax system to make it into a more  effective instrument to encourage savings, both by individuals  as well as by companies. We are exploring the idea of a tax on  spending which, theoretically, looks very attractive. However,  it has proved to be very difficult to implement. It could  stimulate tax evasion and a fall in tax collections. Rather than  replacing the complementary, overall tax with a tax on general  spending, we are thinking of some specific taxes."    And he added: "It is said that the public sector should  spend  less, which would make it possible for the Central Bank to lower  the interest rate, because the increase in private spending  which would occur in that case would be compensated for by less  public spending. We have pointed out that, in effect, we could  try to ensure that public spending would grow less and, since it  is necessary for aggregate spending by the economy (total public  spending plus private spending) to grow less, private spending  would also have to grow less."    [Correa] To do this, would taxes go up?    [Villarzu] If we want to lower interest rates, the only way  to do this would be by imposing a specific tax. For example, a  tax on gasoline. It could also be done by increasing the VAT  [Value Added Tax], but I do not like that kind of solution,  since it has another kind of impact.    The fact is that what is collected under such a tax, which  would be approved in the law, would involve an advance payment  to the Central Bank. In that way the Central Bank would be in a  position to lower the interest rate, which would be advantageous  to the private sector and, in particular, to exporters.    [Correa] Increasing taxes?    [Villarzu] No. Our basic commitment is to maintain the  present tax load. However, this transitional instrument could be  necessary. A specific tax would favor the productive sectors of  the country and will not be enacted if there is not a sufficient  consensus in support of it.    [Correa] Will you be as tough as Buchi or as Foxley in not  increasing expenditures in response to pressures from various  sectors?    [Villarzu] I do not like to use the term "tough," but I can  be tough when I have to be.</p>

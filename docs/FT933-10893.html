			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Flexibility is key to ERM restyling - Looser system evolves for linking Europe's currencies THE European exchange rate mechanism lives to fight another day - but only just. This morning's agreement by European Community finance ministers in Brussels  -reached only minutes before the markets opened in Tokyo - provides a revamped, new-look ERM which is completely different from the system's architecture when it was sketched out in 1979. The accord, hammered out after nearly 12 hours of negotiations, provides for a minimalist form of currency linkage involving fluctuation bands of 15 per cent - much bigger than the 2.25 per cent bands which until today applied for most of the system's eight currencies. The ministers' preferred solution to patching up the mechanism was forced on them after unprecedented selling of weak ERM currencies at the end of last week which brought the mechanism close to collapse. The talks exposed deep divisions among the EC member states about the kind of framework for currency co-operation which they wanted. It featured strong determination by Germany in particular to see constructed a more flexible ERM which would reduce the heavy intervention operations which the Bundesbank has been forced into during the past year as part of the effort of propping up weak ERM currencies. While Britain appeared to play a constructive role in using its own experiences of being ousted from the ERM last year as providing useful lessons for the system's future operation, the meeting exposed Spain as the one EC nation firmly in the camp of suspending the system's rules at least temporarily to allow currencies to float and so permit lower interest rates. What emerges from today's agreement is a much looser system for keeping currencies close to each other. It will be seen by some hardline ERM supporters as a dilution of the idea of forcing different countries' economies to converge by enforcing only restricted movement by their respective currencies around a central rate. On these grounds, some will doubt whether the overall goals of the ERM have been retained. However, the revamp answers the strong conjecture that because of the inflationary implications of German unification the role of the D-Mark as the ERM anchor had been seriously weakened. By permitting a much greater degree of currency movement, the new operating rules should provide extra flexibility that could deter further reduction in investor confidence. A further plus, in the eyes of the designers of the new-look ERM, is that in theory it should be able to provide for lower interest rates by several of the countries in the system. And by retaining the existing central parities against then D-Mark of all the seven other currencies in the mechanism, it ensures that no country will have to admit to having agreed to a politically humiliating devaluation. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, told reporters that Germany had produced the first proposals for resolving the ERM crisis. These focused on two areas: widening the fluctuation bands and suspending the obligations to intervene on behalf of weaker member currencies. Underlying the German move was a desire to preserve the European monetary system and the ERM parity grid. This was the minimum area of agreement reached during Saturday's discussions of the EC's monetary committee. Mr Waigel said there had been 'many, many rounds of talks' between member states, often chaired by Belgium which holds rotating presidency of the European Community. The proposal to suspend the ERM's operating rules was strongly resisted by the European Commission.</p>

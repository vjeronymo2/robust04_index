			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Krivomazov of the RVSN [Strategic </F> Missile Troops] Press-group and Aleksandr Dolinin of `Krasnaya  Zvezda', entitled: "Armored Missile Trains are Not Getting Lost:  Concerning one `Sensation'".]    [Text] Recently our press brought to readers the  following piece of stunning news: Supposedly, at the Kurya  station near Perm local journalists discovered an unattended  element of six train cars, in which, in their opinion, was  located an RS-22 rail-based strategic missile system  [kompleks].    It is best of all to verify the facts of that kind of  `sensation'. We in fact did this. But, probably, it makes  sense to take the opportunity to tell the readers about BZhRK  [Combat Rail-based (Ballistic) Missile Systems] such as that.  It is a combat railroad missile system, currently in the  inventory of the Strategic Missile Troops. It is equipped with  an RS-22 (SS-24) missile. Its throw-weight is more than 4  tonnes.    The BZhRKs are attached to railroad stations in large oblast  centers of Russia. In peacetime they stand in well-protected  zones in readiness to launch a missile or to move out on the  railroad main line. When there is a threat of attack they may  be switched to mobile status.    The idea of positioning a missile system on a railroad  platform has a long history. The Americans came closest to it  at the beginning of the 1970's. However, they did not go all  the way to the actual repositioning in rail cars of their  `Minuteman' intercontinental ballistic missiles. Too many  problems were encountered along the way.    The government entrusted the creation of our BZhRK to the  cooperation of industrial enterprises headed by the `Yuzhnoye'  scientific-production association. The general designer of this  system was B.F. Utkin. The railroad system was placed in  operational service in 1984. Among the missile troops the  modest name `poyezd' [train] was attached to it. And in fact,  when viewing the components with refrigerator or passenger cars,  it was difficult to distinguish it from the common ones. True,  you do not see people around the `missile train'. They are  inside, on combat alert duty. The duty combat team serves under  continuous technical control of the launch systems and the  missile's on-board systems. The train is provided with modern  communications, and automated security and defensive equipment.    What occurs, if the `Launch' command is received on board  the  `missile' train? The BZhRK is fixed in place [?], fastened fast  to the rails. Having started the launch covers fold to the side  and a twenty meter cylindrical tower containing the missile  rises above the car...    ...And there, according to the assertion of people in Perm,  of Moscow journalists, that train appears to have been dropped.  In actuality that is not the case.    As we have already explained, the missile system [Kompleks]  -- this is the total of functionally connected equipment and  systems [Sistem] , intended for the launch of a missile, flight  control and the fulfillment of other tasks. It includes the  missile and ground equipment. According to their designations  there are combat, research and training systems [kompleksy].  Thus, in the case of the one named in the news reports, only  portions [elementy] were actually there, and those were only of  a research rail system [kompleks]. In this object there was  neither a missile, nor missile fuel, nor will there be. Planned  firing range tests were conducted on it up till 1990.    The Perm journalists' `find' was not lost, but rather was  transfered in this very year to the Perm VVKUY RV [Higher  Military Command Engineer School of the Missile Troops], where  it was used as part of the instructional equipment. The object  was written off on 22 October 1993, and all secret and valuable  equipment was removed from it. In essence, the discussion is  about scrap metal. In a word, the rail-cars, intended for  dismantling, were preserved.    That is the whole truth about the pseudo-sensation. It is  understood that competent readers, without much effort, can note  the `ears' [i.e. cover-up] in the publications about the `lost  armored train'. The rest need not be concerned: The question  concerns only the next `falsehood'. Certainly no `armored  train' of the Strategic Missile Troops has been lost. One may  complain only about another thing -- the fact that readers,  including journalists, know little about the various missile  systems and the hard work of those who serve them.</p>

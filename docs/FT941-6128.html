			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Westminster auditor seizes papers Mr John Magill, Westminster city council's district auditor, yesterday impounded documents in the council's offices and said he is considering a further investigation into the council's alleged 'gerrymandering' policy. The documents were identified by Mr Magill and four of his assistants who visited Westminster city hall yesterday morning. They will be held in 'joint custody' by the council's acting managing director, Mr Bill Roots, and Mr Magill at least until mid-October. In January Mr Magill published provisional findings that six Conservative councillors - one of whom has since committed suicide - and four council officers should be surcharged Pounds 21.5m. He said they had manipulated the council's housing policy so that council house sales were concentrated in eight politically marginal wards. Touche Ross, in which Mr Magill is a partner, said his visit to city hall was not directly connected to the designated sales policy. It said: 'The auditor and the council have received a number of questions on the 'Building Stable Communities' policy of which designated sales are alleged to be a part.' The documents held in custody are 'relevant to this matter'. Mr Magill's priority is to resolve the designated sales inquiry before he makes any further investigation. He also announced that the nine people named in his January report will have until April 8 to request an oral hearing on the allegations. This would then take place in mid-October. The 'Building Stable Communities' programme was launched by the council's former leader, Dame Shirley Porter, in 1986. Its official aim is to prevent the long-term migration of residents from Westminster and includes 'quality of life' initiatives to improve the local environment and bans on office developments in residential areas. The council defended the policy by pointing to the 1991 census which showed a rise in the borough's population over the previous 10 years. It had previously decreased every census since 1911. Mr Neale Coleman, co-ordinator of the objectors to Westminster's policy, described yesterday's events as an 'anti-shredding manoeuvre'. He said: 'If Mr Magill's final view is anything remotely approximate to his provisional view then he plainly will have to investigate all the other matters.'</p>

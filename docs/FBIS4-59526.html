			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council </F> member and assistant YSP secretary general, by Salim Badawi;  place and date not given; from the weekly "The Event"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Muhammad] Following the eruption of battles in  Sufyan and the 3d Brigade, the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party]  called for the formation of an inquiry commission. Regrettably,  the incidents continued. The Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar was  also attacked, after which the military situation exploded. We  really regret the accusations. We also urge the stopping of  this bleeding, this crushing war raging among the sons of the  Yemeni people, which claims the lives of Yemen's sons.    [Badawi] Concerning the nature of war, Mr. Salim Salih  Muhammad, the northern Yemenis claim that the fighting is taking  place between the Constitutional legitimacy and the rebelling  forces of the YSP leadership, as they put it. What is the YSP's  viewpoint on the nature of the raging conflict?    [Muhammad] Are we not also part of the legitimacy? Have we  not assumed power in light of the results of elections in the  country? Are we not part of the Presidential Council, the  Council of Ministers, the House of Representatives, and the  other state institutions? We do not come from islands in the  Pacific Ocean. We come from Yemen. We are Yemen's sons. We  have been representatives of a state and a recognized legitimate  power. We have achieved unity on an equal basis with our  brothers in the north. Such claims do not render any service.  In fact, they further exacerbate the conflict. Very  regrettably, they also open a very deep wound in Yemeni unity  and national unity.    [Badawi] The northerners' conditions for a cease-fire are  represented by the YSP leadership's adherence to Constitutional  legitimacy, and the submission to the legitimacy led by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, as they say. Are you willing to accept these  conditions? What are your conditions, as the YSP, to stop  fighting?    [Muhammad] The YSP has never proposed that 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih should be finished or go, or that the existing legitimacy,  represented by the Presidential Council, the Council of  Ministers, the Parliament, or the other existing state  institutions, should go. However, he who has made the war  decision, and who is waging it now against his sons, army, and  people, to prove that he is the strongest and the triumphant, he  is the one who will eventually lose history and the people.    [Badawi] What are your conditions for a cease-fire?    [Muhammad] We have no conditions other than actually  beginning to implement the pledge and accord document, to  recognize people's rights and duties, and to build the modern  Yemeni state. Some sides believe the military option will give  them the upper hand over everything, and enable them to  establish their regime the way they want, in accordance with  their own interpretations. Such a decision, I believe, is a  crazy decision. The Yemeni Armed Forces and Yemeni  installations are now being destroyed. Innocent people are  being killed, the Yemeni people in Aden, Sanaa, al-Dali', Abyan,  Shabwah, and Dhamar. These people are the victims of this crazy  war which will not achieve the objectives of those who ignited  the war.    [Badawi] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was quoted as saying  that he wants to try 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his men, or to allow  them to leave the country. What is your opinion about this?    [Muhammad] I have not heard such a thing. What I ask for  now, from he who has reason and really wants to avoid further  involvement in these crazy battles which, as I said, claim the  lives of the sons of the Yemeni people, we ask them at this  critical moments when the homeland is suffering from an ordeal  and fragmentation, to stop the war immediately and resort to the  language of dialogue, logic, and reason.    [Badawi] What about the dismissal decisions that affected  senior southern officials, led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid? The  northerners say that southern deputies participated in the  voting sessions. Is that true?    [Muhammad] In your opinion, and in view of the current  conditions, the state of emergency, and in view of the campaigns  of physical liquidation we heard about in Sanaa, who would  participate in such sessions? What kind of democratic, peaceful  atmosphere would they have in a state of war? The world, the  Arabs, and the Yemenis must understand what is going on in Yemen  now. The situation is serious. It needs assistance from all  our brothers and friends.    [Badawi] With regard to the rumors about appointing a  successor to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and others in the central  government in Sanaa, especially in the Presidential Council -- a  probable candidate is rumored to be 'Ali Nasir Muhammad -- how  do you view such reports?    [Muhammad] These issues are presented as bargaining chips in  order to be used in haggling. In my opinion, the people have  this right. The people gave their votes to their  representatives in areas from which we came. These people have  this right.    [Badawi] Now that the situation cannot be decided on the  battlefield -- a week has passed since the outbreak of  hostilities -- what are the chances that a return to dialogue  will be effected and unity saved?    [Muhammad] There is no other way, regardless of the battles.  The warring sides must eventually negotiate. I think that  regardless of the harshness of the situation or the number of  victims, we must preserve what is left and resort to the correct  method, the method of dialogue, irrespective of differences. As  for the war methods, regardless of their quick results, it will  have very serious consequences in the future. It will not only  cause wounds but will lead to a great suffering and moving the  Yemeni people 30 to 40 years backward.    [Badawi] In your view, is it possible to save the unity?    [Muhammad] In my opinion, if the political will that was  available when the unity was reached is still there, the answer  is yes. However, judging by the methods that are being used in  the battlefields and the vindictive way military personnel are  dealing with unarmed civilians in towns and villages, deep  wounds have been caused in national Yemeni unity.    [Badawi] Do you expect mediation, especially Arab mediation,  to result in positive results, particularly in the foreseeable  future?    [Muhammad] There is mediation and there are Arab efforts,  but  regrettably the brothers in Sanaa are rejecting all this. They  believe the military solution is the ideal solution. This  reading of the situation and of reality is tantamount to  gambling. We wish them guidance from God. We wish they are  guided to the right path.    [Badawi] In case Arab mediation fails, will you demand  international intervention by the UN Security Council and the  United Nations?    [Muhammad] So far, I have not been informed of any decisions  from the brothers at home but we will consult on all  possibilities, because everything is possible.</p>

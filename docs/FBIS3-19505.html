Nevertheless, balanced trade (in 1993 Austria achieved a 16.4  billion-schilling surplus) is not expected before the end of the  1990's.    In January 1994, however, imports from the region increased  significantly: They were up 28.3 percent to a level of 3.3  billion schillings, while exports increased only by 5.6 percent  to 4 billion schillings, Egon Winkler, head of the foreign  economic department of the Economics Chamber, said in a news  conference on Thursday [17 March] on the occasion of the East  European foreign trade meeting. Exports to East Europe last year  increased by 5 percent to 59.2 billion schillings, while imports  decreased 1.2 percent to 42.8 billion schillings. Hungary was  Austria's most important customer in 1993, with Austrian exports  amounting to 16.5 billion schillings. The Czech Republic came in  second, with Austrian exports totaling 11.3 billion schillings.    Slovenia was the third most important market in East Europe,  with imports from Austria reaching 6.8 million schillings. The  Austrian trade delegate to Ljubljana, Raymund Gradt, said that  the geographical proximity was one reason for this, but he also  noted the country's relatively good economic situation and the  relatively high purchasing power as a result of major wage  increases in 1993. Moreover, Slovene companies are "prompt  payers."    Poland, which comes fourth, last year imported Austrian  products worth 6.4 billion schillings. It is followed by  Russia, with imports from Austria amounting to 6.2 billion  schillings.    As far as transactions with Russia are concerned, Austria  has  now provided the opportunity for Control Bank credit guarantees  again under certain conditions, sources from the Finance  Ministry have stated. Guarantees will be provided for  short-term transactions (with a duration of up to one year) with  a ceiling of 30 million schillings. The special condition in  this connection, however, is that such guarantees also require a  bank guarantee from Russia.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Redland Redland makes a convincing case that its German wonder story will continue for a while. Sales in the west may soften next year as tax subsidies for housing decline, but Redland achieved the notable feat of making more money in east Germany than in the UK last year. That part of the German market, at least, should keep sales marching strongly ahead - although there must be longer term doubts over whether a 24 per cent return on sales will eventually invite fiercer competition. Whatever happens in Germany, Redland should still benefit from an upturn in volumes and prices in the UK and France, where it makes operating margins of just 4 per cent on turnover of almost Pounds 900m. Redland has still to reap the full benefits of rationalising Steetley's French businesses. There is mileage left in improving its pricing strategy in the UK, too. An additional bonus will come from Redland's tax juggling, ensuring UK and French profits are effectively earned tax-free. Even so, Redland's earnings may prove lacklustre set against its UK peers because of the spread of its operations and the profusion of shares. The prospects for dividend increases are also comparatively dull. Redland was one of the few building materials companies not to have cut its dividend during recession. That has left it with an uncomfortably high pay-out ratio. But in today's market conditions, Redland's dividend yield of almost 6 per cent makes its shares look more defensible than most.</p>

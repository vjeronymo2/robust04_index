			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Thyssen in group bid for Klockner-Werke steel mill THYSSEN and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steel producers, said yesterday they would lead a consortium of European steelmakers to take over part of the steel operations of Klockner-Werke. the embattled German steel group. The consortium wants to acquire the cold rolling mill in Klockner-Werke's steel plant in Bremen. 'We will study this offer as carefully as any other. Negotiations with foreign partners have been running for some time already,' Klockner-Werke said. The proposal depends on the success of the debt relief plan under which Klockner-Werke hopes to write off DM1.7bn of its DM2.4bn (Dollars 1.5bn) net debt. The company's main creditors, including Deutsche Bank and other leading German banks, have in principle agreed to the plan. A final meeting of creditors is scheduled for June 7. However, the debt relief scheme still depends on the approval of the European Commission, which has a DM175m outstanding loan to the group. Last week, the EC said it would not push for the loan's full recovery pending a review of Klockner-Werke's restructuring plans. The EC wants to make sure that significant production cuts are made by Klockner-Werke to support the commission's overall plan to restructure the European steel industry. Klockner-Werke will present its restructuring deal to the EC on Wednesday. The company plans to cut its raw steel production by 20 per cent, with a blast furnace in Bremen set for closure. However, it may have to consider reducing production of its hot rolling mill in Bremen to satisfy EC demands, industry analysts said. Like the EC, Klockner-Werke's competitors are eager to see significant production cuts made to relieve the over-capacity crisis plugging the European steel industry. They have an interest in the debt relief scheme going through to prevent Klockner-Werke from going into outright bankruptcy. 'A bankrupt steelmaker would be a danger because a competitor could buy it for nothing,' a source in the German steel industry said.</p>

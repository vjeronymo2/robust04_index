			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKYER'S BILL ON WAITING  </P> <P> So someone at last is speaking out for all of us who sit and wait and wait and  wait for the repairman or the deliveryman who does not show up.  </P> <P> Cheers for Lockyer and his legislation which would penalize, by up to $500 in  Small Claims Court, the no-shows who don't even have the courtesy to call.  </P> <P> Cheers for striking a blow against consumer abuse.  </P> <P> This is a bill whose time has come. This is the bill we have been waiting for.  </P> <P> MICHELE MILLER REGAL  </P> <P> Idyllwild  </P></p>

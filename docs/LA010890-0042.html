			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> PROBE OF HEATING OIL PRICES SOUGHT  </P> <P> Alleging "gluttonous thievery from the new robber barons," Sen. Alfonse M.  D'Amato (R-N.Y.) demanded an investigation into the oil industry for possible  collusion in raising home heating oil prices.  </P> <P> Driven by unseasonably cold temperatures, the prices rose to record highs in  December. D'Amato noted the price per gallon for consumers last week was $1.40,  an increase of 43 cents from November. The House Energy and Commerce Committee  was scheduled to hold a hearing on the increase Tuesday.  </P></p>

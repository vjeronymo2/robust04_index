			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (15): Foreign activity lifted by new push for economic reform - Business guide / The prospects for doing business in China have never been as good since the country began opening to the outside world in the late 1970s 'IT'S an extremely exciting time', said a US lawyer. 'Things have been quite hot since Deng Xiaoping made his visit down south. The Chinese have become more aggressive and flexible and are really pushing.' A foreign business executive said: 'The first quarter is traditionally a slow season but our office in Beijing had the highest volume of sales during that time in 12 years of doing business in China.' Within the last year, the political climate for doing business has changed significantly. China's economic retrenchment policy is officially over. The international political fall-out from the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square has eased. Beijing concluded a memorandum of understanding on intellectual property rights with the US, clarified its tax law for foreigners, and plans to join the Berne Convention on copyright for literary and artistic works. Talks with the US on opening China's markets to foreign products have shown some progress. Under US pressure, China has slowly begun publishing regulations which affect business but which were considered secret. However, daunting obstacles still confront foreign business people in China. It is a tough market to crack even for those who do the necessary research for their products or project. Here are some points to be remembered and tips gathered from long-time China traders about how to do business: The Chinese system is in a process of quasi-reform, but is still a planned economy. The pricing structure is not rational and policies and regulations can change suddenly. For example, the price of steel jumped 50 per cent last year. Accurate forecasts of costs are difficult. Because the economy is state-run in many sectors, and responds to administrative decisions rather than to supply and demand, the Chinese often do not react to business proposals within a reasonable amount of time. Concluding a business transaction takes much longer than in industrialised countries. Co-operation between provinces is poor with the result that it is virtually impossible to take advantage of economies of scale. In one instance, a businessman wanted to ship petrol tanks made for his factory in Shanghai to another similar operation in the north-eastern province of Jilin. But neither the governor of Jilin nor the mayor of Shanghai would accept this. The factories are therefore duplicating each other's efforts, to the frustration of the foreign management. Financial institutions which are common in other countries do not exist, with the result that many people with whom one is dealing are not familiar with the minutia of international business. China has no corporate law and the country's legal foundation is very rudimentary and is being built from scratch. Because of the lack of legal redress, forming relationships with the Chinese is critical to the success of a business venture. 'You must work at all levels to develop contacts,' an experienced executive said. 'It is not enough to work at the top level. Today's middle management will be tomorrow's leaders.' If you don't pay attention to this aspect of your business, you will fail or have a tough road. When problems arise, and they inevitably do, you have a relationship established. That's the key to success.' Determining whether the Chinese party has the authority to sign the contract or participate in a deal is crucial. Provincial enterprises may require approval from the central government. An essential criterion is the value of a transaction. Deals exceeding certain amounts need the go-ahead from the central government. What requires permission from the central authorities in one case is not always the same each time. The climate fluctuates between centralisation and de-centralisation. 'You can make a deal with a government-owned corporation which will say it has the authority to sign the memorandum of understanding,' one executive said. 'Suddenly, the competition is back in. The MoU was not authorised by the central government. You thought you had a deal, but now you must start from scratch. You may still get your way, but you will sacrifice more before you get in.' Selecting a good partner is vital and one of the most difficult tasks. Whether foreign business people are participating in a joint venture, running a trading operation, or starting their own wholly-owned enterprise, they need an ally. The right partner can make all the difference. 'It's better to have a good partner than none', said Mr John Frisbie, a representative of the US-China Business Council, 'But no partner is better than a bad one'. A joint venture with a good partner should have the following characteristics: it should be financially sound, have political clout and solid contacts in the domestic market, and it should share a common vision with its foreign half. If the Chinese party has goals different from those of the foreign ones, it should be able to understand and accommodate them. Finding a good partner can be difficult. It is important to conduct a nationwide industry survey using the services of consultants, trade associations, embassy commercial sections, and chambers of commerce. 'Any foreign company approaching China for the first time should not be able to plead ignorance if it does something wrong,' one analyst said. 'There are enough sources of information and advice available. If a company gets burned, that's not a good excuse anymore.' Knowing where to invest in China can be an almost overwhelming decision. In the coastal provinces, logistics are better, officials are more familiar with international business practices. However, one long-time China trader said: 'Companies should go where the greatest need is. The areas of greatest need give more bargaining power.' Financing can be a severe problem. In spite of China's large foreign exchange reserves, many domestic companies have no direct access to hard currency. An operation must frequently stand on its own. 'The government has asked us to borrow foreign exchange outside China, but the high cost and the foreign exchange risk are a burden for the joint venture', one western manager said. 'Finally, the customer pays for the government decision with the high price of the product.' Because of this, finding an end-user who has access to foreign exchange is important. Whatever product or service a foreigner is selling, analysts caution that its success can often depend on what China's spending priorities are. Ascertaining whether a project or product fits into the country's state plan is vital. 'What is good one year may not be good the next', said Mr Frisbie. 'Last year was a good sales year for equipment, computers, electronics, and certain kinds of raw materials that China does not make.' Although the Chinese are committed to reducing import licenses for specific product categories, tariff rates are still high in many cases and there are other import bans on certain product lines. For those buying from China, contracts should be as detailed as possible on critical issues such as quality and delivery time. Clearly spelling out what happens if certain standards are not met can help avoid problems later. Some businessmen argue that contracts can be simplified and still address the important points. This may be contrary to western business practices. 'Every time in my experience when lawyers are physically present during negotiations, there are problems,' one executive said. 'The Chinese see red when they see lawyers, and it is best to keep them out of sight.' The issue of obtaining political risk insurance was a sore point after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989 and delayed the conclusion of a number of contracts, business executives said. Asking the government for political risk insurance against riots was viewed as an insult when the official party line was that the country was stable. The diplomatic solution to the problem was to include it in the cost, obtain insurance outside the country, and not mention it. Corruption is a growing problem, particularly in the south, diplomats said. The smuggling of high tariff items for use in a joint venture can make legitimate competition difficult for those companies who import through legal channels and pay the high customs duties. One US company pulled out of its negotiations when it learned its competitor was offering the Chinese customer television sets. The bottom line: 'China is a strategic market and is still not easy to penetrate,' one experienced western diplomat said. 'But the pay-off can be significant for companies that have the resources to put in the effort.'</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: DAVIS FAMILY HASN'T LOST ITS TASTE FOR TAKEOVERS  </P> <P> Without the Davis family, things would have been very boring on Wall Street  these past few months. Marvin Davis, the Los Angeles investor and oil man,  tried and failed to acquire both NWA Inc. and UAL Corp.  </P> <P> Both airline companies are being acquired by someone else, but Davis' forays  have made money for him and for traders on Wall Street who would have spent the  summer doing crossword puzzles had it not been for Davis.  </P> <P> Last week I asked John Davis, Marvin's older son and partner, if the family  thought that the economic environment was still favorable for attempting  takeovers. I would have asked Marvin himself, but he doesn't talk to the press.  </P> <P> "There are some opportunities we still see in this country," says John Davis,  who thinks an economic slowdown that would make doing deals risky probably  won't begin for 12 to 18 months.  </P> <P> Even after the slowdown starts, Davis says, his family may keep their takeover  machine running by stepping into situations where previously accomplished  leveraged buyouts are failing. Davis, of course, wouldn't be specific as to  what companies, or even industries, that the clan is looking at.  </P> <P> And, Davis says, Europe could offer some opportunities. Some European  conglomerates, he says, "are not rationalized as efficiently as U.S.  companies." Take as an example BAT Industries PLC, which is being forced to  sell its retail operation, Davis says.  </P> <P> In Europe, Davis says, "there are different obstacles, but different  opportunities." Davis claims that he's looking at certain situations in Europe,  but hasn't yet decided to act.  </P> <P> "It looks to me like Europe is where the U.S. was in 1980 in terms of  inefficient conglomerates that could better realize their economic potential as  individual business units instead of diversified, unrelated groupings of  companies," says Davis.  </P> <P> On a more controversial matter, Davis says his family was "absolutely" serious  about wanting to acquire NWA and UAL, despite critics saying Marvin Davis was  simply trying to force NWA and UAL stocks higher so that he could add to his  billions.  </P> <P> John Davis says they had followed the airlines for two years and determined  that the industry, and particularly those two companies, had good prospects for  the next decade.  </P> <P> If so, are there any other airlines in the Davis' future? "I'm not sure what we  are going to do. We took a shot on the two most attractive properties," he  added.  </P> <P> The roar of Harley-Davidson's stock the past two weeks could have drowned out  the sound of one of its famous motorcycles.  </P> <P> Shares of Harley-Davidson were selling at slightly over $30 at the end of  August. But this week the stock breached the $40 mark as trading soared to 10  times its normal level.  </P> <P> Too bad that the takeover rumors that caused the increased trading activity  probably aren't true.  </P> <P> "No one has been knocking on our door," Harley president Richard Teerlink told  me. He adds that his company isn't interested in being acquired, and "we have  all the appropriate takeover defenses."  </P> <P> The main rumor stirring up the situation was that Ford Motor wanted to acquire  Harley-Davidson. Ford wasn't commenting, but executives at Harley, which is  based in Milwaukee, were quickly and quietly telling Wall Street analysts that  there was no truth to the gossip.  </P> <P> If you don't like that rumor, there was another one -- a standby, so to speak.  Harris Associates, a Chicago investment firm that already owns nearly 13% of  Harley, was said to be buying more stock.  </P> <P> But even if Harris was adding to its holdings, and its president Roger Brown  wouldn't comment, it doesn't mean that Harley is being chased by a shark.  Harris Associates has never attempted a hostile takeover, and sources say the  investment firm is so meek that it calls Harley executives any time it buys  more stock.  </P> <P> "There is nothing in Harris' background to indicate they are hostile," says  Teerlink.  </P> <P> Even if Harley isn't going to be acquired, there may be another compelling  reason why its stock should be going up.  </P> <P> Harley, the only major American manufacturer of motorcycles, is doing  unbelievably well in a business that once was nearly monopolized by foreign  competitors.  </P> <P> Brown of Harris is one of the stock's biggest boosters. He's been buying shares  regularly for months and his representatives have had meetings with Harley's  chairman, Vaughn Beals, and Teerlink. "We like the management and the value we  see in the stock," is about all that Brown will say. "We're always cordial.  They are very talented people."  </P> <P> Beals and Teerlink have other admirers on Wall Street. Recently, two brokerage  firms, Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee and Dean Witter Reynolds, spoke glowingly  of Harley. Daniel Kapusta, the analyst at Baird, says he sees Harley's stock  climbing to between $48 and $51 a share within the next year. "On a fundamental  basis, the stock looked cheap for a long time," says Kapusta.  </P> <P> Harley's business is "fantastic," says Kapusta. "We think they will have record  earnings this year."  </P> <P> Analysts are estimating that Harley's earnings could reach $4 a share this  year, easily topping 1988's record of $3.41 a share. And in 1990, profits could  rise a full dollar to $5 a share.  </P> <P> Probably more important, say the experts, is the fact that demographics are  working in Harley's favor. As the nation's population ages, the number of men  in their upper 30s who can afford to indulge in motorcycles is growing. And  that's the biggest market for the company's products.  </P> <P> And the loyalty of Harley's customers, the experts say, is unparalleled. "Do  you know any other company where customers tattoo the name of the company on  their body?" asks one expert.  </P> <P> Harley's only problem, it seems, is the takeover rumors. Not that the rumors  will come true. That's not the problem.  </P> <P> The biggest problem is what will happen to Harley's stock a few weeks from now  when the rumors don't pan out and Harley becomes just another company that's  doing well.  </P> <P> Investors had better be wearing their helmets.  </P> <P> Is F. W. Woolworth Co. really a takeover candidate? The gossip around Wall  Street last week was that some raider was about to go after the downscale  retailing chain. But several smart traders -- the type who won't buy a stock  unless a rumor makes sense to them -- were wondering out loud why anyone would  go after a retailer like Woolworth when chains like Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth  Avenue and Marshall Field's are up for grabs . . .  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Robusta COFFEE futures continued to surge at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday as signs of a pick-up in roaster interest added to the buoyant mood encouraged by news earlier in the week that African producers would join in the export retention scheme adopted by their Latin American counterparts. The November position closed at Dollars 1,215 a tonne, up Dollars 39 on the day, taking the rise on the week so far to Dollars 93. London COCOA futures were boosted by the New York market's break through stubborn resistance, but the sterling-denominated market was held back by the pound's firmness. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM provided the main feature as a battle developed around a key support level of Dollars 1,170 a tonne for three months metal. It managed to close 50 cents above that level operators trying to trigger US investment fund liquidation were countered by equally determined buyers. NICKEL took an early fall to a new six-year low of Dollars 4,640 as speculative selling and trade hedging of Russian metal continued. But it steadied on short-covering. Compiled from Reuters</p>

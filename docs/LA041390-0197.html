			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BAKKER COHORT ASKS LENIENCY  </P> <P> A judge known as "Maximum Bob" is considering former PTL executive Richard  Dortch's tearful plea to have his eight-year prison sentence reduced.  </P> <P> Dortch on Thursday asked U.S. District Judge Robert Potter to reduce his  sentence because of his cooperation with the government in the trial of his  former boss at the PTL television ministry, Jim Bakker.  </P> <P> "I'm very, very sorry," Dortch, 58, told the judge. "Once again, I ask to be  forgiven and for your mercy."  </P> <P> Potter, known for his stiff sentences, said: "I'm cognizant of the fact that  this is Rev. Dortch's last chance. I don't take it lightly, and I'm not going  to rule on it today." He said it could be up to two weeks before he reports a  decision.  </P> <P> Dortch was indicted in 1988 with Bakker on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy  for soliciting $158 million from PTL supporters in exchange for free lodging at  the ministry's Christian retreat near Charlotte.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> On Oct. 10, my teen-age daughter was watching an NBC movie titled "Desperado:  Outlaw Wars." I sat down for just about 10 minutes to see what it was like, and  I was appalled. In the scene I viewed, a man was shot in cold blood for no  reason other than to flaunt the killer's bravado. Then, after the victim was  down, the gunman emptied his gun into the body. Several other men, all armed,  stood around watching this and didn't do anything about it.  </P> <P> I fully understand that this was only a movie, and that Westerns always have  had "shoot-'em-up" scenes. But this wasn't like that. It seemed to be conveying  a powerful message to my daughter and other impressionable young people that  you can get away with murder if you're tough enough, thus glorifying the  killer.  </P> <P> Dennis F.

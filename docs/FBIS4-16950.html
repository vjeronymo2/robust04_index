			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--A number of substantive  amendments have been made to Russia's criminal code. They are  needed to unify criminal liability for encroachment on all kinds  of property, to enhance criminal liability for terrorism and  contraband, to guarantee citizens' rights to necessary defence  and more effective struggle against organised crime. Such is  the essence of the federal law on amendments and supplements to  the Russian criminal code and the Russian code of criminal  procedure passed by the State Duma in the second reading on  Wednesday.    A number of amendments have been made to the criminal code  in  connection with a radical change of the socio-political  situation in Russia over the recent years. Thus, wordings such  as "socialist property" are dropped from the criminal code.  References to crimes against "state and public property" are  eliminated. All forms of property become equal. For instance,  an encroachment on an enterprise of any kind, regardless of the  form of property, is qualified as banditry.    A new definition is given to such crimes as theft, robbery,  plunder, fraud. The criminal code is supplemented with an  article envisaging criminal liability for a failure to restore  to Russia objects of artistic, historic or architectural value  for Russian people if such a restoration is obligatory.  Articles are introduced that envisage criminal responsibility  for evading the payment of customs duties and for violating  customs legislation. Separate articles envisages criminal  liability for terrorism and for obstructing the discharge of  duties by a procurator, an investigator or persons conducting an  investigation.    During the debating of the draft law on Wednesday the  deputies extended from 10 to 12 years the maximum term of  imprisonment for a theft in a particularly large amount  committed by organised groups or by particularly dangerous  habitual criminals.    On an initiative of the faction of the Democratic Party of  Russia, the criminal code was supplemented with two articles  envisaging criminal liability for illegal transactions with  foreign currency and for concealment or failure to remit sums in  foreign currency.</p>

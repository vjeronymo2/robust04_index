			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Import-export curbs lifted INDIA'S export-import policy for the next five years, unveiled yesterday by Mr P. Chidambaram, the minister of commerce, specifies that trade will be free except for a few restricted items. The government's annual budget presented in February initiated many trade policy reforms, including partial convertibility of the rupee and reduction in tariffs. The export-import policy announced yesterday substantially eliminates licensing, quantitative restrictions and other regulatory and discretionary controls. Consumer goods imports will continue to be restricted, but import of capital goods and raw materials has been liberalised. The government monopoly over substantial imports has been reduced to eight items including crude oil, fertilisers, cooking oil and cereals.</p>

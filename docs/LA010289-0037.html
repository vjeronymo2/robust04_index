			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Members of a small Oakland church have bought a neighboring motel plagued with  prostitution and drug dealing and plan to reopen it as a low-cost apartment  house. The Rev. George Epps, pastor of the Greater Emmanuel Missionary Baptist  Church, said a nonprofit corporation formed by the church paid $550,000 for the  property with the help of a redevelopment loan from the city. "We saw this as a  great opportunity to try to get in there and make a change," Epps said. The  300-member congregation plans to first overhaul the motel's 22 units.  </P></p>

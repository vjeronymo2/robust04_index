			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpt] Fascists from nearby hills carried out  provocations against all the defense lines on the Gorazde  battlefield yesterday. They shelled the commune's outskirts  fiercely, and (Zasevi) and Brdarici in particular. UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] unit members are again acting without shame  as not a single gesture of theirs shows that they belong to  peace forces. Thus, in cooperation with the chetnik hordes,  they are trying to evacuate ethnic Serb citizens from the very  town center, but at the same time they are settling the 3-km  zone with people from Serbia and Montenegro. To what extent the  NATO ultimatum is being respected can be seen from the fact that  three people were wounded in the town and its suburbs yesterday.    A general catastrophe is reigning in Gorazde at the moment.  People have no food, no water, and no electricity. There are no  medicines or first-aid kits. A veritable chaos reigns here.    Chetniks are still positioned 200 m away from the town  center  and any movement by Gorazde citizens means certain death at the  hands of snipers. Two UNHCR convoys that arrived in Gorazde  recently can suffice for the people to survive one day at the  most. [passage omitted]</p>

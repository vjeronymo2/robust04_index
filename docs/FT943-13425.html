			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Swan Hunter set to close as Rosyth gains Pounds 40m order: Blow to north-east England after defence work goes to Scottish rival Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership for the past 14 months, looks certain to close after the Ministry of Defence yesterday awarded a contract to refit the Sir Bedivere landing ship to a Scottish rival, Rosyth Royal Dockyard. Rosyth bid about Pounds 40m for the contract, Pounds 10m less than Swan Hunter, which was fourth out of five bidders on price. The closure of Swan Hunter would mean the end of shipbuilding in north-east England, which once produced two of every five ships built in the world. The loss of Swan Hunter, which combined craft skills with high technology, would be a significant blow to employment and morale in an area already suffering from Britain's highest regional unemployment rate. French-based Soffia, owner of Cherbourg patrol boat builder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, was the only prospective buyer to emerge from a worldwide search by Swan Hunter's receiver Price Waterhouse. Soffia had stressed it would acquire the Tyneside yard only if it had a two-year workload, to sustain overheads while seeking more work. Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said last night it seemed nothing could prevent the closure. Soffia would reach a final conclusion today, he said, but he was not optimistic. With the outfitting of Swan Hunter's last vessel, the Type 23 frigate Richmond due for completion in November, any price CMN could offer was unlikely to be acceptable to the receiver, he said. 'There's just no market for a dead shipyard.' Mr Ed James, joint receiver, said unless CMN went ahead, Swan Hunter's sale as a going concern was unlikely. 'There are no other prospective purchasers waiting in the wings.' About 100 redundancies, of the technical and design staff retained for Sir Bedivere, seem imminent. The remaining 550 employees face redundancy after Richmond is completed. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, also announced that Swan Hunter had successfully tendered for the refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Olwen, a three-month Pounds 6m contract. The yard can take on this work only if it is no longer in receivership. The contract will otherwise go to the second lowest bidder. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary and MP for South Shields, where many Swan Hunter workers live, condemned this as a 'political fudge'. He said: 'The government has thrown Tyneside a minnow when it knows it needs a whale to survive.' Swan Hunter tendered for Olwen to provide work for 238 laid-off employees, hoping they would move on to Sir Bedivere. By an added irony, CMN, which spent months negotiating with the MoD over its acceptability as a UK defence contractor, heard yesterday it had received clearance to take over the contract for the completion of Richmond at Swans. Mr Aitken also announced that Devonport dockyard in Plymouth had won the refit of HMS Birmingham. Mr James insisted that Swan Hunter's Sir Bedivere bid was 'extremely competitive' but had to reflect overhead costs. The government's decision was condemned by union leaders as a missed opportunity to support foreign ownership of Swans. Time to play the very last song, Page 11</p>

"It is  unfortunate that we have been so subdued by apartheid that we  think we can do nothing that has not been done before. This is  slave mentality," said a statement from kwaZulu Deputy Minister  of Works Velaphi Ndolvu. "That no other king in the world has  promulgated the constitution of his kingdom, if this is true,  will not prevent the king of the Zulus from promulgating the  constitution," he said.    The monarch said on Monday he was preparing to promulgate a  constitution for a sovereign kwaZulu and Natal kingdom, but  declined to elaborate at a later media briefing.    Mr Ndlovu's remarks were in response to various African  National Congress statements on the king's demands. On  allegations the king was an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  mouthpiece, Mr Ndlovu said these were was based on the fact that  kwaZulu Chief Minister and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi  regularly accompanied the monarch at public functions. "The  people of South Africa must accept once and for all that Dr M B  Buthelezi is the traditional prime minister to the king and when  he appears with the king he does so as both prime minister and  chief minister and not as president of the IFP."    Mr Ndlovu further rejected charges that the king had  intervened in South Africa's constitutional impasse on behalf of  the Freedom Alliance. He said King Zwelithini had made a demand  for the return of his land and the recognition of the "kwaZulu  kingdom" as a sovereign state as far back as in July last year,  at his imbizo (traditional gathering) at the FNB Stadium outside  Johannesburg. The king's demand for the "reinstatement of the  kwaZulu kingdom emanated form the king himself and not from the  Freedom Alliance".    To allege the king was being used by the IFP was an insult,  said Mr Ndlovu. "It is the IFP which has supported his majesty  and not the other way around."    The king was genuinely concerned about all Zulus, no matter  what their political affiliation, and had never expressed  himself in favour of the IFP with regard to violence, Mr Ndlovu  added.</p>

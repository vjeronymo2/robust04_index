			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Problems still remain for the new government,  which must also deal with the rivalries impelling all the  parties to run independently at the forthcoming European  elections to be held on 12 June. Attilio Romita reports:    [Romita] All the parties have entered the fray of the  forthcoming European elections. Following March's electoral  earthquake, we have a new test which will weigh heavily on the  shoulders of the new political leadership. Partial local  elections will be held on the same day; 9 million voters  throughout Italy will have to elect a new regional council in  Sardinia, 11 provincial councils, and 485 town councils. The  local elections affect 92 cities with over 15,000 [as received]  inhabitants, and of those cities 21 are provincial capitals.    In the race for Strasbourg, all the parties are pitted  against each other. Due to the system of proportional  representation and the disappointments of March, the parties  will run independently at the European elections -- both on the  left and the right. The only alliance is that of the Italian  Socialist Party and the Democratic Alliance.    Silvio Berlusconi will head the Forza Italia list of  candidates. [passage omitted]    All the big guns will also be running in the election;  Umberto Bossi, Gianfranco Fini, Achille Occhetto, Fausto  Bertinotti, Mario Segni, Carlo Ripa di Meana, and Leoluca  Orlando. Giorgio la Malfa is considering whether to participate.    Finally, Francesco Moser, former world cycling champion, is  preparing to run for the Union Valdotaine.</p>

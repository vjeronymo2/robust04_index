			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: RANDY TRAVIS "NO HOLDIN' BACK." WARNER BROS. ** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC) STARS.  </P> <P> Travis is such a compelling country singer (rivaled only by John Anderson among  post-'77 arrivals) that his voice alone on an album should be enough for a  three-star recommendation. Dhe fact that this collection ends up with less  suggests something is amiss with the material.  </P> <P> Like Anderson, Travis sings in the dry 'n' drawl tradition of Lefty Frizzell  and Merle Haggard. Unfortunately, he too has to depend on other writers for  material because he is not a self-contained singer-songwriter like Haggard or  Frizzell.  </P> <P> Just as Anderson has had trouble in recent years finding songs that match the  sentimentality and irony of country music as well as such early '80s hits as  "She Just Started Liking Cheatin' Songs," Travis is having difficulty finding  more tunes like "On the Other Hand" and "Forever and Ever, Amen."  </P> <P> There are a few worthy moments this time, including the playfulness of "Card  Carryin' Fool" and the romantic innocence of "No Stoppin' Us Now." But too many  songs suffer from clumsy or listless imagery ("When Your World Was Turning for  Me," "Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart"). A great voice is only half the equation  in country music.

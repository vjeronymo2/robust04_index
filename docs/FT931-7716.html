			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / The dangers that lurk in delay: Late payments are behind a growing number of corporate casualties in Europe Baroness Denton of Wakefield, the UK minister for small businesses, has some handy hints for companies at their wits' end over the late payment of bills. They include nocturnal telephone calls to the offending company's chairman and sending scruffy teenagers to squat in reception. The minister may be half-joking, but the problem of late payment, now enveloping companies of every type and size, is no laughing matter. She says: 'There are real, moral issues here which must be addressed if we are to stop companies from needlessly going bust.' It is already too late for Mr Harry Aitchison, whose Manchester-based carpentry business has just joined the 20 UK companies expiring daily. 'My customers killed me,' he says 'The bank pulled the plug for Pounds 22,000 when I had Pounds 60,000 overdue.' A time lag in paying suppliers provides a legitimate form of inter-company credit, and gives customers the chance to check the quality of goods and services. But when the practice is abused, suppliers' cash positions deteriorate and interest charges and production costs escalate. Creditor companies then delay paying their own debts to avoid more costly sources of finance. Recession-hit companies now speak of a crisis within a business community unable or unwilling to break free from a vicious circle of overdue debt. The disease, however, is not peculiarly British. The European Commission has just launched an investigation into late payment, which is 'spreading contagiously' throughout the Community. Some member states are so alarmed they are considering using competition law to impose financial penalties on offending companies. The Association of British Factors and Discounters, whose members provide cash against unpaid invoices, warns that hopes for higher UK sales in Europe following last September's sterling devaluation are threatened because spreading recession is lengthening payment delays. It claims the time taken for European companies to pay increased on average by a third in 1992. Even in Germany, where payment practices are held to be exemplary, payment periods have stretched from 30 to 50 days. In the UK, a survey this month from Trade Indemnity, the credit insurer, underlines the problem. It shows that, in December, only 3 per cent of nearly 600 companies contacted were being paid on time. Businesses report they are having to wait, on average, nearly one month beyond the agreed date of payment - itself often 30 days after delivery. The average value of debt per company at least 30 days outstanding was more than Pounds 120,000, with engineering, construction, steel and paper sectors suffering most from large, overdue debt. The government and the private sector are promoting a number of voluntary initiatives to try to combat the damaging drift of indebtedness. But there are doubts about their effectiveness. Only one piece of legislation is planned so far. By the end of 1993, large companies are likely to be required to state in notes to their accounts the average time taken to pay their bills. In a consultative document, published last month, the Department of Trade and Industry defines 'large' as any company which satisfies at least two of the following conditions: a turnover of more than Pounds 11.2m, a balance sheet total exceeding Pounds 3.9m, or more than 250 employees. Critics say the measure has no teeth - the only penalty for poor performance will be the wrath of suppliers - and that companies will be able to manipulate their record by behaving impeccably while they monitor their payment performance. Mr Martin Simons, former head of competitor analysis at Imperial Chemical Industries, says the proposals are open to abuse and wants an industry-wide, standard payment term of about 35 days following the date of invoice. 'Funds would flow more steadily and there would be more effective credit control. Debt would be half the level experienced under the present, archaic free-for-all. 'It would eliminate the common practice of ordering a small consignment at the end of a month, which attracts agreed credit of 20 or 30 days, followed by placing a bigger order at the start of the next month, attracting up to 60 days' credit,' Mr Simons adds. Ministers accept that the public sector must lead by example: all government departments claim they insist their main contractors ordinarily pay their own suppliers within 30 days. However, the Property Services Agency, which manages the government's property estate, has just admitted making contractors wait months for payment, until it has been paid by other government departments. The Confederation of British Industry, which has said that late payment threatens the survival of one in five companies, has a 'prompt payers' code. It calls for a 'clear, consistent' payment policy and a system of dealing quickly with complaints. Only 400 businesses from its 25,000-strong membership have so far signed up, but they include some of Britain's largest companies, such as Esso, Boots, British Airways and Glaxo. Dr Ian Peters, a CBI deputy director, says: 'It's a question of business culture. No one wants to pay up until they are forced to. 'If there is any hope of winning the battle, the big companies have to show the way. Some of them have terrible payment records and exploit a smaller supplier's reluctance to cause a fuss.' Mr David Frost, chief executive of Walsall Chamber of Commerce, which is running an experimental, government-funded hotline for company debt problems, agrees: 'The biggest fear is upsetting customers. If you push too hard, they will think you are going broke or tell you to get lost because other companies are hungry for work.' Beyond the present initiatives, a majority of small and medium-sized businesses now appears to support the introduction of a legal right to interest on outstanding debts - in force in all EC member states except the UK and Ireland. Ministers concede there are powerful arguments for a statutory right of interest, but stress companies must be free to agree the contract terms. They do not exclude more legislation to enforce better behaviour. Some British companies already include in contracts interest penalties for late payment, but few take the uncertain path of seeking compensation through the courts. Nor is there much evidence from Europe that a right to interest means prompt payment. The Commission acknowledges that penalties are rarely demanded or paid, while debt recovery in most European countries still invariably entails court proceedings. Mr Tim Devlin, Conservative MP for Stockton South, is more enthusiastic: 'The mere threat of punitive interest penalties would make many companies pay up and help bring about the culture change we desperately need.' Though less convinced about the role of legislation, organisations such as the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses agree that streamlined court procedures for debt recovery must accompany any moves to improve corporate payment behaviour. The government has pledged to speed up and simplify cumbersome and costly commercial debt recovery procedures, though business is sceptical it will achieve real improvements. The Lord Chancellor has already rejected a CBI plan for an independent debt tribunal which would hear disputed payment cases. But companies are also accused of not helping themselves. According to Ms Barbara Bennett, a spokeswoman for Trade Indemnity: 'The root of the problem is that credit control is regarded as a Cinderella activity, handed down to someone with low status on poor pay. Business must get to grips with credit management if things are to improve.' Up to a third of companies do not even have written payment terms. Mr Allen Page, a director of Marlborough Management, a Buckinghamshire-based business consultancy, says too many businesses are sales-driven and ignore vital financial disciplines. 'You can add legislation on late payment for ever and a day, with little effect. Companies have to end their damaging ambiguities on credit policy, sharpen up control procedures and get tougher.' Mr Page makes another point: 'A lot of companies don't get paid on time because they have provided a shoddy, unsatisfactory service. 'Too often, holding back payment is the only weapon available. Whatever the motive, it is a ruinous, cat-and-mouse game which no one can win.'  --------------------------------------------------- WHEN LATE IS AS BAD AS NEVER  --------------------------------------------------- Country          Normal payment     Actual repayment                   terms (days)           period  --------------------------------------------------- Belgium              30-60                 78 Denmark              30-45                 60 France               60-90                115 Great Britain           30                 80 Germany                 30                 50 Italy                60-90                 95 Netherlands             30                 45 Norway               15-30                 52 Spain                60-90                105 Sweden                  30                 55 Switzerland             30                 60  --------------------------------------------------- Source: Association of British Factors &amp; Discounters  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

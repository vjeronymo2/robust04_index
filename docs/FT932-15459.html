			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / UK Company News: Marlboro move leaves BAT gasping for breath  -The US cigarette price war THE DECISION by Philip Morris to raise the stakes in the US cigarette price war by cutting the price of Marlboro, its leading brand, has wreaked costly damage to the shares of BAT Industries. Investors' concerns about the possible impact on BAT's US tobacco profits - about Pounds 380m of a worldwide total of Pounds 1.34bn last year - have sent the share price of the UK-based multinational tumbling from 999p to 887p, wiping some Pounds 1.66bn off its market capitalisation. Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, professes to be more perplexed than worried by Philip Morris's tactics. 'We find it difficult to see what it hopes to achieve,' he says. He compares Philip Morris's move to that of 'a poker player holding a full house who calls a misdeal in the hope of getting a better hand.' BAT, he says, will wait to see what happens in the market before playing its own cards. 'We may be one of those who started the price war, but we have no wish to escalate it,' he adds. 'But we shall be ready to respond tactically where necessary.' Brown &amp; Williamson, its US subsidiary, claims 20 per cent of the discount sector which has been eating into Marlboro's market share. Almost non-existent 10 years ago, discount cigarettes now account for 36 per cent of the total market. Brown &amp; Williamson's GPC Approved is the fastest-growing brand in the sector. From an overall market share of 1.2 per cent in 1990 it has risen to become the seventh best-selling cigarette in the US with 4.2 per cent of the market. Even if the price of a pack of Marlboro is cut by the expected 40 cents, it would still cost 50 cents a pack more than GPC Approved, says Mr Broughton. That narrowing of the price differential might temporarily stem the decline in Marlboro's market share, Mr Broughton concedes - but it would carry substantial risks. 'Philip Morris does not intend to reposition the Marlboro brand at a permanently lower price level. 'All the evidence - including our own experience and Philip Morris's test marketing in Portland - suggests that though discounts will raise a brand's sales, they fall back when the price is increased again, and usually end up lower than they were in the first place.' Nor could it be in Philip Morris's interest to extend the discount sector, in which its 12 own-label and other brands already vie for market leadership with RJ Reynolds's 19 products. 'To do so would threaten sales of the group's much more profitable full-priced brands such as Benson &amp; Hedges and Merit,' Mr Broughton argues. BAT's main full price brands - Kool menthol and Capri superslims - occupied market niches which, though highly competitive, had proved resistant to discounting, he says. Cut-price cowboy, Page 14</p>

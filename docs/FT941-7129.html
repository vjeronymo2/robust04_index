			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / West tries to maintain momentum for peace World leaders expressed shock and condemnation of the Hebron slaughter yesterday and urged that the atrocity should not be allowed to derail efforts to negotiate a peace agreement. President Bill Clinton warned that the massacre would complicate the difficult work of peace. 'It's horrible and I condemn it. It's a terrible human tragedy and it only complicates the difficult work of peace,' he said at the White House. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, spoke of his horror at the killing, and said it 'underscores the imperative of accelerating the negotiations' towards implementation of the declaration of principles signed between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation last year. He called for calm to prevent the 'enemies of peace' from exploiting yesterday's tragedy. Mr Christopher also telephoned Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, to urge 'calm, reason and restraint'. Similar sentiments came from other capitals, with the French foreign ministry condemning the 'hateful crime' and also urging 'restraint' from all parties. In neighbouring Jordan the atmosphere was tense. An elderly British tourist, Mr Howard Long, of Purley in Surrey, was stabbed in Amman hours after the massacre but not seriously wounded. Westerners have been advised not to stray away from the main tourist areas. The US warned Americans travelling in Israel to stay out of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. The State Department also cautioned Americans to exercise caution when travelling throughout the Middle East and Europe. Angry Palestinian officials, however, said the slaughter in Hebron would 'psychologically and practically' affect peace negotiations due to resume in Cairo early next week. Mr Said Kemal, head of the PLO mission in Cairo, said Mr Arafat had called an an emergency meeting of the executive committee of the PLO central council in Tunis to discuss the future of the negotiations. However, Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the detailed talks on Israeli withdrawal, said yesterday 'we are not contemplating interrupting the peace talks'. He added: 'We don't know about the schedule, but the peace talks will go on.' Describing the killings in Hebron a 'major catastrophe', he said that it 'clearly demonstrated that these settlers are, will be and always have been the major problem to a solution on the ground'. Mr Shaath said it was imperative the Israelis take concrete steps to assure the protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories. 'They have spent 75 per cent of the time in these talks discussing their security without considering that of our people,' he said. Longstanding Palestinian opponents of the Oslo agreement were quick to claim that the killings showed that the PLO-Israeli deal was unworkable. 'It shows that peace with the Zionists is impossible,' said a statement from Hamas, the militant Islamic Palestinian group which also vowed to avenge the killings and 'punish' Israeli troops and settlers. Other 'rejectionist' Palestinian groups, including the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, both based in Damascus, also vowed vengeance.</p>

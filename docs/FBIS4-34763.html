			<p>BFN     [Text] In Havana, Bert Denker, general manager of the ING  International Bank in the Netherlands, said the ING Bank chose  Cuba for its economic activities because it is a country that  has potential and an appropriate infrastructure for development.  He said 80 percent of trade with the island consists of basic  products, and he believes emphasis should be placed on  investments in areas that generate capital for the country, such  as exports. He also believes emphasis should be placed on  production in areas that can substitute for imported products.    The general manager of the ING Bank in the Netherlands  listed  some of Cuba's assets as: an educational system that guarantees  a highly skilled work force; huge nickel reserves that can be  exploited efficiently and at low cost; and an excellent  reputation in tourist development.    Denker is attending the second round table conference with  the Cuban Government organized by THE ECONOMIST financial  magazine. The conference, which is being held in Havana, is  scheduled to last two days.</p>

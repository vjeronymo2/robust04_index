			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Arabs in Tripoli for talks with Gadaffi EGYPTIAN presidential adviser Osama Baz and Tunisian foreign minister Habib Ben Yahya arrived in Tripoli unexpectedly yesterday to join diplomatic efforts to resolve Libya's row with the west, Reuter reports from Tripoli. Mr Baz was to meet Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi, accompanied by Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, an adviser to Col Gadaffi and Tripoli's co-ordinator on relations with Egypt. Mr Yahya was also expected to have talks with Libyan officials. Egypt and Tunisia have been trying to resolve Libya's dispute with the US, Britain and France over the bombing of two airliners, and head off UN sanctions. The UN Security Council wants Libya to hand over two alleged Libyan intelligence agents accused of bombing a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988 and to give investigators access to four Libyans wanted for questioning in connection with a French UTA aircraft which blew up over Niger the following year.</p>

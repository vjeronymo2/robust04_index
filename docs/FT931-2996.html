			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Plan to curb borrowing THE chancellor announced a package of immediate and future tax increases in an attempt to avoid 'excessive government borrowing over the medium-term' from preventing 'a sustained economic recovery'. The package is broadly neutral this year but will boost government revenues by Pounds 6.7bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96. Pages 20, 25, 36 VAT extended: Extension of the VAT base limited to domestic fuel and power. From April 1994 it will be levied at 8 per cent, rising to 17.5 per cent in April 1995. Pages 20, 22, 38 National insurance to rise: The main rate for employees and the self-employed will rise by 1 per cent next year, but there will be no change in employers' contributions. Pages 20, 22, 36, 38 Driving penalised: Road fuels duties will rise by 10 per cent this year to pay for the abolition of car tax last autumn. This adds 2.7p to a litre of unleaded and 3.3p to a litre of leaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty will rise by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125. The discount on high business mileage will be abolished and, from next year, company cars will be taxed according to their list price rather than engine size. Pages 26, 38 Income tax: No change in the basic rate and no increase in the top rate of tax but the 20 per cent tax band will be widened by Pounds 500 to the first Pounds 2,500 from April 1 this year. It will widen to the first Pounds 3,000 in 1994. Personal allowances, the married couples' allowance and the inheritance tax threshold of Pounds 150,000 were frozen. Pages 20, 22, 27, 38 PSBR here to stay ..: The PSBR this fiscal year will be Pounds 35.1bn, Pounds 1.9bn lower than the Autumn Statement forecast. But general government expenditures of 44 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 mean a PSBR of Pounds 50.1bn, 8 per cent of GDP, and Pounds 55.6bn excluding privatisation receipts.   .but maybe not for ever: The government's objective remains 'to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term'. But government projections expect a PSBR of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 by which time net public debt will have almost doubled since 1990 to 50 per cent of GDP. Pages 21, 25, 36 Full-funding rule modified: No news on interest rates, but the government relaxed its funding policy. Sales of gilts to bank and building societies will now be counted as a non-inflationary funding source. The government has increased its upper limit for broad money growth next year in part to accommodate the boost to M4 that relaxing its full-fund rule should allow. The target for M4 in 1993-94 is widened from the 4-8 per cent range, to a 3-9 per cent range. Pages 21, 25, 36 Excise duties rise: The chancellor left the duty on spirits unchanged; other alcohol duties rose by 5 per cent. This added 1 1/2 p to a pint of beer and 5 1/2 p to a bottle of wine. A 6.5 per cent increase in tobacco duty added 10p to a packet of 20 cigarettes. Pages 22, 26, 39 Housing: The stamp duty threshold for houses, land and property was doubled to Pounds 60,000. But tax relief on mortgage interest will be limited to 20 per cent from April next year. Page 38 Small businesses: Business rates will not increase in real terms this year and the threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT will rise from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600. There will be relief on capital gains tax where entrepreneurs reinvest the gains from the sale of shares in their own business in new unquoted trading companies. Premiums on the loan guarantee scheme will be reduced and traders will also be able to claim VAT relief on bad debts after six months. VAT penalties imposed for late returns and misdeclarations will be eased. Pages 20, 26 Industry: The rate of advanced corporation tax will be reduced to 22.5 per cent for this financial year and to 20 per cent from April 1994. The chancellor also announced improvements to export credits. Pages 20, 22, 25, 37 Long-term unemployed: A new vocational education programme will finance 30,000 unemployed people to take full-time courses. Expansion of business start-up schemes will provide an extra 10,000 places for people wishing to start their own businesses. Pages 27, 36 Infrastructure: The channel tunnel rail link will proceed as a joint venture between the government and the private sector and the Heathrow Express will go ahead. Tax burden increasesThe net result of the changes increases tax revenues by a modest 0.1 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 36 1/2 per cent of GDP. But the delayed effects of the changes mean the measures add 1.7 per cent of GDP in tax rises by 1997-98, by which time revenues will have risen to 39 1/4 per cent of GDP. Pages 22, 34 'Budget for sustained growth': The chancellor said the economy 'enters the year in a more favourable position than most of our main competitors' having 'won' the inflation battle.

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Letter: UK industry's use of languages Sir, I sympathise with Mr James Calvert's cri de coeur about languages in British industry (Letters, January 15). As a languages graduate I spent 28 years working as an export and overseas manager for three major British companies. In two cases I was succeeded by someone who had no foreign languages and in the third case my successor spoke no relevant language (in all other respects he was, and is, an excellent person). I would never have got off the ground in industry had my first managing director not kindly sent me to a technical college to learn chemistry (of which I had done none at school or university). My advice to young people contemplating a career in British industry is to study formally a technical subject or accountancy, and then learn languages on the job, preferably abroad. Few British companies are really interested in exports, and you will invariably be paid less than your UK counterparts. Richard Baker, 10 Glentham Road, Barnes, London SW13 9JB</p>

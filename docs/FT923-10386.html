			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow remains strong on fall in bond yields Wall Street SHARP rally in US equities continued yesterday after their summer torpor as the drop in long-term bond yields at home and stronger overseas markets boosted sentiment, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The bond yields showed a further fall early in the session, but finished little changed on the day. This did not discourage the stock market, however, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 45.12 higher at 3,379.19 for a two-day surge of 97 points. New York SE turnover reached a heavy 276m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved ahead 4.71 to 422.23, breaching its previous record high of 420.77 set on January 15, while the Nasdaq composite added 5.86 at 577.49. The month is threatening to give investors whiplash. The Dow entered July on a strong note by climbing 35.58 to 3,354.10 on July 1, but by July 22 the index had retreated to 3,277.61 and it held at depressed levels before the latest buying frenzy started to drive prices forward. This week's rally has been fed by tumbling long-term interest rates, which has triggered a flow of funds into equities. In addition, the drop in interest rates should stimulate activity in the housing market in the coming months. Eastman Kodak climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 43 5/8 after a delayed opening. The photographic equipment manufacturer posted better than expected second quarter earnings of Dollars 1.11 a share after Tuesday's close. Car issues were actively traded for a second day following Chrysler's unexpectedly strong second quarter earnings. Chrysler headed towards a 52-week high in morning trading but ended the day Dollars  1/4 down at Dollars 21 1/2 after adding Dollars 1 5/8 on Tuesday. The company posted net income of Dollars 178m for the quarter against a loss of Dollars 212m a year earlier. Results were less rosy at Ford, which unveiled second quarter net earnings of Dollars 502.4m, or 93 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 323.5m, or 68 cents, a year ago. The earnings were below expectations of about 99 cents a share, but analysts noted that a higher than expected tax charge cut into Ford's profits. Its shares slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 . Bristol-Myers Squibb climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 69 on news that the big pharmaceuticals company plans to sell its Drackett household products business, which makes Drano and Windex. In addition, an analyst at Brown Brothers reinstated a 'buy' rating on the stock. Wang Laboratories fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 1 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange following press reports that the embattled computer company might violate some debt covenants when it reports its results for the fourth quarter ended June 30. Canada TORONTO was inclined to move higher in response to gains on most other world markets, but the rise was limited by weakness in the gold and transportation sectors. The TSE 300 index put on 13.1 to 3,424.6 as rises led declines by 275 to 244. Volume came to 31.2m shares. PWA fell for the second day, losing CDollars 1.87 to CDollars 2.08, after touching CDollars 1.55, in volume of 2.8m shares on nervousness about its merger talks with Air Canada, off 18 cents at CDollars 4.95.</p>

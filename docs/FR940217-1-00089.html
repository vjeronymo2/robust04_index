			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, for purposes of this part, the Secretary proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to specify that with regard to the conduct of an officer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee of a third-party servicer or a person, entity, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer or employee of an entity with which the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts, that conduct would be a factor in determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's financial responsibility only if the individual or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity is used in a capacity that involves administering any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspect of the Title IV, HEA programs. For example, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not hold the conduct of a custodian employed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer as an element in determining the servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility, if that custodian had no responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for administering a Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes to specify that a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer would not be considered to be financially responsible if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer, or any principal or affiliate of the servicer (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those terms are defined in 34 CFR part 85), is debarred or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended under E.O. 12549 or the FAR, or is engaging in activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is cause under 34 CFR 85.305 or 85.405 for debarment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension under E.O. 12549 or the FAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like the proposed changes governing the past performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals or organizations associated with institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the Title IV, HEA programs and standard of conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of participating institutions and third-party servicers, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes are needed to establish appropriate safeguards to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the integrity of the FFEL programs and the Federal financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest if serious questions are raised about the honest and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lawful conduct of a servicer's owners, officers, directors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, or affiliates whose duties involve the administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of or influence over the use of those funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this section, a third-party servicer would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have an annual independent audit of its administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL programs that examines the servicer's compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act and applicable regulations and its financial management of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL program activities. These requirements and audit exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would parallel the proposed audit requirements and exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 34 CFR 668.23 (governing audit requirements for third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers contracting with institutions to administer any aspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs), except that the report of the audit would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the Secretary within six months of the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit report period. A third-party servicer's initial audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to cover the same period required of audits performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for third-party servicers contracting with institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer any aspect of the institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs (discussed previously in 34 CFR 668.23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that initial audits will be more useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and effective if they encompass an entire fiscal year. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary also believes that allowing servicers additional time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prepare for the implementation of these regulations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable servicers to comply more fully with these regulations as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as defray the costs associated with an audit of a partial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal year and minimize the burden associated with implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations, as called for under E.O. 12866. Subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits would, as required by statute, encompass the entire period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the servicer's previous audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Secretary proposes that the audit report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be conducted in accordance with the audit guide developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Inspector General of the Department of Education unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the third-party servicer is a governmental entity or nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization. A third-party servicer that is a governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity would be required to have an audit conducted in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with 31 U.S.C. 7502 and 34 CFR part 80, appendix G (pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Single Audit Act). A third-party servicer that is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit organization would be required to have an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Circular A&hyph;133, ``Audit of Institutions of Higher Education and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Nonprofit Institutions,'' as incorporated in 34 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 74.61(h)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed rules would also limit a lender's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter into a contract with a third-party servicer. As explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously in the discussion for &sect;682.200, under this proposal, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender may not enter into a contract with a third-party servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Secretary has determined does not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability or financial responsibility standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this section. Further, a lender that contracts with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer would have to provide the Secretary with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name and address of the third-party servicer, and, upon request,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a copy of that contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sections 682.700&blank;Purpose and scope, 682.701&blank;Definitions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms used in this subpart, 682.702&blank;Effect on participation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 682.703&blank;Informal compliance procedure, 682.704&blank;Emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action, 682.705&blank;Suspension proceedings, 682.706&blank;Limitation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination proceedings, 682.707&blank;Appeals in a limitation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination proceeding, 682.708&blank;Evidence of mailing and receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates, 682.709&blank;Reimbursements, refunds, and offsets, 682.710&blank;Removal of limitation, and 682.711&blank;Reinstatement after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to amend subpart G to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the Secretary would have the authority to limit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspend, or terminate a third-party servicer's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract with an eligible lender if the Secretary determines the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer has violated any FFEL program requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 432(a)(1) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action against third-party servicers for any violation of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FFEL program requirement. Under these proposed regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary could also take emergency action against the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the Secretary receives reliable information that the servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in violation of applicable requirements pertaining to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender's portfolio of loans. The procedures under which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary could take those actions and the procedures a third-party servicer could use to appeal those actions are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the long-standing procedures the Secretary uses to take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those actions against a lender, and the procedures a lender may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use to appeal those actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader </F> Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Marianne Sajdik; place and date not  given: "They Can Eat Their Dumplings in the Dark"]    [Text] [Sajdik] How would you describe the current  situation in Russia?    [Zhirinovskiy] I can see the situation in Russia only in a  positive light: Ahead of us are the end of the crisis and the  renaissance of Russia. The reformers have declared their  bankruptcy, which is unpleasant for the West. Our policy is  based on the equality of all forms of ownership, state or  private. We would change the tax system in favor of the  producers. We will end state and criminal blackmailing. We  will reconstruct economic relations with the regions and end the  war in the south. Conversion will be stopped. The plants that  now have to produce canteens for 2,000 rubles apiece, which  nobody needs, instead of submarines will go back to producing  submarines. Western aid is nothing but provocation and  hypocrisy. Foreigners are only a nuisance and not helpful. We  will chase them away. Foreign politicians are honest in the way  they treat us. They all hate Russia. We will help ourselves.    [Sajdik] How are your relations with the Russian president?    [Zhirinovskiy] My relations with Yeltsin are good. Now and  then we meet for a game of checkers or play volleyball. He is a  good man, I like him. He is calm and quiet. I do not mind him  at all. He was deceived by radical reformer Yegor Gaydar and  his people. He thought that their plans were good -- but  everything failed. Now he is trying to neutralize the  consequences of the activities of Gaydar and reformer Gennadiy  Burbulis.    They are to blame for the destruction of the USSR and the  creation of the CIS. Yeltsin is now embarrassed that he  believed them. If I were him, I would have chased all of them  out of the country or thrown them into prison. Yet, Yeltsin is  a good man. However, I will not leave them alone but call them  to account. They are afraid of me, which is why they call me  "fascist" all the time.    [Sajdik] What are your plans for the future?    [Zhirinovskiy] I want to become president. The  parliamentary group does not offer any possibility to implement  my program. As president the constitution gives me maximum  powers and I can fulfill my promises. Yeltsin will not run  again, and the people that have so far forced themselves to the  foreground -- Sobchak, Volskiy, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, and Travkin  received less than 10 percent in the election. So I cannot see  any opponent.    [Sajdik] What is your program?    [Zhirinovskiy] I will concentrate on improving the living  conditions of the Russians without getting rich myself. The  others did nothing but steal: money was transferred to Western  banks, children sent to school abroad, villas and limousines,  everything achieved through fraud. Now they are leaving the  sinking ship like rats. They cannot pay the price that I am  asking -- the new Russia.    [Sajdik] What will your new Russia look like?    [Zhirinovskiy] Ukraine will always be a part of Russia, in  the same way in which the Crimea is Russian. I would not stop  western Ukraine from seceding and becoming a small republic.  Then they can eat their dumplings in Lvov but (gets up and  turns out the light) in the dark because they will not get any  more electricity. That will then be the end of Ukrainian  nationalism. Yet, we will not take them back; the Germans or  Swedes can feed them through. (turns on the light again)    [Sajdik] What does democracy mean for you?    [Zhirinovskiy] Democracy means that the majority makes a  decision but not without taking the interests of the minority  into account. We Russians take the decision to make the former  borders of the USSR the borders of Russia yet we do not ignore  the minority. The Estonians do not want that, which means that  the Estonians will live in Tallinn -- in a mini-republic like  Monaco or Andorra -- but without Russian raw materials, light,  energy, and cars.    [Sajdik] You do not have a good press. Do you mind?    [Zhirinovskiy] Nobody writes the truth about me. If you  dare, write that Zhirinovskiy is a good, highly educated man,  who got his diploma with distinction, knows four foreign  languages, does not drink and does not smoke. Yet this is not  what you are paid for. One has to write the opposite:  Zhirinovskiy is a bad man, an anti-Semite, and a fascist.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments have been modified to respond to these comments. The phrase ``pertinent'' has been deleted from the reference to operating information and the word ``data'' is used to emphasize the intended quantitative nature of the information. Operating data is included as a subset of annual financial information, and the operating data to be provided annually also is determined by reference to the type of operating data presented in the final official statement. Thus, the parties will determine at the outset, presumably with the assistance of applicable industry guidelines, what operating data will be provided both initially and on an ongoing basis. For example, in a conduit health care financing, under current industry practice, an official statement typically provides information relating to the obligated party_the hospital_in an appendix. In addition to a discussion describing the hospital, its administration and management, economic base and service area, and capital plan, operating statistics such as bed utilization, admissions and type, patient days, and payor utilization often is provided. Under the amendments, in this type of transaction, parties at the outset of a transaction will determine which operating data will be included in the hospital appendix; such information, in turn, will be the type of ``operating data'' to be provided annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters expressed concern that the Proposed Amendments were not sufficiently flexible to permit parties to address changing conditions because the undertaking would have to describe the financial and pertinent operating information to be provided in the future. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 113 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Nonetheless, the requirement that the undertaking specify in reasonable detail the type of data that will be provided on an ongoing basis, including the identity of the persons (or category of persons) about which the information will relate has been retained. As is the case with financial information, the intent of the amendments is to give investors and market participants the ability to evaluate the security through comparisons of the quantitative operating data provided. Contrary to the suggestion of some commenters, the undertaking would be meaningless if issuers and obligated persons could unilaterally determine that certain types of information were no longer necessary or meaningful to investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 113 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Chapman and Cutler; Joint Response; Letter of Kutak Rock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the amendments require that the undertaking specify only the general type of information to be supplied, there should be sufficient flexibility to accommodate subsequent developments that may require adjustments in the financial information and operating data that should be provided annually. Of course, nothing in the undertaking will prevent a party from providing additional information, particularly where such disclosure may be necessary to avoid liability under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Similarly, the amendments make specific provision for adjusting the persons about which information is provided. As required in the case of pooled financings, parties may identify the persons covered by reference to objective selection criteria that will be applied on a consistent basis between the offering statements and with regard to annual financial information. Moreover, the party providing the undertaking need not continue to provide information concerning persons that are no longer obligated persons with respect to the municipal securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new provision has been added to the amendments which permits the written agreement or contract to have a termination provision with respect to any obligated person that is no longer directly or indirectly liable for repayment of any of the obligations on the municipal securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 114 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Once an obligated person no longer has any liability for repayment of the municipal securities, whether through termination or expiration of its commitment to support payment, or as a result of a defeasance of the municipal securities with no remaining liability, then the obligation to provide annual financial information and notices of events may terminate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 114 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Notice of Material Events  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters generally agreed that issuers and obligors should be subject to an undertaking to provide event information to the market. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 115 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers supported these provisions of the Proposed Amendments, because the use of a list provides guidance as to what events should be covered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 116 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other commenters, however, felt that the list should be deleted from the rule and that the concept of materiality should be relied upon to determine what events should be the subject of notices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 117 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters believed that the list of eleven events should be expanded to include a provision that would cover any other event that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the holders of the bonds. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 118 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 115 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of the Proposed Amendments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of A.G.

Under the amendments, only the occurrence of one of the specified events will, if material, create an obligation to send a notice to the repository.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 119 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The introduction to the list also has been clarified to indicate that the events relate specifically to the securities being offered.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The determination of whether other events also should be the subject of notification pursuant to the information undertaking is left to the parties. For example, some commenters requested that the list of events be expanded to address circumstances when the notified events have been cured or rectified, as well as other favorable developments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 120 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The parties would be free to add such matters to the undertaking. Issuers also may wish to send information regarding material developments to the repositories, to ensure equal access to that information by all investors and participants in the market, regardless of whether the particular development is subject to the undertaking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 121 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 120 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of NAST; Letter of the Treasurer of State of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 121 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters have expressed concern that statements by various elected officials made in a political context relating to an issuer must now be included in information provided to a repository. The amendments contain no such requirement. Moreover, these concerns appear to be based upon a misunderstanding of the reminder to issuers in the Interpretive Release that investors may rely on a variety of formal and informal sources for continuing information on municipal issuers, including public statements and press releases concerning an entity's fiscal affairs made by municipal officials, particularly in the absence of a more standardized mechanism for disseminating information about the municipal issuer to the market as a whole. The caution contained in the Interpretive Release that the antifraud provisions may apply to releases of information to the public reasonably expected to reach investors and the trading market does not mean, as some commenters inferred, that such statements are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> per se  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> material; nor do the amendments require that such statements, even where material, be provided to the repositories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

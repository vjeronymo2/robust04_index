			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Short sterling steady INDICATIONS from the UK government that it is unlikely to sanction a cut in interest rates soon helped to brake an early rise in short sterling, writes Peter John. That rise was sparked by a larger than anticipated fall in the headline inflation rate. This fell last month to 3 per cent from 3.6 per cent in October, suggesting that there might be room for manoeuvre on base rates. However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the head of the Bundesbank was once again stressing his commitment to current German interest rates and the UK chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, was said to be seeking to lower hopes of a fresh base rate cut. Consequently, a rally by March short sterling from the 93.38 opening level to 93.53 was cut back and the contract closed only 8 higher at 93.46. The Bank of England operations continued to be hampered by unwillingness by the clearing banks to take up the January 5 repo which would leave them with an unwanted amount of cash over the Christmas and New Year period. The clearers found better value in overnight money which was pushed up to about 8 per cent before easing towards the close as the central bank shortage was taken out. The unwillingness to carry money over was compounded by the continuing trend to close up positions ahead of the Christmas break. One dealer said; 'The will just isn't there at the moment.' The Bank of England offered an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.65bn, later revised to Pounds 1.6bn. The Bank provided Pounds 465m of early assistance, buying band and band two bank bills, both at the established 6 7/8 per cent rate. It also purchased Pounds 400m of bills for resale on January 11 at 6 15/16 per cent. The Bank provided a further Pounds 155m in the morning, buying band one bank bills at the 6 7/8 per cent rate. In the afternoon, the Bank provided Pounds 544m bringing help to Pounds 1.164bn. It bought Pounds 367m of band one bank bills and Pounds 177m of band two bank bills, both at the established 6 7/8 per cent rate. Despite Pounds 240m of late, unspecified assistance, Pounds 196m of the liquidity shortage was not taken out and dealers expected short money rates to continue their tight trend next week.</p>

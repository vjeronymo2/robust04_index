			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Lu Yu-sun, Li Hua, and Cai </F> Cun of the Lanzhou Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of  Space Technology, 730000; MS received 24 Nov 92]    [Text] Measured results of the electric and optical  performance of ITO, IO and TO films are given. These films are  prepared on substrates of flexible Kapton, Mylar and FEP Teflon  by magnetron sputtering. Tests indicate that their stabilities  under various conditions are quite good. The conductivity of the  antistatic films in the simulated substorm environment is also  measured. The results show that the modified flexible SSM can  eliminate the charge accumulation on their surfaces and control  the surface voltage below 80 Volts. On the contrary, the  potential on the uncoated SSM surface can have a value up to  8-10 kV.</p>

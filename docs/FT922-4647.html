			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Small businesses see threat SMALL business groups around Europe are concerned that the European Commission's enterprise directorate is to be abolished or merged into the industry directorate with the loss of an independent voice for small companies, Charles Batchelor reports. European MPs and representatives of small business organisations throughout Europe will argue the case for a continued strong voice for small business in meetings with ministers in Portugal - present chairman of the European Commission - tomorrow. The European Committee for Small and Medium-sized Independent Companies (Europmi) has written an open letter to Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, seeking assurance that the enterprise directorate (DG 23) will not be abolished.</p>

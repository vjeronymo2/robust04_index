			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Don Carlos - Opera In Tim Albery's new Don Carlos production for Opera North, Spain is a cheerless, pitiless place - of imprisoning high walls, narrow vistas, sombre surfaces and hard planes of light. Whether cloister, monastery garden, town square or palace study is the setting, the removal of all Mediterranean warmth is intentional. In the later acts the rigid containment of the visual line is at last breached - only to reveal at the back of the stage a landscape stained blood-red. This spare, subtle, bleak Verdi staging has been designed by Hildegard Bechtler in a manner marrying Appia-like abstraction to a wonderful painterly refinement of colour and line; it is altogether a sustained feat of dramatic economy. (Only some opening-night waywardness in the lighting box blurred the sharpness of its outlines.) In the medium-sized Leeds Grand Theatre, on a miniscule budget, there was absolutely no question of Opera North simulating French Grand Opera spectacle a la Visconti or Zeffirelli; but style - and subject have been matched with an imagination and intelligence unshackled by budgetary restriction. The choice of text has been made a crucial part of this fastidiously concentrated approach. Opera North opts for the four-act (1883) version, Verdi's severely purposeful reduction of his original (1867) expansive five acts; and gives it in Andrew Porter's superb translation. People on the point of being persuaded, by the more fanatic adherents of the Surtitle School, that opera in the vernacular is now a hopelessly old-fashioned notion should rush to Leeds: a demonstration awaits them of the extraordinary, close-binding 'contract' that can arise between singing-actors and audience in the moment of theatrically sharing their native language. On Friday this reached its peak in the scene for Philip and Posa: never before have I been so completely gripped by its smallest pinpointing of communicative nuance, its shifting weights and balances of dramatic and musical insight, its developing theatrical momentum. Since this brought together, in Albery's quietly intense staging of their dialogue, the two most powerfully eloquent members of the cast, it was no coincidence. Anthony Michaels-Moore, beautifully free and forward of baritone timbre, effortlessly ardent and noble in every utterance, is already a young Posa of high class (who will join the highest once his trill and his walk have been polished). John Tomlinson, whose short stature adds to the impression of a Philip at once fiercely overbearing and pierced with self-doubt, bared the king's soul - fearlessly, frighteningly. In the study monologue the soft singing may have gone hollow, the pitching a touch bumpy, yet in the context of the staging the naked truthfulness of the performance seemed, if anything, increased. Both singers threw out each word as if it were an expressive lance aimed at the opera's heart. Less so Claire Powell's Eboli, but her sparky personality still sent flashes through the prevailing gloom, and in 'O don fatale' she darkened it with strict control of means. This artist is developing apace, to impressive effect. Linda McLeod, a mezzo turned soprano, suffused her first Elisabeth with tenderness, grace and dignity; only the last degree of security and focus at the top is wanting. In the title role the American tenor Richard Burke has the hardest task, and at first appeared unequal to it, but mustered his vocal forces in time to deliver the farewells with poise and affecting sincerity. A company's first Don Carlos is only the beginning. A conductor's likewise: Paul Daniel will surely learn to keep the brass more firmly in check, to hold a more consistently secure balance between dramatic tension and release. The care with which he nursed his singers (Miss MacLeod being lovingly supported through the long phrases of Elisabeth's two arias) was a clear indication of the heartfelt seriousness which has informed Mr Daniel's  -and Opera North's - whole approach to Verdi. Supported by Arthur Andersen &amp; Co and Weatherall Green Smith; in repertory at the Leeds Grand until January 29, then on tour to Nottingham, Birmingham and Manchester.</p>

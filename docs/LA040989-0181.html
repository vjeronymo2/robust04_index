			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LETTER'S EFFECT ON OLD ACQUAINTANCE  </P> <P> Re the letter by Dr. William Moss (April 2):  </P> <P> We came to Santa Ana 33 years ago, the same year as Moss. We knew him then as a  fine general surgeon who practiced high quality life-saving medicine. He later  chose to limit his practice to life-preventing medicine (performing tubal  ligations and vasectomies), and now he is specializing in life-destroying  procedures. It saddens us to know that he is the face and name behind the  Tustin abortion clinic.  </P> <P> His letter of thanks to the Tustin police and the pro-choice advocates who were  at his clinic to "protect" him and his patients has made us even more aware  that those of us who are advocates of the pro-life cause -- which holds that  all human life is sacred and has dignity and value -- must become more vocal  and visible.  </P> <P> It seems abortionists have protectors, animals have protectors, even car owners  are told by an American manufacturer that "protection is your right." Only  human babies not yet born are unprotected.  </P> <P> Dr. JOHN McANDREW  </P> <P> THERESE McANDREW  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

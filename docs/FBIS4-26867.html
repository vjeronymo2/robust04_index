			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, June 27 (XINHUA) -- A top trade union  leader today urged all overseas-funded enterprises in China to  set up trade unions to protect the legal rights of their workers  and better solve problems between labor and management.    "Such organizations will not only help protect the legal  rights of workers, but also promote cooperation between  employees and employers, and be conducive to the prosperity of  the enterprises," Zhang Dinghua said.    Zhang, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions, was speaking at an on-going national work conference on  trade unions in foreign enterprises held in the capital city of  north China's Hebei Province.    Trade unions in overseas-funded enterprises numbered 8,200  by  the end of 1993, taking in more than 1.32 million members,  according to Zhang.    He said that most overseas enterprises with trade unions  abide by Chinese laws and regulations in protecting the rights  of their employees and achieve good economic results due to  harmonious labor relations.    "However, some serious problems still remain," Zhang said,  noting that some small manufacturers neglect safety in  production, and some overseas investors force workers into  unreasonable overwork and then underpay them.    "Some even treat employees in a disrespectful and illegal  manner," he said.    In November last year, 84 woman workers were burned to death  in a fire in a Shenzhen toy-making factory run by a Hong Kong  businessman, because all the exits were closed for fear the  workers might steal his toys.    One month later, 62 workers were killed in a  Taiwanese-invested factory in Fujian Province for the same  reason.    Zhang stressed that trade unions play an indispensable role  in protecting laborers' rights and adjusting laborer-employer  relations in ways that other organizations can not.    But only 12 percent of the overseas-funded enterprises in  China have trade union organizations, Zhang said.    "Overseas-funded enterprises, especially those in  development  zones and coastal cities, must establish trade unions in their  enterprises by the end of this year," Zhang pronounced, reading  from a recent decree by the State Council.    "From now on, such enterprises must establish trade unions  in  order to open for business, and the deadline is one year from  the start of business," the decree said.    Zhang called for the legislature to issue laws and  regulations on the protections of laborers' rights and set up  relevant supervisory bodies to ensure that they are observed.    Zhang said his federation will also help township  enterprises  in the countryside to establish trade unions.    Some 400,000 township enterprises have already met the  requirements for setting up trade unions for their 25 million  workers. But not more than 5 percent of the enterprises have  trade unions and less than 8 percent of workers have  memberships, Zhang said.</p>

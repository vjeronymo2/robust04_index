			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke firmer Gambling and hotels group Ladbroke continued to recover from its recent mauling, adding 8 at 177p in hefty turnover of 6.8m. The shares have underperformed in recent weeks as worries resurfaced over its gearing and prospective property write-downs. There was also a stock overhang, compounded by fears that a scrip issue next month will bring more stock into the market. However, sentiment has improved in recent sessions, with more positive leisure analysts arguing that the stock was looking too cheap to be justified and that its betting business in particular was well placed. NatWest Securities, which recently put out a weighty tome on the issue, was yesterday reiterating its buy recommendation. Stanley Leisure benefited from the positive gambling talk and put on 5 at 215p. The continuing weakness in crude oil prices, ahead of the June 8 Opec meeting, took the steam out of the oil shares sector. Oil prices are said to have fallen around 70 cents a barrel since the middle of last week. BP lost 4 to 316 1/2 p, with the market surprised at the shares' performance after last week's move by one leading UK institution which bought a block of more than 20m shares. UK funds, big sellers of BP for much of last year, are thought by some oil sector specialists to be 'running for cover' and seeking to top up their holdings in BP. Much of the selling of BP yesterday was said to have emanated from the US. Shell, the FT-SE 100's best individual performer last week with an 8.1 per cent rise after the splendid figures, eased 1 1/2 to 609 1/2 p. Lasmo, still viewed as one of the most likely candidates to drop out of the FT-SE 100 after the inclusion of Zeneca and the forthcoming evaluation of the 100 index, edged up 1 1/2 to 154p in spite of evidence of sustained selling pressure from income funds. British Gas slipped 1 1/2 to 293 1/2 p ahead of Thursday's first-quarter numbers and also after comment in the weekend press, which suggested that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's inquiry may be moving to a position where it may seek an opening up of the domestic gas market, a move which is thought may not be viewed favourably in the City. APV shed 4 to 95p after Cazenove, the company's broker, downgraded current year profits expectations. The recent selling of GKN, following a clutch of broker's downgradings, appeared to have come to an end, leaving the shares to advance 9 to 443p ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting. A squeeze in Hunting brought an improvement of 6 to 210p. Vosper Thorncroft was in demand and put on 7 at 541p. Turnover in Smiths Industries of 2.2m included an agency cross of nearly 1m shares. The stock hardened a penny to 357p. Bargain hunters went shopping for Simon Industries, helping the shares firm 3 to 58p. UK flag carrier British Airways had a busy session ahead of today's expected announcement of a Pounds 400m-plus rights issue. Heavy selling saw the stock fall 6 1/2 to 297p in brisk trade of 7.3m shares. The company, which also reports final figures today, is expected to come in with profits for the year to March 1993 of around Pounds 200m, against last year's figure of Pounds 285m. Profit-taking in Lonrho left the shares 4 lighter at 113 1/2 p. Computer graphics company Division Group made a spectacular market debut. The shares closed at a 56p premium to the issue price at 96p, with 10m shares having been dealt by the close. Pharmaceutical stocks surged as US buyers were seen, helped also by some positive weekend press in the UK. Glaxo rose 14 to 655p, SmithKline Beecham 'A' 15 to 481p and Wellcome 16 to 755p. Food manufacturers were mostly strong, a mixture of market gossip and technical factors underpinning the rises. Of the major stocks, Northern Foods rose 10 to 270p as dealers reported a large buyer in the market. Tate &amp; Lyle firmed 4 to 386p on rumours of an imminent deal to buy a Spanish sugar refinery. Finally, old bid talk once again swirled around United Biscuits, the shares advancing 7 to 421p. Weekend press comment helped Marks and Spencer climb 6 to 355p, as the market waited eagerly for today's trading statement, which is likely to set the trend for the rest of the retail sector. There was speculation that Allied-Lyons would announce some form of equity-raising event with its results today. A convertible bond, or preference share issue seem to be the market favourite, although more cynical analysts said the 'Allied rights issue' story was a tired one. The shares shed 2 to 543p. Catering group Compass, which reports results this week, jumped 19 to 525p. The shares have underperformed in recent weeks. Allied Leisure gained 4 at 57p as it confirmed the appointment of Mr Bill Davis, former head of the English Tourist Board, as non-executive chairman. After a weekend of boardroom rows, Tottenham Hotspur climbed 14 to 103p. A company statement attempted to play down talk of profits mentioned in weekend press reports. The prospect of above average profits and dividend growth at Lloyds Bank saw the shares outperform the rest of the big banks and close a net 11 higher at 545p. TSB, where Hoare Govett was said to be a keen buyer of the shares, added 3 1/2 at 185p.</p>

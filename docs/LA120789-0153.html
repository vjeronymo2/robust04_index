			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLARK SCORES 45 IN TRIUMPHANT RETURN IN SMALL SCHOOLS INVITATIONAL  </P> <P> This time there were no lawyers, no television cameras and no press releases.  This time there were no rumors, no appeals and very little frustration. This  time Tony Clark was playing basketball rather than being entangled in it.  </P> <P> Tuesday at the second San Diego Small Schools Invitational at La Jolla Country  Day, the big man from Christian set three tournament records and held off a  late surge by Capristrano Valley Christian to preserve a 71-68 opening round  victory for the Patriots.  </P> <P> What a long, strange, trip it has been.  </P> <P> It began in mid-June, with Clark's decision to transfer from Division I  Valhalla, where he was the leading scorer in the county and the San Diego  section Player of the Year, to Division IV Christian.  </P> <P> It heightened when Section Commissioner Kendall Webb declared Clark ineligible  for athletics, on grounds of possible recruiting violations stemming from a May  dinner meeting involving the parents of six top county players.  </P> <P> Later, the question of what college he would play for -- Arizona, it turned out  -- hung in the balance.  </P> <P> Finally it ended. On Nov. 16, his remaining high school eligibility was  restored by a Section Board of Managers subcommittee, on an appeal by his  parents.  </P> <P> At long last, Clark fielded questions concerning his first official high school  on-court performance since the spring, when Valhalla lost 79-67 to San Diego in  Division I semifinals.  </P> <P> And he gave quite a show. In his Patriot debut, Clark had 45 points, including  five three-pointers, 16 rebounds, five blocked shots, and a nasty cold.  </P> <P> "We should have been better," said Clark, who scored Christian's first 16  points. "We started out like a ball of fire, but then we relaxed."  </P> <P> Christian outscored Capistrano Valley Christian 18-11 in both the first and  second quarters, but the Eagles' switch to a full-court pressure defense  crimped Christian's, namely Clark's, scoring effectiveness in the second half.  CVC outscored Christian, 46-35, after the half.  </P> <P> "We have a long way to go as a team," Christian Coach Randy Wright said. "Our  inexperience really showed and there's lots of work to do on defense." KIM Q.

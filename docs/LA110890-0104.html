			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> DUPREE IS ACTIVATED, MAY FACE GIANTS  </P> <P> The Rams activated Marcus Dupree off the injured-reserve list Wednesday, but  Dupree and Coach John Robinson cautioned against expecting the 26-year-old  running back to see much action Sunday against the New York Giants at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> "I've got to look at it in reality," said Dupree, who is bringing his two sons,  his mother and his little brother from Mississippi to the game.  </P> <P> "I've been out of this game for five years, so don't expect to see me go out  there and bust an 80-yard touchdown. It would be great, but whatever happens,  happens."  </P> <P> Robinson emphasized that he is taking it slowly because Dupree has played fewer  than 20 college and (United States Football League) games -- and that was more  than five years ago.  </P> <P> "It's like getting on an airplane and having them announce, 'We've got a really  great pilot, he's got greatness in his future, but it's been five years since  he's done it,' " Robinson said. "You'd get your . . . off the plane."  </P> <P> Robinson said recently waived running back Curt Warner got a fair chance with  the team. "I thought when we started, he would be the veteran back and  Cleveland (Gary) and Gaston (Green) would be the younger backs, and there would  be a mix there. But we got off track somewhere. Whether his skills have  deteriorated or not, that I don't know."  </P> <P> Cornerback Jerry Gray, who did not play in last week's game because of a sore  knee, practiced Thursday and said he expects to play Sunday. . . . The Rams  waived center Rodney Lossow off injured reserve and re-signed running back Fred  Whittingham Jr., who was assigned to the practice squad. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

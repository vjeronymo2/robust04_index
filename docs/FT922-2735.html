			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BIS Annual Report: Cautious optimism voiced for world recovery THERE are grounds for cautious optimism about the prospects for world economic recovery, according to Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements. In comments in the BIS's annual report Mr Lamfalussy says that growth in much of the developed world should soon start to recover from its depressed levels last year. Among the reasons for optimism are signs of recovery in the US, aided by a revival in housing investment. Private sector debt in both the US and UK has fallen, while low inflation in much of the industrialised world should aid increased growth. Large government budgets in many countries are helping to stimulate demand, even though the consequent deficits give some cause for concern. Efforts should be made, says Mr Lamfalussy, to reduce deficits where possible and also to channel extra government spending 'into public investment rather than public consumption, and into projects chosen on the basis of their likely return over the medium turn'. The costs of servicing the large debts taken on by many people and companies in the 1980s had retarded the recovery in some countries last year. Another worry concerns the large fall in land and property prices experienced in many nations. However, Mr Lamfalussy says it is 'far-fetched' to draw parallels between the depressed state of the world economy and the depression of the 1930s. In further discussion of the world economy elsewhere in the report, the BIS says restrictions in bank credit in the US arising from the weak state of the banking industry 'may have become a serious constraint' on spending and hindered an upturn. As for Europe, the report draws attention to 'dissatisfaction' with the operation of the European Monetary System, which due to tight monetary policy in Germany has prevented several European nations from reducing interest rates to levels that could help recovery. But one bright spot is the resilient performance of the economies of a large part of the developing world, particularly in Asia and Latin America. Many nations in these regions have made strides in structural economic adjustments and reductions in overseas debt.</p>

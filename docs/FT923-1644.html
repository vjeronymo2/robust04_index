			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Interest rate gap 'should be reduced' - IMF in Washington GERMAN interest rates should be lowered and US rates increased, Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's finance minister and chairman of the IMF's policy-making interim committee, indicated yesterday. He said world economic recovery was being held back because 'German rates are too high and US rates too low'. The differential in rates had to be reduced if countries were to achieve sustained growth and greater currency stability. Countries would have to co-ordinate their policies more effectively if the kind of turbulence in financial markets experienced last week was to be avoided, he said. Mr Solchaga was speaking at a press conference in Washington to release the communique of the IMF's interim committee. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, echoed Mr Solchaga's call for greater economic co-operation, arguing that recent events had shown with 'crystal clarity' the interdependent nature of countries' policies. Mr Camdessus said he was not pressing for an immediate raising of US interest rates. However, the Federal Reserve should ensure that economic recovery was promptly accompanied by 'moderate and progressive' increases in rates. The importance of policy co-ordination and the need for economic convergence within Europe was underlined in the communique. It said countries had to improve the balance between fiscal and monetary policies if they were to achieve a narrowing of interest rate differentials. Mr Camdessus said yesterday that President George Bush's suggestion on Sunday that greater use be made of commodity price indicators in co-ordinating economic policies was 'timely' and would be explored further. However, the IMF already made use of commodity prices, including gold, as a 'forward-looking indicator' of economic developments. Mr Camdessus again called on industrial countries to consolidate their budgets. The route to sustained growth lay in reducing long-term interest rates by cutting the proportion of national savings absorbed by public sectors. Turning to the outlook for developing countries, Mr Camdessus said substantial progress had been made in reducing debt burdens. The ratio of debt to gross domestic product had fallen by a third  - from 180 per cent to 120 per cent  - in the past seven years. In many countries debt was 'no longer an impediment to growth'. The communique also praised the reform efforts under way in central and eastern Europe. Questioned about the narrow Yes vote in France's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, Mr Solchaga said that having received a democratic Yes in France the ratification process should continue. Mr Solchaga expressed confidence that the Italian lira would return to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism soon but he believed the British authorities had no intention of an early return for the pound.

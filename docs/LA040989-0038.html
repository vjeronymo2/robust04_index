			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPANDED COVERAGE  </P> <P> I am so impressed with your newly revised Real Estate Section that I decided to  write and say "thank you."  </P> <P> Especially to be noted are sections on preservation, urban scene, architects,  gardening and home improvements. Leon Whiteson's article on the Home Savings of  America Tower (March 19) was well written and most interesting.  </P> <P> SHIRLEY SUPPLE  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

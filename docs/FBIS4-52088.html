			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by station </F> correspondent Truong Cong Hoa; place, date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Dear Minister: You just accompanied  President Le Duc Anh on an official friendship visit to  Indonesia and Iran. Would you please appraise the results of  these visits?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] These two countries have some similar  features but have different approaches in their relations with  Vietnam. First, Indonesia and Iran are both active members of  the Nonaligned Movement. Indonesia, as chairman of the  Movement, has made great efforts in carrying out its activities.  Second, these two countries have great potential for economic  development. The two nations share the same aspiration to  expand relations with Vietnam in various aspects.    Indonesia has maintained long-standing relations with  Vietnam; it has been almost four decades since the establishment  of consulates general between the two nations. During this  period, Vietnam-Indonesia relations have developed consistently  in various fields. Although this relationship has sometimes  declined, it has developed vigorously following President  Suharto's official visit to Vietnam in late 1990 and Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet's official friendship visit to Indonesia in  October 1991. Since then, Vietnam's relations with Indonesia  and the other ASEAN countries have shifted to a new era -- an  era of cooperation and development. Over the past two or more  years, these relations have developed rapidly. The value of  goods exchanged between the two countries reached $255 million  in 1993, compared to $192 million in 1991. Regarding economic  cooperation, Indonesian businesses have invested in various  projects in Vietnam and have been granted licenses [words  indistinct]. In addition, the two countries have expanded  cooperation in the fields of culture, science, and national  defense.    We have had relations with Iran for over 20 years -- since  1973. In the past we have not have much activity in economic and  trade cooperation because of unfavorable geographical  conditions. Over the past few years, however, our trade  relations with Iran have improved remarkably.    President Le Duc Anh's visit to Indonesia and Iran was aimed  at strengthening friendship and cooperation with these  countries, especially Indonesia, with which we have consistently  maintained a close relationship. As for Iran, through President  Le Duc Anh's visit we have built a firm basis for developing  relations with this country. During the meetings between  President Le Duc Anh and the Indonesian and Iranian presidents,  as well as meetings between Vietnamese ministers and their  Indonesian and Iranian counterparts, we focussed on discussing  ways and means to expand cooperation, especially in the economic  domain.    In Indonesia, the presidents and ministers of the two  countries contended that economic and trade relations are not  active enough in view of the political relationship and the  potential of the two nations. On this basis, the two countries  agreed that efforts must be made in the future to expand  cooperation in trade and other domains; first in the exploration  for oil and gas, then in the exploitation of coal mines,  maritime products, agriculture, and tourism. In our meetings  with representatives of Indonesian companies, they expressed  their readiness to cooperate with Vietnam and participate in  building various electric power plants in our country. I can  say that through the visit to Indonesia, we have established a  basis and an orientation for further development in relations  between the two countries. To achieve this goal, the two  countries will sign an agreement in the near future on the  avoidance of double taxation to create favorable conditions for  the promotion of business activities between the two countries.    In Iran, President Le Duc Anh held talks with his Iranian  counterpart. Both sides contended that economic and trade  relations between the two countries are still minimal, although  the bilateral friendship has developed satisfactorily. As a  result, both sides should make greater efforts to expand  cooperation in the economic and trade domains as soon as  possible. There is a great demand in Iran for rice and tea;  Iran needs about 500,000 tonnes of rice annually. Both sides  agreed that Vietnam can export rice to Iran on a regular basis.  Iran would also like to import a large volume of tea from  Vietnam.    [Nguyen Manh Cam continues] In addition, from Iran we can  buy such things as cotton and petroleum products, including  asphalt, chloride, and clinker, which is used in the processing  of cement. Thus, the two sides have goods for barter trade.  Economically, the two sides agreed to cooperate in the field of  gas and oil, as Iran's oil industry is a century old and has  much experience in this field. Iran is ready to help train  cadres for us. Iran also wants to help build an oil refinery in  Vietnam. In addition, Iran is ready to cooperate with us in the  field of construction, especially the construction of a cement  factory, based on its experience in this field. Based on our  suggestion, Iran is very eager to cooperate with us in the  fields of oil, rubber, tea, and coffee.    To make a long story short, Iran is very eager to achieve  long- term cooperation with us. This means that our president's  visit to Iran, the first high-level meeting between the two  countries, laid the foundation for a real and long-term  relationship between the two countries. It should be noted that  during this visit we were showered wherever we went with the  special sentiments of the Iranian leaders and people. Here I  would like to recall a highly typical remark by Ayatollah  Khamene'i, Iran's highest spiritual leader, on our people and  struggle: The Vietnamese people are highly admired because they  have demonstrated their very heroic fighting spirit. They have  set a shining example for those nations fighting for  independence and have contributed greatly to the struggle of the  world's nations for independence and freedom. Cooperation  between Vietnam and Iran has a very good basis for development.    What should be recalled here is that the summit meetings  between President Le Duc Anh and Indonesian President Suharto,  and between President Le Duc Anh and the Iranian president,  contributed to strengthening the solidarity among members of the  Nonaligned Movement further so as to realize the Movement's  common goal of peace, independence, sovereignty, and development  and to contribute to establishing a new world order.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what do you think about the  question of Vietnam joining ASEAN, which was raised during the  visit to Indonesia?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] The fact that we are joining ASEAN as an  observer and that we recently participated in a project  sponsored by an ASEAN committee will inevitably lead to our  country's participation in ASEAN as a full member. This is a  logical development in line with the current trend in the region  as well as the world. Recently, all of the ASEAN leaders have  expressed their desire to see Vietnam obtain full ASEAN  membership soon. Because this is compatible with overall  developments in the region and the world, we must -- with the  support of the ASEAN members -- be prepared to participate in  this organization soon as a full member. Just as President  Suharto said during his exchange of views with President Le Duc  Anh: Vietnam becoming a full member of ASEAN will be very  beneficial to regional development. This is compatible with the  current trend toward regional peace, stability, and cooperation  and is universally beneficial to the development of all nations  in the world.    [Correspondent] During his visit to Iran, President Le Duc  Anh was accompanied by a number of Vietnamese businessmen. Is  this a change in the way our country's leaders work when they go  abroad?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] In the past, our leaders' overseas trips  were more politically motivated. In the new situation, overseas  trips by high level leaders such as the president, prime  minister, and general secretary will not only have political  significance -- because they help strengthen the friendship  between our country and the countries that our leaders visit --  they will also have very positive economic significance. As  economics has become the pressing demand of all nations, visits  by our government's high level delegations are usually  accompanied by representatives of various public health  organizations, corporations, and enterprises. This is because,  along with high-level meetings, we also need direct contacts  between corporations. This way we will be able to understand  the real capabilities of related sectors with which our country  can achieve cooperation. That is why representatives of the  corporations dealing in those goods Iran wishes to import from  us or export to us went along on the trip to Iran. This further  substantiated the high-level agreements we reached. Of course,  we could not do much on a visit that only lasted for a few days,  but at least we established direct contacts to continue our  exchange of views and spur bilateral cooperation. This is a  change in our working method that suits the requirements of the  current situation that is witnessing the growth of various  countries in the world.    [Correspondent] Thank you, comrade minister.</p>

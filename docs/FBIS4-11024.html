			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "Panamanians for Democracy, Honesty, </F> and Civilian Rule" in Panama City, date not given: "Videos.  National Mission To Vote Against the PRD" -- capitalization as  published]    [Text] The videos aired by the Presidency showed in a  straightforward fashion how the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary  Party] used the money of the Panamanian people. THEY TOOK IT AS  IF IT BELONGED TO THEM while lying and deceiving the people.  They played with a matter as important as NATIONALISM for their  personal gain. For 22 years, they made a mockery of the  nationalist struggle of more than six generations just to remain  in power and carve out the PIE. How many dead, how many  students who gave their lives for this nationalist struggle were  sacrificed by these men for the sake of stealing the people's  money! They paid off union leaders and then poked fun at them  during their Cabinet Councils! That is why the national mission  of all Panamanians without regard for political parties MUST BE  TO VOTE AGAINST THE PRD. THE PRD IS THE COMMON ENEMY. This is  no new PRD. It is the same thieving, criminal, embezzling PRD  that made a mockery of the people, with a false spirit of  nationalism and which is corrupt to the bone. They are the same  ones: ERNESTO PEREZ BALLADARES, RIGOBERTO PAREDES, ALFREDO  ORANGES, CARLOS DUQUE, MARIO ROGNONI, RODOLFO CHIARI, THE  DIGNITY BATTALION MEMBERS, AND THE CODEPADI [Committee for the  Defense of the Fatherland and Dignity]. It shamed the people  that presidential candidate Perez Balladares admitted going to  the military's meetings at the TINAJITAS garrison to behead  presidents. As Targidio Bernal [former justice and government  minister] brazenly stated in the video: "We changed two  presidents with one crushing blow to the balls."    The theft at the Fortuna Dam, one of the hundreds that they  carried out, raised the project's cost from 250 million balboas  to 500 million balboas. ALL THAT FILTH AND IMMORALITY regarding  sinecures, mistresses, and sinecure jobs for $3,000 and $3,500,  as that creature called MANUEL SOLIS PALMA AND OTHER PRD MEMBERS  admitted. The people of Panama must respond to that. VOTING  AGAINST THE PRD IS THE NATIONAL MISSION. WE WILL VOTE AGAINST  CORRUPTION, THEFT, AND CRIME.    [Signed] Panamanians for Democracy, Honesty, and Civilian  Rule.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  Wednesday [19 January] blasted a U.S. policy seeking numerical  trade targets as "bid rigging" between exporting and importing  countries. The policy is designed to guarantee a fixed portion  of trade profits by imposing import goals in "a compulsory  manner," said the head of the Industrial Structure Council, an  advisory body to the minister of international trade and  industry.    The practice would serve nobody's interests in the long run  because it would eventually erode the competitiveness of  exporting countries as well, panel chairman Mitsuo Matsushita  told a press conference.    The panel said, "an exporting country should not call on the  government of an importing country to implement a `numerical  target-based trade policy.' Nor should the government of an  importing country accede to such a request."    Voluntary plans for U.S.-made auto parts purchased by  Japanese car makers and U.S. expectations in its chip trade  accord with Tokyo were "abused" in the past and treated as if  they were government commitments, which they were not, the panel  said.    Japan must dismantle numerical trade policies already in  place by "as early a date as possible" while it should ensure  that the private sector does not take similar measures in the  future, the panel said.    Matsushita, professor at the University of Tokyo, dismissed  a  U.S. call for Tokyo's introduction of numerical targets as a way  to further open up Japan's markets.    There is no relationship between market shares and the  degree  to which the market is closed, Matsushita said, noting foreign  shares in a given country are determined by various factors such  as differences in competitiveness, business efforts by exporters  and consumer preferences. The United States would contradict  itself by saying the Japanese chip market is closed because of a  U.S. chip share in the market of less than 20 percent against  its 40 percent share in the global market, Matsushita said.    Japanese-made chips command a 40 percent global market share  while their share in the U.S. is only 20 percent, he explained.    To oblige a user to buy more than they require is tantamount  to "abandoning the principles of a market economy," Matsushita  said. He also said a numerical trade target policy represents a  "complete disregard of normal selection criteria such as quality  and prices," noting the policy would result in a "waste of  taxpayers' money" and "a loss of economic benefits" for them.    He said the policy is also "completely" against the  principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  which is aimed at "strict adherence to the rules of  international trade." Matsushita said preferential treatment of  certain countries under the policy violates Article I of the  GATT provision, which calls for most-favored-nation treatment  among countries.</p>

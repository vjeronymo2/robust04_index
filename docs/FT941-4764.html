			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / France is in a budgetary bind, says the OECD The French economy will grow by 1 per cent this year, less than the 1.4 per cent forecast by the Balladur government which may thus have difficulty hitting its deficit reduction target, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warns in a report today. The OECD says France needs to cut its interest rates further, and accepts that it wants to do this only in conjunction with Germany, and assumes that this will be possible. But it cautions that 'if German interest rates fell by less than projected, the French authorities would have to consider how to continue their policy of gradual interest rate reductions while maintaining their stable currency strategy'. It suggests that with 'no room for fiscal manoeuvre left' to boost the economy through the budget, a further easing of monetary policy would 'be the only way to support demand'. While acknowledging the pick-up in consumption in the third quarter of last year, the Paris-based organisation says the signs are 'the (economic) decline has halted, rather than that a clear-cut recovery is under way'. French government economists yesterday attributed the OECD's caution to the fact that it, like every other forecaster, failed to predict the 1992-93 recession, and to the fact that its report does not take into account the continued improvement in the last three months of 1993. This showed a 0.2 per cent rise in output, with an automatic 'carry-over' effect contributing 0.3-0.4 per cent to this year's growth. Highlighting France's budgetary bind, the OECD suggests that the government may be planning to restrain public spending too much for the short-term health of the economy, but too little to fulfil the longer-term fiscal goals set out in the Maastricht treaty for monetary union. This discrepancy arises out of the fact that the government plans to bring down its central budget deficit from FFr317bn (Pounds 36.31bn) last year to FFr300bn in 1994, but has taken few measures to contain local authorities' spending and to cut back social welfare spending. France aims to meet the Maastricht goal of bringing overall public borrowings/deficits to 3 per cent or less by 1997. But the ratio this year for France, the OECD predicts, will be nearer 5.75 per cent of gross national output in 1994, rather than the 5.1 per cent government target. The OECD criticises the tax system, despite recent reforms, as having too narrow a base, too complex a structure and too steep a progression. But the OECD endorses the government's moves to shift more of the cost of the French welfare state off the backs of companies and their employees and on to the state budget. However, it says the government may have to go further than it did in 1993 in cutting pension benefits and much further than it has in containing the cost of French healthcare.

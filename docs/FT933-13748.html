			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Pushing the boat into calmer seas - Rupert Murdoch / Raymond Snoddy on media manoeuvres It is extremely unlikely that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The News Corporation, will do any deals this weekend or launch dramatic media initiatives. He's far too busy relaxing on his new toy, Morning Glory, an Italian-built 50-metre yacht launched in May and undergoing trials in the Mediterranean. When he lived in Australia, Murdoch always had a yacht but he did not see much point in keeping one when he was founding the core of his newspaper empire in London. Morning Glory, which has the latest high-tech equipment, from computer-controlled sails to satellite telephones, will eventually be based on the west coast of the US, where Murdoch lives, after possibly stopping off in the West Indies for a break at Christmas. The restless media tycoon may have been forced to relax this week - his long-time personal assistant Dot was making sure very few telephone calls got through to Morning Glory - but the holiday followed a period of frenetic activity. Within a matter of days, he achieved near total victory in regaining the New York Post; launched a cut-price campaign designed to revive the flagging sales of The Sun, which galvanised the popular newspaper market in the UK; and bought 50 per cent of a record distributor in Australia. For good measure, News Corporation is also involved with several Australian television channelsand Australia Telecom, the national telecommunications network, to launch pay television in the country. While all that was going on, a much slower poker game continued - Murdoch was trying to play the right diplomatic cards to remove the regulatory barriers to his 22 per cent stake in Television Broadcasts, one of Hong Kong's commercial television stations. 'All of this means that Murdoch is out of jail,' said one News Corporation watcher in a reference to the miss-three-turns penalty in the game of Monopoly. The nature and size of the deals and initiatives taken by Murdoch recently, and the way in which they were done, give considerable clues to his present business priorities. They come at a time when News Corporation, with interests ranging from Twentieth Century Fox film studios to ownership of five national UK newspapers, is largely free from the financial constraints that brought the multi-media group to its knees three years ago. 'We are not rushing to expand. This is all just normal business. This is the 1990s. In the 1980s the banks threw money at us. That's all finished now,' said Mr Gus Fischer, chief operating officer of News Corporation, and one of those minding the shop while Murdoch sails his boat. The top team, which increasingly runs the business on a day-to-day basis, includes Mr David DeVoe, News Corporation's finance director, and Mr Arthur Siskind, general counsel. Wall Street observers note that, after three years of doing little but run existing businesses, Murdoch is on the hunt again. Rather approvingly, they note that the deals are relatively small and measured and that there is no sign of the mega-acquisitions of the past, such as the multi-billion-dollar purchase of TV Guide. Perhaps the most telling indication of his current motives is Murdoch's return to New York to save the 192-year-old Post newspaper, which he owned until 1988. In strictly business terms it is probably imprudent for Murdoch to try to buy back the ailing Post. Unless he can force the rival Daily News out of business, or take it over at some later date, it is difficult to see how the paper can ever make money. The symbolic importance of rescuing the Post is great, however. Murdoch was forced by US regulations on media ownership to sell the Post to keep his New York television station. He would be happy to be back in the New York swim, having talks with allies such as New York governor Mario Cuomo. 'He was really full of beans when he turned up in the newsroom,' said one New York Post journalist. Murdoch is reported to have bought an apartment again in the city, and has even involved himself in contentious local issues, such as whether the New York Yankees baseball team should be allowed to move to New Jersey because their Bronx home is in too violent an area. Murdoch has even been reported to be in talks with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner about the possibility of helping to build a covered stadium which would contain television or film studios. They would call it Fox Plaza. But strict business limits have been applied to the plans for the Post. Last Friday, when Murdoch was completing a week of meetings in London - the longest period he has spent in the UK this year - the decision was taken to abandon the deal. The unions would not agree to cost-cutting of Dollars 6.2m. By Monday the unions had agreed to the concession. News Corporation insists that the deal will only go through if there is a chance that the paper can break even, despite the pleasure it would give Murdoch to run a newspaper in New York again. Tough negotiations with the paper's creditors are now likely. While the Murdoch management was walking out - temporarily - from the Post, Murdoch was putting his imprimatur on the controversial plan to cut the price of The Sun by 5p to 20p for the summer. The proprietor has become convinced that popular UK newspapers have become too expensive, particularly in a recession. It is too early to judge the success of the experiment, which is seen in News International, Murdoch's UK subsidiary, as giving the readers back some of the promotional money that would otherwise go to the ITV companies on television advertising. The first signs are that The Sun is selling about 8 per cent more copies, and that the Daily Mirror is not, so far, being damaged, even though it is now 7p dearer. Total sales in the popular newspaper market have risen by about 2 per cent. Evidence would suggest that the newspaper market is not very price sensitive. Mr Harry Henry, in his Dynamics of the British Press, found that between 1961 and 1984 the cover price of newspapers doubled in real terms, while the number of copies sold fell by only 15 per cent. Murdoch and his senior managers will be watching to see whether the same trend holds true today. If The Sun were to lift its circulation well above 4m from its present 3.6m, the experiment could be extended beyond the summer. If the increase in sales stays at its present 8 per cent, there is a good chance of a possibly counter-productive price 'rise' for The Sun in September. At the same time as they were looking at The Sun's circulation in the UK, Murdoch's men were making a record deal in Australia this week. Though small, - Dollars 34m for a 50 per cent stake in Mushroom Records, Australia's largest independent record distributor - it is a further indication that News Corporation intends to expand into every corner of media 'software'. But the biggest prospects of all are not in London or Sydney, but in Asia, in China in particular. Last month Murdoch announced that News Corporation was paying Dollars 238.8m for a 22 per cent stake in Television Broadcasts in a venture with the company's controlling shareholders, Sir Run Run Shaw and Mr Robert Kuok. However, he asked the Hong Kong regulatory authorities to defer a decision on his bid because he feared it was going to be turned down - he already owns the South China Morning Post - and because of uncertainty about the attitude of the Chinese government. But it has emerged that he has not given up on the deal, that more detailed work on it is now being carried out, and that if necessary he will fly to Beijing for talks with the Chinese leadership about his Asian ambitions. In the past Murdoch has been adept at finding a way round or over regulatory hurdles. One further venture attracted his attention last week. In London, he was able to catch up with the progress of what started out as an outrageous gamble - British Sky Broadcasting. On September 1 the satellite venture, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a substantial stake, will create a subscription package of at least 14 channels. From then, only those who pay a monthly subscription will be able to watch - with the exception of Sky News, the 24-hour-a-day news channel which will go out all over Europe. If the gamble works and BSkyB does not lose too many of its viewers - at the moment is it available in more than 3.5m homes through cable and satellite dishes - the move will create growing subscription revenues for Murdoch. As he relaxes this weekend on the deck of Morning Glory, there can be little doubt that from New York to London, and Sydney to Hong Kong, Murdoch is back with a vengeance.</p>

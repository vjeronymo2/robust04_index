			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION J;  </P> <P> BUSY SIGNAL  </P> <P> Last year more than 4.6 million calls were handled by the city's 911 emergency  telephone system. But a half-million other callers were unable to reach an  emergency operator, the result of a system whose capacity to respond has been  overtaken by the demands made on it.  </P> <P> Proposition J on the Nov. 6 ballot would provide funding to expand and  modernize this vital emergency system. Every resident of Los Angeles will  benefit if Proposition J is approved.  </P> <P> Proposition J, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, would impose a  special tax on residential, business and commercial property in the city of Los  Angeles to finance a $235-million bond issue. Proceeds from the bonds would  modernize the Police Department's obsolete radio system, build a new 911  dispatch center in the San Fernando Valley, move the current dispatch center to  a new facility and increase the number of 911 operators, dispatchers and police  radio channels.  </P> <P> Expanding the capacity of the 911 dispatch center would ensure better emergency  service on police, fire and paramedic calls. Building a second facility some  distance from the present downtown center would also make available a backup  system should an earthquake or some other disaster put the downtown site out of  operation.  </P> <P> Proposition J would cost the owner of a 1,500-square-foot home about $14 a year  over the 20-year life of the special tax. That is a small cost to pay to obtain  a more secure and responsive emergency communications system. Proposition J is  a life-saving measure.  </P></p>

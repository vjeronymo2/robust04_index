			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD SMOKES DIVISION III POMONA-PITZER, 84-49  </P> <P> Pomona-Pitzer didn't figure to be much of a challenge for the University of San  Diego men's basketball team, and it wasn't.  </P> <P> USD blew out the Sagehens, 84-49, Tuesday in front of 1,075 at the USD Sports  Center.  </P> <P> It was the Toreros' fourth victory in four games this year, their best  beginning since becoming a Division I member in 1979. It was also their biggest  margin of victory since beating Cal Lutheran, 82-46, to begin last season.  </P> <P> USD also tied an obscure school record as all 15 available players scored.  </P> <P> USD Coach Hank Egan normally schedules one early game per season against a  non-Division I opponent for the purposes of working on a specific part of the  game and getting the reserves some playing time.  </P> <P> Egan chose Pomona-Pitzer, a Division III member of the Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, because the Sagehens are coached by  Charles Katsiaficas, a former assistant to Egan.  </P> <P> "I was reasonably pleased because of all the factors involved," Egan said.  "That guy coaching at the other end of the bench, his kids looked pretty good,  and that was important to me, too. (Katsiaficas) is part of the family, too."  </P> <P> Egan was also pleased with the victory, his 98th in seven seasons as the  Toreros' coach, the defensive effort and that he was able to play a number of  players in a number of different positions.  </P> <P> Against a quick, swarming USD defense, the smaller Sagehens shot only 31.6% (18  of 57) from the field. They also made only 11 of 20 (55%) free throws.  </P> <P> "We were looking at this as a scrimmage really, to tone up on defense," Torero  senior guard Pat Holbert said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, USD made more than 50% of its shots -- 51.5% on 34-of-66 shooting --  for the fourth time this season.  </P> <P> Holbert and Reed Watson were the only scorers in double figures, but 13 others  scored between two and eight points.  </P> <P> Pomona-Pitzer (1-4) was led by William Cover with 13 points and six rebounds.  </P> <P> USD never trailed in the game and led by as many as 20 in the first half and 39  in the second half.  </P> <P> Anthony Thomas, who made 10 of 10 shots in a 98-81 rout of San Jose State  Saturday night, made his first three before missing a 10-foot bank with 2:29  left in the first half.  </P> <P> The Toreros play next in the Indiana Classic beginning Friday against North  Carolina-Wilmington.  </P></p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Private View: Living in another world TOMORROW is our summer solstice, a high point in the calendar for disciples of the New Age. At the sacred sites of Britain - Avebury, Stonehenge, Glastonbury, Arthur's Seat, Callanish - there will be little pagan ceremonies, accompanied by music and dancing, pot-smoking and the police. The New Age is difficult to define. It is a mildly apocalyptic vision of a post-technological world in which Man lives in harmony with Nature. It has no fixed doctrines or liturgy: it is a syrupy mixture of primitive animism, Christianity and Oriental mysticism. It is about saving the planet and being nice to others, but especially about feeling good. It is a revolt against rationalism, science and materialism, with a metaphysic as spongy as marshmallow. To find out whether the New Age is more than any other other brain-softening cult I went this week to see Michael Irving, a publisher of New Age pamphlets and organiser of the Avebury summer solstice sit-in. He lives with his girlfriend, Karen Jones, in a rented bungalow in the West country looking out at Glastonbury Tor. I discovered a normally intelligent, softly-spoken 40-year-old with a pale face and innocent, grey-blue eyes. There was a sickly smell of scented candles in the house and the new baby sat in his playpen, chubbily smiling like Buddha. Within a minute of our meeting, however, I learned that the bungalow is built on the dragon line that runs diagonally from St Michael's Mount in Cornwall to Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk. There are two of these dragon lines circling the world, one positive, one negative. They are harmless, my host explained as he handed me a glass of pure orange juice. Michael Irving does not like the term 'New Age' because of the way it is used in the papers. 'You often see people with crystals saying very funny things. I'd rather not be associated with that. It's quite a serious business.' Instead, he talks of Leading Edge, New Thought or Inspiration. Why do you celebrate the summer solstice? 'I think it's because of seasonal changes in the planet, as the sun moves up and back again, a movement of energy, I suppose, across the earth's surface. The ancients found strong places of that flow and built their temples there.' Some New Agers claim to be able to plug into the earth's current when they touch standing stones and generate energy by dancing in and out of them. Irving said he had not reached quite that degree of sensitivity, having been so 'shut down' in his early life. He had had to retreat from life after the disciplines of public school and the unfulfilling experience of working in his father's kitchen equipment shop on the Isle of Man, he explained. He studied mechanical engineering at Farnborough College of Technology, worked for the 600 Group in project engineering but a bout of bad health sent him off to learn Transcendental Meditation. He became the cook at a TM academy in Derbyshire and later, in the TM settlement in Skelmersdale, learned to design and print T-shirts, stationery and menus. In 1983 his life was changed by meeting Sir George Trevelyan, a prominent New Age guru. 'He awakened my consciousness, a deeper sensitivity that up to then nobody had really reached in me.' Sensitivity to what? I asked. 'It's like a magnification inwards, an inner opening and expansion. You feel things like hope, deep meaning and the significance of things.' Had you been depressed before? 'Yes. Normally depressed, as I would say.' He smiled. 'I didn't really know till then that I was depressed.' Under Sir George's influence he produced a scrapbook of favourite quotations from people like the Apollo astronauts, Mother Theresa - and Sir George himself. An 'oak dragon camp' brought him to Glastonbury. He pointed out of the window: 'We camped three miles over there in the Glastonbury zodiac. Marvellous things started to happen to me: sitting in the circle feeling something tremendous as the talking stick passed round. I heard people saying interesting things, and real things, like they were fed up with the person in the tent next to them, or singing a song, or just holding the stick for a couple of minutes.' Driving round, he could feel the energy flying across the land. Next weekend 100,000 people will descend on the nearby village for the Glastonbury Festival. Irving is afraid there will be violence because, he explained, some people were not used to celebrating and feeling good about life. It seems the violence is due to a certain pre-millennial tension. New Ageism is a 'holistic' view of the world and making 'connections' is important. This includes connecting the left brain (the rational hemisphere) with the right (intuitive) side. I asked if the notorious Travellers were making these connections. 'I think they're totally right-brained without any left brain, plus a bit of anger. They feel the connection of things a bit too much. Like they want to just pick up anything and throw it in their van. They're a bit too connected. They don't have the discrimination to know what doesn't belong to them.' I asked about the Brew Crew (they drink Special Brew) and the Crusties (who don't wash). 'I think they are basically very confused people. Life isn't working for them but they don't know why.' A clue to the New Age revelation, according to some disciples, is contained in crop circles. When I said they had been exposed as hoaxes, Irving insisted some were genuine. Apparently they fulfil the prophecies of a Red Indian 'rainbow dream vision', a 20-year programme of enlightenment leading to the millennium. According to a certain Harley Swiftdeer, when the winged or feathered serpent wheels turn again we will see rainbow lights in our sleep. These rainbow lights accord with the seven coloured chakras or energy centres in our body. And, said Irving, the crop circles contained symbols from the rainbow dream. I was losing the drift. Who makes these circles? I asked. He hesitated. 'Well I know who I think. I'm pretty sure it's extraterrestrial intelligence.' You really believe extraterrestrials make these marks? 'If you ask me personally, yeah. I have seen three spaceships quite close up.' He was meditating one night near Warminster on the edge of Salisbury Plain when three of them came over his car about 100 yards off. He chased after them. 'They were about 25ft in diameter and there were windows in them going round. I saw nobody at the windows but my heart opened. I felt incredibly wonderful. 'Eventually they went over a clay hill and I saw them going round over a stand of trees, very peacefully, before flying off towards Stonehenge and Avebury.' He believes they had chosen him in order to convey something. The message was 'about getting people into circles, about raising our consciousness.' Irving went on to explain something called the Birth of the Cosmic Child, which is about recapturing lost innocence and spontaneity and sharing one's experiences. I suggested psychoanalysis would do the trick without the need for earth currents or dream visions. Irving replied that both Freud and Jung had foreshadowed the New Age solution: just as the sun's energy radiates from earth's core to its surface, so we must learn to allow the heart chakra to radiate its energy to the body. I see, I said. I asked if he believed in God. 'What I do believe in is a consciousness that brings us all together.' Isn't what you are talking about pagan? 'I'm not too bothered about what things are called. It's just whether it feels OK and works. As a matter of evolution we had to remove ourselves from experiencing things directly. We split off and we're on the point of rejoining the flow.' We did not have to go back to living in mud huts, he added. We could keep the benefits of technology provided we restored the balance. I suggested that was dropping out. He said: 'It's dropping in. It's a paradox, a turnround in our appreciation of life.' If I said you were childishly escaping into a primitive world of rituals, symbols and ignorance, what would you say? 'It's not just being childlike, it's not just living in the country, it's not just being artistic. You're making a left-brain. Something else is going to happen. I would say stick around because this thing is going to happen.' What is going to happen? 'I don't know. A good thing might be to go and stand in a good crop pattern and see what one feels. See if you feel good or excited or expanded. What would you like to happen? 'I'd like to relax. I would like to not feel that I'm totally anonymous when I go out in the world. That on the High Street we know how to say hallo to each other, that we could start helping each other. We could start creating this prediction of Heaven on Earth. We could bring more celebration, more street parties.' It sounded OK. But it was a disappointing climax to my initiation into the New Age - especially because - as it happens - we're having a street party already.</p>

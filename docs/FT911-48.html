			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Leading Article: A compromise path to Emu AFTER THE informal meeting of European Community finance ministers over the weekend, plans for the EC's expedition to Economic and Monetary Union are becoming clearer. Those plans may not be to everyone's liking; indeed, they are probably to nobody's liking. Nevertheless, they represent a sensible compromise. Participants will not be allowed to prevent others from starting out towards Emu, merely because they are unwilling to depart themselves; nor may they insist on going in the vanguard, however unfit for that position they might be; and even though countries may move at different speeds, each will do so under supervision. The goal will not be reached much before the end of the decade, while a European Central Bank is unlikely to be constructed before its attainment. Finally, the move towards Emu may require a new budgetary deal for the EC. One point now seems clear. The British will have to change their plans radically. This is not surprising, because they were absurd. The UK not merely told the other 11 that it was unwilling to go where they wanted, but intimated that the UK might veto the others' plans. Meanwhile, Britain insisted that the others should not set out without it, because this would leave it in the slower group within a 'two-speed' Europe. Further to enhance the UK's reputation as a team player, it recommended that they should go somewhere altogether different, towards the 'hard ecu'. Poor chances Since the UK's 'hard ecu' plan involves creating a new monetary institution, which the Germans abhor, and does not introduce a single currency, which the French (and others) desire, its political chances are close to zero. The economic merits of the plan are greater than that, but this matters little. The plan will have to be abandoned. It was always inconceivable that the UK would veto a treaty on which the others were determined, any more than it could prevent others from moving to Emu. The best it could hope for was a degree of influence upon the pace and nature of the move towards Emu, while not being forced into it itself. The likely compromise cannot resolve all of the UK's political problems. Acceptance of a treaty implies a commitment. Once it exists, the UK will find itself confronted with a choice between participation, on the one hand, and consignment to the slow group in a 'two-speed' Europe, on the other. The treaty will certainly call for increased surveillance of economic policy. It may imply greater fiscal transfers within the EC as well. Shared interest The need for parliament to ratify such a treaty is a recipe for trouble. But since that trouble will arise within the two big parties as much as between them, they share an interest in making as little as possible of one of the most important decisions the country will ever take. All this assumes that the other 11 can agree on the path to Emu. They can do so, provided that they accept the terms of the one country that does have a veto. The Germans will not accept the creation of a European Central Bank before the new currency is introduced, are most unlikely to tolerate a central bank not at least as independent as the Bundesbank and will not consent to participation by countries that have not achieved a high degree of convergence on the German standard. These conditions are likely to be accepted (or at least appear to be accepted). Difficulties would still remain. Convergence of inflation is desirable, for example, but central control over the fiscal policies of member states is not. How, then, will the EC deal with the problems created, not by Greece and Portugal (which are economically insignificant), but by Italy's huge public debt? What the path to Emu will not involve is still clearer than what it will, just as who will not be in the vanguard is more obvious than who will. For all that, there is progress. The shape of the agreement is emerging. It is one that will impose discomfort upon many - upon the UK above all, but not only upon the UK.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / TV satellite operator faces revolt by users Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg company that operates the Astra television satellite system, is facing a potential user revolt over managerial instability at the group. At stake could be as much as Pounds 1bn of business, as Europe's main satellite broadcasters plan to introduce digital satellite television channels over the next few years. Some users of Astra satellites were alarmed at what they saw as an attempted coup against Mr Pierre Meyrat, director-general of SES. Mr Meyrat is credited with creating one of the world's most successful satellite television companies. An attempt was made to remove him last month by a group of directors and shareholders including the two SES vice-chairmen, Mr Romain Bausch, chairman of the SNCI bank of Luxembourg, and Count Roland Kergorlay, a private investor. Mr Meyrat ultimately received widespread support at a board meeting last week. One Astra user said yesterday he would be wary about signing up for the vast investment needed to introduce digital channels if the SES director-general could be removed without warning. A number of users wrote to SES in support of Mr Meyrat, including British Sky Broadcasting and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, which has a 16.6 per cent stake in SES. Some are seeking assurances of managerial stability and are demanding to be kept better informed about the company. Unless assurances are received, at least one big Astra customer is prepared to go to Astra's rival Eutelsat, which is owned by Europe's telecommunications organisations, for its new digital business. SES operates three 16-channel television satellites and plans to launch a fourth in the autumn. The fifth and six satellites are scheduled to be dedicated to digital television and should be capable of broadcasting more than 150 channels across Europe.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Arts: Tancredi - Teatro Comunale, Bologna The Rossini bicentennial is only one of the occasions celebrating this year, along with anniversaries of Columbus, Piero della Francesca and Lorenzo de Medici; but Rossini seems to have got off to a flying start. Verona has just staged a much-praised Guglielmo Tell with Renato Bruson and Chris Merritt, and the Rome Opera opened its season with a televised, over-touted Barber of Seville produced by the film comic Carlo Verdone - a delightful actor and a successful film director (of his own vehicles) but a disappointment in the opera house (at least to judge by what was seen on TV), prone to gimmickry and sight gags and very short on real perception. Bologna, one of the cities most associated with the composer, has two of his operas in its current cartellone: Tancredi, in a production borrowed from the Pesaro Festival, and, later this spring, a new production of Cenerentola with Cecilia Bartoli. The Pesaro Tancredi, which Pizzi designed and staged several years ago, is handsome, colourful, yet sober in movement and restrained in invention. Avowedly inspired by the traditional Sicilian puppets, whose versions of Tasso and his heroes Tancredi, Roggiero, and company are a national treasure, the Pizzi staging avoids any hint of cuteness or send-up. Even the wooden horses mounted by the singers and propelled by supers seem to possess a natural gravity. The great vitrages, one in shades of blue, one in reds, that serve as backgrounds, allowing imaginative play of lights, gave the successive scenes the quality of illustrations - a reminder that Tancredi is, in a special sense, a literary opera, referring to a whole narrative tradition with which, ideally, the spectator is familiar. On another level, of course, the work can be enjoyed as a musical feast, a constant outpouring of orchestral vitality and vocal virtuosity. And, in Bologna, the singing was almost always a joy to hear, especially when Bernadette Manca di Nissa - the Tancredi - was on stage. Mezzosopranos in trouser-roles can sometimes be an embarrassment (one thinks of Marilyn Horne's cocky strut and over-plumed helmets, of Simionato's elevator-heel boots); but Manca di Nissa solved the gender problem simply by not acting like a prima donna. She walked, gestured - sparingly - and sang with conviction and spontaneity. Her emotions were always so patently sincere that she inspired only total acceptance. The voice itself is beautiful, warm, agile, but not plummy and never hooty. This singer is already familiar to followers of the Italian musical scene; now she seems to have moved into a new, even more exciting phase. As Amenaide, her beloved, Mariella Devia was vocally almost faultless, but the artist lacks personality, charm, pathos. When this production was first seen in Pesaro, the role was sung by Katia Ricciarelli, less secure musically perhaps, but a more credible, more vulnerable heroine. The tenor William Matteuzzi has an appealing voice and a graceful stage presence, but he does not really possess the necessary agility, and some of his coloratura sounded strained. The Orbazzano, Natale De Carolis, is a promising young basso; he did not have a great deal to do, but he did it more than competently. And, as usual in Bologna, the smaller roles were well-handled: Monica Bacelli was Isaura, and Barbara Briscik, Roggiero. The chorus was a bit dim at first, but then brightened up. The conductor, Gianluigi Gelmetti, is a Pesaro Festival regular, and a reliable artist. His Overture was well-judged, played not as a concert showpiece or, worse still, a star turn for band, but rather as an introduction to the whole work. He began as he intended to go on, without excesses. Here and there, in the course of the performance, he let the rhythm sag. But, all in all, his was a well-controlled, intelligently conceived reading. Rossini's birthday comes on February 29; but the leap year celebrations will continue long afterwards. La Scala will stage a new Donna del Lago, La Fenice will revive two of the Venetian operas: L'italiana in Algeri and Semiramide. A decade or so ago there would not have been enough singers capable of interpreting Rossini to cover all these productions; but, thanks partly to the popularity and the proselytizing work of Pesaro and the advances in scholarship, a whole generation of Rossini interpreters has grown up and, with them, an audience capable of appreciating them. Scholarship, however, has two faces. Not all discoveries have the same value. In 1974 some musicologists, including the super-Rossinian Philip Gossett, tracked down a 'tragic' ending of Tancredi, composed by Rossini shortly after the Venetian premiere (February 6 1813) which had the happy ending expected at the time, culminating in a chorus of joy. Naturally, the Pesaro Festival performed the newly-discovered pages, but - unwilling to sacrifice anything - the original happy ending was performed as well. So, after expiring, with a brief recitative - on stage, in a blackout, Tancredi rose again to life, slipped back into the wings, to emerge again, resuscitated, to share in the joyous finale. For a scholarly, festival production, this double-ending was permissible; but for a normal performance it is frankly a nuisance. The tragic ending loses impact, and the joyous ending seems diminished. Scholarship is a fine thing, but Rossini wrote for audiences, not for paleographers.</p>

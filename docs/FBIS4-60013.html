			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of  the Armed Forces, today visited the al-Sab'in Camp. He was  received by the camp's commander, officers, noncommissioned  officers, and soldiers. He addressed them, expressing his  happiness at meeting with them and reviewing the current  situation in our country at this critical stage in its history,  during which our Yemeni people and their Armed Forces--the  forces of unity and legitimacy--are waging a valiant struggle  for the sake of defending the homeland and preserving its unity  and the accomplishments of the revolution, for which they have  offered the dearest of sacrifices.    The brother president and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces said: This fighting, which was imposed on our people and  Armed Forces by the gang of apostasy and secession in the  Socialist Party leadership, has made it incumbent on the masses  of our people, headed by our Armed Forces--the forces of unity  and Constitutional legitimacy--to rise in defense of the dearest  of their national aims and confront the remnants of apostasy and  secession, who sold their consciences, and abandoned the values  of belonging to this homeland and their loyalty to its martyrs  who shed their blood for the sake of the unity of the  homeland--land and people.    The brother supreme commander of the Armed Forces praised  the  high morale of the officers, noncommissioned officers, and  soldiers of our Armed Forces--the forces of unity and  legitimacy. He greeted this high militant spirit and the  splendid combat performance as embodied by the heroes in the  arenas of national struggle in defense of the gains of the  Yemeni revolution and people.    In his speech, the brother president invoked mercy on the  souls of martyrs, who sacrificed their lives so the banner of  unity and Republic of Yemen will continue to fly as high as the  mountains of Yemen and as solid as the solidity of its blessed,  brave sons. He stressed that the state will look after the  families and children of martyrs and will extend to them all  good care and sound education. He stressed the importance of  maintaining discipline and vigilance and care for the people's  interests. He said officers, noncommissioned, and soldiers in  the battle should set an example to others with good conduct,  high discipline, and the sense of responsibility and the noble  mission they are performing for the sake of the people,  homeland, and unity.    Brother Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil, minister of  the interior, accompanied the brother chairman of the  Presidential Council.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The two dreadful days, the prospects of which  were causing alarm within the government, are finally upon us.  The government is taking measures to prevent a new crisis in  the market with the planned payment of 17 trillion Turkish lira  in civil servants' salaries tomorrow and 27 trillion for the  internal debt the next day.    But the civil servants, over whose salaries a political  storm  has broken out, fail to understand the governments' concern.  [passage omitted]    The news of the issuance of 44 trillion has already started  affecting the money markets. The dollar fell and interest rates  rose. Most important of all, the stock exchange, which had been  sliding for weeks, suddenly rebounded.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Today, investors were happy at  the Istanbul stock exchange where for the last three weeks every  100 Turkish lira invested lost 52 Turkish lira in value. The  index rose by 1,232 points and leveled at 15,096.    The hope that part of the 44 trillion to be injected into  the  market tomorrow will flow into the stock exchange has already  pushed prices up.    [Muslun Demirbilek, president of the stockbrokers  association] This atmosphere appears to be conducive for the  stock exchange to reestablish its balance. Therefore, our  advice to our investors is not to sell their valuable shares and  take a long-term view, as time is working to the advantage of  the stock market.    [Reporter] The banks also supported the idea of keeping  holdings in Turkish lira. IS Bank, TYT Bank, and Demirbank  increased their interest rates for savings accounts 2-6 percent.  The yearly interest rate rose to 105.5 percent. [end recording]    Each person is making his own calculations in these critical  days. On the one hand we have the dollar and on the other the  Turkish lira. Where will the money flow?    Measures have already been taken today to prevent the flow  of  money starting tomorrow from causing a new black Wednesday, as  happened two weeks ago. Interest rates rose and the value of  foreign currencies fell, and the Treasury and the Central Bank  have gone into action.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] The government fears the money  could be converted into foreign currency and then hidden under  the bed. The Treasury and the Central Bank will act together to  prevent such a thing, which might lead to devaluation of the  Turkish lira and then to inflation.    These two government institutions will use the weapon of  high  interest rates to absorb the 17 trillion in salaries and 27  trillion in internal debt.    The Central Bank will sell advance notes issued to it by the  Treasury to the banks and collect the money. The Treasury  itself will sell bonds at 125 to 130 percent interest to the  people. Thus, the demand for foreign currency, a phenomena  observed after each payment of salaries to the civil servants,  will be stopped. In short, the government will try to prevent a  new black Wednesday. [end recording]</p>

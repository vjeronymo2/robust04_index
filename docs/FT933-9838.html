			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / CSO changes statistical base THE CENTRAL Statistical Office announced yesterday that it was altering its volume, or constant price, series which are at present based on 1985. Index numbers in future will equal 100 in 1990 rather than in 1985 so series expressed at constant prices will have their levels changed. The CSO also said that it was changing the definition of manufacturing. It will now include coke ovens, mineral oil processing and nuclear fuel production. These industries were previously classified as energy industries.</p>

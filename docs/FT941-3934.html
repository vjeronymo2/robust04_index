			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial leases costly for UK retail businesses Sir, In the letter 'No foul play over rent reviews for commercial properties' (February 25), Mr William McKee referred to research undertaken by the British Property Federation which concluded that there is no evidence that the upwards-only rent review provision in commercial leases has exerted inflationary pressures on occupational rents. This is misleading and contrary to our own research, which employed a similar methodology, but was tailored specifically to the retail property market: The retail rental value index has been at a higher level than the index of 'high street' retail price inflation (measured using the retail sales deflator) in just under half of the last 22 years. This upward inflationary pressure in the retail property market has not been compensated for by downward pressure during periods of relatively low inflation, for example the late 1970s and early 1980s. The rapid rise in retail rents during the late 1980s more than covered the lower rental growth (relative to price inflation) during the period 1975-1986. On average, retailers in the last 22 years would be paying 9 per cent more rent under a conventional lease with UORR, compared with the rent which would be payable under a regime of annual inflation-indexed (ie linked to retail sales inflation) leases. For leases agreed during the period 1975-1987, this proportion rises to 20 per cent, peaking at 26 per cent in 1977. In summary, our evidence indicates that the structure of the institutional lease has resulted in the majority of retail businesses in the UK paying more rent than they can afford to cover through price inflation. With the prospect of a low inflation decade, this is likely to inhibit expansion by retailers which, in turn, could impact on a national economy placing reliance on consumer expenditure to lead the recovery. There is, however, one important area where our views depart from those of Mr V A G Tregear (Letters: 'Outlaw upwards-only provisions on commercial rents', February 9). In common with the BPF, the Boots Group, in its response to the government's consultation paper on the commercial lease structure, has argued for non-intervention. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that the property market must face up to its own inherent inefficiencies and work towards achieving greater flexibility, as any market should.

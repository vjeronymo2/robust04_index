			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / John Birt paid wife two company salaries MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, paid his wife a total of Pounds 29,000 in 1991 as both a director of his private company John Birt Productions and as a secretarial assistant. The accounts for John Birt Productions for 1991 make it clear that Mrs Jane Birt was paid Pounds 14,000 as a director. In addition there was an expense of Pounds 15,000 for an unnamed secretarial assistant. The revelation that the secretary was his wife will intensify controversy because of the possibility that more of Mr Birt's earnings from the BBC were taxed at basic rate instead of a higher rate. Last week Mr Birt joined the staff of the corporation - six years after his first appointment as deputy director-general in 1987 - following revelations that for all of that time he had been a freelance consultant to the BBC paid through John Birt Productions. On Tuesday in a prelude to a conference on the future of the BBC Mr Birt was asked by Mr Jeremy Isaacs in an interview on stage at the National Film Theatre to name the secretarial assistant. Mr Isaacs is general director of the Royal Opera House and a former chief executive of Channel 4. Mr Birt declined to name the secretarial assistant. He told Mr Isaacs: 'It seems to me I did satisfy the concern that this arrangement (having his BBC salary paid through a private company) had been a way of me enjoying a significant tax advantage. It is not right that I have to reveal every detail of my personal matters. I don't intend to.' On Monday Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, said that being paid through his private company had saved Mr Birt Pounds 3,935 in tax in 1991. After accountancy and administration charges, Ernst &amp; Young said, the net benefit for the Birt household was Pounds 810. It is clear that Ernst &amp; Young had full access to every detail of the 1991 accounts of John Birt Productions but they would not discuss them. John Birt Productions would have deducted tax on both of Mrs Birt's salaries. Mrs Birt's top tax rate is not known. The chairman and vice chairman of the BBC board of governors were criticised yesterday by Sir David Attenborough, the broadcaster and former BBC 1 controller, at a London conference. They should be 'monitors not managers' he said. Later Sir David said the John Birt contract with the BBC was an error and one made by the chairman and the vice-chairman. The BBC declined to comment last night other than to say that Mr Birt had made it clear he would not reveal every personal detail on the matter.</p>

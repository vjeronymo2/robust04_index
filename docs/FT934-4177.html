			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: What's good for the goose . . . - First of two articles by Philippa Davenport on the gastronomic pleasures of a good foie gras I can live without caviar. Black truffles leave me cold. Foie gras is what I want for Christmas. Foie gras is to the French what smoked salmon is to the British, celebratory food every family aspires to on special occasions. While some of us may feel slightly uncomfortable at the thought of le gavage, the French are unperturbed. With a Gallic shrug of the shoulders they remind you that geese in the wild fatten themselves up naturally, gorging as much as they can prior to migration. French foie gras producers may also point out that their birds enjoy far longer and freer lives than those of the chickens which the average Englishman eats. (The British broiler is tightly confined for its 49-day sentence of life. French ducks and geese destined for foie gras and confits range freely for four to five months before the four- to five-week intensive fattening process begins). Arguments have always raged, and probably always will, about whether duck or goose makes the best foie gras. Goose is rarer now as it is more trouble to raise and feed, but its devotees rejoice in its richer and smoother texture, silky on the tongue. Duck, on the other hand, is prized for its deeper, winey, almost gamey flavour. What the French and the British mean when they talk of feasting on foie gras is not necessarily the same thing. French households may be thinking in terms of foie gras cru, fresh and raw. Failing that, they will probably opt for mi-cuit or demi-conserve. In the UK, most people know only the preserved product, cooked at length and sterilised in tins or jars, and many will never have tasted anything more luxurious than a duck or goose liver pate or parfait. Pate and parfait are the bottom rungs of the ladder of foie gras delights, permitted legally to contain as little as 50 per cent and 75 per cent of foie gras, respectively. To get 100 per cent pure foie gras, you need to look for certain wording on the label. Top of the range and most expensive is foie gras entier: whole lobes or a large piece of lobe, with small pieces permitted only to make up weight if necessary. Then comes foie gras d'oie and fois gras de canard. This consists of pieces of liver pressed together. Finally, 100 per cent foie gras is also available as bloc de foie gras. This is considerably cheaper, a loaf of smoothly blended foie gras trimmings, usually with chunks of liver embedded in it. When preserved foie gras is produced skilfully, it can be memorably good, velvety rich in texture and delicately flavoured. It also has the advantage of long shelf life. It can be kept safely for a year or more in a larder, ready to draw on whenever the desire to celebrate occurs. Traditional stockists in Britain include classy old-fashioned grocers such as Fortnum &amp; Mason in central London. Now, Fortnum has been joined by specialist mail order companies such as Clark Trading (tel. 081-297 9937 fax. 081-297 9993), which imports respected brand names such as Auguste Cyprien, of Perigord. Home deliveries are despatched promptly for all manner of preserved duck and goose products, from foie gras to cassoulet. More delicate than preserved foie gras is mi-cuit or demi-conserve. Mi-cuit here does not mean half-cooked in the sense that more cooking is necessary before serving. It means cooked and pasteurised for eating quickly. The downside of mi-cuit foie gras is that it keeps for about three weeks only and must be kept refrigerated, but discerning palates wax lyrical about its tenderness, succulence and fresher taste. Elizabeth Rostaing (081-788-6908), who operates a year-round mail order service for preserved foie gras and other duck and goose products from Landes, supplements her list with mi-cuit foie gras entier and en bloc at Christmas only. The mi-cuit is, alas, too perishable to send countrywide; but orders can be collected from her, or she will deliver to London addresses. Mi-cuit and preserved foie gras are served the same way. Chill the liver for a few hours, then turn it out of its container complete with surrounding fat. The fat can be served with the liver or saved for frying potatoes. Slice the foie gras cleanly using a hot, sharp knife dipped in boiling water and dried before making each cut. Then serve with toasted brioche or plain toast, with or without a little salad - say, endive or chicory scattered with thin, sliced, raw mushrooms dressed with walnut oil. The greatest treat of all is fresh foie gras. Raw fattened goose and duck livers are not easy to buy in Britain but you might find them at such places as Boucherie Lamartine in Ebury Street, London SW1 (071-730-3037); the delicatessen counter of Selfridges in Oxford Street, London W1 (071-493-0568); or you can order from Vivian's in Richmond, Surrey (081-940-3600). Fresh foie gras is far from cheap, but Father Christmasses who might have contemplated giving diamonds a few years ago will consider it a bargain at about Pounds 45 for a 2lb liver. As for the cooking, Sidney Smith's idea of heaven was pate de foie gras (that is to say, foie gras enclosed in pastry and baked) eaten to the sound of trumpets, a feast he enjoyed at a dinner in Brussels. More often today, foie gras is cooked en terrine, baked gently and minimally in a bain-marie. This is, I am told, a tricky operation, for foie gras is a very delicate piece of meat which is destroyed easily by over-cooking. Too much heat and it melts away - literally. Also popular now is steaming and poaching foie gras in rich stock. Simplest, quickest and possibly most delicious is to saute foie gras. Slice the liver and season it with salt and pepper. (Alsatians would add a few spices, Gascons a splash of armagnac). Saute it swiftly (it barely needs to glance at the heat) and garnish it with quickly fried apples, gently warmed grapes, or a sprinkling of capers and chives. The meat should be meltingly tender and rich, dissolving deliciously on the tongue.</p>

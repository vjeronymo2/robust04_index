			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> What a wonderful surprise "Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again" was.  Christopher Rich as Archie was an absolute delight -- the perfect incarnation  of red-haired, freckle-faced ingenuousness.  </P> <P> As a fan of Archie comics for over 20 years, I found the entire production  impeccably cast and well-written, faithfully capturing all the charm and humor  of the comic books.  </P> <P> Susan E.

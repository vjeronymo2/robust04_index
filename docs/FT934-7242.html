			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec 12.5% ahead HYDRO-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest power utilities, posted a profit of CDollars 386m (USDollars 292m) for the first nine months of 1993, up 12.5 per cent on a year earlier. Revenues from power sales rose 3.1 per cent to Dollars 5.08bn, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Demand in Quebec was helped by the start-up of two new aluminium smelters, cost-reduction programmes and by savings derived from the replenishment of reservoirs during 1992.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BACH'S 'ST. JOHN' PASSION BY OCC SINGERS  </P> <P> There were many fine things about Saturday's performance of Bach's "Passion  According to St. John" at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, but the one that  remains indelibly etched in memory is tenor Thomas Randle's profoundly moving  performance in the role of Evangelist.  </P> <P> It is the Evangelist who must deliver nearly all of the narrative portion of  the text. With the kind of conviction and persuasiveness that make the title  evangelist wholly appropriate, Randle brought vivid drama and poignancy to the  familiar story. His words rang out with clarity and his pronunciation of German  was faultless. He exhibited sure technique and intelligent phrasing. And he  sang with warmth and resonance in every register.  </P> <P> Bass Hector Vasquez, in the role of Jesus and in the bass arias, brought  commanding authority and textual clarity to his singing, showing vocal agility  and depth of expression. Mary Rawcliffe brought well-controlled vocalism and a  sweet, limpid sound to the soprano arias. Mezzo Candice Burrows maintained a  dulcet, angelic tone throughout her range, though she had difficulty projecting  over the instrumentalists.  </P> <P> Less successful was bass John Ross, who sang the role of Pilate with stolid  detachment. The minor roles, delegated to choristers, were delivered weakly.  </P> <P> Under the precise leadership of conductor Richard Raub, the Orange Coast  Chorale and Orange Coast Singers proved a well-disciplined, balanced ensemble.  With rhythmic bite and driving energy, the singers depicted a frighteningly  angry mob. In the chorales, Raub elicited a unified, balanced sound and telling  contrasts.  </P> <P> Nearly all of the time, the orchestra proved exceptionally alert.  </P> <P> In two of the arias, a pair of muted violins substituted for the violas d'amore  indicated in Bach's score. In another aria, Edward Willett's very sensitive  cello playing substituted for the viola da gamba.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] An agreement was reached at the coordinating session  between the retirement administration and the parliamentary  groups of the parties to the effect that after 1 January 1995  women can still retire at 55; this proposal will be submitted to  the National Assembly. At the same time, work must begin on  raising the retirement age, on flexible retirement, and on  incentives to work longer.    The coordinating session, which was initiated by the  retirement administration based on a resolution of the latest  general assembly, was attended by six of the parliamentary  groups, including representatives of the Hungarian Socialist  Party, the Association of Young Democrats, the independents, the  Hungarian Democratic Forum, and the Christian Democratic  People's Party. The attending representatives agreed that the  prerequisites for raising the retirement age by 1 January 1995  have not been met. For this reason the retirement administration  proposed to postpone raising the retirement age, to detach it  from the package of amendments to the social insurance law, and  to treat it as a separate package.    According to Social Committee Chairman Gyula Kis, who also  represented the position of the Welfare Ministry, women who have  been employed for at least 20 years and who will turn 55 between  1 January 1995 and the time when the law on increasing the  retirement age becomes effective should be able to retire  without limitation, but their employers should not be able to  send them into retirement merely because they reached the  retirement age. A motion to this effect was submitted to  parliament already, requesting urgent discussion of the matter.  Work continues on the rest of the package.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEANUT BUTTER'S POPULARITY SPREADING ACROSS THE U.S.  </P> <P> I was so happy to read your article about the spreading popularity of peanut  butter ("Peanut Butter Obsession Spreading Across Country," by David Treadwell,  Part I, May 30). Now that it is no longer considered kid stuff, millions of  adult peanut butter fanatics like myself can finally come out of the closet and  reclaim this wholesome and delicious stuff for ourselves.  </P> <P> We will know we have made it to the big time when the supermarkets decide to  take peanut butter out of the potato chip aisle, and instead stock it on the  shelf next to the oat bran!  </P> <P> KATHLEEN HERRON REINERT  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

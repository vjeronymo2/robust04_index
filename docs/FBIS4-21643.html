			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by K.S. Jayraman] </F>   [Text] The reports that Japan's fast-breeder reactor is  expected to go critical should be good news to India's nuclear  scientists. India and Japan appear to be the only two countries  pursuing the breeder technology in today's world that has become  hostile to this new source of electric power. The hostility  stems from two reasons.    One is the safety consideration, because of the complex  technology involved in breeder reactors. It is for this reason  that France, which pioneered the breeder technology, decided to  shut down its 1,200-megawatt fast-breeder reactor.    To appreciate the second reason, one must know what a  breeder  is. The fast-breeder reactor has a core made of plutonium fuel  surrounded by a blanket of natural uranium. During the chain  reaction, more plutonium is created in the blanket than what is  consumed in the core, and hence the name breeder. One simply  has to remove the blanket, extract the plutonium, and build  another breeder with it or use the plutonium to build a bomb.    It is this possibility of nuclear proliferation that is at  the heart of the American campaign against plutonium. In the  United States spent nuclear fuel is not reprocessed to recover  plutonium, and Washington does not want any other nation to  produce plutonium, even for power generation, because of its  fear that it can be diverted for bombs.    Interest in fast-breeders declined for yet another reason.  In the 1970's it was anticipated that a spread of conventional  reactors would lead to a shortage of uranium and make plutonium  the fuel of choice. But this did not happen. Japan relies  almost totally on the outside world for energy. It sees  fast-breeder technology is a promising route to reduce this  dependence. Japan's prototype fast- breeder reactor Monju will  produce 280 megawatts when it begins full operation next year.    India's compulsion to go into fast-breeder technology is  dictated by the fact that while its uranium resources are  limited, it has large deposits of thorium, which can be turned  into a nuclear fuel. In order to efficiently make this  conversion, India has to build fast-breeder reactors with cores  made of plutonium and blankets out of thorium. India's  fast-breeder test reactor at Kalpakkam, near Madras, is about 10  years old, but its power level is nowhere near the designed 40  megwatt. It has succeeded in convincing Indian scientists that  the technology is difficult to master but not impossible to  learn.    India no doubt is way behind Japan in harnessing this power  source, but its consolation is that it is not alone in pursuing  this technology. Whether India will be able to commit enough  resources to pursue its goal like Japan is, however, a big  question mark.</p>

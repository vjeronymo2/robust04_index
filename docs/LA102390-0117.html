			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PRAZAK QUARTET OPENS COLEMAN SEASON  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia, which must produce more quartets per capita than any nation on  Earth, provided yet another highly proficient group, the Prazak Quartet, for  the season opener of the Coleman Chamber Concerts at Caltech's Beckman  Auditorium on Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> For their local debut, the Prazaks (the name means, simply, Prague residents)  -- violinists Vaclav Remes and Vlastimil Holek, violist Josef Kluson, cellist  Michael Kanka -- presented a Czech program skillfully, if with more restraint  than might be expected from ensembles of similar provenance.  </P> <P> A half-dozen of Dvorak's "Cypresses," exquisitely soothing lyric miniatures,  opened the program in unhackneyed, inviting fashion.  </P> <P> For the less familiar of Janacek's two quartets, the work in E minor inspired  by Tolstoy's novella "The Kreutzer Sonata," the Prazaks added appropriate sonic  weight and tension. But their interpretation contrasted sharply with the heady  style to which some of their Czech predecessors have accustomed us.  </P> <P> If some of the Janacek theatricality was in abeyance on this occasion, the  result nevertheless remained engrossing, with the bonus of a structural clarity  denied to us in more heated interpretations.  </P> <P> In Smetana's E-minor Quartet ("From My Life") the Prazak again refused to be  passion's slaves, offering playing of unusual lightness, clarity and technical  refinement -- at the expense, however, of the gutsiness of Smetana's stomping  peasant dances.  </P> <P> A single encore, the Minuet from Haydn's D-major Quartet, Opus 20, executed  with stylish brilliance, served to remind us of the failure of quartets  visiting this area to program Haydn, and how much the poorer we are for his  absence.

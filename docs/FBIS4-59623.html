			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, member of </F> the National Authority, by Itay Engel; place not given -- live,  in English]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Engel] Dr. al-Agha, can we  ask you to relate to the statement of Chairman 'Arafat in  Johannesburg? The person who is in charge of the Palestinian  side in this peace agreement talks about the need for the  continuation of the jihad against the State of Israel.    [Al-Agha] I think when we started this peace process, we  started the negotiations. Indeed, I am astonished about what is  said in the broadcast about this, and indeed I didn't hear this  statement. I have no official thought about this, so I would  have to ask my chairman to understand what happened about this.    [Engel] I see. And if he says to you that indeed, he said  and talked about the idea of the jihad, so you are going to  implement now the idea of jihad, or you are going to continue  with the peace process?    [Al-Agha] No, no, maybe the head means not only the armed  struggle, but also any other means, like negotiations, like  other. I don't think -- I am sure that Mr. 'Arafat doesn't mean  what happened.</p>

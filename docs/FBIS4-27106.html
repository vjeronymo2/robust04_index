			<p>BFN     [Text] This is news that has just come in. Today about  50,000 college students staged fierce antigovernment and  anti-U.S. rallies and marches in Kwangju. They demanded the  punishment of former rulers who carried out bloodshed oppression  of Kwangju uprisers who demanded democracy in 1980.    Keeping in mind Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, former presidents  from the military, the students shouted, "These rascals must be  punished." The students pursued a judicial step against these  two former presidents over the responsibility of massacring at  least 200 people while repressing the Kwangju uprising.    The protesters condemned the United States for having played  a certain role in this repression, and stressed that Washington  approved this tacitly. Although the United States denied this,  protests regarding the Kwangju uprising always had a deep  anti-U.S. nature.    The students hung a large U.S. flag this morning, and burned  it by shooting a blazing arrow. The police said that they will  block the students' march at a point 100 meters away from the  U.S. Cultural Center.    Although there was no immediate report on clashes in today's  rally, the atmosphere in the venue of the rally was grave  [homak].    Some students were carrying iron pipes and fire bottles.  Police did not appear in the site as if not to irritate the  feeling of the participants in the rally.    The rally in Kwangju was held on the second day of the  annual  meeting of the student organization embracing students  throughout South Korea.    On 28 May, about 30,000 students held a peaceful rally in  the  playground of Choson University in Kwangju. Approximately  15,000 policemen were deployed in town. But they watched the  rally from a distant place.    In addition to their appeal for judicial steps against Chon  Tu- hwan and No Tae-u, the students are opposed to the opening  of South Korean rice markets. They are also demanding the  withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula.    The students asserted that the agreement on opening of South  Korean rice markets was made by the U.S. pressure.</p>

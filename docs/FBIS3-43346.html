			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Abbey Makoe] </F>   [Text] Three alleged MK [Spear of the Nation, ANC military  wing] commanders were shot and burnt to death by their  colleagues serving in self-defence units [SDU] in Katlehong on  Sunday in what is believed to be an ongoing "war" between the  two groups, residents said. The three, all MK commanders based  in Ncala Section, were executed while visiting the family of  slain "Commander Boja," whose body was found at the mortuary  earlier on the same day, witnesses said. Boja had disappeared  on New Year's Eve. The last time he was seen was in the company  of the three "commanders," a neighbour said.    A resident, who was part of a group that marched on the  SDU's  office in Mavimbela Section yesterday to protest against the  clashes, was shot dead. Police confirmed the incident. Police  said yesterday the death toll in Katlehong since New Year's Day  stood at 16. Residents said hostilities between the SDUs and  foreign-trained MK members based in Mavimbela and Ncala sections  peaked on Sunday afternoon. The two sides, despite having  fought heavily side by side in their "war" with members of the  Inkatha Freedom Party, reportedly converged on their boundary --  Motaung Street -- and fired at each other. "They fought from  11AM until 6PM, when members of the Internal Stability Unit came  with reinforcements," a witness said.    Concerned residents spoke of kangaroo courts, in which  suspects were tried and sentenced, even in their absence. Boja  is alleged to have been killed by fellow commanders after he  called for self-discipline. Most residents were concerned that  the "war" was largely seen as ANC [African National Congress]  against ANC in that the SDUs in both sections were run by MK  commanders. But MK PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  regional chief of staff Mr. Viva Mkhonto yesterday said claims  of MK soldiers leading the SDUs were not true.    He said while MK members were part of the communities, they  did not necessarily control the controversial township  neighbourhood watch groups. Senior MK officers had by yesterday  not gone to investigate the claims, which he said he knew about  only from rumour. "We cannot act on information that is not  verified by our commanders," Mkhonto said.</p>

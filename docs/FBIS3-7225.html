In response, Japanese  automakers and other manufacturers are perplexed at the U.S.  request.    "In the past, Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor  Company announced their plans to increase the share of  foreign-made semiconductors in their purchase of semiconductors  to 20 percent by 1993. In fact, however, this year's share of  foreign-made semiconductors in the purchase of semiconductors by  the entire Japanese automobile sector is expected to fall to 8  percent" (according to an official concerned at the  Semiconductor Industry Association). This prospect is believed  to have prompted the U.S. side to make the request at the  Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks.    The Japanese automakers are taking a different view,  however.  They are rebuffing the U.S. request, claiming that "the share of  foreign-made semiconductors in our purchase of chips is supposed  to have already reached 20 percent" (says a senior official of  Toyota Motor Corporation).    Motorola, Texas Instruments, and other American chip makers  have admitted that the purchase of foreign microchips by the  Japanese automakers has been steadily increasing.    Game machine makers are responding the same way. The share  of  foreign chips in Nintendo Company's purchase of semiconductors  in 1993 was 21.3 percent and the share of foreign semiconductors  in the total purchase of chips by Sega Enterprises is said to be  hovering around 16-23 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group  made "a sweeping search" of the South Korean Federation of  General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) and launched a wholesale  arrest of core leaders on charges of "open pro-North,  pro-communist tendencies" and "violation of the National  Security Law."    Papers here today brand it as a premeditated fascist  offensive to suppress and strangle Hanchongnyon, the patriotic  vanguard organisation of the South Korean students.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    The fascist clique is brandishing the sword at Hanchongnyon,  labeling it as a "pro-communist, enemy-benefiting organisation".  But this is an illegal fascist action which can never be  justified.    The criminal Kim Yong-sam group's suppression of the  righteous- minded students who did praise-worthy things for the  nation is a violence of fascist hooligans who have lost the last  shred of national conscience and human reason.    It is an unjustifiable anti-national crime for the puppets  to  invoke the "National Security Law" against South Korean students  for the mere reason that they refuse obedience to the  reactionary rule and advocate patriotism and justice.    It is crystal clear that "democracy" and "civilian politics"  advertised by the Kim Yong-sam group is a camouflage to conceal  its true color as civilian fascists and the group is seeking a  way out in crackdown on the just struggle of the students and  people.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says:    The Kim Yong-sam group must scrap the anti-democratic, anti-  reunification "National Security Law" and immediately stop the  suppression of Hanchongnyon and students.</p>

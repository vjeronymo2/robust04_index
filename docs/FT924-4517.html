			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Scrapyard no longer end of the road for cars: How BMW's recycling plant is opening in the face of uncertainty from the EC BMW AND a vehicle salvage company specialising in the German executive cars yesterday jointly opened the UK's first dedicated car dismantling and recycling plant. The plant is relatively small - it has a capacity of 2,500 cars a year  - but BMW says it is the most advanced in the world and is a potential model for the car and materials reclamation industries to undertake systematic recycling of the 14m cars scrapped annually in Europe. The plant at Bolney, West Sussex is intended to be the first of a network of about 15 that BMW wants to develop in the UK with a number of partners. Before the end of the decade it should be processing most of the 16,000 BMWs scrapped in the UK annually. A second plant is to open next year and a further five in 1994. The plant is opening when the obstacles faced by European legislators and carmakers in seeking a harmonised approach to recycling are becoming increasingly apparent. Rover Group is the only UK-based manufacturer to have announced a full recycling research programme in Britain. It is co-operating with Bird Group, one of Europe's largest materials reclamation and recycling concerns, on dismantling and recycling trials at Bird's headquarters near Stratford-upon-Avon. They expect a demonstration facility to be operating next year. Like Fiat of Italy, however, Rover believes efficient plants will need to be much larger than the BMW-style ones and to be capable of dismantling all makes of vehicle if satisfactory economies of scale are to be achieved. Volkswagen, Mercedes, Fiat and some other European manufacturers have set up or are preparing recycling ventures on the Continent in the expectation of EC-wide legislation governing car scrapping and recycling by 1995. Fiat this week emphasised its unease at what it sees as the haphazard manner vehicle recycling is advancing in the absence of a clear lead from Brussels. Mr Paulo Cantarella, chief executive of Fiat Auto, said some recycling initiatives 'could produce systems that are both costly and inefficient since they are based on insignificant volumes'. Such criticism was rejected yesterday by BMW executives and Bolney Motors, BMW's partner in the venture. They see it and subsequent facilities as offering a practical means of tackling vehicle disposal. For parts and materials reclamation partners such as Bolney Motors, it is seen as a significant commercial opportunity. EC legislation is expected to require disposal certificates for every car produced to ensure that they end their lives only at an authorised dismantling and recycling centre. There is now little regulation of the way vehicles are scrapped, with only 50 per cent finding their way to authorised scrapyards. The Bolney plant will help take the industry closer to its target of being able to recycle nearly 100 per cent of each car, unlike the average of about 75 per cent now and the 82 per cent BMW claims for its latest 3-Series, largely as a result of greater use of plastics which can be easily recycled. Cars arriving for disposal are hoisted aloft in a purpose-built bay where fluids are drained and the battery removed. From there, they undergo a progressive dismantling process. Parts and materials that cannot be sold through Bolney Motors' normal used-parts sales channels are sent to specialised companies for recycling. Since last year, BMW (GB) has been sending used or damaged plastic bumpers and catalytic convertors back to Germany for recycling. Following traditional trading patterns, many engines and transmissions are remanufactured for re-supply through BMW's dealer networks. The stripped body shell is cut up for delivery to a conventional shredder facility prior to recycling. Dismantling takes between two and seven hours, representing a Pounds 40-Pounds 140 cost in time alone. With transport and investment costs added, BMW is assuming an average disposal cost per car of Pounds 175. Thus while EC legislation is expected to place the onus on manufacturers to ensure that vehicles are effectively disposed of, the industry is arguing that owners should share the responsibility because the worst-kept cars could have a negative value. That might mean a car's final owner paying for disposal, according to Dr Wolf.</p>

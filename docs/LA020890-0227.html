			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> PATTI DAVIS' MARRIAGE ON ROCKS  </P> <P> Patti Davis, Ronald and Nancy Reagan's estranged daughter, is now estranged  from her husband, it was reported today.  </P> <P> Davis, 37, has been living apart from yoga instructor Paul Grilley, whom she  married Aug. 14, 1984, for about a month, the New York Daily News said. "They  are divorcing," a friend of Davis told the newspaper. Davis' acting career  failed to take off, and she turned to writing novels -- first with "Home  Front," an unflattering parallel of her family, and then "Deadfall," a thriller  about Nicaraguan policy. Neither pleased her parents, according to reports.  </P></p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Exchanges in turmoil WORDS ARE cheap. Deeds may yet be required, however much Mr Lamont may hope that yesterday's words will prove a substitute. If so, the chancellor is entitled to curse his luck, for the pound is not weak. Its trade-weighted effective exchange rate is higher than during the second half of 1991 and early 1992. The pound is stronger against the dollar than at any time since February 1991. Before that it had not been close to Dollars 2 since 1981. The pound is also stronger against the Japanese yen than at any time since March 1991. Only against the D-Mark is the pound weak. This problem is shared by many, both outside the ERM and within it. The difficulty for the latter is that they may have to do something about it. In the UK's case, yesterday's London close of DM2.797 was less than two pfennigs above sterling's ERM floor. But pity the Italians, who are at their floor already. Will the chancellor's luck change? If this is a crisis at all, it is one between the dollar and the D-Mark. The question then is whether anything effective might be done about the soaring D-Mark and the collapsing dollar. The chances of effective intervention still seem remote. Recent intervention has had little effect, because many investors doubt whether the authorities have had their hearts in it. They doubt, in particular, whether the monetary authorities of the big three economies would allow intervention to override their domestic monetary objectives. History suggests two sufficient conditions for whole-hearted intervention by a major country: that there appears to be no significant conflict between exchange rate policy and other central domestic goals or that the benefits of exchange rate stabilisation outweigh the costs to other domestic goals. Neither condition has yet been fulfilled. Could things change? They just might. The US authorities do not want dearer money, but they will also want neither the dollar in free fall nor an impotent G7. The Bundesbank may be happy about the disinflationary implications of a strong D-Mark. It may be happy as well about the dwindling likelihood of European economic and monetary union. But it will not wish to be blamed for sabotaging either the future of the European Community or the credibility of the G7. What if sterling slides to its floor, intervention notwithstanding? Mr Lamont could then remind his European partners, including the Bundesbank, that ERM intervention is an obligation upon all. If intervention were to prove unsuccessful, it is also hardly evident that British policy is out of line with realities. Many will agree that the problem lies with Germany. The Bundesbank will do so too. But instead of lowering interest rates, it may well suggest a D-Mark revaluation - which would be unacceptable to many, especially the French. If neither the G7 nor the currency markets come to the rescue, Mr Lamont may yet have to make good on yesterday's words.</p>

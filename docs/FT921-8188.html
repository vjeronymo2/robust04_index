			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Deprivation blamed for rise in crime THE Metropolitan Police yesterday identified 'social and economic malaise' as a factor in record crime rates in London. Commander David Stevens, presenting the capital's crime trends for last year, said the figures had to be viewed against the background of the recession. A 26 per cent increase in street crime last year had occurred largely in areas of social deprivation. The pre-election atmosphere, said Commander Stevens, was an opportune one for the community to influence policing. Crime-prevention initiatives must be introduced by all responsible members of society, he said. Recorded crime in London rose by 11 per cent to a record 926,200 offences last year, and national figures are expected to show a similar trend. The link between social deprivation and crime is not one that appeals to ministers, who denied that deprivation caused recent Tyneside riots. Mr Roy Hattersley, shadow home secretary, said the figures highlighted the government's failure to tackle the causes of crime rather than its symptoms. Mr Robert MacLennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said that it was not enough for the government simply to pay lip service to crime prevention, which must form the core of a strategy for tackling crime.</p>

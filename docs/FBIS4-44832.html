			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Science Research on the Verge of </F> Collapse"]    [Text] One of the most important victims of transition is  the scientific research funded from non-budgeted sources. This  victimized research--mostly technological--is done in about 80  percent of all the science institutes, which are supposed to  survive by covering half of the expenses out of their own  resources (contracts, microproduction, etc), while the other  half from a special fund, representing 1 percent of the economic  units' production.    In many cases, because of the financial blockage, these  institutes are so poorly funded that they can no longer satisfy  their obligations. In 1993, only 50 percent of the special fund  could be collected. For instance, SIDEX Galati presently owes  over 4 billion lei, which the company serenely admits it can't  pay. The fines, recently doubled, no longer have any effect. As  a consequence, the Ministry of Research and Technology  administering the fund started 1994 with 80 billion lei of  unpaid bills (arrears). In the attempt to liquidate them, during  the first trimester of the current year, the ministry has been  thus unable to provide practically any kind of financial support  to research organizations in their charge. So the situation of  the latter became dramatic. Many institutes had to resort to  loans of ruinous interest in order to cover, more or less, the  payment of salaries. A new wave of dismissals looms on the  horizon, especially for the specialists. Some institutes might  even have to go as far as to interrupt their activities  altogether. The severe, long-term consequences of these  developments can be easily comprehended.    During a recent meeting with the press, Dr. Eng. Dumitru  Doru  Palade, the minister of research and technology, has  categorically denied rumors that this special fund intended for  supporting scientific research will be terminated. According to  him, new financing sources for this vitally important activity  for the nation are assiduously being sought. This situation  could be improved by terminating the financing of geological  prospecting, which is supported by the same fund and is also in  arrears.</p>

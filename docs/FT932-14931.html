			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Engineering recovery 'threatened' A FRAGILE recovery in UK engineering output is being threatened by deepening recession in vital European export markets, according to the Engineering Employers' Federation. The federation said yesterday in its latest economic trends report that all the main engineering sectors, except aerospace equipment and metal goods, could expect higher sales over the months ahead. Forecast engineering sales for 1993 of Pounds 130bn represent a modest improvement over the 1992 total of Pounds 128bn and will only restore industry sales to the level achieved in 1980. Total engineering output by the first half of 1994 is expected to be 3 per cent up on the level recorded in the second half of last year, with electronics and components for the motor vehicle industry showing most growth. In spite of a calculation by the federation of a 7 per cent improvement in the cost competitiveness of UK manufactured goods over the last four years, it forecasts a continuing imbalance between engineering exports and imports. While exports in the next 18 months are expected to rise 5 per cent, imports are forecast to increase 10 per cent. It also warned there will be no significant recovery in engineering activity until EC markets - which account for 55 per cent of UK engineering exports - also improve. Mr Neil Johnson, federation director-general, predicted a 'very slow and difficult recovery'. He said EC customers were of critical importance and that the weakness of European markets was restricting the scope for an export-led UK recovery. He warned that the continuing political upheaval over the future shape of European development was 'becoming dangerous and damaging to UK interests'. Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty, he added, would have serious consequences for the engineering industry, just as it began to detect signs of growth. Unemployment in the engineering industries represents another continuing blackspot. According to federation estimates, the average level of engineering employment in the first half of 1993 is about 1.7m, compared with just over 2m at the start of 1990. Employment is expected to fall another 45,000 over the next 12 months. The federation also points to continuing under-investment in the engineering sector, with investment levels forecast to be lower at the end of 1994 than in 1989. Engineering Economic Trends.

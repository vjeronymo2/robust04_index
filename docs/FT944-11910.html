			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (1): Consume less, borrow less - This year's economic crisis may have shaken politicians out of their complacency and crystallised public opinion in favour of free-market reform This has been a dreadful year for business in Turkey. In March, financial markets collapsed, the Turkish lira lost over half its value and inflation topped 100 per cent. For a few tense days, the entire economy ground to a halt. Shops emptied, factories stopped working. On one spring weekend, just one car was sold in the whole of Turkey. After averaging 6 per cent growth since 1990, the economy is now contracting by 4 per cent. Yet many executives believe this severe crisis may finally have shaken politicians out of their complacency and crystallised public opinion in favour of free-market reforms. Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister since June 1993, bears great responsibility for the mess, for allowing a consumer binge and speculative bubble to run out of control. The result has been: a 1993 budget deficit of 18 per cent of GNP and a current account deficit six times larger than the year before. Confidence evaporated in January when Wall Street rating agencies marked Turkey's debt below investment grade, the central bank governor resigned and capital flooded out of the country. By March, Turkey was facing financial meltdown. Mrs Ciller adopted a stringent stabilisation package in April to deal with the immediate crisis. The International Monetary Fund agreed to a two-year Dollars 756.2m standby loan in July, based on an aggressive programme of emergency taxes and spending cuts. The economy minister, Mr Aykon Dogan, now claims total success in meeting the IMF's targets, especially on deficit-reduction. He says: 'We have diminished the public sector borrowing requirement to 10 per cent of GNP, and it will no doubt be further diminished to 7 per cent in 1995. People said our programme was impossible to apply. But we are serious people.' The government also asked the World Bank for loans to support public sector reform that would attack the economy's underlying problems. Six months on, though, progress is barely noticeable. A weary World Bank staffer summarised Turkey's problem as 'simply a situation where the government is too big and revenues too small'. Turkey must privatise state companies, eliminate subsidies, modernise the tax and social security systems and sweep away red tape. Determination, or the lack of it, to pursue public sector reform will shape Turkey's business environment in the years to come. Mr Unal Korukcu, chief executive of Ankara's big Isbank warns: 'We face a tough period for some years. Turks must accept the fact that they must consume and borrow less.' Privatisation has split the weak coalition government of Mrs Ciller's conservative DYP party and the social democratic SHP. Political stalemate is also delaying negotiations with Brussels over establishing a customs union. This requires adoption of European legislation, especially on competition and intellectual property. But these new laws, which would further underpin reform, are making slow progress in parliament. Mrs Ciller is a US-trained economist. She knows reform is ultimately unavoidable and that it would place Turkey on a sound long-term footing, albeit at the cost of prolonging the current recession. Yet she is a politician first, the leader of a weak and divided government. General elections are due by November 1996. Most business leaders - who dislike and distrust her - expect Mrs Ciller to equivocate and for Turkey's economic problems to return with redoubled force in 1996. Still, economists expect the encouraging demand and production trends of recent months to build into 2-3 per cent growth next year, just enough to keep up with population growth. Business executives are confident that public support for structural reform is approaching critical mass. A sound economy would certainly make management a less seat-of-the-pants affair and investment would recover. But banks and companies would lose easy pickings in financial markets. They would miss the tax system's gaping loopholes and lax enforcement. Import tariffs are already falling. Intensifying competition, especially after customs union, will further depress industry's high margins. Companies will also lose big government contracts and subsidies - although these are mixed blessings, since debt-ridden Ankara always pays late. It seems certain that Turkey's handful of conglomerates, which grew so powerful in the old hothouse economy, will continue to dominate the business scene. Few others can yet match the financial strength, market share, political connections and management skills of the pre-eminent Sabanci and Koc groups. Yet small and medium companies have grown strongly, able to deliver intermediate technology goods as well made and well priced as anywhere else in the developing world. Recession and murderously high interest rates now threaten these often undercapitalised companies with bankruptcy. Fortunately, even very small companies can go public. Listings on the Istanbul market have grown by one-fifth to 169 companies since January 1993. Turkey's strengths are its typical developing-country characteristics - rapid economic growth, a large and fast-expanding population, low operating costs - with the added benefit of some highly sophisticated companies, proximity to Europe and, if all goes well, customs union with an expanded European Union. However, investment is too low. A US observer commented that under-investment is 'something (companies) have to worry about. They have to continue improving productivity and sophistication, but it's not happening.' He says research and development spending in Turkey is equivalent to only 0.5 per cent of GDP. Instability discourages foreign investment: Turkey has received just Dollars 13.45bn in inward investment since 1980, mostly in the transport, cement and food processing industries. The underdeveloped legal system, where rulings can take years to obtain, may further discourage investment as business becomes more sophisticated and competitive. Already a large part of the economy has gone underground to escape the incompetence and over-regulation - as well as the taxes - of officialdom. The underground economy helps explain why, in a year of such difficulties, the streets of Istanbul remain choked with traffic instead of protesters. Professor Osman Altug, of Marmara University, says the unregistered economy has grown to 41 per cent of GDP from 34 per cent in 1992. Unregulated sales of consumer goods to smugglers from Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia alone provide about 200,000 jobs. The textile industry probably has unregistered exports of about Dollars 3bn a year. But the informal economy also spawns corruption, loan-sharking and organised crime. Press reports of connections between gangsters, state companies, businessmen and senior politicians further reinforce the public's view of businessmen as flashy Mercedes-driving racketeers. Disgust at corruption in state companies, their inefficiency - Istanbul ran out of water this summer - and the heavy financial burden they impose on the country are changing Turks' traditional view of these companies as the heritage of Kemal Ataturk and the economy's bedrock. Yet public sector reform is blocked by fear of unemployment. Mr Dogan himself says three-quarters of the public sector's 2m employees are not needed. Mistrust of the business elite is probably another important factor delaying privatisation. And politicians fiercely resist any measure that reduces patronage. The rise of the Islamic Refah party is frequently seen as a reaction against incompetence and corruption. The business elite and middle classes are growing further apart from the 40-45m ordinary Turks struggling to survive on the land or in big city slums. Polarisation is not just politically dangerous. It is bad for business. Turkey needs a strong, well-balanced domestic market for companies to grow and exports to expand. But Turkey lacks determined leadership. Mr Erol Aksoy, owner of Istanbul's Iktisat Bankasi, says: 'We need strong governments, not coalition governments. We need a government (to begin reform) that is at the beginning of its term not at the end.' Turkey is still waiting for a successor to Turgut Ozal, the decisive former prime minister and president who mapped out reform in the 1980s but died last year.</p>

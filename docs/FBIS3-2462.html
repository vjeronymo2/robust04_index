			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing yesterday released a major address by  President Jiang Zemin on the imperative of political stability  and the vital role propaganda plays. Chinese sources said the  speech, made on January 24 at a national meeting on propaganda  work, provided the theoretical underpinning for a series of  measures the administration would take to ward off  socio-political instability.    Mr Jiang, who is also party chief, disclosed that in the  training of cadres, more emphasis would be put on raising their  ideological purity as well as their total obedience to the  edicts of patriarch Deng Xiaoping. The President said the  national goal this year was "safeguarding political stability"  and "maintaining the sustained, high-speed and healthy  development of the national economy. All comrades in the party  must clearly recognize this national situation, and obey and  provide service to this national situation," Mr Jiang said.    Reiterating a point of view that remnant Maoists had used  against Mr Deng, Mr Jiang said the leadership must guard against  "one hand being relatively strong, and the other hand being  relatively weak". This is a reference to the fact that radical  reformists such as ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang had  concentrated on developing the economy while neglecting  ideological indoctrination and "the dictatorship of the  proletariat".    Mr Jiang urged the propaganda and media workers to "provide  a  correct guidance to public opinion. They [propaganda and media  cadres] must insist on making good propaganda about the line,  goals, and policies of the party," he said. "In political  matters they must remain in unison with the Party Centre."    A large segment of the address was devoted to the  propagation  of a new generation of cadres who would be loyal to the party  and to Marxism. He called upon central and provincial leaders  to ensure that their officials would be "armed with the  theoretical weapon" called Deng Thought. He also called upon  regional leaders to use two to three years to provide training  in Deng Thought to lower- level cadres. Special attention  should be paid to the education of staff in the ideological,  propaganda and media fields, Mr Jiang said. He urged leaders  of various levels to show concernto these staffers "from the  point of view of politics, ideology, work and lifestyle".    A Chinese source said in terms of its stress on Marxist  orthodoxy, Mr Jiang's address was on a par with speeches made by  the leadership soon after the Tiananmen Square massacre. They  said Beijing had worked out plans to combat "de-stabilising  factors" in the sensitive period that stretches from the opening  of the National People's Congress this week to the fifth  anniversary of the June 4 crisis. More state-security agents  have been deployed to keep surveillance not only on dissidents  but on "trouble-makers" in state factories, many of which are  not paying full salaries. The media has been told to avoid  reporting on "negative" news.</p>

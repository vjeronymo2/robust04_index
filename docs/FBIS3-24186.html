			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Nikolayev, president of the Republic of </F> Sakha (Yakutia), under rubric "Position": "Peoples of the North:  Prospects for Common Development. Yakutia Sets a Good Example"]    [Text] By and large, all of the problems in the North are a  human problem. Primarily, the problem of the northerner -- a  person living in the planet's high latitudes. Nevertheless I  shall never get tired or trying to prove, or of repeating, that  the problems of the North were and will continue to be problems  of a scale that affects mankind as a whole. Having recognized  that truth, we shall move far ahead along the path primarily of  humanism.    In the Russian Federation and in the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia) in recent years there have been major changes in the  entire way of life and it is impossible to evaluate in any  simple manner the importance of those changes for the peoples of  the North. However, the value of the reforms manifests itself  precisely against the background of the overall condition and  well-being of the peoples of the North.    Upon attentive consideration it is revealed that the  northern  peoples of our planet not only assimilated for mankind a vast  territory that is unbelievably severe and also very rich in  resources, but also created a unique spiritual and material  culture. One can confidently speak about a specific circumpolar  (existing in the regions of the Arctic Circle) civilization that  enriched mankind by its invaluable historical experience, an  experience that reveals man's ability to survive and to engage  in creative activity under the most severe climatic conditions.    For Russia this experience is unusually important, or even  invaluable, for the simple reason that 60 percent of Russian  territory is nothing but an arctic and northern zone. For the  Republic of Sakha this experience is national wealth, property  that belongs to the entire nation, the dividends from which we  shall receive in the twenty-first century, when we shall see the  fruition of the words of the great Lomonosov, to the effect that  Russia's might will accrue to Siberia and the Arctic Ocean.    The peoples that formed the circumpolar civilization have  many attributes in common, such as a harmonious, completely  balanced interrelationship with the fragile environment. The  northern peoples created great models of economic culture, the  fruits of which the industrial part of mankind is just beginning  to use. The cult of life, the recognition of the inherent value  of life, collectivism, mutual tolerance and mutual aid, respect  for women, the family, and the tribe, heightened aesthetic  sense, a sense of beauty -- those are only a few of the shared  and special attributes of northern civilization.    The North's vast mineral wealth became the chief reason for  invading and destroying the fragile circumpolar civilization,  for having it become absorbed by industrial civilization. A  large amount of harm was inflicted on the peoples of the North  by the social experiment that was carried out in Russia after  October 1917 under the slogan of the building of a communist  society. The industrial breakthrough to the unlimited natural  resources of the northern territories was accompanied by a  disdain for the peoples populating those lands, by the  incompetent interference of the state and officials into the  social and spiritual life of the northern peoples.    At various stages in the development of Russia, the  effectiveness of administering the northern territories varied.  The first and most significant legal act, in our opinion, was  the Regulations for Administering Aliens, which were enacted in  1822. Tribal communes were recognized as being the basis of  self-government and the subject of land use. Under the Soviet  authority the freedom of national associations of northerners  was declared: in the early 1930's the Presidium of the VTsIK  [All-Russian Central Executive Committee] even enacted a decree  entitled Organizing National Associations in the Rayons  Inhabited by Small-Population Nationalities of the North. For  example, 15 national rayons were formed as part of the Yakut  ASSR of that time. Officially that decree was never appealed,  but it was also never executed. For Russia as a whole, those  rayons were gradually deprived of their national status, and  that fact, combined with other unfavorable factors, led to a  decline in the development of the northern peoples and to a loss  by them of many achievements of circumpolar civilization.    The restoration of Russia, the reformation of all aspects of  its life at the present-day stage, creates excellent  opportunities for overcoming the mistakes that were made. And  the experience of Yakutia that was gained in recent years  inspires optimism.    According to the data in the 1989 population census, there  were 24,817 persons residing on the territory of the Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia) -- representatives of 25 of the 26 peoples,  practically all with a small population, inhabiting the North of  the Russian Federation. We are gratified that, during the period  between the most recent censuses, the size of the population in  the small-population peoples of the North on the territory of  our republic increased by 6372, or by 34.5 percent. During that  same period the size of the Sakha nation increased by 16.3  percent, and the size of the rural -- mainly indigenous --  population increased by 9.8 percent. I might note that the rates  of population increase among the small-population peoples of the  North in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) are considerably higher  than the same indicators on the whole for the Russian  Federation. There the total increase for all 25 ethnic groups  was 16.6 percent. Thanks to the higher rates of population  increase, the percentage of the small-population peoples of the  North in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) increased from 11.8 to  13.7 in the total figure of Russia's indigenous North.    The highest birth rate is observed among the Eveny -- those  rates came to 50.4 percent during the period between censuses.  More than half the Eveny in the Russian Federation live on the  territory of the Republic of Sakha. The number of Evenki in our  republic increased by 24.5 percent, whereas, for Russia as a  whole, the increase came to 10.6 percent, and in the Evenki  Autonomous Okrug, which is in Krasnoyarsk Kray, it came to only  7.4 percent. The percentage of Evenki in the Republic of Sakha  in the entire Evenki population of the Russian Federation  increased by 24.8 to 48.2 percent. The favorable conditions for  the population increase can be explained by a number of factors.    First of all, we benefited from the declarations and  promises  to change over to practical matters. The republic's leadership,  in defending the rights and interests of the indigenous  population of the North, in the scientific posing and practical  resolution of a number of problems of the socioeconomic and  cultural development of the small-population peoples of the  North, has been recognized in all the regions of the Russian  North. Something that serves as the best confirmation of the  correctness of the course that was chosen by us is the increase  in the migration in the Republic of Sakha of representatives of  the indigenous population of the North from adjacent krays and  oblasts. For the time being, the only nationality that does not  live in our republic is the Nganasany.    It is difficult to cure a sick person if he himself does not  really want to be cured. In the same way, it is important in the  rebirth of the northern peoples to reinforce their will to live  and their confidence in their own abilities, and to develop  national self-awareness. Any nation is reborn through the  development of language and the resuscitation of cultural and  spiritual life.    Look at the results of the 1989 population census and you  will easily be convinced that a large number of people in  various ethnic groups have lost the knowledge of their native  language --Orochony, Chvantsy, Itelmeny, Nivkhi, Udegeytsy,  Evenki, Yukagiry, and Mansi.    One could hardly expect any other result: the way of life  has  changed so, and there has been such a narrowing of the sphere of  use of the native language. Unfortunately, it is precisely the  native language of the peoples in the North that used to be  viewed most frequently as a subject of secondary importance in  primary school and as a linguistic phenomenon in science.  Currently in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia) very important laws have been enacted, that regulate  the linguistic life of the peoples residing on the particular  territory. Work has been broadened to restore and develop  national systems of educating the indigenous peoples of the  republic, including those for the Eveny, Evenki, and Yukagiry.  The Institute of Problems of Small-Population Peoples of the  North, of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, has submitted a concept for national Evenki, Eveny,  and Yukagiry schools, the concept of preschool education. They  have become components of the republic-wide concept of the  national school. For the first time, the Nizhnekolymskiy College  of the Peoples of the North is operating, and the School of  Northern Philology has been created at Yakutsk State University.  The Institute of Problems of Small-Population Peoples of the  North has been created under the academy, and that institute,  during just one year of its existence, in addition to conducting  fundamental research, has developed state programs entitled "The  Health of Small-Population Peoples of the North" and "The Press  of Small-Population Peoples of the North." The draft of a  Program for the Socioeconomic Development of the Eveny, Evenki,  and Yukagiry is being prepared. The institute is also executing  a number of state production orders for the Russian Federation  and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) for the correct guaranteeing  of social questions in the development of the peoples of the  North.    For example, for several years there have been regular  broadcasts by the "Gevan" ("Dawn") radio station in the Evenki,  Eveny, and Yukagiry language. There is a special program on  republic television, and the thick artistic magazine ROZOVAYA  CHAYKA [Pink Seagull] is published. Supplements to it are  published in the languages of the peoples of the North.    I shall particularly emphasize that all this work is being  carried out by the forces of the republic itself and within the  confines of the republic. Therefore at one time it was  surprising to hear the enthusiastic report that Moscow had begun  radio broadcasts in the Assyrian language for a nation that  scarcely numbers 1000 persons. Why doesn't Moscow have radio and  television broadcasts in the languages of the peoples of Russia,  especially the peoples with small populations which spend most  of their life far from populated places and for whom radio is  practically the only thread that links a person with the outside  world and with his state? Active, functioning language, press,  radio and television, meaningful publishing activity, and the  creation of literary and artistic works -- all these things and  many more form the nation's vital spirit and make its spiritual  life unique. Nor can we do without the national intelligentsia.  Using as an example the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) I can state  confidently that our land has its rightful share of talent. We  have brilliant individuals who are capable of becoming the  expressers of the national self-awareness of the northern  peoples. I do not doubt that the spiritual life of northerners  will become even more enriched with the influx of fresh forces,  under the conditions of freedom and democracy that are new for  us. There is no need to interfere in that natural process, or to  unify and level the culture of peoples. The variety of cultures  is the beauty that will save the world.    Something that can serve as the confirmation of what has  been  said is the history of the nomadic tribal commune, which was  destroyed during the years of the Soviet authority and that is  being restored now. In a resolution enacted by the first  congress of tribal nomadic communes that was held in our  republic, it is directly stated: "...The restored tribal  communes will become a true socioeconomic and spiritual base for  the rebirth and further prosperity of the way of life of the  small-population peoples of the North as completely equal  subjects of the sovereign renewed state." Prior to that, the  Constitution of the Republic of Sakha )Yakutia) was enacted.  Article 42 of that constitution reads: "...The republic,  respecting the traditions, culture, and customs of the  indigenous peoples and small-population peoples of the North,  protects and guarantees their inalienable right:    "-- to own and use, in conformity with the law, the land and  resources, including the tribal agricultural, hunting, and  fishing grounds;    "-- to organize a social program and a medical program with  a  consideration of the economic peculiarities of the area being  populated, and the management and ethnic specifics of the human  organism;    "-- to protect against any form of coercive assimilation and  ethnocide, as well as encroachments on ethnic uniqueness, the  historic holy places, or monuments of spiritual and material  culture."    I might note that the demand stated in the Constitution is  being translated into the language of practical life. Several  laws have been enacted and are in operation: "The Nomadic Tribal  Commune of the Small-Population Peoples of the North,"  "Citizenship," "Languages in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)";  and "The Alternative Military Service of Representatives of  Small-Population Peoples of the North." According to those  documents, the languages spoken by the peoples of the North have  been recognized as official in places of dense population.    In our opinion, the question of the self-government of the  nomadic tribal commune as a form of national-territorial  formation of the small-population nation that does not have its  own state system deserves the most careful and complete study.  It is also necessary for us to analyze the rich experience of  the indigenous nations of the North beyond the border.    The further work of creating legislation dealing with the  problems of the small-population peoples in the North of the  Russian Federation must be aimed at developing, for example,  legislative drafts and legal-normative acts dealing with: legal  status; local self-government; the traditional trades engaged in  by these peoples; benefits; the training of cadres of  specialists; the northern domesticated reindeer; and the  construction of housing and social and cultural amenities in  places of dense population by those peoples.    The reform of the self-government of the peoples in the  North  of the Russian Federation presupposes a change in the strategy  of state policy with respect to the northern territories. The  territory of the Russian Federation remains the cradle of the  unique culture of the peoples of the North. The government of  the Russian Federation, like the governments of the Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia) and the other subjects of the Federation, is  responsible for preserving and developing those peoples.    There is nothing surprising in the fact that the Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia) has proven to be on the cutting edge of the  problems pertaining to the life of the northern peoples. It is  herein that the republic views the priorities of its policy and  develops the strategy and tactics for its development. What is  much more surprising is the shortsightedness of certain  influential politicians who do not see the vital importance of  the northern problems and postpone indefinitely the resolution  of those problems. The republic will patiently explain its views  and its policy with respect to the future of the entire North  and the Arctic zone for Russia and for mankind as a whole.  Practical steps have already been taken in the direction of  reinforcing the cooperation among the northern states. We shall  develop as a northern state and as such shall cooperate with the  world community and bear responsibility to that community for  keeping intact the achievements of circumpolar civilization and  for the rebirth of the northern peoples. Today the Republic of  Sakha is becoming a completely equal member of the community of  northern states -- the Northern Forum -- and feels completely  confident in its new role. This kind of "northern"  specialization of international cooperation under the conditions  of the political thaw must yield weighty and tangible fruits  both for the participants and for the rest of mankind. The Cold  War is not for northerners -- it's already cold here. Warfare is  definitely not a northern pastime.    The time has come for the joint development and enactment of  an international law governing northern space -- a law governing  the Arctic. It would make it possible to lay the legal basis for  the efficient use of the resources of the North and to establish  international monitoring of their use.    It is also necessary to strive constantly to improve the  legal acts dealing with the protection of the northern ethnic  groups, their traditional way of life, and modern forms of  management, spiritual self-expression, and self-government. It  is necessary to recognize the fact that the inhabitants of the  North are now a new population of people who have become firmly  established in their life in the higher latitudes. Irrespective  of nationality, they must possess the corresponding set of  rights and obligations that guarantee the conditions for  prosperity in the North. The vital activity and the standards  for guaranteeing it and providing services for people must have  a zonal peculiarity. It is also necessary to proceed from the  specific requirements of the natural and geographical  environment in which people live.    Justice requires the consolidation of the efforts of the  world community in supporting circumpolar civilization. The  humanization of international relations will promote the  conception and development of a new policy in the area of the  Arctic Circle.</p>

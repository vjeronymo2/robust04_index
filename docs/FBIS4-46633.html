			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vira Valerko of the NHU command press center </F> under the rubric "Draft-94": "Are the Sick Are Being Taken Into  the Guard...?"]    [Text] It is, of course, a rhetorical question. But the  impression is being created that it may not be for all. How else  to explain a situation where 16 young men from last year's fall  replacements for the National Guard of Ukraine were immediately  sent home as unfit to serve, and 78 were sent for medical  examination to determine their fitness?    Incredibly, among the diseases with which the draftees were  commissioned were stomach ulcers, cardiosclerosis, oligophrenia  at the stage of mild debility, arthrosis and even psychopathy.  Just what guided the physicians of the draft commissions, if  they knowingly signed the documents on the supposedly  satisfactory state of the health of the sick people? They must  bear that responsibility as malefactors, among other things,  since one such falsification ended tragically for Guard soldier  Dmytry Reznyk, who died in December of last year from a  perforated stomach ulcer. Strange? Only in November of that same  year, after all, the military medical commission of Zavodskyy  Rayon of the city of Dnipropetrovsk has officially established  the full fitness of the youth to serve!    Why recall today these sad events, six months old? The new  recruits will soon be welcomed. Reports are coming in from  everywhere on the completion of the work of the groups for  preliminary selection that were working in contact with the  regional military commissariats. Certain oblasts have already  sent the lists of the candidates selected. There is no assurance  whatsoever, however, that the military commissariats are sending  namely those youth to serve in the NHU. The experience of the  prior draft--when, for example, the Ternopil city military  commissariat sent only three of the 42 draftees selected for the  National Guard--forces one to have doubts again.    The indoctrination of the draftees, their moral and  spiritual  qualities, their abilities and the state of their health require  especially careful attention today, as was emphasized by Guard  Colonel Vasyl Romanovskyy. That is possible, however, only  provided there is personal contact with the future soldiers.  Financial difficulties unfortunately hold sway here as well. The  shortage of funds has led to the fact that business trips  connected with preliminary selection have been cut back to a few  days, while the transportation that could accelerate and improve  that work is effectively lacking. So how many populated areas  can you cover on foot in five days? So they have to familiarize  themselves, as a rule, not with people but with their personal  files. They are often highly falsified. It becomes a vicious  circle.    The Guard is ready to receive its young replacements. The  difficulties that are expected as a consequence of the  quantitative imbalance between last year's and this year's  replacements have even been taken into account. The training  centers of the National Guard of Ukraine are awaiting their new  recruits, and the officers are prepared to begin the training of  the newcomers and to educate them as true Guardsmen.</p>

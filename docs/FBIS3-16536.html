At its plenary meeting on Wednesday [16 March], the Duma  directed appropriate committees to arrange for hearings on the  Partnership-for-Peace documents, which had been adopted at a  session of the North Atlantic Council in January 1994, on  matters concerning the implementation of the START I Treaty and  its realisation problems, an analysis of the status and problems  of the state border of the Russian Federation, and on the  Russia's participation in international agreements on the  elimination of chemical weapons.    The Duma will also hold hearings to consider "the results of  the privatisation of state-run and municipal enterprises of the  Russian Federation in 1992-1993" and a relevant state programme,  on structural, science and technology policy, and a concept of  the Russian Federation's transition to a steady development  model.</p>

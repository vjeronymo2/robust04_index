			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace Talks between British Aerospace and Honda over the ownership of Rover might seem a little odd at this stage of the business cycle. After all, Rover has had to invest in new models - most recently the Rover 600 - and work hard to cut working capital in order to get through the recession. Since Rover is now gaining market share, should BAe not sit back and reap the benefits of the hard work? If BAe were free of any other constraints that might be true. But the capital intensive nature of the motor industry means that companies are rarely far away from the demands of new model development. While Rover should begin to swing into profit, substantial cash generation to fund other BAe projects may remain merely a nice idea. Meanwhile, Rover's working capital requirements remain significant. This far, Honda has had the comfort of a 20 per cent equity holding without having to cover any of Rover's financing costs. An agreement on closer co-operation which involved Honda sharing that burden would free up some of BAe's capital for use in other parts of the business. If that were accompanied by a sale of Rover equity to Honda at above book value it would also help underpin BAe's balance sheet. That may be particularly useful at a time when BAe may wish to make provisions against leases on its turboprop aircraft leases. Honda too has reasons to pursue discussions. Gradually closer links between manufacturers is part of the Japanese way of business. And cementing the two companies more tightly would help Honda shut out a potential European competitor.</p>

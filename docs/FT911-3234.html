			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Short-time work takes bigger toll THE NUMBER of hours lost through short-time working has doubled over the past year as organisations attempt to hold on to skilled employees during the recession rather than make them redundant, according to a study published today. In January 1991, more than half a million hours a week were lost where employees were stood off for the whole or part of a week. That was double the number of hours lost in January 1990, although still far short of levels reached during the recession of the early 1980s, says the research group Incomes Data Services. The study says: 'Many employers are only too aware of the recent difficulties they experienced in attempting to recruit and retain skilled employees and they are reluctant to lose these people.' Short-time working is widespread in sectors such as textiles, footwear and clothing, and motor vehicles. Service industries such as travel have also been affected. Lay-Offs and Short-Time Working.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finland's participation in NATO's Partnership for  Peace program is likely to be restricted to peacekeeping  training in the initial stage. According to Foreign Minister  Heikki Haavisto, Finland will study the matter during the spring  and will have talks both with NATO countries and neutral  countries about the Partnership for Peace offer. Haavisto  reported on the offer to the Diet's Foreign Affairs Committee  today.    Pertti Paasio, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee,  also thought that peacekeeping training was the only form of  Finnish participation in the initial stage. According to  Paasio, Sweden and Switzerland are very interested in the  Partnership for Peace. Paasio thought it possible that at best  the Partnership could be the beginning of a pan-European  security system.</p>

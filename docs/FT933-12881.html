			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / BR maintenance arm to be sold BRITISH RAIL'S train maintenance activities, which employ 2,400 people around the country, are to be privatised next year, the government announced yesterday. The move could mean heavy job losses because the operations will have to compete with the private sector in an industry burdened by overcapacity. The activities to be sold are the maintenance depots at Eastleigh, Doncaster, Wolverton and Glasgow and other facilities at Chart Leacon, Ilford, and Swindon. The depots are responsible for heavy maintenance and repair of BR rolling stock. Lighter maintenance activities will stay with BR - but on privatisation will pass to Railtrack, the proposed track-owning company of the railway. Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said train maintenance was suffering from overcapacity because of advances in rolling stock technology in the last 20 to 30 years. But he said the privatisation of BR's maintenance depots could bring benefits because they would have greater freedom to diversify and compete for work outside the railway supply industry. The depots to be sold had a combined turnover of Pounds 228.3m in the financial year 1992-93, but made only marginal profits. Mr Freeman said he expected the depots to be sold either to private sector companies or to internal buy-out teams, but he added: 'No one is going to pretend in current economic circumstances that the sale will yield significant sums of money.'</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RATHBUN'S SECOND-HALF SURGE PACES WOODBRIDGE  </P> <P> Leslie Rathbun's second-half performance led Woodbridge High School to a 50-44  Pacific Coast League girls' basketball victory over Orange.  </P> <P> Rathbun scored 11 of her 23 points in the third quarter to help Woodbridge  rally from a 22-15 halftime deficit to a 36-30 lead going into the final eight  minutes of play at Orange High School.  </P> <P> Rathbun, a senior guard who was the Pacific Coast League most valuable player  last season, made seven of 15 field goals, including one three-pointer, and  eight of nine free throws. She also had seven assists and 11 of Woodbridge's 23  steals.  </P> <P> "Leslie said she wasn't getting her shots (one of five) in the first half and I  told her the shots were there, but she wasn't looking for the right one,"  Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said. "Her control in the second half made the  difference."  </P> <P> Orange Coach Ed Prange called Rathbun "one of the best (female) players in the  county."  </P> <P> Woodbridge (18-4 overall, 7-0 in league), the county's 10th-ranked team,  remains undefeated and Orange (13-6, 5-2) holds onto second place.  </P> <P> For Orange, Nicole Champion, made eight of 15 field goals and four of six free  throws for 20 points and had 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> "Our defense battled all the way and our girls never gave up," Prange said.  "Woodbridge is just a good team. They made their free throws (including eight  of 11 in the fourth quarter that ensured the victory) and they maintained their  poise." BOB BORSUM  </P></p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Telecoms boost predicted: British Association For The Advancement Of Science PEOPLE WILL be able to send voice, video and text around the world for the price of a local telephone call in the next century and video-conferencing systems will make 90 per cent of business travel unnecessary, the British Association meeting in Southampton heard yesterday. The predictions came from a panel of opto-electronics specialists, who said that they were not indulging in flights of fancy but reflecting the progress over the past five years in fibre-optic technology. Professor Peter Cochrane, of British Telecom Laboratories, Martlesham, said that a single glass strand as thin as a human hair can carry information equivalent to billions of telephone conversations over thousands of miles. He said: 'Optical communications provide us with an infinite capability to communicate.' The key to this is the erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA), invented at Southampton University in 1987 and now being exploited worldwide. Professor David Payne of Southampton University said: 'Commercial EDFAs are now offered by more than 30 companies, which must be close to a record for development of such a new technology.' EDFAs intensify light signals automatically as they shoot down the optical fibres, removing the need to install expensive electronic amplifiers at intervals. 'These developments will shift the bulk of future international telecommunications traffic from satellites to undersea fibre routes,' said Prof Payne. 'The development of the EDFA has removed a barrier which promises to allow optical telecommunications finally to reach its full potential.' Part of that potential lies in face-to-face communications that are much cheaper and more realistic than today's video-conferencing systems. Prof Cochrane said: 'We're not just talking about a videophone.' He predicted that early next century optical fibre networks will extend to every home and business in the UK. Copper cable will be replaced entirely; radio and microwave systems - both ground and satellite based - will be reserved for mobile communications. Now that the telecommunications transmission problem has essentially been solved, he said, the greatest technical obstacle is to develop computer systems capable of switching and managing the large amounts of information expected to flow through the fibre-optic networks of the next century. Several speakers predicted that the much-discussed replacement of commuting and business travel by telecommunications would then happen on a large scale.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In addition, the Agency reviewed 1990 and 1991 Superfund Records of Decision (RODs) for information on municipal landfill sites where mercury was listed as a contaminant of concern (COC). A total of twelve out of sixty-six 1990 and 1991 RODs for landfills accepting municipal waste listed mercury as a COC. Of these 12 sites, 5 had mercury detections in ground-water over the MCL. All but one of these sites had confirmed industrial waste codisposal. At this site only onsite ground-water exceeded the MCL for mercury (maximum of 0.013 mg/L); all offsite ground-water samples were below detection limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, preliminary data and analysis suggest at this time that mercury in municipal solid wastes is not being readily released by leaching processes that typically occur in the MSW landfill environment. This indication is also supported by controlled leaching studies of high-concentration mercury-containing wastes codisposed with municipal solid waste (Borden et al., 1990/Gould et al., 1988). However, the Agency requests that commenters provide any MSW landfill leachate or groundwater data, or data from industrial Subtitle D landfills, that EPA has not considered in its analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Air Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Agency is also reviewing data on the air pathway for mercury because low levels of mercury in surface water have caused elevated fish concentrations at many sites in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, and other States, and these elevated levels of mercury have been attributed to atmospheric deposition from non-specific sources (U.S. EPA, 1993a). Therefore, EPA reviewed data on mercury emissions to air from a number of sources, including those potentially related to lamp disposal. EPA also considered available data on the fate and transport of mercury of mercury emitted to the air. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of elemental mercury's high vapor pressure, it is easily volatilized into the atmosphere. Two factors are believed to contribute to the recent increases in atmospheric deposition of mercury compounds. The first factor is increased atmospheric levels from mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, chloralkali plants, MWC facilities, and other sources. The second factor is increased oxidation of atmospheric elemental mercury vapor to more soluble oxidized forms which is enhanced by anthropogenic (i.e., pollution from man-made sources) increases in atmospheric oxidizing agents, such as ozone and inorganic acids. Based on current mercury emissions inventories EPA believes that major mercury emission source categories include coal fired power plants, municipal waste combustors and medical waste combustors. (U.S. EPA, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mercury that is methylated is strongly biomagnified through the food chain through bioconcentration in animals, and in plant tissue. Methylation is a chemical process in which a methyl unit is added to either elemental or oxidized mercury. The primary environmental human exposure pathway for mercury is through the consumption of contaminated fish. Fish bioconcentration factors (fish tissue concentration/water concentration) are as high as 85,000. Recently, elevated levels of mercury in fish in isolated, pristine lakes have been identified in widespread areas around the country. There are currently over 1,550 fish consumption bans or advisories due to mercury in effect in the United States (Sorensen et al, 1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there may be insufficient data to determine whether mercury from lamps will endanger human health and environment by the release of mercury to the air, there are concerns over emissions of mercury from lamps from municipal waste combustors, possibly landfill gas, as well as concerns with the handling and disposal of mercury lamps. In this section, available information will be discussed pertaining to the hazards of mercury via air exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> (1) Incineration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Agency estimates that approximately 14% of U.S. municipal solid waste is burned in municipal waste combustors (MWCs), comprising 23 million metric tons (Mg) of waste. Approximately 100 Mg of mercury-containing waste is burned in municipal waste combustors, of which about 3 Mg/yr is mercury-containing lamps (U.S. EPA, 1990). Because of its low boiling point, elemental mercury in the waste is largely vaporized during municipal waste combustion and, without controls specific to mercury, passes out of the municipal waste combustor into the atmosphere with the flue gas. Measurements have shown that for several municipal waste combustors with emissions controls for sulfur and nitrogen oxide particulates, average MWC mercury emission factors range from 70 to 90 percent of the mercury input (Vogg et al, 1986/Reiman, 1989). If we assume that 98% of the mercury in incinerated municipal solid waste is volatilized during combustion this would potentially generate 98 Mg/year mercury emissions of this, about 2.9 Mg/year would be from mercury-containing lamps. Post-combustion mercury control at the municipal waste combustor's would reduce mercury levels by 80% to 90%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

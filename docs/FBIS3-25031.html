The Angolan government now occupies 80 percent  of Cuito following another day of intense fighting. More than  50 people are believed to have died. Hence the peace process is  threatened once more. The National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] wants the ban on the sale of arms  and oil to be lifted. Luis Henrique Pereira reports.    [Pereira] UNITA is accusing the Angolan Government of being  solely responsible for the renewed fighting, mainly in the city  of Cuito. In a communique signed by Jorge Valentim, spokesman  for the UNITA team at the Lusaka talks, UNITA said that the  negotiations are now inevitably affected by the fresh fighting  on Saturday morning. If the situation deteriorates, UNITA has  threatened to end the dialogue with the government because there  is now much mistrust. UNITA also wants the sanctions preventing  the sale of arms to UNITA to be lifted. The sanctions were  ordered in September by the United Nations. Jorge Valentim said  that Bosnias are being created in the UNITA areas. He added  that one side is armed to its teeth and the other side is  limited to buying arms [as heard]. [passage omitted]</p>

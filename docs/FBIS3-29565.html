Speaking at the meeting, the honorary chairman of the  Cilreco, George Pattas, former Greek general, said what is  exasperating with regard to the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula is that the United States is incoherent in its stand.    "I think if the Clinton administration is willing to find a  peaceful solution to the acute nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula through bilateral talks between the DPRK and the  United States it must adopt its decision properly at the  present crucial juncture," he said.    Robert Parry, British Labour member of the House of Commons,  said the prevailing situation requires that the essence of the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be laid bare and  the solidarity movement for supporting the Korean people's cause  of reunification conducted more vigorously in diverse forms and  ways.    He said when the international solidarity movement for  supporting the just cause of the Korean people is intensified  the United States will not be able to impose any kind of  "sanctions" on the DPRK and, even if it is possible to do so, it  is bound to end in failure.    Lawyer Stanley Faulkner, vice-chairman of the Cilreco and  chairman of the U.S. Lawyers Committee on Korea, said the United  States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea is a crude  violation of the Korean armistice agreement that prohibits the  introduction of new weapons and military hardware from outside  Korea, and called for an immediate pullout of the nuclear  weapons from South Korea.    He stressed that war rehearsals of the U.S. should be  stopped at once as they run counter to the U.N. charter on  stopping threat to world peace and solving problems through  peaceful means.    Roberto Gabriele, general secretary of the Movement for  Peace  and Socialism of Italy, said the Cilreco struggling for the  reunification and peace of Korea should lay bare the essence of  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by keeping in close  contact with the committees for friendship and solidarity with  the Korean people across the world and launch an international  campaign to check and frustrate the anti-DPRK moves of the  United States and its followers. Prof. Paulette Pierson at  Libre University in Brussels, Belgium called on the U.N.  Commission on Human Rights and governmental and  non-governmental organizations to lay bare through international  arenas the nature of the Kim Yong-sam "civilian" regime and  build up widespread international opinion supporting the  democratization of the South Korean society and Korea's  reunification.    Joe Debono Greck, Maltese Labour member of Parliament,  exposed the persistent despicable moves of some force of the  United States to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, saying it is a big  mistake if the United States and its followers think they can  frighten the Korean people united in one mind with pressure and  threat and representative of the Sandinist National Liberation  Front of Nicaragua Esmeralda Cardenas said if Kim Yong-sam truly  wants the reunification he should tear down the concrete wall  without hesitation as it is a product of the cold war that was  built by the military dictatorial "regime". The secretary  general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers,  Amar Bentoumi, former minister of justice of Algeria, called on  the progressive lawyers of all countries in the world who love  justice and peace to launch into an international campaign  urging the United States to abandon its hostile policy aimed at  stifling the DPRK and implement the principles stipulated in  the DPRK-U.S. joint statement in good faith.    Speeches supporting the Korean people's cause of national  reunification were also made at the meeting by Robert Charvin,  secretary general of the International Committee of Jurists for  Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea; Basco Hago Fernandes,  chairman of the Democratic Intervention of Portugal; Jaime  Ballesteros, international secretary of the Communist Party of  the Peoples of Spain, and other figures.</p>

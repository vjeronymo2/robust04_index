			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Revolution on the golf course Wilson Sporting Goods of the US has launched a 'revolutionary' new golf ball which, it says, improves performance by 'optimising interaction between opposing aerodynamic forces of drag and lift', writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Borrowing design principles developed in the NASA space programme, Wilson's Ultra ball has a new dimple pattern and 100 more dimples than the average ball, which has 400. Ultra's dimples, arranged in a 'geodesic icosahedral' pattern of 60 spherical triangles, create a more symmetrical surface to achieve higher velocity and more stable flight, the designers say. The ball, which sells for about Dollars 36 per dozen, comes with different combinations of dimples depending on whether you are going for distance, low trajectory or high trajectory.

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Questions raised over Fondiaria stake sale A FORMER top executive of Italy's troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) group has reportedly admitted to magistrates that the much-trumpeted 1989 sale of control of its big Fondiaria insurance subsidiary was never fully implemented. According to leaked evidence to Milan magistrates investigating alleged corruption, Mr Roberto Michetti, former finance director of Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary, said the transfer of a controlling stake in Fondiaria to the quoted Gaic holding company had never been put through. Mr Michetti allegedly said the L3,600bn (Dollars 2.3bn) sale to Gaic, then jointly controlled by Ferfin and the financier Mr Camillo De Benedetti, had been conducted to shift borrowings off Ferfin's debt-laden books. However, according to Mr Michetti, one of several former Ferruzzi executives under investigation for alleged political corruption and financial irregularities, control was never fully transferred to Gaic. In the leaked testimony, published in today's Panorama magazine, he claims Mr De Benedetti, who died earlier this year, put up only L300bn of the L1,800bn necessary to gain control of Fondiaria through Gaic, which was in turn controlled by a holding company jointly owned by Ferfin and Mr De Benedetti's family interests.</p>

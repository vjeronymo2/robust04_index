			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> POMONA HOPES ROSS WILL MAKE DIFFERENCE AT SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> The Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball team is hoping the return of forward Terry  Ross will make the difference when it visits Sacramento State in a  nonconference game at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Without Ross, listed as one of the top 25 small college players by The Sporting  News, but who missed the team's first four games because of a broken hand, the  Broncos lost to Sacramento, 99-83, Nov. 20 in Pomona.  </P> <P> But Ross made a big impression in his return to action against NCAA Division I  San Diego State last week, coming off the bench to score 27 points including 12  of 18 field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> The Broncos lost to San Diego State, 94-78, despite holding a 45-44 halftime  lead and have a 3-2 record. Sacramento State is 6-5.  </P> <P> In addition to Ross, the Broncos are led by forwards Eric Mobley and Ken  Scalmanini and guard D. J. Norman. Norman averages 12.6 points, Mobley 11.4  points and 8.4 rebounds and Scalmanini 11.3 points.  </P> <P> Pomona will face a Sacramento squad led by center Tim Little, who averages 16.4  points and 6.8 rebounds, and forward Greg Ballard, who averages 11.8 points.  </P> <P> Following the game against Sacramento, the Broncos will visit UC Davis in  another nonconference game at 7:30 p.m. Monday. Davis has good scoring balance  paced by forwards Stephen Smith and Richard Saunders and center Marc Jones.  </P> <P> Off to its best start in school history, the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men's  basketball team will attempt to remain undefeated when it plays host to Christ  College Irvine at 8 p.m. Saturday at Ducey Gym in Claremont.  </P> <P> Claremont, ranked 7th in NCAA Division III in a preseason poll, enters the game  at 7-0 and Christ College is 2-7. Sparked by a 57-point showing in the second  half, Claremont rolled to an 88-71 win over Cal State San Bernardino last week.  </P></p>

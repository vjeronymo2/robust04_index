			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 23 June (MTI) -- The parliamentary  faction leaders of the six parties preparing the founding  session of the new Parliament, to be convened on June 28, signed  an agreement in Budapest on Thursday [23 June] to settle  parliamentary posts, the composition of each committee, and the  seating of the six parliamentary groups (delegated by the  Hungarian Socialist Party, Alliance of Free Democrats, Hungarian  Democratic Forum, Independent Smallholders' Party, Christian  Democratic People's Party, and the Federation of Young  Democrats).    Karoly Szunyogh, the head of the President's Office, said  the  document is based on the country's interests and establishes all  conditions of parliamentary democracy.    Secretary-General of Parliament Istvan Soltesz announced  that  a draft proposal will be completed by Monday [27 June], in which  each parliamentary faction enlists who they wish to delegate to  the committees.    Under the agreement, the Speaker of Parliament will be  nominated by the faction that holds the majority of mandates,  i.e. the Hungarian Socialist Party. The six groups suggest that  the new Parliament elect three deputy speakers: from the  Alliance of Free Democrats, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, and  the Independent Smallholders' Party, respectively.    The new Parliament will have 17 committees: 13 permanent and  four special ones. The Socialists will chair 9 committees, the  Free Democrats three, and the four opposition parties will  preside at five.    The four opposition parties of the new Parliament will get  12  deputy chairman posts on 17 committees, not nine, based on votes  in the elections, not proportions of deputies.    Viewing the chamber from the Speaker of Parliament's pulpit,  the six parliamentary groups will be seated from left to right:  Hungarian Socialist Party, Alliance of Free Democrats, Hungarian  Democratic Forum, Independent Smallholders' Party, Christian  Democratic People's Party, and Federation of Young Democrats.  The farthest section on the right-hand side will be left vacant.    Under the rules of Parliament, candidates for parliamentary  posts are proposed by faction leaders, and the list of  candidates is to be presented to the deputies by the chairman of  seniority.    In the last part of the document, parliamentary group  leaders  fix that the agreement comes into force only if the Socialists  and Free Democrats form a coalition, and lapses if they split up.    The June 28 founding session of the new Parliament will be  opened by President Arpad Goncz, followed by Prime Minister  Peter Boross's announcement of the ending of his cabinet's  commission. But Boross and his ministers are to keep their  offices until the establishment of the new government.</p>

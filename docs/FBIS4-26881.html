			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese workers' rights  and interests will be better protected if the present draft  labor law is approved by the country's legislators.    The revised draft law places more emphasis on workers'  interests than did the first version. It is to be further  deliberated at the current session of the Standing Committee of  China's National People's Congress, which opened here today.    The revised draft suggests that when an enterprise has to  lay  people off in face of difficulties in production or on the brink  of bankruptcy, the management should inform the trade union or  all of its employees 30 days in advance and seek their consensus.    The dismissed workers should be given first priority when  the  enterprise wants to recruit any staff within six months after  the lay-off.    The draft law puts a 44 hours per month ceiling on extended  working hours, compared with the 48-hour ceiling in the first  draft.    Workers who work overtime, work on days off or during their  holidays should be paid at time-and-a-half, double-time or  treble-time rates, the draft says.    The revised draft has explicit stipulations on labor  disputes. For example, a dispute could be patched up by the  enterprise's mediation committee.    But a worker is entitled to ask for arbitration from the  relevant authorities. He or she could bring the case to court  when disagreeing with the arbitration.    The labor dispute mediation committee should be jointly  formed by representatives of employees, enterprise management  and trade union. The chairman of the committee, however, should  come from the trade union, the draft says. The first version of  the draft law demanded that a labor contract system should be  adopted in all state enterprise.    But the revised draft describes the contract system as the  right direction and the final goal, which may need to be reached  step by step in some provinces and cities where the social  welfare network has yet to be built up and improved.    China now has 35 million workers on contracts, about a third  of the workforce in state enterprises.    To ensure workers on a contract have a relatively secure  job,  especially when they are past their prime, the draft says that  when the employer and employee agree to extend the contract, the  worker has the right to stipulate the length of the extension.    But to have this right, the worker will need to have worked  in the enterprise for at least ten years without a gap.</p>

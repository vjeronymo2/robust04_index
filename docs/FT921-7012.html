			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Hoare Govett Europe finds Netherlands buyer HOARE GOVETT, the UK stockbroker owned by the US bank Security Pacific, yesterday ended two years of speculation about its future by announcing that ABN Amro Bank of the Netherlands had agreed to be its new parent. The proposed takeover of Hoare Govett's European operations, including its large client list of British blue chip companies, marks the Dutch group's most energetic push into European investment banking since it was formed in 1990 by the merger of ABN and Amro. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Security Pacific will recover most of its capital of about Pounds 70m tied up in stockbroking. Even after the sale of Hoare Govett's remaining Asian businesses, Security Pacific is still likely to have lost more than half of its total investment of some Pounds 100m. It bought control of Hoare Govett in December 1984, and took full ownership in 1987. Security Pacific's results for the fourth quarter of 1991 included a Dollars 65m (Pounds 37m) writedown on its investment in the broker in anticipation of a sale. Since Security Pacific merged with Bank of America last October and the two Californian banks decided that UK stockbroking had no place in their future, Hoare Govett has courted half-a-dozen potential backers. However, serious talks with ABN Amro did not begin until last month. One obstacle had been the desire of Hoare Govett's management to preserve a role in the firm's direction. Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman, said yesterday that the deal had the full support of management and that the broking firm would operate independently within ABN Amro. 'We expect the relationship to work very well - they're only an hour away,' he added. Last month Hoare Govett cut 60 staff from its workforce of 440, seen by other stockbrokers as a necessary step for a deal. ABN Amro decided not to buy Hoare Govett's Asian operations because the group already has a presence in Asia. The Asian businesses, which employ several hundred people, are now searching separately for potential backers. At the time of Hoare Govett's unsuccessful management buy-out in late 1990, they were estimated to be worth half the European businesses. ABN Amro already has banking and broking operations in France through majority stakes in Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet and Massonaud Fontenay, in Holland under in its own name and through the Pierson Heldring &amp; Pierson investment bank, and under its own name in Germany and Switzerland.

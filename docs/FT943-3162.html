			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / ECC looks for acquisitions to build up speciality chemicals English China Clays, the UK minerals and chemicals group, said yesterday it was prepared to make acquisitions worth up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) to build up its speciality chemicals business. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said: 'That is the next stage for us - to start an acquisition build-up as well as organic growth.' The group, which in June demerged Camas, its construction materials arm, also said it was beginning to see scope for price increases in the buoyant European paper market. Mr Teare said: 'We are seeing our customer base starting to get into a more healthy financial state. We have had to restrain our desire for price increases. We have shared the pain, now we should share the gain.' ECC reported a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 52.2m in the six months to June 30, including a Pounds 21.6m contribution from land sales by the group's construction division. Camas reported increased pre-tax profits yesterday, up from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m. The group's speciality minerals business, ECC International (ECCI), improved operating profits in Europe, but offset this by declines in the Americas and Pacific. ECCI's sales of European-sourced minerals increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 217m, with strong growth in both the paper and ceramics markets, aided by an increase in sales of US-sourced clays in Europe. Operating profit rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 22.8m and underlying trading margins improved from 9.7 to 13.1 per cent. This was achieved in spite of incurring Pounds 5.7m of reorganisation costs. Mr Teare said more than 300 jobs had been shed in the first half and 486 since June last year - representing 11 per cent of the group's workforce. In ECCI's Americas and Pacific division, sales increased by 3 per cent to Dollars 217.1m, but operating profit fell 15 per cent to Dollars 23.3m. Margins fell from 13 to 10.7 per cent. It blamed lower pricing to the paper industry,higher distribution costs for Georgia clays and lower plant utilisation for expanded US clay operations. Details; Camas results, Page 23</p>

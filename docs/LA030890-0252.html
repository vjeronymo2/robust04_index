			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MOGUL BEHIND PATHE'S BID;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: ITALIAN FINANCIER GIANCARLO PARRETTI HAS AMASSED AN EMPIRE OF TV  AND MOVIE STUDIOS. BUT SKEPTICS SAY HIS COMPANY LACKS THE FINANCES TO BUY  MGM/UA.  </P> <P> Hollywood doesn't always embrace aspiring film moguls, and many were skeptical  when Giancarlo Parretti came to town in 1987 with a bankroll and an ambition to  build the next important film company.  </P> <P> In 1988, the Italian financier won control of Cannon Group, a struggling  mini-studio, and on Wednesday his Pathe Communications announced plans to buy  MGM/UA Communications for $1 billion. With these and other purchases, Parretti  has assembled a diversified international entertainment empire of film  libraries, TV and movie studios, and theaters.  </P> <P> But he hasn't convinced the skeptics.  </P> <P> Parretti, 48, a one-time waiter with a cheerful manner and a murky past, still  must persuade Hollywood and Wall Street that he can complete the deal and  rebuild a frail MGM to the kind of health that will make the studio worthy of  its great name.  </P> <P> "He said he'd announce a deal, and now he has," said one Hollywood film  executive, who asked to remain unidentified. "But will it close?"  </P> <P> Pathe's ability to finance such a deal "is not apparent from its balance  sheet," says analyst Jeffrey Logsdon, of the Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co.  investment firm. "You've got to wonder."  </P> <P> And others on Wall Street apparently shared Logsdon's view, for MGM's stock  closed Wednesday at $17.75 a share, significantly below the company's offering  price of $20.  </P> <P> Parretti, who was said to be flying to Europe on Wednesday and unavailable for  comment, has in recent years faced questions not only about his business  prospects but also about the sources of his funds and his past business  practices. He has been accused in publications here and abroad of money  laundering and Mafia ties and has successfully brought a series of libel suits  in Europe to defend himself.  </P> <P> The son of an olive merchant from the Umbrian hill town of Orvieto, Italy,  Parretti is a short, chunky man who began trying to speak English only two  years ago. But if he hasn't yet mastered the language, he appears to have  quickly learned the life style of Hollywood magnates.  </P> <P> Last year, he bought an $8.9-million Beverly Hills mansion, which he decorated  with paintings by Goya, Picasso and Miro. He has a taste for Rolls-Royce sedans  and fine cigars, and he owns a mahogany desk once used by MGM boss L. B. Mayer.  </P> <P> Questions about the extent of his financial resources have been raised as he  has bid several times without success for Hollywood properties.  </P> <P> After paying $200 million for control of Cannon, Parretti last year bid  unsuccessfully for three struggling independent studios: New World  Entertainment, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Kings Road Entertainment.  Also last year, Parretti was among a long line of companies that bid  unsuccessfully for MGM/UA.  </P> <P> But though the first MGM bid failed, Parretti made an important alliance when  he hired Alan Ladd Jr., MGM's former production boss, to head his newly formed  U.S. production company, which he had named Pathe Communications. While  Parretti's abilities as a studio head are open to question, Ladd knows MGM, has  Hollywood's respect and presumably the kind of relationships that Pathe will  need to turn MGM around.  </P> <P> Pathe itself controls a film library of more than 1,200 titles, a theater  network with more than 1,000 screens in five countries, film studios in Italy  and a film laboratory in France. Much of these assets came from Parretti's 1989  acquisition of Pathe Cinema, France's oldest film company, for $160 million.  </P> <P> For the nine months that ended last Sept. 30, Pathe reported a loss of $54.6  million on revenue of $276 million.  </P> <P> As Parretti became more visible in Hollywood, he has repeatedly been forced to  deny allegations about his past.  </P> <P> Last March, Parretti issued a statement to denounce a story in Business Week  magazine that said he had indirect ties to at least one Mafia family and that  accused him and Pathe Chairman Florio Fiorini of money laundering through a  network of private foreign holding companies. Fiorini, a partner on a number of  deals, has become well known in Italy for quickly buying and selling companies  in the manner of some American corporate raiders.  </P> <P> The Business Week story, which Parretti denounced as "riddled with false  statements," said the pair had been implicated in a series of financial  scandals in France and Italy, and it quoted business associates and government  officials as saying that they had built their fortune "from business deals  arranged by high-ranking government officials."  </P> <P> The story said that early in his career, Parretti had been forced to take a job  as a waiter on a transatlantic liner after he was accused of falsifying balance  sheets at an Italian hotel he managed.  </P> <P> In interviews, Parretti has ridiculed accusations that his wealth was derived  from the Mafia, saying such charges reflected only jealousy.  </P> <P> In last November's quarterly report to shareholders, Pathe said the company has  won four libel judgments in French courts, against such publications as  L'Express and Nouvel Observateur. In an unusual aside, the report to  shareholders said Parretti's "sole purpose in initiating these legal actions  was vindication against defamation, disparagement, indirect harassment and  innuendo. Having won these judgments, it is hoped that future reporting will  aim toward a higher level of accuracy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MGM/UA AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> NET INCOME/LOSS in millions of dollars (fiscal year ended Aug. 31)  </P> <P> Wednesday close (NYSE): $17.75, up $3.75  </P> <P> 52-week range: $10.75-$23.125  </P> <P> Shareholders of record: 1,690  </P> <P> Common stock: 51 million shares (72% owned by Kirk Kerkorian)  </P> <P> Total assets: 1.31 billion (Aug. 31, 1989)  </P> <P> Current titles: "Blue Steel," with Jamie Lee Curtis; "Lisa," with Cheryl Ladd;  "Daddy's Dyin'," with Beau Bridges and Tess Harper; "Rocky V," with Sylvester  Stallone  </P> <P> Film library: 1,000 titles, mostly from United Artists  </P> <P> Headquarters: Culver City  </P> <P> Chief executive: Jeffrey C.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- A message of greetings to  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at a Malian  joint seminar on the chuche idea and education which took place  in Bamako.    Noting that Comrade Kim Chong-il is a brilliant thinker and  theoretician, outstanding statesman and illustrious leader, the  message said it was thanks to his wise guidance that the heroic  Korean people were firmly defending their anthropocentric  socialism with the might of the singlehearted unity of the  leader, the party and the masses without any vacillation in face  of the heinous moves of the imperialists and reactionaries to  isolate and stifle socialist Korea.    It expressed invariable support and solidarity for the  Korean  people's struggle to defend the sovereignty of their country and  their national dignity and achieve the reunification of the  country.    It wished Comrade Kim Chong-il good health and a long life.</p>

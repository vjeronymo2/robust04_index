			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Marriage that makes sense: Robert Peston examines a comeback by Morgan Grenfell It was not exactly love at first sight. But Mr John Craven, chairman of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, will never forget an autumn night three years ago when Mr Rolf Breuer, a Deutsche Bank executive, asked: 'Should we be talking?' The venue was Washington, where both were attending the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Two months later, Morgan and Deutsche were engaged to be married, amid predictions from some friends and rivals that disaster would follow. Deutsche was paying far too much (Pounds 950m), they said, for a merchant bank whose business it could not possibly understand - and anyway, Morgan was in inexorable decline. Three years later, the bridegroom feels vindicated. Morgan yesterday disclosed a record financial performance for 1992, while profits of UK rivals, such as Barings and S G Warburg, are under pressure. 'As far back as the records show, we have never done as well, in terms of the after-tax return on capital, which was 15 per cent,' said Mr Michael Dobson, Morgan's chief executive. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 80.2m, 49 per cent higher than the previous year, would also have been a record, if the bank had not made contributions of several million pounds to a scheme designed to pay bonuses to staff over the next few years. The performance was surprising because only a few years ago Morgan appeared a spent force. In the mid-1980s, it became embroiled in two financial scandals, the Guinness affair and an insider trading case. It also made a series of poor acquisitions in preparation for Big Bang, the 1986 de-regulation of the UK securities markets. By the beginning of 1987, the institution seemed to be irreversibly deteriorating. Following the scandals, Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, pressured Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, to force the resignation of Mr Christopher Reeves, Morgan's chief executive, and Mr Graham Walsh, head of the corporate finance department, which had traditionally been responsible for 80 per cent of group profits. There were widespread predictions in the City that Morgan's clients, which included many of the UK's biggest companies, would desert en masse and that the bank would wither. Mr Craven's arrival in mid-1987 started the rebuilding process. Clients stopped leaving and Morgan's financial performance was stabilised after he sold or closed all seven businesses bought over the previous five years, including its UK equity trading businesses. But it took five years for the bank to regain some of its former sparkle and confidence. Rivals today acknowledge that Morgan has made a comeback. Mr Win Bischoff, chief executive of Schroders, the merchant bank, said: 'It seems to me they are doing well.' Morgan's record profits have come at a time when there is overcapacity in the merchant banking business, particularly in the area of advice to UK companies on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), which for decades was the dominant activity within Morgan. In London, there are a dozen well-established merchant banks chasing a shrinking amount of M&amp;A business. UK companies are questioning whether takeovers are sensible given the uncertain outlook for the economy. Morgan's comeback is also noteworthy because commercial banks have traditionally been bad owners of investment banks or securities firms. Big banks from Asia, the US, continental Europe and the UK have all bought City firms over the past few years and most have made low or negative returns on their investments. Most commercial banks have not been able to resist the temptation to meddle with their newly acquired businesses. They have often placed their own managers in charge of the firms or tried to integrate them with existing operations. The results have sometimes been disastrous, primarily because lending bankers rarely have investment banking skills. In contrast to many other commercial banks, however, Deutsche took a long-term view of its investment. 'In our planning, we said to ourselves that we thought the results would go down in 1990 and would still be disappointing in 1991,' Mr Hilmar Kopper, speaker of Deutsche's board of managing directors, said. 'Our main disappointment is that our judgment was right.' Deutsche stuck to its position and has not encroached on Morgan's autonomy. Mr Kopper said: 'We recognised that we should not impose Deutsche Bank culture and German style on the businesses we buy. All business has strong local characteristics, especially in our trade.' Morgan has continued to be run by Mr Craven and by Mr Dobson, who has been at Morgan since 1973. Mr Kopper says Deutsche's main involvement is in assessing Morgan's budget at the beginning of each financial year. Since it took over, Morgan's business has become better balanced. Mr Dobson said that more than half Morgan's revenues are generated outside the UK. Perhaps more important, its corporate finance department, whose speciality is M&amp;A, is no longer the dominant force in generating profits. Equally important departments are asset management, which manages funds totalling more than Pounds 20bn, money market trading, various forms of sophisticated commercial banking (such as raising funds for big infrastructure projects) and the trading of less developed countries' debt. Profits which stem directly from working jointly with Deutsche are small, Mr Dobson said. 'You can interpret that in different ways,' he added. 'Either we are not doing enough or there is plenty of scope to grow.' The main benefit to date for Morgan of ownership by Deutsche is that it has been freed of the short-term performance imperatives it experienced as a public company. There are several more tangible advantages. As an independent, for example, it could never have become the world's biggest trader of less developed countries' debt. But the team it recruited from Libra, the international consortium bank, in 1991, was able to trade with Deutsche's portfolio of poor-performing loans to developing countries. Similary, Morgan could never on its own have become the leading adviser to German companies on M&amp;A. The maxim of Mr Kopper and Mr Craven is 'co-operation not integration' between the two organisations. They accept that their investment banking businesses have an unusually complex structure, in that Deutsche's substantial securities trading operations are managed independently of Morgan's M&amp;A businesses. Indeed the structure is about to become more complicated, because Mr Kopper said Deutsche is planning within a few days to hive off the activity of giving advice to companies on new issues of securities from its corporate finance division into a separate primary markets department. But Mr Craven is adamant: 'There will not be a big bang integration of the businesses.' Big bangs, as most commercial banks admit today, can often cause big headaches.</p>

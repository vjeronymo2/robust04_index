			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / No peace for hippies: Alternative lifestylers love Cork. But increasingly, the feeling is not reciprocated WEST Cork, in the Irish Republic, has a reputation for peace and tranquillity; a kindlier way of life. Recently it has begun to attract some unconventional settlers. Drawn by the availability of small tracts of land, and the (often mistaken) impression of dole on demand, they have deserted England for Ireland - and found their prospects equally bleak. These young, jobless English settlers live in old buses, caravans, or tepees of the type popular with their 1960s' soul-mates in west Wales's Teifi valley. But as recession has gained a grip on England, especially, many native Irish have had to return home - perhaps as many as 25,000 in the past year. Often, they have no work and little money, swelling further the numbers who depend on benefits. In rural areas such as west Cork, a long-term solution to this dilemma is going to be hard to find. For those alternative lifestylers who do want it, work is near-impossible to find, particularily in the more remote areas, and dole is no longer the foregone conclusion many new arrivals imagined it to be. Recently, a young Englishman living in the Skibbereen area was denied relief on the ground that he had 'deliberately made yourself unavailable for work by moving to a rural area.' He believes, however, that the decision was based more on the way he looks and the fact that he is not an Irish national. He claims some local officials are showing a growing hostility towards his kind. Local people increasingly are uneasy about the numbers of alternative lifestylers arriving in their area and fear an influx of drugs, sheep-worrying, by dogs unused to their free-ranging sheep, and an increase in petty crime. They have the uneasy sense that, somehow, west Cork has become a Mecca for people with a value system very different from their own. After a combined police/customs action in Bantry - which many believe was designed to shake up the new arrivals - a leading solicitor said publicly that he was 'increasingly concerned about the amount of non-nationals settling in the area.' It was understood generally that he was not referring to the more affluent owners of shore-front homes. 'We're used to people who look different, practise strange religions, and want to live in tents in the woods,' said one Glengarriff local. 'But, just lately, these people coming in seem to have changed. They don't have the easy-going attitude hippies had 10 years ago. And some of them are dirtier, arrogant. They really seem to think the world owes them a living.' Andy Ridgeway, a newly- arrived alternative lifestyler, says his friends in England regard west Cork as a great place to live, uncrowded and undemanding. 'Most of the people I know who have come here are fed up with the political climate in England. And there's not much chance of jobs there, anyway. We buy buses, caravans, put whatever money we can raise into converting them. Then we go on the road, do odd jobs, travel. We can't afford to buy places or pay rent, so what else is there for us? 'A lot of people I know have been called in on dole reviews, asked why they came here in the first place, and told they should go back to wherever they came from. And it always seems to be non-nationals. If we're all part of the EC now, though, how can they ask people questions like that? And what would happen if they started throwing Irish people off the dole in England for similar reasons?' If living in a rural area is to be accepted as valid grounds for denial of benefit, it is not only non-nationals who could be in trouble.</p>

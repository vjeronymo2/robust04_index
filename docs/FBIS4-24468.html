			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Sichuan Province, the largest pork producer in China, marketed  18.1 million head of pigs in the first three months of this year.    Making up one third of the total pork output of the country,  Sichuan supplied other provinces with about one million tons of  pork last year.    As pig raising is profitable, more and more farmers are  taking to it. At present, more than 60 percent of the local  farmers' cash revenue comes from sales of pigs.    Meanwhile, the local government has drawn up favorable  policies to encourage the farmers to raise more pigs and  popularize new technology in this field. Twenty counties have  been chosen to be built into lean pork export bases.    The province is also paying attention to pork processing and  trading in a bid to improve economic efficiency.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Peel Holdings advances 34% and shares rise 23p PEEL HOLDINGS, the prop-erty company, has defied the recession with a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.4m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 7.01m, on turnover down from Pounds 76.2m to Pounds 68.1m. The shares rose 23p yesterday to close at 233p. Fully diluted net assets per share of the company, which also controls the separately-listed Manchester Ship Canal, rose by 9p over the year to 315p. After a tax charge this time of Pounds 2.1m, against a credit last time of Pounds 5.63m, earnings per share were 2.41p (8.01p). The board is recommending a final dividend of 3p, making a total for the year of 4p (3p). The company attributed its ability to survive the recession to the sectoral diversity and geographical spread of its property portfolio and its ability to generate windfall profits from sale of dominant landholdings. Mr John Whittaker, chairman, said: 'There are now signs of improvement in the property market and it would be safe to assume the worst is now over.' At the year end shareholders' funds were up Pounds 1.52m at Pounds 303.5m and net borrowings were static at Pounds 336.1m (Pounds 335.1m). Gearing rose to 99.2 per cent, compared with 94.6 per cent. Peel's confidence can be gauged from its voluntary cancellation of Pounds 50m of bank facilities last November and its intention to repay Pounds 75m to its consortium of bankers this November. New facilities have recently been negotiated at Pounds 30m for up to three years and Peel is investigating taking on more fixed rate borrowings while the climate is favourable. Property sales realised Pounds 56.53m at a profit of Pounds 3.38m, bringing the sales during the last three years to Pounds 265m in spite of recession. Mr Whittaker said the sales had reduced debt, funded the acquisition of more of the Ship Canal and increase profits at a time when interest rates on variable borrowings exceeded relevant rental income. Peel's Ship Canal stake is now 82 per cent, bought mainly from Mr Whittaker's private family interests Oversupply and weak demand in the office and industrial sectors meant fresh voids of Pounds 1.59m on unlet property more than offset new rental income of Pounds 1.26m. Mr Whittaker said total voids were 'unacceptably high' at Pounds 6m, of which Pounds 1.7m is concentrated in Salford Quays, Greater Manchester's equivalent of London docklands. Peel said there had been strong interest from leading retailers in the Trafford Centre, which it plans to build on 300 acres owned by the Ship Canal at Dumplington on the edge of Trafford Park. Mr Whittaker said he was confident a High Court appeal by eight local authorities against planning permission for the centre would fail, as arguments about protecting existing town centre shops were a repeat of those at previous public inquiries.</p>

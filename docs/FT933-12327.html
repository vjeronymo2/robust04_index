			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Ex-Ferruzzi chief in apparent suicide MR RAUL GARDINI, 60-year-old former chairman of Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private sector company, was found in his Milan apartment yesterday with a single shot to the head, an apparent suicide. Mr Gardini was rushed to the first-aid unit of a nearby hospital, where he was dead on arrival. Magistrates were investigating Mr Gardini among others over alleged corruption and illicit financing of political parties. Yesterday afternoon an arrest warrant was issued for Mr Carlo Sama, the former chief executive officer of Montedison, the controlling company of Ferruzzi. Mr Sama is married to a daughter of the late Serafino Ferruzzi, the company's founder. Warrants were also issued for Mr Vittorio Giuliani Ricci, brother-in-law of the late Mr Gardini, Mr Sergio Cusani, a close associate of Mr Gardini with links to the Socialist party, and Mr Giuseppe Berlini, who manages the Ferruzzi family finances. Mr Sama was charged with falsifying the 1992 Montedison accounts which reported an unexplained L320bn (Pounds 134m) extra loss after shareholders had approved the balance sheet. Mr Gardini's death was discovered just two hours before a funeral service began in a nearby church for Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. Mr Cagliari committed suicide on Tuesday in his cell in Milan's San Vittore prison where he had been held since March on corruption charges. Mr Gardini and Mr Cagliari were rivals in the lengthy battle for control of Enimont, the chemicals joint venture set up between Ferruzzi's Montedison chemicals subsidiary and Eni in 1989. Hailed as a long-overdue attempt to create a world-class Italian chemicals group, management of the joint venture soon deteriorated into a lengthy war of attrition between the two sides. Magistrates investigating Enimont suspect that the events surrounding its launch and its eventual dissolution in late 1990, when Eni bought out Montedison's 40 per cent share, hide some of the worst excesses in Italy's 17-month-old political corruption scandal. The Enimont affair may already have contributed to the suicide this year of Mr Sergio Castellari, the top civil servant in the former Ministry of State Shareholdings, closely involved in the formation and dissolution of the joint venture. Mr Castel-lari's body was found on a hillside near his Rome home. Mr Gardini's death was almost certainly prompted by the return to Italy last week of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, a former Montedison executive. Mr Garofano, who went into hiding this year after being told by magistrates he was under investigation over a L250m contribution to the Christian Democrat party, was arrested in Geneva last week. He was apparently on his way back to Italy to give himself up. On Thursday night, an Italian news magazine released an extract of leaked testimony from Mr Garofano, accusing Mr Gardini of various financial irregularities at Montedison. Mr Garofano reportedly confirmed suspicions that creating and dissolving Enimont involved kickbacks to politicians and that Mr Gardini had authorised property transactions to create a pool of L80bn-L100bn in off-balance-sheet funds to pay kickbacks. However, pressure had been mounting on Mr Gardini after his name was formally added to those under investigation over Enimont earlier this year, before Mr Garofano's return to Italy.

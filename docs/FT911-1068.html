			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Polly Peck aims to avoid break-up THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International are to submit proposals to continue operating the bulk of the fresh-fruit-to-electronics group as a single entity at the long-awaited creditors' meeting later this month. But they will propose selling certain 'non-essential affiliates' and, 'if possible', existing investments in northern Cyprus and Turkey. This seems to suggest that the administrators, who were appointed last November, will try to soldier on without disposing of either Del Monte or Sansui, Polly Peck's two flagship subsidiaries. The summary proposals emerged from the text of a full-page advertisement, aimed at the group's bondholders, which is being carried in today's Swiss press. A full list of proposals, together with a 20-page administrators' report, should reach the group's approximately 100 banking and 28,000 commercial creditors later today. The proposals will be submitted to creditors in the form of a single resolution on May 24. Polly Peck has extensive fruit, electronics, leisure and packaging interests in the Near and Middle East, which in 1989 contributed more than two-thirds of the group's Pounds 161.4m in reported pre-tax profits. However, administrators have been frustrated in their efforts to build up a full financial picture of the group's activities in the region, and in particular to track down interests worth Pounds 200m which the company said were located in northern Cyprus. It is not specified in the summary proposals which of the assets they propose to sell. In March they said they hoped to float the Turkish and Cypriot leisure subsidiaries on the Istanbul stock exchange. The May 24 meeting will also see the appointment of a five-member creditors' committee and a 10-member secondary committee. However, the latter will have no formal powers. The new proposals have been made public in the wake of a concerted and puzzling buying spree of Polly Peck shares. The buying spate has extended to Zurich, where Polly Peck is still quoted; in London, the shares were suspended last September at 108p. Mr Asil Nadir, the group's Turkish Cypriot chairman, has said that he knows nothing about the buying spree.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / IRA's 'long arm' reaches for industry: The growing risk to economic targets THE IRA'S bomb attacks last week on a Gateshead gasholder and an Esso petrol and oil terminal in North Shields have highlighted the security problems terrorism poses for the owners of industrial installations. Such complexes offer terrorists an economic target, presenting the opportunity for dramatic, publicity-generating damage and serious disruption to business interests. After last Wednesday's explosion and fire, caused by an IRA attack at Tyneside's largest gasholder complex, Mr James Marris, chairman of British Gas Northern, admitted it was impossible to achieve total security at such a compound. 'I don't think we can stop anybody getting into any of these sites. A determined intruder can get in almost anywhere,' he said. 'The main thing is to detect it quickly enough to do something about it.' Esso, whose North Shields terminal has been attacked by the IRA twice in seven weeks, refused to discuss its security arrangements at the site, apart from confirming that it had round-the-clock cover. An Esso official, stressing the vast acreage of land covered by installations like oil refineries and petrochemical complexes, endorsed Mr Marris' comments. He said: 'I think he is expressing the views of everybody who is involved in running industrial complexes which have an element of risk about their operations or products.' In addition to ensuring that intruders can be quickly detected, management must ensure procedures are rigorously applied, the official added. Any breach of security demanded a very thorough investigation, he said, but he stopped short of suggesting that a repetition could be avoided. Lessons should be learned and action taken 'to make sure either it can't happen again or to make sure the risk is managed more tightly', he said. The Esso site is being closed, a decision taken before the first IRA attack. Most oil companies employ former police and Army officers as security advisers and many have contracted out their security. While many companies are reluctant to talk about their arrangements, British Petroleum said the recent bombs had led to the tightening of security at sensi-tive sites. 'It's just making people a lot more vigilant,' BP said. The three gasholders on the Gateshead site attacked last Wednesday have a total capacity of 7.7m cu ft. The compound is near homes and 400 people were evacuated for five hours after the explosion and fire. But Mr Marris insisted that gasholders, which resisted wartime bombing, were 'inherently safe structures'. The company said the gas in the holders would not explode unless it was mixed with air and their structure made that unlikely. British Gas has fallen victim to four IRA bombs - the recent Warrington bombing and two sites in London in the 1980s. 'It looks pretty dramatic,' the company said, 'which is why they target them, but the chances of someone being injured are pretty slim.' Northumbria police assistant chief constable Mr David Mellish said it appeared that the terrorists' aim at both sites was maximum damage and publicity, rather than injury. But because of the petrol and gas involved, there were potentially tremendous implications, he said. Tyneside has been targeted by the IRA before. Last May terrorists admitted planting incendiary devices at the MetroCentre shopping centre, barely a mile from the Gateshead gasholder site. The psychological impact of last week's IRA attacks on Tyneside's business community was compounded by the evacuation of Newcastle's Regent Centre office complex on Thursday after a telephoned coded warning to a local newspaper. The complex is the headquarters of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, Northumbrian Water and Northern Rock. Nothing was found. North-east England's good road infrastructure is normally cited as an attraction for inward investors but it is becoming evident that it is also a bonus for terrorists. Northumbria police last week noted the proximity to fast roads of the sites on Tyneside targeted by the IRA. The police declined to comment on speculation that an IRA cell might have been set up in the region. Newcastle University politics lecturer Mr David George, a terrorism specialist, believes that targeting north-east England, along with the north-west and London, helps the IRA promote its image of omnipotence. 'They want to show the IRA has a very long arm,' he said. One of the notable features of the region, which has 350 foreign-owned plants, is its strength in securing inward investment. It claims to be the principal European centre for manufacturing investment from the Far East. But Mr George warned management at these workplaces, as well as the operators of high-risk sites handling volatile substances, to beware of the IRA. He said high-profile plants such as Nissan could be attractive to publicity-seeking terrorists. They have already targeted foreign-owned plants in Northern Ireland, even though the IRA has not employed such a tactic in England yet.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fed approves Bank of Boston acquisitions BANK of Boston, the largest bank in Massachusetts, has been given approval by the US Federal Reserve to buy two New England banks, Multibank Financial and Society for Savings Bancorp. The Bank of Boston will pay with its own shares an equivalent of around Dollars 232m for Multibank, and Dollars 215m for Society for Savings. The two banks would add Dollars 4.8bn to Bank of Boston's existing assets of Dollars 32bn. The purchase is still conditional on approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation, but this is expected to be a formality. Bank of Boston had to promise to raise around Dollars 170m in new capital to win approval from the Federal Reserve for the purchase of Multibank. Two Federal Board governors opposed the authorisation, on the grounds that the promise to raise new capital was not part of the Bank of Boston's original application. The two members believed the addition of new information after the original application 'impairs the integrity of the Board's decision-making process'.</p>

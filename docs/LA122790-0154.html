			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROTC UNDER ATTACK BY GAY ACTIVISTS AND FACULTY SENATE;  </P> <P> MILITARY: ACTIVISTS WANT TO BAN THE CORPS AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH. BUT ARMY AND  AIR FORCE OFFICERS SAY THEY ARE MERELY FOLLOWING FEDERAL POLICY.  </P> <P> A squad of ROTC students at Cal State Long Beach spent a recent Tuesday  preparing for war.  </P> <P> They attended classes on military history and troop management, then stood at  attention in a campus quad to hear announcements and salute their superiors.  After marching in formation out to an athletic field, they performed a series  of exercises, including push-ups and sit-ups.  </P> <P> Lately, however, the cadets and officials of the Reserve Officer Training Corps  have been under verbal attack -- from an outspoken group of students and  professors who want the program banned from campus because it discriminates  against homosexuals, a violation of university policy.  </P> <P> One of the critics, Jack Munsee, a physics professor, recently persuaded the  campus Academic Senate, an advisory group of elected faculty representatives,  to initiate proceedings that could eventually result in the program's ouster.  </P> <P> "I never want it said of me that I was silent over this injustice," Munsee  said.  </P> <P> ROTC officials, most of whom are in the military, say they are following  Defense Department rules banning gays from military service. Homosexual  students are allowed to take ROTC classes for academic credit at Cal State Long  Beach and most other colleges, but they are not eligible for the $100-per-month  stipend that most upper-division participants receive. They also are not  allowed to become regular cadets their third year, the time when most  participants promise to become military officers upon graduation.  </P> <P> "We serve two masters, a civilian boss on campus and a military boss in  (Washington)," said Lt. Col. Andrew Peterson, a professor of military science  and director of the university's Army ROTC. "What we have here is a conflict  between the Department of Defense and the university, with the ROTC in the  middle."  </P> <P> But he made it clear which master has more clout. "I have to enforce government  policy," he said.  </P> <P> ROTC students and administrators said their program provides a valuable service  and ought to be preserved.  </P> <P> Peterson pointed out that ROTC contributes a stream of liberally educated  officers with roots in civilian life. ROTC students and administrators also  argue that an ROTC ban would discriminate against students who depend on the  program for scholarships and to pave the way for a military career. Many of  these students are minorities, he added.  </P> <P> The ROTC controversy first erupted at Cal State Northridge, then spread to  other California State University campuses.  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge Faculty Senate voted to eliminate the ROTC program  there because of its adherence to the Defense Department's anti-gay policy.  Northridge President James W. Cleary eventually rejected the recommendation,  citing an opinion by university lawyers that there was no legal basis for doing  away with ROTC.  </P> <P> Cleary wrote that, while he personally found the anti-homosexual policy  "deplorable" and worthy of abolition, "banning an academic program simply  because we are in disagreement with a policy of a profession which is serviced  by this program is antithetical to the nature of an open university."  </P> <P> The issue then was taken up by the state Academic Senate, consisting of faculty  representatives from all 19 California State University campuses. The group  adopted a resolution condemning the Defense Department and urged faculties of  each campus to begin taking steps to remove ROTC if the department policy is  not rescinded by Jan. 1. Local ROTC officials say they have received no  indication the department plans to change its policy.  </P> <P> Faculty groups at Cal State Hayward, Cal State Pomona and Cal State Bakersfield  have also passed anti-ROTC resolutions. One private institution, Pitzer College  in Claremont, banned ROTC earlier this year.  </P> <P> Ultimately, each university president will decide ROTC's fate.  </P> <P> Campus officer training programs throughout the country were attacked in the  late 1960s and early 1970s by opponents of the Vietnam War. Some programs were  closed, and others experienced dwindling enrollments.  </P> <P> The first ROTC programs were established only six years ago at Cal State Long  Beach, however. About 150 students participate in Army and Air Force ROTC  programs on campus.  </P> <P> Physics professor Munsee led the ROTC protest, and found support among members  of the campus Gay and Lesbian Student Union, who cited studies that they said  indicate that the presence of homosexuals in the military would not hamper  national defense.  </P> <P> "As long as there is discrimination going on for one person or small group of  people, then it's possible for discrimination to go on against others," said  Heather Haskell, the organization's treasurer. "We should fight discrimination  on all levels."  </P> <P> Two months ago, after a spirited debate, the campus Academic Senate approved  the resolution endorsing the state faculty's position and initiating the  procedure for discontinuing ROTC.  </P> <P> In accordance with university procedure, the group voted to form a committee to  hold hearings on the issue and submit a report next fall to university  president Curtis L. McCray, who will make the final decision.  </P> <P> McCray says he has an open mind on the subject. "We are attempting to give  everybody an equal shake and if any of our programs, either directly or de  facto, have impact on students because of their differences, then (those  programs) have to be looked at."  </P> <P> In the meantime, the ROTC students continue their program. While many say that  they would have no personal qualms about serving on military duty with open  homosexuals, opinion is somewhat divided on whether the government's anti-gay  policy ought to be changed.  </P> <P> "I don't think they're a legitimate minority," said Joe Ingram, a 26-year-old  political science major in the last semester of the four-year program. "These  people have chosen to be a minority and therefore shouldn't receive the kind of  benefits that legitimate minorities receive."  </P> <P> Lisa Pantano, a 28-year-old fine arts major who already has been commissioned  as an Army lieutenant, disagrees. "Personally, I don't think sexual orientation  should have anything to do with it," she said. "There are already a lot of  slime-ball heterosexuals in the service."  </P> <P> Some of the cadets acknowledge, however, that they are a bit concerned about  ROTC's uncertain future on campus.  </P> <P> "If worse comes to worse," said Joselito Sto Thomas, 28, "we'll just go to UCLA  and drill over there. (But) that would be a major hassle."  </P></p>

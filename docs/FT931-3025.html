			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Disincentive removed over foreigners - Relocation Packages This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. PROPOSALS TO change the tax treatment of relocation packages offered to employees who make job-related house moves will remove a disincentive for companies to bring foreign nationals to work in the UK and reduce the cost of what had become a very expensive relief, the Treasury said yesterday. It said there would be two changes. Tax relief for removal expenses and benefits will be put on to a statutory basis and limited to Pounds 8,000 per move. Relief will be available whether or not an employee sells his or her old home. Tax relief for additional housing cost payments will be withdrawn. The changes will apply to employees who start a new job or move with their existing employer on or after April 6 1993, but there will be transitional arrangements for employees who are already committed to moving. The existing extra-statutory reliefs will be available for employees who start new jobs before April 6 1993. Under the terms of extra-statutory concession A5 an employee is not taxed on certain removal expenses which an employer pays or re-imburses or on certain benefits which an employer provides if the employee has to change residence either as a result of a job transfer with the existing employer or to take up a new employment. Relief is available only where it would be unreasonable to expect the employee to work at the new location without moving nearer to it and provided the employee disposes of any interest in his or her home at the old location. The Inland Revenue interprets 'change of residence' as meaning that the employee must sell his or her old home. The chancellor proposed that these conditions should be broadly matched in the statutory relief. But there will be some important changes. There will be a ceiling of Pounds 8,000 on the relief available to set against the costs of each move. Employees will no longer be required to sell their old home to qualify for relief. Payments by employers to compensate employees for losses on sale of their old homes will not qualify for relief. The categories of help given by employers to employees who move house which will be covered by the proposed statutory relief include: Selling the old home - for example, legal fees and estate agent services. Buying or renting the new home - for example, legal fees and stamp duty. Removal of furniture and effects; assistance with travel and subsistence costs incurred in connection with the move, for example, journeys undertaken to find a home at the new location and the provision of temporary accommodation at the new location before a permanent move. Provision of replacement goods, services and facilities  - for example, the replacement of carpets and curtains which are not suitable for removal to the new home. Bridging loans; and services of relocation management (or similar) companies. The new rules will apply to moves relating to jobs started on or after 6 April 1993. Under transitional arrangements, payments made and benefits provided on or after April 6 will continue to qualify for extra-statutory tax relief provided the employee has entered into a firm commitment to move before April 6 and starts the job at the new location before August 1. To determine whether an employee satisfies the first condition, the Inland Revenue will need evidence either that the employer has given formal notification of the job transfer or that the employee is committed to accepting the job transfer. Extra-statutory concession A67 exempts from tax certain payments to employees by employers towards the additional housing costs - increased mortgage interest or rent - incurred as a result of moving with their jobs to more expensive housing areas. Tax relief is available only when payments are made for a limited period, reduce year by year and do not in total exceed a prescribed maximum. The maximum has varied from time to time in line with changes to the amount payable to civil servants under their additional housing costs allowance. The present maximum, which has applied since February 1, is Pounds 13,440. At the chancellor's request, the Board of Inland Revenue will withdraw this extra-statutory concession with effect from April 6. Under transitional arrangements tax relief will continue for any employees who have entered into a firm commitment to move with their jobs to a more expensive housing area before April 6 and who then start their job at the new location before August 1.</p>

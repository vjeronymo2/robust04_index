			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, March 25 (XINHUA) -- Sources close to the  PLO said today that Israel has agreed on dispatching 50  lightly-armed Norwegian international observers and another 50  Palestinian policemen to the West Bank town of Hebron.    However, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) demands  dispatching an international-observer battalion of about 400  persons and a Palestinian battalion of the same size.    The sources told XINHUA that this is the first time for  Israel to agree on dispatching lightly-armed international  observers to the occupied West Bank.    This agreement came in the context of a draft accord  achieved  between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations after a 14-hour  negotiation in Cairo Thursday [24 March].    The PLO-Israeli talks on the implementation of the September  13 PLO-Israeli peace agreement was stalled in the wake of the  February 25 massacre, in which a Jewish settler gunned down some  40 Palestinian worshipers at a mosque in Hebron.    The sources said the PLO has not agreed so far on the number  of Palestinian policemen and international observers as Israel  did.    The Cairo talks focused on dispatching international armed  observers to Hebron, early access of Palestinian policemen to  Hebron, nominating a municipality head of Hebron town by the PLO  and evacuating 42 Jewish families from Hebron.    The sources said that Israel agreed in principle on the  evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron to Keriat Arba'  settlement near Hebron.    The PLO calls for dispatching a total of 1,500 international  observers to the occupied Palestinian territories.    The sources said the PLO-Israeli negotiations are expected  to  resume next week.</p>

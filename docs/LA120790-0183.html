			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIEGHBORHOOD PROFILE: SOUTH ROSSMOOR  </P> <P> The mailing address may read "Los Alamitos" or "Seal Beach," but this  particular neighborhood is all Rossmoor.  </P> <P> The unincorporated community of Rossmoor is precariously snuggled between Seal  Beach and Los Alamitos and nestled between public and private interests.  Through it all, though, Rossmoor has hung onto its identity with the Yankee  Doodle intensity of a small entity that doesn't want to be fused with its  larger neighbors. And several of the political tugs-of-war have been centered  on this south-end neighborhood.  </P> <P> One could almost subtitle the place "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," but there  are no trains. There are planes, though -- in this case helicopters.  </P> <P> Late last year, the Army Corps of Engineers considered designating south  Rossmoor an "APZ" -- that's military talk for "accident potential zone." The  community sits squarely beneath the takeoff pattern for the Armed Forces  Reserve Center airfield, making it an ideal candidate for a "crash zone." The  engineers withdrew their recommendation, however, when the town officials came  at them in a fury, vehemently contending that kind of designation would harm  prospects for new development and negatively affect property values.  </P> <P> As for automobiles, the community battled the county and the state for more  than a decade to get sound walls constructed along the San Diego (405) and San  Gabriel River (605) freeways. The decibel level from cars and trucks whizzing  by, plus the irritation of stranded motorists hiking through back yards instead  of to call boxes, again brought out the community activism in south Rossmoor  residents. In January, they got good news: the Orange County Transportation  Commission had voted to appropriate $2 million for the project.  </P> <P> "We fight for issues. We're true community activists," said Art Becker, vice  president of the Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. But it's not all hard-fought  battles. There's plenty of time for relaxing here. And the hub of activity is  the Rossmoor Shopping Center. It is a major source of sales tax revenue and one  of the largest entertainment venues for local residents.  </P> <P> It is amusing to note that the same neighborhood whose average household income  is well over $67,000 yearly also boasts some of the cheapest movies in the  county -- the Super Saver 7 Cinemas where feature films are "$1.50 for any  movie, any time."  </P> <P> The movies are inexpensive, so people flock to the theater, and that increases  foot traffic for the rest of the mall, which includes a butcher, a baker but no  candlestick maker. There's also a shoe repair, dry cleaners, hardware store,  various clothing stores, supermarket, drugstore, a golf shop and several banks  and restaurants.  </P> <P> Sounds kind of quiet and middle-American, but life is rarely dull in the  neighborhood. From time to time, something happens to upset the area's  calmness. The bank, Marie Callender's, the liquor store, jewelry store, a  clothing store, Thrifty's and even Baskin-Robbins have all been hit by robbers  at one time or another.  </P> <P> There were also a couple of "scandals" at the Rossmoor Athletic Club a few  years ago that had the neighborhood buzzing. In 1985, the club owner agreed to  a seemingly harmless arrangement to furnish patient referrals to a diagnostic  testing firm in exchange for money in the form of lease payments. Federal law,  however, prohibits such arrangements in any case involving Medicare money. The  owner was granted immunity and testified for federal prosecutors the following  year. In 1987, a fugitive and convicted sex offender was inadvertently hired by  the club to conduct a rape-prevention clinic. He was arrested without incident  on a Texas warrant.  </P> <P> But things are fine now at the club and business is still booming. Last month,  new owner Chris Dewire, who was, coincidentally, also the original owner of the  club (but not involved in the aforementioned incidents), installed the first  indoor "rock," Mt. Rossmoor, in the county for enthusiasts to scale. The  popular 20-foot climbing wall has already increased business.  </P> <P> When all is said and done, though, the quality that is most appealing about the  neighborhood isn't the shopping, the cheap seats or the walls. Neither is it  the homes, with their meticulous landscaping and prices flirting with the  half-million-dollar mark. Rather, it is the way in which residents who have  acquired wealth and position give back to the community, especially the youth.  </P> <P> "A lot of the people in our community are in leadership roles and serve on  boards of charitable organizations," Becker said. "We can't escape the world  around us. We can't remain unaffected."  </P> <P> The Rossmoor Bowl, for instance, treats runaway teen-agers from the Casa Youth  Shelter in Los Alamitos to a free night of bowling once a week. And in addition  to fights to save trees, improve services, erect sound walls or avoid an APZ  designation, the involvement extends to working with unwed mothers, to CASA  (Court-Appointed Special Advocates), "all the way down to grad night at the  local high school."  </P> <P> "People are involved," Becker said. "Moving into Rossmoor is not like sticking  your head in the sand like an ostrich."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population:  </P> <P> Total (1990 est.): 4,420  </P> <P> 1980-90 change: +2.1%  </P> <P> Median age: 39.8  </P> <P> Radical/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 90%  </P> <P> Black: less than 1%  </P> <P> Latino: 5%  </P> <P> Other: 5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income:  </P> <P> Per capita: $27,165  </P> <P> Median household: $63,997  </P> <P> Average household: $67,424  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income distribution:  </P> <P> $100,000-and more: 10%  </P> <P> $75,000-99,999: 9%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 35%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 30%  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 16%  </P> <P> </P> <P> By sex and age: in hundreds  </P> <P> Males: Median age: 38.1 years  </P> <P> Females: Median age: 41.3 yearsDALLAS M.

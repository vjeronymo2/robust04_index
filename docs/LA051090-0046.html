			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: PARAMOUNT;  </P> <P> PARENTS OBJECT TO MOVING PUPILS FROM 3 SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Some parents are objecting to a Paramount Unified School District plan to move  an estimated 700 elementary students from their neighborhood schools to a  renovated facility to relieve overcrowded conditions in the 12,500-student  system.  </P> <P> More than 100 parents attended a meeting Tuesday at Roosevelt Elementary School  to discuss the plan with district personnel.  </P> <P> The plan is expected to go into effect in September. It will transfer students  from the three most crowded elementary campuses, Hollydale, Roosevelt and  Lincoln, to Wirtz Elementary School, Assistant Supt. Donald E. McGuigan said.  </P> <P> Wirtz has been used as an annex for Paramount High School students. Those  students will return to the high school campus in September after 40 newly  constructed classrooms are expected to be completed. Wirtz also will be  remodeled.  </P> <P> Parents said they were most fearful of their children crossing busy streets and  of traffic from the nearby Century Freeway, now under construction.  </P> <P> The district said it will provide crossing guards, and the freeway overpasses  will be enclosed.  </P> <P> Another meeting is planned for May 15, before the Board of Education is  expected to make a decision May 22.  </P></p>

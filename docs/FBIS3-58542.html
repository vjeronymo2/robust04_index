At the land party congress in Bielefeld, as  a sign of gratitude for his work and additional backing for his  candidacy for the office of federal president, Rau received 310  out of 312 votes (99.4 percent) and thus achieved the best  results of his 16-year term in office as the chairman of the  largest SPD land association.

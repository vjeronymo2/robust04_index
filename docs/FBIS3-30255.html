			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vukovar, 31 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, said this  evening in Vukovar in the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] that  "the West -- because of applying double standards -- is most to  blame for the war in the former Yugoslavia." On the one hand  the republics which succeeded from the former Socialist Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia were recognized, and on the other, the  Serbs were not granted the right to self-determination, the  leader of the largest opposition party in Russia said at a rally  in the center of Vukovar.    "The West must be punished for this and Russia will do its  utmost to have the war criminals punished," Zhirinovskiy said at  a news conference held in the partially rebuilt Danube Hotel  after the rally. Amid an ovation from several thousand people  of Vukovar, the guest of the Serb Democratic Party of all  Serbian lands promised that "the great Russia will be the  protector of all Serbs" and spoke about the "creation of a joint  Slav state from Vladivostok to Knin."    "The era is behind us, once and for all, when the Serbian  people, who heroically fought for their own survival and the  survival of all [eastern] Orthodox peoples, were punished. If a  single bomb falls on a Serb town, that will mean a declaration  of war on Russia and that will be the time when we will have all  debts paid to us," Zhirinovskiy said.    The leader of the party which won the largest number of  votes  at the elections in Russia on 12 December said that a Russian  battalion is already fighting in the RSK and that, "if need be,  whole divisions and even a whole army will come." He wished the  Serbs the strength to persist in their just struggle for their  homes where they have lived for centuries.    In reply to a reporter's question, Zhirinovskiy said that  his  party stands for Russia with the borders of the former USSR, but  only by peaceful means. He recalled that Georgia, Azerbaijan,  and some other former USSR republics have already expressed a  desire to return to the joint state, primarily for economic  reasons.    The citizens of Vukovar were also addressed by RSK President  Milan Martic, who said that the Serbian people "got only  disappointment from Russia, while waiting for the great Orthodox  spirit to reawaken."    "And it is being reawoken in the person of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, who is a guarantor for us that in the future we  will have a great protector in the world", Martic said, and  added that "Vukovar and the RSK will never be Croatian again."</p>

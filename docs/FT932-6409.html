			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Solution to fundamental ERM problems Your leader, 'Complacency on the ERM' (May 25), rightly bemoans the complacency of the EC monetary committee's report into the workings of the exchange rate mechanism. No one could have witnessed the events of the past six months without concluding that the ERM is far from healthy. Indeed, at times the illness afflicting the ERM appeared fatal. However, the committee is not alone in failing to propose remedial action. It is possible to identify two fundamental problems with the ERM. Both are potentially solvable. German reunification lies at the heart of last September's crisis. It transformed the system's anchor currency, the D-Mark, from a low-inflation currency into a high-inflation one. Germany now has the highest inflation rate of all the European Monetary System states, save Portugal and Greece. Convergence upon a high-inflation anchor yields an explosive process of rising real interest rates and deteriorating economic prospects. The best solution would have been for a general D-Mark revaluation that would have reduced the European-wide cost of German deflation. With greater pain than might otherwise have been inflicted, a D-Mark revaluation is in effect what has occurred in the ERM over the past six months. The high-inflation anchor problem is thus of diminishing importance. But there remains another intractable problem. The prospect of European monetary union gives the ERM the force to withstand realignment pressures. Dashed hopes of an early move to Emu sparked September's currency debacle. However, the political will necessary to underwrite the economic pain required for the Maastricht convergence criteria to be met is no longer there. The fiscal conditions alone imply a draconian tightening of the EC's collective fiscal stance amid record and rising rates of unemployment. Unless the convergence criteria is balanced to ensure economic growth as well as fiscal prudence, Emu will be postponed indefinitely thereby condemning the ERM to being nothing more than a system of crawling currency pegs.

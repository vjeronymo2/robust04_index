			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar recovers ground Foreign exchange markets were dominated yesterday by the gyrations of the dollar, which recovered from early weakness on the back of some strong economic data, writes Philip Gawith. After slipping to a low of DM1.6945 in early European trade, the US currency later rose sharply to touch a high of DM1.7135, before closing in London at DM1.7090. In New York it finished at DM1.7095. The catalyst for renewed dollar strength - a reversal of recent negative sentiment - was the release of fourth-quarter GDP figures, and the February purchasing managers' index (NAPM). GDP was revised to an annualised 7.5 per cent from an earlier 5.9 per cent estimate, while the price component of the NAPM surged to 67, its highest since October 1990, from 59.8 in January. These strong growth indicators renewed speculation that the US Federal Reserve may again raise interest rates. Elsewhere, attention was focused on developments in the UK and German money markets. In Germany the repo rate came down by three basis points to 5.97 per cent, while tight conditions in the UK discount market saw overnight rates rise to 20 per cent at one stage. The dollar started European trading at a new low for the year against the D-Mark, after comments from Fed governor Mr Lawrence Lindsey sugg-ested that interest rates were unlikely to rise in the short term. This compounded sentiment which was already bearish on account of the absence of clear investor demand for dollars and concern about the currency's failure to advance recently in spite of a run of favourable data and events. There was also concern that hedge funds, rumoured to be cash-short, were selling dollars. These selling pressures gained further impetus when the Bundesbank announced that the repo rate was fall-ing by only three basis points. The small increment of the fall was seen as lending support to the German currency. The lunchtime release of the GDP and NAPM figures reversed the trend. The detail was seen as offering a strong indication that the next move in Fed rates would be up. As Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, commented: 'The two components that were strong in January (commodity prices and employment), and preceded a Fed tightening, were strong in February.' Many observers played down the stronger dollar, saying it was more a correction within a range than a change in sen-timent. Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at SGST, said: 'This is not the making of a lasting dollar rally.' He added that market reaction to the NAPM was overdone as the price index did not offer any new infor-mation. Clearly the market remains extremely nervous about inflation pressures in the US. Yesterday it chose to focus on the narrowly based price index of the NAPM, while ignoring the fact that the GDP deflator, the broadest available inflation indicator, was unchanged. The dollar was slightly firmer against the yen, closing at Y104.615 from Y104.150 on Monday. It ended New York trading at Y104.55. The Bank of Japan's tankan report confirmed the weak state of the economy, but was no worse than expected. The D-Mark was firmer in Europe, with the small cut in the repo rate seen as indicating that the Bundesbank is likely to be cautious in relaxing policy. The German currency ended in London at L989.8 against the Italian lira, up from Monday's L988.2, and at FFr3.403 from FFr3.399. This cautious approach was not well received in the futures market. The price of the December three-month interest rate future on the Liffe fell by 14 basis points. Traders said the D-Mark also gained support from weakness in the Italian bond market which spread to other European markets. Sellers of bonds, wanting to put their money in cash, were reported to have bought D-Marks, as German interest rates are quite fav-ourable. In Europe the Belgian national bank cut its key central rate to 6.25 per cent from 6.40 per cent. Belgium last reduced rates on Friday. Yesterday was an exceptional day in UK money markets. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.7bn, the Bank of England provided no assistance in its early round, and only Pounds 22m at midday. This saw the overnight rate rise to 20 per cent at 2 pm. Only Pounds 338m assistance was provided during the afternoon round, with the bulk of funds - Pounds 995m - being offered through late assistance. The pattern of the day's events suggested that most of the bills had been held by the large clearing banks. 'The distribution of shortage around the market did not coincide with distribution of bills to relieve it,' said one observer. By not offering bills in the early rounds, those who held the bills were able to drive up the cost of borrowing for those with a shortage of funds. Sterling finished a shade up at DM2.5395 from DM2.5366 and was barely changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.486.</p>

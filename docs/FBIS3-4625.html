Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat  Junid Megat Ayob said the government will never compromise when  it comes to defending the integrity of the country. The  government's move has been prompted by the lies spread by the  British media.    Datuk Megat Junid was speaking to newsmen after meeting  trainees of the dadah [drugs] aftercare center in Kampung Gajah,  Perak.</p>

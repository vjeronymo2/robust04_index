			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Boom in German offices subsiding GERMANY'S office rent boom is running out of steam. The cost of space in Frankfurt, for example, is now only 3.5 per cent higher than a year ago, the RDM property agents association said yesterday. During the previous year rents in Germany's main banking and business centre had risen by up to 16 per cent. The overall slowdown was less marked, thanks to strong demand in Berlin, the new capital, Munich and Cologne. But average business rents still rose by only 8 per cent, compared with 15 per cent a year earlier. There is a danger of a build-up of unlet space in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Munich, the association said. Further slowing in rent rises is expected this year, because of economic uncertainty and the fading excitement over completion of the single European market, it added. Even so, there was no shortage of takers for best-quality, city-centre space, and the RDM viewed the outlook with cautious optimism. Average monthly rents in Frankfurt are now DM60 (Pounds 20.60) a square metre. Top rates of around DM90 compare with DM70 in Munich. Prices there climbed more than 15 per cent, driven up by a shortage of space in the centre and the development of new properties near the route to the new airport. Further north, quality space in Dusseldorf ranges from DM35 to DM60. In Cologne, the office property boom town of the 1980s, rents are 12.5 per cent up on a year ago, at around DM32. The city's position in the centre of industrial Germany and the EC still has strong pulling power, the association said. Berlin, meanwhile, continued its upward charge, recording a 60 per cent increase over the 12 months under review. The best offices now cost DM100 and more, with good quality space DM30 dearer at DM80 a square metre. New orders for west German manufacturers fell in June for the fourth month in succession, the Economics Ministry said. Drops of 3 per cent in domestic orders and 1.5 per cent in export demand produced an overall seasonally and price-adjusted decline of 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>the   Nuclear Submarine `Komsomolets'   <F P=102> 94UM0389C Moscow MORSKOY SBORNIK in Russian No 1, 1994  (Signed to press 28 Dec 93) p 36 </F>  <F P=103> 94UM0389C </F> <F P=104>  Moscow MORSKOY SBORNIK </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Decision Has Been Made -- A </F> Special Sarcophagus Will Cover the Nuclear Submarine  `Komsomolets'"]    [Text] The Committee for the Conduct of Special Work  (KOPRON) under the Russian Federation Government has totally  completed the study of materials associated with the  investigation of the nuclear submarine "Komsomolets" that was  lost in the Norwegian Sea on 7 April 1989. The research that was  conducted this year has shown insignificant seepage of cesium  and strontium radioactive isotopes from the nuclear submarine,  which attests to a seal failure of the reactor and partial  destruction of the pressure hull. However, the latest  measurements have shown that, although the nuclear reactor is  giving off a definite background, it does not pose a serious  danger. We have detected evidence of corrosion and fragments of  the torpedoes' warheads in the submarine's torpedo tubes. The  warheads, which are gradually being destroyed, contain plutonium  and, according to the assessments of KOPRON Chairman Captain 1st  Rank T. Borisov, could result in serious ecological consequences  in 2-3 years. KOPRON's experts have arrived at a final  conclusion: It is dangerous to salvage the "Komsomolets" and  therefore it is necessary to build a special sarcophagus from  the submarine's hull, having sealed the submarine's nose section  and torpedo tubes using a special compound (development of the  compound is continuing). The Russian Academy of Sciences,  Gosatomnadzor [State Committee for Nuclear Energy Oversight],  Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], environmental protection  organs and the Ministry of Defense have supported the proposals  of T. Borisov's committee.    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.</p>

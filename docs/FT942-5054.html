			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Wind farm call Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, wants more wind farms to be built in spite of criticism of their economic value and visual impact. In guidelines published today the group calls on planners and wind-power developers 'to ensure high-quality, publicly supported wind-power projects continue to appear in the countryside'. It suggests planning refusals have been influenced by 'a sometimes vociferous anti-wind power minority'. Wind power has divided environmentalists. It is a renewable energy source, but it requires a large number of obtrusive turbines to generate a small amount of electricity. The Council for the Protection of Rural Wales has called for a moratorium on development and local authorities have recently taken a more restrictive attitude.</p>

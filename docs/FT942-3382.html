			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Banham digs in for the liberation of Blackpool Blackburn, Blackpool, Lancaster, Portsmouth, Slough and an enlarged Reading will become self-governing under plans to redraw the English local government map announced yesterday by the Local Government Commission. Blueprints for Berkshire, Hampshire and Lancashire, following five other counties announced on Monday, signal a continued intention to replace the two-tier system of counties and districts in non-metropolitan England. County councils in many areas would be abolished and existing districts merged to form unitary authorities. The commission risked a row with the government by recommending that the two-tier system should stay in place for all of Hampshire except Southampton and Portsmouth. The commission's detailed recommendations, which will go to public consultation, are: Berkshire: The county, and all except one of its districts, agreed a proposal for four unitary authorities which the commission has now endorsed. Slough and an 'expanded' Reading would become unitaries, while Bracknell Forest, Windsor and Maidenhead, and most of Wokingham would merge to create Royal East Berkshire. Newbury would also be unitary, and would take in a few Hampshire parishes. Hampshire: If the first option of leaving the county unchanged outside its two biggest cities is rejected, the commission's favourite alternative of seven unitary authorities involves radical restructuring, and would be fiercely opposed by the county. The unitaries would be New Forest; Basingstoke and Deane with the north part of Test Valley; Hart and Rushmoor; Winchester, East Hampshire and the south part of Test Valley; Southampton and Eastleigh; Fareham and Gosport; and Portsmouth and Havant. Financial consultants described the first option as 'the worst of all worlds', as Portsmouth and Southampton attract proportionately more government grants than the rest of the county. The shrunken county council might therefore suffer a disproportionately sharp reduction in grant. Lancashire: Eight unitary authorities are the commission's preferred choice for Lancashire, but local people can opt instead for six or seven. They can also keep the status quo of a county council with 14 second-tier districts. The eight would be Lancaster; Blackburn (represented in parliament by Labour's local government spokesman, Mr Jack Straw, who favours unitary councils); Wyre and Fylde; West Lancashire; Chorley, Preston and South Ribble; Blackpool; Hyndburn and Ribble Valley; and Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale. Annual savings are put between Pounds 1m and Pounds 8m, with set-up costs of Pounds 21m to Pounds 28m. The six-authority proposal would cost as much to set up but would save more  -between Pounds 9m and Pounds 16m a year. But it would require Blackpool to join Wyre and Fylde, and Blackburn to merge with Hyndburn and Ribble Valley. The mergers would be accepted by the commission if there were support for them, but neither is likely to find favour in the rural areas of Wyre, Fylde and Ribble Valley, the last of which is unlikely to welcome Hyndburn anyway. The case for the status quo will be vigorously fought by Lancashire county council, which secured a judgment from the High Court to ensure that this option was included in consultation.</p>

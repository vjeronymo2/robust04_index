			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Defense Minister Yevgeniy </F> Shaposhnikov, by an unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given -- recorded; from the "Aty-Baty" program]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] When you became defense  minister, how did you envision the new army, how did you  envision the reforms of the army that we had and, in your  opinion, how much were you able to achieve of what you had  envisioned?    [Shaposhnikov] The Russian Army absorbed the major part of  the Soviet Armed Forces and naturally, at that time it was, and  still is, of great interest to me. I cannot remain indifferent  to the issue of what is going on in the army with regard to  reforms. I have several views, or rather, thoughts on the  subject and I would like to share them.    The army has lost the simple and clear reference point that  the concept of the enemy used to provide. When the civil war  ended, our leaders, the leaders of the young Soviet Republic,  began a tenfold reduction of the armed forces despite being  surrounded by the enemy. Today, the opportunity exists and such  conditions have been created that I am actually convinced that  no one will attack us if we have reliable strategic forces and  border troops.    I am not revealing any secrets by telling you that within  the  Defense Ministry, like in any other ministry, there is definite  lobbying. Speaking unconditionally, or rather conditionally so  as not to correlate it with anyone or anything, as an example  let us assume that the General Staff, or the defense minister,  gets an idea to abolish the Air Defense High Command. How will  the Air Defense High Command react? He will make the rounds of  all the directorates, all the services; he will load the problem  onto all the scientific research establishments, the Academy of  Sciences, and so on; and then he will come back to the minister  and report that it is impossible to implement. This would be  the same with the Air Force and so on. I will represent all  these problems as a thick copse of trees. [Shaposhnikov begins  to demonstrate with a pen on the table]    Let us suppose that the trees are standing here and it is  decided to thin some of the them out, remove and forget about  them. Then, when the minister or someone else grabs hold of the  trunk, he finds that all the roots are intertwined below the  surface and when he tries to pull the problem [trunk] out, this  single trunk begins to rock all the rest of the trees.  Consequently, the minister will find it very difficult to solve  the problem in this way.    Therefore, there should be some kind of a state structure or  committee, be it under the president or the government, that  would concern itself with these reforms and the resolution of  all the problems in the system without advocating their own  various mercenary interests.    As you know, after the August events, we began with a  Military Reform Committee headed by General of the Army Kobets.  The committee did not develop for many reasons, such as the  Union's disintegration and so on. However, if there were such a  body composed of former military people, military scientists,  civilian military experts, representatives of the military  industrial complex, outstanding politicians, and various other  specialists, then we could have done it impartially.    [Correspondent] Three years have passed and we still do not  have that kind of a body. Why? How can we explain this?    [Shaposhnikov] That is not a question you should be  directing to me. [passage omitted] The army should be  apolitical, outside of the political stream. It has a more  important and more serious course than adhering to the various  political flows, movements, structures, leaders, and so on.  Naturally, for me, these issues are also unpleasant, and now  even incomprehensible, as they are for you.    For instance, let us take the latest event in Crimea where  the situation is becoming supercharged. While the two  presidents, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Leonid Makarovich  Kravchuk are talking to each other about it and are working out  some kind of a formula to prevent the conflict's settlement  through force, suddenly we have Mr. Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense  minister, coming out with the statement and virtually thumping  the table with his iron fist saying: We will not be stopped by  anything, let everyone remember that, we will take any, and even  extreme, decisive measures. I think that as a military man he  should be silent in these situations. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Has our officer, soldier, [pauses] the  serviceman become the central figure in the armed forces? Has  he, in fact, become the figure on whom our whole military policy  is principally focused?    [Shaposhnikov] I would like to believe and think that.  However, I am convinced that at present we are still far from  that. Especially if there are some advances in this respect  then, as we know, there is no limit to perfection in any  situation.</p>

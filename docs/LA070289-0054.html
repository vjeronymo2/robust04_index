			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SMALL INVESTOR: CAN CO-OWNER SUCCEED IN PARTITION LAWSUIT?  </P> <P> QUESTION: About five years ago we invested in 24 acres of land with another  couple, our best friends. We agreed this parcel had future potential as a  commercial site as it is at the crossroads of two rural highways. But for the  last year our co-owners have been pestering us to sell.  </P> <P> A local builder made us a standing offer to buy our acreage at a decent, but  not huge profit. We think if we wait five more years we can quadruple our  investment. However, last month our co-owners informed us that they sold their  half interest to the builder. He then contacted us and offered to buy us out  for the price he paid our former best friends. If we don't sell, he says he  will bring a partition lawsuit, whatever that is.  </P> <P> ANSWER: I presume you were tenant in common co-owners. There is no law that  prevents such co-owners from selling their share without the permission of the  other co-owners. However, if you had a well-drafted partnership agreement, then  such a sale could have been prevented with mutual buy-out or  right-of-first-refusal provisions.  </P> <P> Now your new co-owner might be successful in his partition lawsuit if the court  agrees to order the property sold. A partition lawsuit is one of the weaknesses  of owning real estate as tenants in common or joint tenants. Please consult a  real estate attorney for more details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unexpected Risk in a Limited Partnership  </P> <P> Q: About five years ago, I invested $20,000 as a limited partner in a motel  built by a well-known developer. The limited partnership was sold to me by a  stockbroker. Everything went well until March and April, when I didn't receive  my usual dividend check and K-1 partnership income tax return.  </P> <P> When I called the stockbroker, she said the limited partnership is bankrupt and  the lenders are foreclosing. Just last December we were told the motel was  doing very well. How can this happen and what can the limited partners do?  </P> <P> A: You raise an unexpected risk of limited partnership real estate investments.  The developer you named, but which I deleted, has more than 11,000 limited  partners who were similarly defrauded by what appears to be looting of the  partnership cash accounts. Other than suing the developer and alerting the  government authorities, there isn't much you can do to get your investment back  after the lender forecloses on the partnership assets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Should Landlord Give Tenants 1-Year Lease?  </P> <P> Q: I own an apartment building. My policy has been to give tenants  month-to-month leases. But at a recent apartment owner's association meeting a  speaker said owners should give their tenants one-year leases to cut down on  tenant turnover. Do you agree?  </P> <P> A: Leases protect tenants more than they protect landlords. When a tenant has a  lease, the rent cannot be raised nor can other lease terms be changed until the  lease expires.  </P> <P> However, it has been my experience that when tenants decide to move out, a  lease won't stop them. Of course, the lease gives the landlord a legal right to  go after the tenant for the remaining unpaid rent until the end of the lease,  minus rent collected from a new tenant. But obtaining a judgment against such a  tenant usually isn't worth the trouble. Also, in most states the building owner  has a duty to try to re-rent the premises to reduce damages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Invest Only for Tax Reasons  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I earn over $135,000 annually and are paying a small fortune to  Uncle Sam in income taxes. We desperately need to buy some real estate for the  tax shelter. What kind of property do you recommend?  </P> <P> A: Please don't buy investment real estate just for the tax gimmicks. Income  property should be acquired for its long-term investment potential, and the tax  benefits are only incidental.  </P> <P> Personally, I like to buy run-down "fixer houses," which can be purchased at  below-market prices and upgraded either to hold for long-term investment or for  resale profits. After the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the tax shelter benefits are  definitely not a major reason for investing in real estate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rental House Managed by Agent Unprofitable  </P> <P> Q: I am undecided if I should sell or rent my home as I will be moving away  from this area. After consulting several local realtors who will manage the  rent collection, I find they want a fee of 10% of the gross rent plus a lease  fee if a new tenant must be obtained. As this will result in a loss after  making my mortgage and property tax payments, do you think this is too high?  </P> <P> A: Hiring a professional property manager for a single-family rental home at an  affordable fee is not easy. The customary fee is 10% of the gross rent. You are  not being overcharged. From the manager's viewpoint, that fee barely covers the  expenses of rent collection and supervising the house, especially if it needs  repairs.  </P> <P> Since you will be moving away from the area, I suggest you sell your home now.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J. Bruss, a San Francisco-area lawyer, author  and real estate broker, may be sent to the Real Estate Section, Los Angeles  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

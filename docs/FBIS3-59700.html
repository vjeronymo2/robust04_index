			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazukiyo Okano, Director, Senior Chief Engineer, </F> Fuel Cell Division, Fuji Electric Co., Ltd.]    [Text]  <H5>  Development of Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell Power Plants </H5>   Fuji's development focuses on three primary applications:  on-site cogeneration power plants, large scale power plants  suitable for Electric Utilities and vehicular power systems.  Together with three gas utilities: Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho  Gas, 50kW and 100kW power plants are developing for  commercialization.    More than 60 units of 50kW and 100kW including NEDO's field  testing plants are operating on customer's sites such as hotels,  office buildings, factories and other places.    In addition to 50kW and 100kW plants, Fuji is developing  500kW on-site PAFC plants in cooperation with Osaka Gas. The  first prototype was installed at Osaka Gas for testing. Photo 1  [photo not reproduced] shows 500kW plant. After improvement of  these prototype models to get better reliability, commercial  models will be completed by 1996.    Fuji has installed 77 PAFC test plants as shown in Table 1:  64 plants in 77 are on-site fuel cells, 4 plants are power  plants for Electric Utilities.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

All equipment except the fuel  cell stacks have been installed on site. Six 860kW stacks are  being manufactured at the factory. The 5MW plant is planned to  be completed in March 1994.    For vehicular application, Fuji is participating in the DOE  fuel cell bus program and manufacturing the first 50kW power  system for a small prototype bus.  <H5>  Development of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells </H5>   Fuji Electric has been developing planar solid oxide fuel  cells since 1987.    Development of a substrate type planar cell has been done  under the NEDO Project since 1989 and a 410W stack using 10  cells of 200cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  has operated successfully. The next  target is to manufacture kW class stacks using larger size cells.</p>

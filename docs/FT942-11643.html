			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Turkish inflation rises to 107% Turkey's annual inflation rate rose to 107 per cent last month, in the wake of the recent wave of price rises in state-controlled commodities. According to figures from the state statistics institute, monthly consumer prices rose 24.7 per cent in April. The wholesale index rose 32.8 per cent, giving an annual wholesale index of 125.5 per cent, while monthly prices of state-controlled products went up a hefty 55 per cent. The price rises form part of the austerity programme unveiled last month by Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister, in an effort to reduce the budget deficit and restore confidence. A mission from the International Monetary Fund is in Ankara to discuss the programme with a view to agreeing a letter of intent and a stand-by facility which would pave the way for Turkey to return to international debt markets. The government is projecting zero growth for 1994. The programme envisages a 50 per cent cut in the central government deficit to TL90,000bn for 1994. A further improvement in Spain's trade figures in March reduced the first-quarter deficit to Pta389bn (Pounds 1.9bn), 23 per cent less than in the same period last year. The Economy Ministry saw the figures as confirmation of a recovery, with exports 44 per cent up at Pta2,359bn and imports up 28 per cent to Pta2,748bn. The March deficit was 17 per cent lower than a year ago at Pta164bn. The Belgian National Bank yesterday cut its key central rate for money market lending by 10 points to 5.50 per cent. Russia's April inflation was 9.7 per cent a month, up from 8.7 per cent in March but below a monthly average of 20 per cent last year and 22 per cent in January.</p>

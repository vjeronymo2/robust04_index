			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sharjah, 13 January, KUNA -- In a press statement  issued here today, the first deputy prime minister and minister  of foreign affairs, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, stressed the success  of the State of Kuwait on all fronts with regard to the  protection of its sovereignty and independence. He refused to  say that concluding defense treaties with the great powers meant  Kuwait's failure on the Arab and Gulf fronts.    In a statement to the weekly magazine AL-SHURUQ, he said:  "Everybody knows that all the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]  member-states put the lives of their sons at risk to liberate  Kuwait. We are still, after the liberation, going ahead with  coordinating joint defense among the GCC states, which proves  that cooperation among them is successful".    On the Arab front, he added: "There are Arab countries which  participated in the liberation war, such as Egypt and Syria,"  pointing out that this coordination had continued later on  within the framework of the Damascus Declaration, which includes  these two countries alongside the six GCC states.    Shaykh Sabah denied the existence of external pressure on  the  State of Kuwait regarding the direction of its policy, pointing  out that the recent visits of Western personalities to Baghdad  were made for a specific reason, namely the release of Western  hostages imprisoned by the Iraqi regime.    He stressed the continuation of the isolation of the Iraqi  regime for its refusal to comply with all UN resolutions in  connection with its aggression on the State of Kuwait, pointing  out that: "No country could extend its bridges to a regime which  inflicts starvation and homelessness to its people and practices  the most cruel torture against it".    Shaykh al-Sabah denied the allegations that Kuwait's  statements calling for distinction to be made between the Iraqi  regime and the Iraqi people were in variance with actual  practices, and stressed that Kuwait had helped the Iraqi people  with food and medicine, particularly those expelled by the Iraqi  regime in the north and in the south to whom humanitarian aid  was sent. He further said: We do make a distinction between the  regime and the people and it does not please us at all to hear  about a fraternal people beset by hunger and poverty.    On whether he expected success in forthcoming days to  efforts  days aimed at bringing about a reconciliation with the adversary  states that supported Iraq in its aggression against the state  of Kuwait, Shaykh al-Sabah asked: On what basis would these  efforts succeed and reconciliation be brought about.    He added: First, the problem must end, and then  reconciliation begins, but if reconciliation comes now, it would  be absolutely useless. Kuwait has, in fact, specified the  conditions for a reconciliation with the adversary states to the  effect that these states must announce their recognition of the  UN Security Council resolutions pertaining to the Iraqi  aggression against Kuwait.    In his statement, the Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister  and  foreign minister expressed the hope that harmony would prevail  and all the accumulations resulting from the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait would disappear. The invasion, he said, had frozen  everything, including peace which he hoped would be realized.  He further said: So long as differences exist in the Arab  world, everything will remain suspended and frozen.    In his assessment of the current events regarding the Arab-  Israeli settlement, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said: "We welcomed the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a first step." He added that  he "hopes that this step will lead to an agreement in all  processes, otherwise there will not be any progress towards  peace."    Regarding the GCC's failure to reach a total union so far  along the lines of the European Maastricht Treaty, Shaykh Sabah  said: "The European Council is over 50 years old and despite  this it has not taken its final shape yet. By contrast the Gulf  Cooperation Council was created only 14 years ago." He added:  "It is true that we have not realized all the hopes pinned on  the Council, but we should not ignore the fact that many of  these have been realized." He further said: "We all hope to  achieve the remaining aspirations in the coming years."    In reply to a question on whether he thought that the  success of the GCC as a formula for regional cooperation was due  to a weakening of the Arab League's role, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad  indicated that the Cooperation Council did not come from outside  the framework of the Arab League, but that it had been set  within the framework of the Arab League Charter which stipulates  that Arab countries should cooperate among themselves.    He also stated that the Council continued to play its part  in  reinforcing the Arab League and making its role more effective.  He added that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the state of  disunion and division which ensued led to a fragmentation of the  Arab decision. He also deplored the fact that this had led to  the weakening of the role of the Arab League to the point of  marginalization.</p>

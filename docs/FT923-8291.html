			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Critical months in Japan JAPAN MAY not yet be suffering a western-style recession, but the probability that it will do so rises by the day. The official government line remains sanguine. But the stock market knows better; and its continued downward path suggests further troubles to come. Little wonder that, behind the scenes, Japanese officials are becoming increasingly edgy. Japan is midway through an Anglo-Saxon style debt deflation, a fact that is finally dawning in Tokyo. Japan's debts are concentrated in the financial sector, while household debt levels remain low. And the Bank of Japan has been able to cut interest rates five times in the last 13 months to ease the pressure, albeit in a tardy fashion compared with the US Federal Reserve. Japan's disadvantage is that bank balance sheets are closely tied to the value of the stock market through the banks' holdings of unrealised equity capital gains. Share values have fallen by 62 per cent since their 1989 peak and yesterday's fall in the Nikkei average to 14,822.56 was the first time it has closed below 15,000 since March 1986. Only a few months ago, analysts quoted 16,000 as the floor beyond which bank capital adequacy ratios would be violated. The pressure on banks to re-build their capital is spilling over into the wider economy. Only the most creditworthy customers now receive a warm welcome. Bank lending in July was unchanged from June, the eighth successive month in which the growth of bank lending hit a record low. Broad money growth has slowed almost to a standstill. Depressed confidence Not surprisingly, the economy looks sicker by the day, despite government claims that the slide is coming to an end. Japanese companies continue to cut investment, and private sector machinery orders, excluding shipbuilding and electric power companies, fell by 19.2 per cent in June compared with a year ago. Even Japan's consumers, normally sheltered from the turbulence of the economic cycle, are feeling the pinch. The ratio of job offers to applicants is at its lowest level in four years, and some smaller companies are shedding staff. Consumer confidence is depressed and department store sales are falling. Official government forecasts for 3 1/2 per cent growth this year now look absurd, as even the Ministry of Finance concedes. But the Tokyo market consensus of 2 1/2 per cent growth, a better reflection of current MoF thinking, still looks too optimistic. Economists at the London subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, released from Tokyo's conformity, plan to halve their current 1.2 per cent forecast for 1992. Nor does next year look much better, even if a world recovery can fuel Japan's already impressive export performance and the risk of a large bank failure is avoided. Rebuilding balance sheets is a long process which will take years not months. Sorely needed At least the Bank of Japan appears finally to have realised the gravity of situation. The best way to ease the pressure on the banks is to keep cutting interest rates. The Bank should do so at once. But the US experience demonstrates the limited effect that monetary policy can have when private sector confidence is depressed. Only a revival in spending and investment will provide the fillip that is sorely needed to shore up the market. And only the public sector has the means to do so. Yet the Ministry of Finance remains unwilling to act on anything like the scale and speed required. It provided no more than a cosmetic fiscal boost last spring which, if anything, reduced market confidence. Once again, despite government claims that an aggressive economy-boosting package of public infrastructure spending is imminent, the ministry is prevaricating. The much heralded supplementary budget will not arrive before October, if the MoF prevails, and the stimulus is unlikely to exceed 1-2 per cent of gross domestic product. The government cannot afford to be seen to dither in this way. If market nerves are to be soothed, a more substantial package of tax cuts and spending increases is needed before the end of the summer. The further the market falls, the larger the gap between the Ministry of Finance's complacent optimism and hard reality will become.</p>

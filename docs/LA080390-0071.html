			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND TOWN;  </P> <P> JILL RICHARDS HAS DESIGNS ON MAKING THE MOST OF SECOND CHANCE AT SUCCESS  </P> <P> Like the movie studios with their sequels, Los Angeles actress-turned-designer  Jill Richards is showing "part two" of her designing career following a brief  hiatus from the clothing business in 1988.  </P> <P> She says her new collection reflects the same look and taste level that made  her label de rigueur for ladies-who-lunch.  </P> <P> In the '70s, Nancy Reagan and her friends put Richards on the fashion map when  they bought her dark "Kitty Foyle" dress with a crisp white collar.  </P> <P> But when the designer sold 75% of her share of Jill Richards Inc. to Robert  Colman in 1987, the line expanded, the label lost its cachet and the wealthy  clientele quickly looked elsewhere for their dressy clothes.  </P> <P> Her fall from grace, in Richards' words, was "awful."  </P> <P> Finally, Richards secured the rights to her name from Colman for $150,000 last  year and reentered the designing business under a new company name, JR Couture.  </P> <P> And now she is back in the designer salons of pricey stores like Saks Fifth  Avenue and Neiman-Marcus as though she never left.  </P> <P> Her latest collection includes the same signature touches: white collars,  ruffles and her favorite fabric, matte jersey. The silhouette is often simple  and close to the body.  </P> <P> "I've been doing this for so long now that I'm very aware of consumer wants,"  she says. "Once ladies hit their 30s, they want sleeves. So I offer draped  clothes with long sleeves and a V-neck."  </P> <P> Today, Richard's dresses range in price from $450 to $1,250.  </P> <P> "It's taking a while to build that image back," she says. "We'll see what  happens."  </P></p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Saudi bank floods market with 600 tonnes of silver THE National Commercial Bank of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia's sole private bank and one with close ties to the royal family, sold at least 20m troy ounces - or 622 tonnes - of silver, worth about Dollars 80m (Pounds 42m), in only two hours yesterday. Traders linked the huge sale with yesterday's announcement of the resignation of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, the Saudi bank's deputy general manager and chief operating officer, who was indicted in the US last week on charges related to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The metal sold was equivalent to about 5 per cent of annual worldwide demand for silver. At one stage, the silver price in London was driven down from Dollars 4.06 an ounce to Dollars 3.82, its lowest level so far this year. The turmoil in Europe was reflected in futures trading on the New York Commodity Exchange, where the most active September silver contract was down 21.8 cents an ounce at one point at Dollars 3.835. Prices recovered slightly later and silver closed in London at Dollars 3.87 an ounce. Sheikh Khalid and a London-based associate were charged by a US grand jury less than a week ago with scheming to defraud depositors, regulators and auditors of BCCI. Sheikh Khalid has described the charges as 'completely unwarranted and without justification'. Announcing yesterday that Sheikh Khalid's resignation had 'reluctantly' been accepted, Sheikh Mohammed bin Mahfouz, chairman of the NCB, said: 'We are fully confident of Sheikh Khalid's innocence. God willing, he will be vindicated.' Analysts suggested the market would take some time to digest the metal. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, recalled that the same bank had hit the gold market in a similar way with large sales in March 1990, when it sold about 100 tonnes of gold, equivalent to about 5 per cent of world supply, and drove the price down by Dollars 20 an ounce to Dollars 368 in a few hours. 'It took the gold market several months to settle down after that,' Mr Smith said. Silver is used mainly by the photographic and electronics industries and demand fell slightly last year to 541m ounces. Production has fallen far behind demand as mines have closed because of depressed prices. But there are probably 1bn ounces of metal held by investors who were encouraged to buy in 1987 when the price rose above Dollars 7 an ounce. Saudi banker quits, Page 8 Commodities, Page 32</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Clinton toughens stance against Haitian junta President Bill Clinton yesterday refused to rule out the use of force to oust the Haitian military junta from power. 'It's time for them to go,' he said, before leaving for Atlanta and an internationally televised news conference on foreign policy. However, he emphasised that the first step in renewed US pressure on Haiti would be to have the United Nations Security Council agree to tighter economic sanctions, aimed more precisely at the assets of junta members and of prominent civilian supporters. 'We've tried other initiatives and they have not worked,' Mr Clinton conceded, 'so we are now doing this sanctions regime as recommended by President (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide and others.' Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said that military intervention in the Caribbean country was 'a little far down the way' and would only be undertaken with congressional approval under the War Powers Act. Mr Clinton has come under growing pressure, particularly by the black caucus in Congress, to act as evidence of atrocities in Haiti proliferates. Father Aristide, exiled by the military coup of October 1991, has described US policy towards his country as tantamount to racism. The administration's stance came under fire yesterday from ex-president George Bush, whose general policies towards Haiti Mr Clinton has followed, and from Mr Lawrence Pezzullo, US former special envoy who resigned, under pressure, last week. In an interview with a Houston newspaper, in which he confessed to a change of opinion, Mr Bush said it was time for 'a significant shift' in US policy. This should combine intensified diplomatic efforts with an end to US support for the return of the democratically elected President Aristide on the grounds that it was now clear he lacked sufficient support in Haiti itself. However, Mr Bush added, it would be 'a tremendous mistake' for the US to intervene militarily because 'no US lives are at risk in Haiti today'. Mr Pezzullo, heavily criticised by supporters of Fr Aristide, also warned - in a letter to Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state  - of 'my grave concern that we are heading down a path towards unilateral military intervention'. The White House yesterday declined comment on a report that it was thinking of sending US military officials to seek to 'retrain' the Haitian army and to provide some protection for humanitarian food supplies in Haiti. A similar, lightly-armed mission was aborted last year off Port-au-Prince in the face of junta-organised protests.</p>

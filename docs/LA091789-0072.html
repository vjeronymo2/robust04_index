			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BAPTIST CHURCH WORKS TO BRING CULTURES TOGETHER  </P> <P> It began with Baptist refugees from Cuba.  </P> <P> They settled into the neighborhood around Fullerton First Baptist Church about  40 years ago, then began spreading their faith to Mexican and other Latin  American immigrants in the barrio nearby. Eventually, the Spanish-speaking  congregation there grew to more than 100, requiring a pastor and Sunday service  of its own.  </P> <P> This presented a dilemma for Senior Pastor Sam Hochstatter.  </P> <P> Like most churches in the county, Fullerton First Baptist began, as one member  put it, "a normal white-bread church." And some members at first were unused  to, and in some cases intolerant of, the growing Latino congregation sharing  their church, Hochstatter said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All-Too-Rare Solution  </P> <P> Now, however, in what civil rights leaders see as an all-too-rare solution to a  common problem in scores of Orange County churches, Hochstatter and Jose  Arreguin, pastor of the Hispanic department, are taking steps to help the two  congregations share activities and build relationships.  </P> <P> Three bilingual seminars on differences and common ground between the church's  English- and Spanish-speaking ministries are being held. One was held last week  and the others are set for Wednesday of this week and next at the church, 212  E. Wilshire Ave. in Fullerton.  </P> <P> A combined worship service also was to be held today to coincide with Hispanic  Heritage Week in the American Baptist Church, Hochstatter said. The  congregation has held combined services a few times each year for the last few  years, he added.  </P> <P> At the same time, the pastors said they will launch an unusual fund-raising  campaign for a bilingual weekly radio talk show with Anglo and Latino Christian  themes. They hope to broadcast the program beginning in January to Orange, Los  Angeles and San Bernardino counties. (Arreguin also broadcasts a short-wave  radio program, "Una Palabra al Corazon" -- "A Word to the Heart" -- from KVOH  radio in Van Nuys to Latin America.)  </P> <P> In the beginning, it was unclear whether the congregations would be able to  accept each other, said Arreguin, 72, a native of Mexico who graduated from the  USC School of Theology and obtained a doctorate at the University of Strasbourg  in France.  </P> <P> Arreguin, who joined the church about 10 years ago, started a fund-raising  campaign and began seeking a separate church site, but he soon discovered that  moving would be too expensive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unity Is Answer  </P> <P> It was then, about five years ago, that the pastors decided it would be best  for the congregations to try to unite.  </P> <P> Hochstatter looked, he said, but could found no other "multiethnic model" in  Orange County for integrating a church.  </P> <P> Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations  Commission, said that nearly 100 churches in the county are so-called "nesting  churches" -- that is, they either rent or give space to an ethnic minority  congregation. But Kennedy said most of those churches have "squandered" the  opportunity to build intergroup relationships.  </P> <P> In Protestant nesting churches, Kennedy said, "many have begun their  relationships with the desire to do things together, but most have had a  difficult time living up to that ideal." Some churchgoers, he said, have  expressed hostility over such matters as the smell of the minority groups'  food, their attitudes in regard to church maintenance and contributing toward  improvements.  </P> <P> "In some cases, the host churches asked the other congregation to move on or  they upped the rent," he said, or they "continue in a situation where there's  not (an) interchange."  </P> <P> "In many cases, there were not good structures for communication," Kennedy  added.  </P> <P> Catholic parishes, in particular, have been struggling with changes in  demography, Kennedy said. Veteran parishioners have argued over such changes as  adding Masses in Spanish, whether the Spanish-language Mass would be at a more  desirable time than the English-language ones, and whether such services would  be in the main sanctuary or in a hall, he said.  </P> <P> "Some segregation is needed initially, so everyone can understand the language  of worship," Kennedy said. But "the ideal situation is, like children learning  English in school, you have time with your own language group . . . and other  times when you can be bilingual and share activities with" the English-speaking  group.  </P> <P> At Fullerton First Baptist, the Latino service led by Arreguin begins Sundays  at 9 a.m., with the Anglo service led by Hochstatter at 10:35. (A Vietnamese  congregation of about 50 Protestants also rents a room at the church but is not  included in the seminars because it belongs to a different denomination,  Arreguin said.)  </P> <P> For at least 10 years, the two groups have mingled in "alley parties" between  services, and in youth clubs and nursery and athletic facilities. Latino  children, who are mostly bilingual, attend Sunday school in English and sing in  the choir.  </P> <P> Arreguin said he believes the Latinos will stay in the church "as long as the  Anglo congregation is willing to help us stay."  </P> <P> While most of the 650 or so Anglo church members have been receptive, a few  families quit the church about 1 1/2 years ago, Hochstatter said. "They did not  like differences. . . . It was too threatening. Too frightening."  </P> <P> The pastor said he has preached to his congregation that if it could not learn  to live together, it would have to "turn the church over to the Hispanics and  call ourselves the First Baptist Church of someplace else. Maybe Palm Springs.  That's where the white flight is going."  </P> <P> More important, Hochstatter said, he believes the Gospel challenges Christians  to understand one another.  </P> <P> "I can't understand why people who call themselves Christians can't be together  to celebrate Christ," he said.  </P> <P> One member of the Fullerton church, Ricardo Vergara, 32, an immigrant from  Chile who now lives in Diamond Bar, said the seminars will be important.  </P> <P> "You get to ask about what the other culture thinks about things," Vergara  said.  </P> <P> Moreover, he said, being together helps break down stereotypes.  </P> <P> "If they hear me speak Spanish, they might think I clean hotels," said Vergara,  who is a sales representative. "We have people in our congregation who are  engineers and doctors."  </P> <P> Formality is one of the differences between the two congregations that the  pastors say they hope to explore at the seminars.  </P> <P> "Anglos tend to be more formal," Arreguin said. "They look to order as (a) main  principle of social life. We . . . are more spontaneous. That probably  frightens some Anglos. They make us nervous -- they put everything on a  calendar. We keep it in our heads."  </P> <P> At both Anglo and Latino services, worshipers sing the formal, New  England-style hymns used by the American Baptist congregation. But in the  evening service for the Latino congregation, Arreguin said, "we play the guitar  and the trumpet. We clap our hands."  </P> <P> Because only 20% of the Latino congregation is bilingual, neither pastor is  pushing for a joint congregation at this time.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / People: New treasurer for WPP Martin Sorrell's marketing services group, WPP, will soon get a new treasurer, Paul Richardson, currently deputy treasurer with Hanson. Richardson is due to take over from Derek Hawkins in early January next year, though Hawkins is likely to continue to be associated with WPP in a consultancy capacity. WPP has seen a trail of treasurers since 1990, including Simeon Galpert, then Chris Coles, before Hawkins took over early this year. Richardson, 34, graduated from the University of East Anglia in 1979, with a degree in economics and computing. He travelled and worked in Spain for a year before joining (as it then was) Thomson McLintock, where he trained as a chartered accountant. He joined Hanson in March 1984. Richardson says he looks forward to his new post as a 'great opportunity, now that WPP has turned the corner after its refinancing agreement with the banks'.</p>

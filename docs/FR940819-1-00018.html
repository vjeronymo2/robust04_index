This event is held each year on July 4 on the Ashley River, at Charleston, South Carolina. In the past, the Coast Guard established temporary special local regulations each year to protect the safety of life on the navigable waters during the effective times. However, because the event recurs annually, the Coast Guard is proposing a permanent description of the event and establishment of permanent regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to better serve the boating public by creating a permanent reference. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before October 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed to Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Group, 196 Tradd Street, Charleston, South Carolina 29401.

M. SICARD, Assistant Operations Officer, Coast Guard Group Charleston, project officer, and LT J. M. LOSEGO, project attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Charleston Water Festival, Inc., sponsors the Festival on the Fourth celebration. Approximately, two towboats, one pick-up boat, forty waterskiers, and five jet skiers conduct various exhibitions during the Festival on the Fourth event, including ski jumping, kite skiing and jet ski maneuvering. The event also closes with a fireworks display on that portion of the Ashley River in Charleston, South Carolina, between Brittle Bank Park and the main river channel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The event's exhibitions, coupled with the fireworks display, create an extra hazard in the navigable waters and require these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The regulated area encompasses less than one nautical mile on the Ashley River from Brittle Bank Park to the main river channel in Charleston, South Carolina, entry into which is prohibited for eleven and a half hours on the day of the event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Hilton clears way for sell-off Shares in Hilton Hotels, the US hotel and casino group, shot up Dollars 10 to Dollars 67 7/8 yesterday - a gain of more than 17 per cent - after the company effectively put itself on the market for the second time in five years. It said it had engaged Smith Barney, the Wall Street investment bank, to advise on a number of strategic alternatives including a possible break-up or sale of the company, a merger with another business, or a share repurchase programme. The company said the purpose of the move was to enhance shareholder value, but would not elaborate further. Hilton Hotels owns, manages or franchises Hilton hotels in the US, operates several more hotels overseas under the Conrad name, and has extensive gaming operations, mostly in Las Vegas. Its market valuation at yesterday's closing price was Dollars 3.3bn. The company once operated Hilton hotels around the world, but it sold Hilton International in 1966. That company is now owned by Ladbroke. Some 24.5 per cent of Hilton Hotels' stock is controlled by Mr Barron Hilton, the company's chairman and chief executive. A Hilton family charitable foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Fund, controls another 8.6 per cent. Mr Barron Hilton invited offers for the company in 1989, but a year later he was forced to take it off the auction block because no serious bidders emerged. Recently, Hilton's gaming operations have been suffering from tough competition in the key Las Vegas market, but the hotel division has been performing well. Recovery in the US economy has lifted room rates and occupancy levels, and last month Hilton reported a 32 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 27m in the third quarter. Mr David Wolfe, an analyst at Oppenheimer, a Wall Street brokerage, said Hilton appeared to be taking advantage of an upswing in the hotel industry to get a fresh valuation on the company. 'The environment for the hotel industry is such that they can see an opportunity to get a good price for at least one part of the business,' he said. Possible buyers could include ITT, US owner of the Sheraton hotel chain, or and Ladbroke of the UK, because both have been seeking to expand their gambling interests.</p>

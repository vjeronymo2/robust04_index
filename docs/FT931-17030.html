			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Travel: St Lucia: a violet in the Jalousie rainforest - Jalousie Plantation is the smartest, newest, hideaway Caribbean luxury resort SIX snapshots from St Lucia: First snap, 9.30am: I am sitting on the veranda of my cottage at Jalousie Plantation, listening to the birds, listening for the rain, and watching the rainforest stir and resettle. There are butterflies flickering. It is early December. Jalousie Plantation is the latest word in luxury hideaway Caribbean resorts, so I am flicking through the PR bumf, comparing what it says with what I see around me. For once, the PR hooligans and harridans have met their match. They cannot be gainsayed. In the calm of this beautiful morning their superlatives seem gnat-sized in comparison with the scene laid before me. According to the bumf: 'Situated on 320 acres of a former sugar and copra plantation, in its own private estate set against the waters of the Caribbean Sea, Jalousie Plantation is a site spectacular, even for the Caribbean. 'Framed between the symbols of St Lucia, the Petit Piton and Gros Piton mountains, which rise 2,619ft and 2,461ft respectively, the creators of this new resort have painstakingly disguised it to blend in with Mother Nature.' That is all extremely true. To my left and right are Gros and Petit Piton - dramatic volcanic upthrustings, arrowhead-shaped. When it rains, the pitons shed instant cataracts, like a young bride's tears. Yesterday, a woman was injured while climbing the Petit Piton. She should not have been on it. Illegally, guides take tourists up for about Dollars 20. The woman had to be rescued: soldiers, a helicopter, really quite a flap. The sea is in front of me, lapping the beach at Jalousie Cove where some fishermen are located. This is an all-inclusive resort. One price covers everything: accommodation, meals, drinks, sports, spas, supervision of children, airport transfers, taxes and service charges. Apparently, I can ask one of these fishermen for the catch of the day and have it charcoal-grilled at the Bayside Bar and Grill, one of the resort's four restaurants, before my very eyes. Behind me is a dense rainforest ridge from which the plantation and its tropical flora cascade to the cove. Part of the estate is regarded as a bird sanctuary, to help attract the green Jacquot parrot, St Lucia's national bird, which is said to be endangered, no doubt due to foolishness. Jalousie's efforts at plant and birdlife conservation have won the approval of Dr Josephine Rickards, chairman of the St Lucia Naturalists' Society. The rain has not come. I bin the PR bumf. Shall I swim in my private plunge-pool or go in search of the elephant? Second snap, 9.30pm. I am having dinner with Colin Tennant - Lord Glenconner  -who is an investor in Jalousie, and Robert Stewart, general manager. Some of the antiques in Jalousie's Great House have come from Glenconner's homes in Mustique, Scotland and England. He lives in a house high above the cove, at the foot of Gros Piton. The house is murder to get to though the view is sensational. Glenconner is a scrupulously courteous man, and inexhaustibly knowledgeable about the Windward Islands and their ways. He has lived in St Lucia since 1979. Between courses, I tell him about my theory that travel writing should be judged not on what it includes but on what it leaves out. 'Such as?' 'Well, wodges of historical stuff chucked in as padding.' 'I see. Much of it is wrong, you know. Someone gets the history wrong and then it is repeated, handed on down. I feel sorry for tourists, you know. They don't see very much. All they see is an extremely small part of things  -not how people live, how they really are. 'And inaccuracies abound. For example, all the guides and guidebooks say St Lucia has a 'drive-in volcano,' but it is neither volcano nor drive-in. If you ask me, the volcano was out here' - he gestures towards Jalousie cove - 'between the pitons. What the tourists are shown are merely sulphur springs associated with volcanic activity. I could be wrong, however.' 'How about that parrot? Is it really endangered?' 'I don't believe it is. Someone I know sees one nearly every day.' 'And how about your elephant? Is she generally around?' 'Ah, Bupa the elephant. She's in the bush right now, but certainly she's about. A very good elephant. She would answer my call from anywhere on the plantation.' Bupa is a 16-year-old African elephant that Glenconner purchased in Dublin and shipped to St Lucia. 'She's very kind at heart, and very fond of pigs. She doesn't sleep at night. Do you know what she does? She cracks open coconuts and puts them in a line for when the pigs wake up.' Third snap, 10am the next day. I am pottering round the volcanic springs, south of Soufriere: about an acre, grey and brown mudpools, a gentle hissing of steam. Really rather tedious. An eruption is not predicted. After that I drive into Soufriere, which is tatty and poor, but not without charm, and demonstrates the extreme vulnerability of many old Caribbean towns to storms and hurricanes. Some of Soufriere's shanties could be demolished with a cough. The people are nice, though: as slim as sticks of sugar cane, and not at all hustly. Fourth snap, 12.45pm. I am riding with Glenconner, heading for his house along a track of unbelievable ruggedness. He chatters on cheerfully. 'The mangoes here are very fine, you know. I believe there must be 20 to 30 species, though it is almost impossible to find anything about them in books. Do you see that one? That is mango morte. I tried it once. Its taste is said to be reminiscent of human flesh. Rather a fine tree.' Fifth snap, 4pm. I am back at Jalousie, sitting near the beach, pondering the state of marriage, of which I have no experience. Was it diffidence, I wonder, the curse of the English, that stopped me getting married, or am I one of Nature's swingers, born to be single? What is prompting these musings is the press of honeymooning flesh parked by the swimming pool: bronzed pecs and breasts basted and sauteing. Perhaps, it occurs to me, a marriage inaugurated and consummated at Jalousie would not die with a whimper. I snatch up a description of Jalousie's rates and packages. The Jalousie wedding, it says, is something never to be forgotten. It says that couples that get hitched at Jalousie will receive, at no extra charge, 'upgraded accommodations (depending on availability), a wedding ceremony (with surcharge for the attendance of officials, the rate depending on denomination), bouquet, dress (an extravagant wedding gown, created in St Lucia, is available, free of charge), decorated wedding site, cake (three-tier), cocktail reception with hors d'oeuvres, gala dinner and a bottle of French champagne. Other services available for a surcharge include: professional photographer, video services and special dance band.' The Jalousie honeymoon also sounds auspicious: 'At the dawn of each day, the couple can request a special breakfast in the privacy of their own patio by the plunge-pool. A candlit dinner for two on the night of their choice also awaits, as does a private day on a deserted beach with an exotic picnic lunch . . . Each night, as the sun sets into the Caribbean, a personalised Good Night Treat will be in the room.' Again, there is no extra charge for the 'honeymoon programme.' I wander up to the reception desk. I am more than half tempted to ask to view the indigenous wedding gown, to see if it would fit anyone I know. But my courage evaporates; diffidence reasserts itself. They would think me frivolous, my inquiry half-baked. I shrink away silently, a violet in the rainforest. Sixth snap, 5.50pm. The sun, an orb of palest gold, is propped on the horizon, about to disappear. The sea is pewter coloured. An hour ago I scrambled through the bush in search of Bupa the elephant. An extremely kind elephant. A lover of bananas. Remarkably long eyelashes. No sign of her pigs. It has been a perfect day. I realise that I am sitting in the best spot in the best location of what many people regard - scenerywise, peoplewise and otherwise - as the Caribbean's most attractive island. I am reading Travels With My Trombone: A Caribbean Journey, by Englishman Henry Shukman, who tells of travelling by cement boat from Dominica to Trinidad. As they pass an ink stain above the horizon which he guesses is Martinique, a crewman approaches him and asks: 'Checking de island? That Mattnick.' 'Mattnick?' 'Yeah. Martinique. Dey is French.' The crewman rests his elbows alongside Shukman's. 'I don't like Martinique,' he says. 'Why not?' asks Shukman. 'De people is very stick to deyself.' 'Which island do you like?' 'Saint Lucy,' replies the crewman. 'Saint Lucy sweet, man.' Michael Thompson-Noel was a guest of Jalousie Plantation, and travelled c/o British Airways. Until April 11, rates at Jalousie vary from Dollars 240-Dollars 460 per person per night in a double suite or cottage; after that: Dollars 215-Dollars 375 per person per night per couple. Children under 12 are free if staying with parents. Children 12-15: add Dollars 70 per night per child. Jalousie is managed by Premier Resorts &amp; Hotels of Miami, reservations (US and Canada): (800)-877-3643; all other countries: (305)-856-5405. In the UK, Premier's agent is Supereps, tel: 071-242-9964.

Jalousie Plantation's address: PO Box 251, Soufriere, St Lucia, West Indies, tel: (809)-459-7666. Jalousie is an hour by road or boat from Hewanorra airport; apart from BA, Hewanorra is served by Air Canada, American Airlines, BWIA and LIAT. There is a smaller airport, Vigie, at the other end of the island, near the capital, Castries. The temperature on St Lucia is said to vary only between 77oF-82oF year-round.

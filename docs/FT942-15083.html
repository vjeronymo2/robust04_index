			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Aldeburgh goes for Baroque In the 1970s, any student arriving in Cambridge with a preference for Wagner or Mahler felt decidedly out of fashion. All the advanced music students seemed to be involved in researching medieval troubadours or then little-known composers of the early Baroque. Meanwhile, not far away in Aldeburgh, Benjamin Britten was giving performances of Purcell and Bach that set new standards. His recordings of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and St. John Passion using chamber-sized choruses and orchestras divided popular opinion for being light and fast. The vanguard of early music has advanced rapidly since then, but Britten would probably be pleased to learn that Aldeburgh is trying not to get left behind. This Easter saw the first Aldeburgh Early Music Festival. Five days of events over the holiday weekend were stretched rather thinly over the whole span of early music as the definition goes these days, ranging from 12th-century pilgrims' songs to Schubert and Mendelssohn. There have been Easter events at the Maltings for some years but this was the first time that a specifically themed festival had been mounted. The programme was a near sell-out and the management will be analysing the figures to see where the audience has come from and how to capitalise on its first-time success. I asked Philip Pickett, Artistic Director of Aldeburgh's first festival, whether there was a financial advantage in drawing large audiences to concerts which often involved relatively small numbers of players. He thought not: 'It can cost as much to hire a period-instrument orchestra as it does one of the better provincial full-scale symphony orchestras. Some early music specialists are greedy.' As no financial safety-net was set aside in case of failure, the programme was relatively safe, and unlike the June festival, this one does not aim to occupy the intellectual high ground. What Pickett had devised was a broad survey of what is going on in early music at the moment. The only stipulation was that he had to use the Britten-Pears Baroque Orchestra, formed in 1992 and comprising advanced students from the principal music colleges, but that will not have been a hardship. The young players gave a good account of themselves in a pair of Bach Suites and one of the Brandenburgs under the Dutch conductor Ton Koopman. Even among well-known groups, there was quite a range of period performance styles to be observed. Koopman is one of the more flamboyant early music figures and Trio Sonnerie showed the same kind of energy in their programme of 17th-century instrumental duets and trios from Venice. Moving forward to the 19th century, however, Hausmusik gave a pale account of Schubert's Octet, despite the fact that this group includes some of the same players. Why was Aldeburgh able to score a success with early music at its first attempt? First, it must have helped that the Easter period is clear of music festivals elsewhere. Secondly, the programme was varied and safe. Thirdly, a decade of promotion by the record companies has made many early music performers stars in their own right, able to draw enthusiasts to concerts of music by composers they may not even have heard of. Sheila Colvin, Aldeburgh's general director, says she is '99.9 per cent certain' that she will proceed with another early music festival in 1995. If this success encourages sponsors, she will spend the money on building up the daytime events. And if the East coast weather plays its usual tricks, even a hardy Aldeburgh audience would prefer a lecture programme to spending the day dodging hailstones.</p>

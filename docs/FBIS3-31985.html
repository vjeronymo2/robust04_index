			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] We just confirmed that guards at the Cali and  Medellin prisons have joined the strike declared by La Picota  Prison guards. In this regard, moments ago we interviewed  Colonel Gustavo Socha Salamanca, general director of prisons.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Col. Socha, what  are the measures that the Penitentiary and Prison Institute is  announcing in relation to the strike declared by guards at La  Picota, La Modelo, and El Buen Pastor Prisons in Santa Fe de  Bogota?    [Socha] I want to clarify that prison guards have not  declared any strike. At this time there is nothing of this sort  occurring in the country's prisons. I ordered the inspection  division to conduct the pertinent investigations. I also  requested support from the Attorney General's Office to disclose  all reports on developments during and after the search to  determine who failed to carry out their duties and who behaved  improperly, if there was any improper behavior. In short, we  want this situation resolved. [end recording]</p>

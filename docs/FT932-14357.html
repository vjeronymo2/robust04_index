			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (20): Well-established pattern  -Hubs / Manchester Airport WHEN British Airways' inaugural inbound flight from Los Angeles arrived at Manchester airport last month, it contained a surprise. Forty of the 218 passengers were en route to Munich, transferring to BA's early morning service on arrival. BA had not been expecting Manchester to start playing its hub-and-spoke role so quickly - before advertising and promotions had exerted their full effect in California - but the service seems to have tapped a pent-up demand. With 30,000 advance bookings already, BA's target of 70,000 passengers flying Manchester-LA looks easily attainable. It fits a now well-established pattern. Qantas was the first international carrier to give Manchester a proper test with a scheduled long-haul service 10 years ago. This has since proved to have been the critical first step towards a remarkable progress. In 1985, the airport had 2.4m scheduled passengers, 3.7m chartered, and 114,000 in transit, making a total of 6.2m. By the end of last year numbers had doubled, with 4.8m scheduled, 6.9m chartered, and 747,000 in transit, totalling 12.4m. The three categories grew by 100 per cent, 88 per cent and more than 500 per cent respectively over the eight years. This means that the scheduled traffic, which carries business travellers, is growing faster than the holiday traffic, while rapidly rising numbers of transit passengers are proving Manchester's emergence as a hub. Last month, Manchester opened the Pounds 265m first phase of its Terminal Two, so it can grow to 18m passengers a year. There are now 94 airlines serving 166 destinations. Most of Europe is now covered - with day trips to, for example, the main business centres of Germany, France or the Netherlands exploited by growing numbers of business travellers. But it is the growth of worldwide connections which is establishing Manchester's international credibility. Manchester's attraction is 20m people within two hours' driving. Qantas tested a research finding that most of the 50,000 northerners then travelling to Australia via other airports each year would prefer not to change aircraft. 'They got 28,000 in the first year; now it's up to 75,000,' Mr Gil Thompson, Manchester airport's chief executive, says. 'Qantas proved that the northerner rewards the airline that flies to his doorstep. Our research shows that if airlines come in here, people will move their itineraries around to use the services.' Manchester was also helped by a cross-party lobbying group called the Northern Consortium, formed by local authorities throughout the north of England. It helped Manchester airport's designation by the government as both an international gateway and the UK's northern hub. The airlines soon got the message. The airport itself always offered BA first crack at any new potential route, but knew foreign airlines were eager to step in if BA did not want the route because of its commitments at its Heathrow headquarters. American Airlines was therefore the first US carrier to fly direct into Manchester, opening a daily route to Chicago in 1986. Mr Iain Burns, a former Manchester airport employee who now works for American, says: 'There was a huge untapped market of business travellers in the north of England. There was, and still is, a pronounced feeling among businessmen in the north that they should not have to travel to the US by way of London.' Manchester to Chicago is one of the airline's most profitable routes, with flights close to full. Mr Burns says: 'The attraction of Chicago for the business traveller is that it is an important hub. New York is essentially a point-to-point airport. From Chicago it is possible to fly to 114 other destinations. Only 30 per cent of our passengers finish their journeys in Chicago. The other 70 per cent fly on somewhere else.' Delta Airlines is also happy with Manchester, from where it has been flying daily to Atlanta for nearly two years. An official said: 'This flight is very profitable. We carried 136,000 passengers last year, which means pretty full payloads. It did not start quietly, then limp along and finally pick up. We did well from day one.' Cathay Pacific has three flights a week to Hong Kong. Mr John Paterson, Cathay's manager for Britain and Ireland, says: 'The problem of going via Heathrow is that you have to change terminals and flights. From Manchester you can fly direct, with one stop in Frankfurt.' This creates the minimum of disruption for travellers but also enables Cathay to top up with passengers in Frankfurt. Profitability is encouraging Cathay to increase to five flights a week in July, followed by daily services when it can get the slots. Mr Thompson says: 'We have then been able to prove if that airline were minded to fly direct from Manchester, it would carry at least 50 per cent more than our market research first indicates is available. Chicago is a case in point: there were 40,000 when American Airlines started, then 60,000, then 80,000, then 90,000. . and now it's 130,000 people.' Competition is also effective: 'When American Airlines started a daily service to New York - as British Airways already offered - BA was afraid it would halve the cake. What has it done? It has doubled the traffic. Instead of 100,000 passengers a year to New York from Manchester, there are now 200,000. 'Our research has shown that direct, particularly non-stop services, multiply the traffic. We are not in the business of putting airlines on the margin by trying to cut the cake into too many small slices,' Mr Thompson adds. As well as passengers driving to Manchester, the airport also promised airlines it would use valuable air traffic slots to improve feeder services. This has also paid off. 'There are now more domestic passengers feeding Manchester as a hub than any other airport in the country, including London,' Mr Thompson says. 'We have 19 domestic routes. We feed them in from places such as Dundee, Edinburgh, Exeter, Southampton, Belfast, Cardiff and Newcastle. It's expensive in terms of slots, but it's our investment in the future  - to be a hub, rather than an airport that flies from point to point.' About 250,000 extra passengers have therefore been delivered to the long-haul scheduled carriers, the bulk of them business travellers. Manchester also offers another advantage - it is up to an hour nearer New York than London is, partly because of less air traffic congestion. Business leaders point to a 5 1/2 -hour journey time eastbound. There are still gaps in Manchester's schedules, such as Vienna and Japan, but Mr Thompson and his team are working on them, with a regular return service to Osaka by All Nippon Airways the best bet for the next new long-haul route.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> QUE PASA?;  </P> <P> PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> "We were tired of being excluded" from leadership positions in the Chicano  movement, Francisca Flores recalled, explaining why the Comision Femenil  Mexicana Nacional was formed in 1970. "Women were never nominated for executive  offices, so we went off on our own," said Flores, the comision's founder, now  77 and retired in San Diego.  </P> <P> The group's first project was the Chicana Service Action Center, "an agency  serving low-income, working Chicanas," said Magdalena Beltran, vice president  of the group's Los Angeles chapter. With 23 chapters, the comision today  sponsors a variety of community service projects and numerous programs to  develop leadership among Latinas.  </P> <P> Frank J. Alderete was functionally illiterate when he entered East Los Angeles  College, but he went on to earn his Ph.D. in education from USC. Alderete, 47,  is the new president of the Los Angeles County Board of Education, an  intermediary between county school and community college districts and the  State Department of Education. That post and his temporary duties with the  Workforce L.A. civic alliance goes well with his interest in ensuring that  education meets the needs of the future labor force. "Otherwise," he said, "we  are going to hurt our young people if we're not moving in that direction."  EDWARD J. BOYER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Monday  recent developments toward solving the situation over North  Korea's nuclear facilities, including possible resumption of  talks between North korea and the United States and a summit  between the top leaders of North and South Korea.    Japan welcomes the results of a visit to North Korea by  former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko Saito said.    He told a press conference Japan will continue to watch the  developments following Carter's Pyongyang trip and to make the  utmost efforts in calling for a "serious" response from North  Korea while maintaining close contact with the U.S. and South  Korea.    Turning to Japan's proposal to assist North Korea to convert  its present nuclear facilities to a light-water reactor, Saito  echoed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's remarks over the weekend  that such aid would take place if Tokyo and Pyongyang discuss  the issue within the context of normalization talks.    Since Japan's economic aid for North Korea after  normaliztaion of bilateral relations is one of the topics in the  normalization talks, it is natural that Japan's help to convert  to a light-water reactor will also be discussed, Saito said.    Japan and North Korea have not held normalization talks  since  November 1992 due to a stalemate over international inspections  of North Korea's nuclear facilities.</p>

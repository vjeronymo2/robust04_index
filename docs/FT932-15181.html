			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Pakistan's president warns PM to resolve continuing political crisis PAKISTANI President Ghulam Ishaq Khan issued a stern warning to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif yesterday to resolve what he called grave problems and to end a crisis that threatens his government, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Mr Sharif met the president for the third time in 10 days to try to end a bitter feud that many ministers have said could prompt Mr Ishaq Khan to use his powers to dissolve the National Assembly (lower house). Mr Sharif enraged the president in February when he set up a committee to modify the Eighth Amendment, martial law-era legislation that empowers the president to dissolve parliament and appoint the armed forces chiefs of staff. Six cabinet ministers and two advisers have resigned in an apparent show of support for the president in the present tussle. Mr Sharif undertook to act on 'an urgent basis' and to report to the president with precise measures, the statement said. Fears that Mr Sharif's 2 1/2 -year coalition government, weakened by several desertions in the past year, could fall sent the stock exchange into a tailspin. 'The stock market has nose-dived and business activity is suffering because of the political instability,' Mr Sharif told reporters earlier in the day. The Karachi Stock Exchange index has plunged 25 points since Sunday. 'The uncertain political situation will affect the economy, which in turn will bring unemployment,' he said. 'Unemployment breeds anarchy.' Mr Sharif said political instability could reverse Pakistan's ambitious reform programme to deregulate the economy. Last week the prime minister nominated Mr Ishaq Khan for a second term to try to end the hardening antagonism. Mr Ishaq Khan, whose five-year term expires late this year, used the Eighth Amendment to dismiss former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on charges of corruption and misrule in 1990 and feels betrayed by her successor's bid to curb his authority. General Abdul Waheed, chief of army staff, postponed a visit to France due to begin today. His visit to the US from April 20 will go ahead. Diplomats said Gen Waheed may have postponed his departure because of the mounting domestic political crisis. Should the president decide to dissolve parliament, they said, he would be unlikely to act without consulting the chief of army staff - the most powerful pillar in the ruling troika with the president and prime minister. The army has governed Pakistan for most of its 45 years since independence from Britain and partition in 1947.</p>

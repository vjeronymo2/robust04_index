			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "uhl": "The Temporary Acceptance of Loss of </F> Real Income"]    [Text] In its 1994 annual economic report, the government  has once again stressed that there has to be an improvement in  conditions for industry in Germany, the consolidation of public  finance has to be continued in a determined manner, and there  have to be further tax reductions to raise competitiveness.    So as not to discourage companies from investing, fiscal  policy must, above all, "dispel the fear" that the increase in  the budget deficit will lead to a further taxation burden in  either the short term or long term. Thus, at all state levels,  there has to be a high degree of "savings and discipline  regarding expenditure" to gradually reduce the state's share of  GDP to the same level as in the period before unification by the  year 2000.    The government advises the partners to wage agreements to  show "moderation" and has stressed its intentions of achieving a  wage freeze in negotiations with public sector employees. In  the old laender, a drop in real incomes will have to be accepted  to improve employment opportunities. An increase in  productivity should only lead to an increase in real incomes  when a high level of employment has been achieved once again.    In the new laender, it should be borne in mind that economic  performance will only reach western German levels over a longer  period of time. A strategy of catching up in economic terms so  that incomes reach western levels will "increasingly be an  obstacle to more investment and employment." Wage policy cannot  bear the entire burden for the process of economic adjustment in  eastern Germany. It is, however, "imperative and reasonable" for  wage policy to contribute to closing the gap between wage levels  and enterprise performance.    The government regrets that in western Germany and above all  in eastern Germany, wage policy currently does not take  sufficient account of the differences in economic performance in  terms of sectors and companies. There is much to be said for  "new directions" in wage policy. So, for example, more freedom  for companies and plants would provide a meaningful stimulus for  "more wage policy creativity." Profit sharing could also reduce  the burden on wages.    The partners to collective agreements should consider the  possibility of concluding agreements covering several years to a  greater extent than has been the case until now. Agreements  could, for example, be reached guaranteeing a share of profits  if earnings develop favorably.    Finally, the Federal Government is calling on the partners  to  wage agreements to make working hours more flexible to reduce  company costs and to better satisfy the individual wishes and  needs of employees and those seeking work. The new labor law  will thus increase what room for maneuver there is. More  flexibility in working hours should not, however, be a burden on  the Federal Office of Employment.</p>

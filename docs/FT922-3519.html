			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Collor comes down to earth WHEN the dignitaries leave Rio de Janeiro this weekend after their deliberations on saving the earth, their host should return to more mundane matters of state: persuading a recalcitrant Congress to move on economic reform. President Fernando Collor's economic programme hangs in the balance. Success on a variety of fronts is vital, the most significant being the passage into law of a comprehensive tax reform proposal, which is vital for long-term stability in government finances. Fiscal consolidation is necessary to tame inflation, now running at around 20 per cent a month. Without that, the conditions for a resumption of growth  -the only answer to the country's pressing social problems - will not exist. In April, the president gave himself a chance to break the political deadlock that has so far hampered his administration's economic reform efforts. His brother's recent allegations of corruption and drug abuse against the president may regrettably have set this process back. The group of politicians Mr Collor brought into his cabinet in April has given the president the potential to deal more effectively with Congress, where he has lacked support since he took office in 1990. In doing so, however, he embraced traditional politicians for whom he expressed distaste in his presidential campaign. New-found supporters There are worries that this accommodation of old-style politicians will be accompanied by a return to old-style politics. The test of this will be whether in coming months public funds are distributed to the regions where the administration's new-found supporters are located, ahead of important local elections in October. This would compromise the government's fiscal policy. However, the credibility of the policy should be enhanced by the continuation in office of economy minister, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, and his team. It has helped gradually to rebuild Brazil's damaged image with foreign financial institutions, including international banks and the International Monetary Fund, with which the government has a stand-by loan programme. Continued fiscal stringency is needed not least to maintain the support of the IMF. Without it, a potential debt reduction accord now being discussed with international banks would unravel. That accord is needed to bring a boost in confidence which should help to lower domestic interest rates. This, in turn, would reduce the crippling cost of Brazil's internal debt, which feeds both the fiscal deficit and inflation. Purse strings The economic team held tightly to the purse strings in the first three months of this year, allegedly compressing government expenditure by 60 per cent in real terms from the same period last year. Even then, the government failed to meet the targets set for the first quarter of its IMF programme. The government says it is confident of meeting its half-year IMF targets. Although revenues should now be rising as delayed corporate tax payments start to flow, these are likely to be insufficient to avoid further drastic expenditure compression, which is neither sustainable nor desirable for long. For a more permanent solution, congressional action is needed, first to reform and simplify the tax system, also making clearer the divisions of responsibility between federal and state governments, and second to reform the 1988 constitution, which at present makes Brazil almost impossible to govern. This would permit the necessary rationalisation of the state, allowing the government to fire employees, for example. By lowering tariffs and other measures, the Collor administration has, despite early mistakes, begun to shake up Brazil's cosseted, inefficient and state-dependent private sector. But progress is dependent on Mr Collor's breaking the political stalemate. If he fails to do that this year, his chances of doing so in the last two years of his presidency will be remote. By then, the window that has opened for a resolution of Brazil's external financial difficulties may well have closed: the support of the IMF and what sympathy exists among international banks will not be extended indefinitely.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- Kim Chong-su, chairman  of the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful  Reunification, in a statement April 20 denounced the U.S.  imperialists' criminal deployment of Patriot missiles in South  Korea as a very dangerous act of pushing the military situation  on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, the Tokyo-based  Korean News Service reported.    He demanded that the U.S. authorities renounce their hostile  policy of stifling the DPRK, immediately stop the reckless war  rackets and sincerely approach DPRK-USA talks for a fundamental  solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    He strongly urged the South Korean authorities to discard  their flunkeyist, treacherous policy and not refuse but  sincerely accept the proposal of convening a national conference  to find the way of the great unity of the whole nation, a  proposal made at a joint meeting of the DPRK Government,  political parties and public organizations.</p>

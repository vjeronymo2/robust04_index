Talks dealt with the Arab situation  and relations between the two fraternal countries.    The meeting was attended by Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed  Salah Dembri and Syrian Ambassador in Algiers Dr. 'Abd-al-Jabbar  al-Dahhak. It was also attended by Dr. Mikha'il Wahbah,  director of the special bureaus department.    At the end of the meeting, al-Shar' spoke to reporters. He  said: I conveyed a letter from President Hafiz al-Asad to His  Excellency President Zeroual dealing with bilateral relations,  the overall regional situation, and internal developments in  fraternal Algeria. I listened to his excellency's assessment of  the situation in Algeria and the national dialogue. President  Zeroual stressed his concern for Syrian-Algerian relations to  me, and I emphasized to his excellency our concern for bilateral  relations.    Al-Shar' added: We expressed our conviction that Algeria,  through what it enjoys in terms of militant history and  important regional and international status, must restore its  position and effective role, particularly in the Arab World.  This is because Arab and Islamic nations are facing great  challenges, and Algeria has an important role to play in  confronting these challenges. Collective Arab action will remove  many dangers facing us, and will help us all serve our nation's  objectives.    Asked about Syria's position on the Security Council's delay  in passing a resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, the  foreign minister said: Delaying a resolution by the Security  Council is not important. What is really important is the  substance of such a resolution. Accordingly, we say that such a  resolution should not only condemn the hideous crime committed  in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque; it should also address the real  reasons behind committing such a crime. In other words, a clear  position should be taken on the settlements and the armed  settlers. These settlers should be disarmed, and the  settlements should be dismantled as part of a comprehensive  solution that will completely end the Israeli occupation of Arab  territories. Otherwise, such terrible massacres can occur again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 8 Jan--The Russians have once again  amazed everyone by their precision: the launching of the  spacecraft "Soyuz TM-18"--planned for 13 hours 05 minutes 32  seconds--was carried out with only a two-second delay, whereas  the permissible divergence from the launch time is plus-minus 60  seconds. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the Russian cosmonauts and their colleagues from  other countries will have to work on the Russian "Mir" station.  It is true that the shortage of funds has had its effect on the  state of the orbital complex. Launched in 1986, the station was  meant to exist in orbit for five years. The shortage of funds,  however, has lead to the fact that setting up a substitute--the  "Mir-2" station-- has been delayed. Regular work is being  carried out on "Mir" to prolong its "life".    The "old age" of the station is already having a negative  effect. It was noted at one of the latest sessions of the  interstate committee that 661 defects have been revealed,  including 18 during the period of the 14th main expedition (from  1 July 1993). However, these defects do not pose any direct  threat to the safety of the crew. [passage omitted]</p>

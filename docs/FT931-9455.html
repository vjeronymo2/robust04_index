			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Welsh gas project may secure shipyard's future PLANS FOR a Pounds 250m gas terminal on the North Wales bank of the Dee estuary received government approval yesterday, in a move which may secure the future of the Cammell Laird shipyard at Birkenhead. But the consortium of oil companies planning to build the terminal stressed it would go ahead only if PowerGen, the electricity generator, was allowed to build a Pounds 580m gas-fired power station nearby at Connah's Quay, which would use gas piped from the terminal. The approval process for the power station has been frozen pending the government's pit closure review; blocking further gas-fired power stations is one option to boost markets for coal. The North Wales project would create more than 3,000 jobs during the construction phase and 200 permanent jobs. Investment for a new gas field in Liverpool Bay, the terminal and the power station would total Pounds 1.5bn in the depressed sub-region of Merseyside, west Cheshire and north-east Wales. Amec, the civil engineering and offshore construction group, said yesterday it would reconsider whether to bid for the Cammell Laird yard, which is due to close when it runs out of work this year. Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec's chairman, said recently the group would be interested in Cammell Laird if development of the gas field allowed it to shift to offshore and related work. The consortium involved in the exploration and development of Liverpool Bay and which wants to build the gas terminal includes Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and Monument. Yesterday, Mr Ed Blair, president of Hamilton Oil called for rapid Department of Trade and Industry approval for the PowerGen project. The terminal was approved by the Welsh Office after a public inquiry. It was opposed by miners at the Point of Ayr pit, one of the 21 pits affected by the closure review, and by environmental groups. The DTI said yesterday there was 'no connection' between decisions on the terminal, which was a planning matter, and the power station, which needs approval under the 1989 Energy Act. However, the companies involved were sceptical about government departments taking decisions in isolation from each other. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who has been a longstanding champion of Cammell Laird, as both environment secretary and defence secretary, now has to make the decision on the Connah's Quay power station, which in turn will have an impact on pit closure policies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] France has reiterated its clear stand in support of  Yemeni unity. In a memorandum to the Yemeni government on the  current crisis, France said that it considers Yemeni unity a  factor of stability in the region and therefore expressed  reservations over the secessionist declaration. It noted that  it is paradoxical for the international community to recognize a  secession resulting from an armed action, given that the  Republic of Yemen realized its unity through a democratic  process, a referendum held in May 1991, and legislative  elections held on 27 April 1993.    The memorandum explained the international organization's  [as  heard] position on this issue by saying that if the United  Nations approves such recognition, France fears that the UN's  credibility will be affected and it will stand bewildered and  confused when dealing with certain regional crises that are  similar to the Yemeni crisis; that is, when certain parties  declare their own establishment such as the Serb Republic in  Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia for instance. Moreover, France  does not harbor any hostility. [sentence as heard]    In conclusion, the memorandum affirmed support for UN  secretary general and his special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. It  stressed the urgency of calling on all parties to implement the  cease-fire as stipulated in UN Resolution 924 and convincing  these parties to continue the dialogue to find a peaceful  solution.</p>

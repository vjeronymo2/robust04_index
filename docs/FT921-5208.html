			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Holzstoff proposes plan for capital restructuring HOLZSTOFF, the Swiss paper and distribution group, has reported a 22.4 per cent jump in 1991 consolidated net income to SFr31.5m (Dollars 21m) on sales up 18.5 per cent to SFr814.6m. The directors have also proposed a radical capital restructuring plan that would put all shareholders on an equal basis. Last May, an alliance of foreign and Swiss pension funds forced the Holzstoff board to withdraw a proposal that would have limited the voting rights of registered shareholders. Under the new plan, to be implemented following the change in Swiss company law on July 1, all restrictions on the transferability and voting rights of registered shares would be eliminated. All bearer shares and participation shares would be converted into registered shares and the registered shares would be split on the basis of 10 for one. The directors said that the group had successfully completed a strategic restructuring over the past two years and was raising the gross dividend per share from SFr90 to SFr110. Each share or participation holder will also receive gratis options.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Members are inattentive Sir, Ms Arrowsmith (Letters, November 20) may have missed the point of our article ('Omissions on options', November 18) when she cites the various institutional shareholder guidelines that cover issues such as equity dilution, discounting and voluntary lapsing of share options. She does not dispute that these flaws exist, but states that there are regulations to prevent misuse. We agree, and applaud the extent to which the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) have created such comprehensive guidelines. However, the point of our article was to illustrate how little impact these issues and their regulations have at the individual pension fund manager level. Certainly, with respect to issues of executive remuneration, the ABI and the NAPF are anything but 'inattentive', but their thousands of members often are, as has been admitted.

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fourth quarter up 16%, but growth slows at Wal-Mart Wal-Mart Stores, the biggest US retailer, increased net income by 16 per cent to Dollars 868m in the fourth quarter to January 31, ending a year in which the rate of profits growth slowed significantly. Net income for the year was 17 per cent ahead at Dollars 2.33bn, on sales 21 per cent ahead at Dollars 67.34bn. This produced a 17 per cent increase in earnings per share to Dollars 1.02. In the previous five years, earnings per share grew at an average 25 per cent a year, and in the five years before that averaged 36 per cent. Some analysts believe the latest figures reflect an inevitable maturing of the company's rapid development. Last spring the shares were re-rated downwards, as the market adjusted to the prospect of a decline in earnings growth. Shares yesterday were Dollars  1/2 ahead at Dollars 28 1/4 , compared with a 12-month high of Dollars 34. Although the pace slowed, Wal-Mart pointed out it was positioned for further expansion. During the year it added 143 new Wal-Mart stores and 164 Sam's Club membership warehouses, 99 of which were Pace clubs acquired from the rival Kmart stores group. It has also expanded geographically, partly through its joint venture with the Cifra retailing group in Mexico and partly through last month's acquisition of Woolworth's 120 Woolco stores in Canada, which are to be converted to the Wal-Mart format. Fourth-quarter sales were 19 per cent ahead at Dollars 20.36bn, and earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 38 cents.</p>

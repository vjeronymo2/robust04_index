			<p>BFN     [Text] The four leaders of the United Opposition Front of  Djibouti who were arrested in Djibouti on 30 January are now  free. A Djibouti tribunal sentenced them to a three-month prison  term this morning. They have already been detained for three  months pending their trial.    The four leaders, including Cheiko, leader of the United  Front, were accused of having publicly supported the armed  struggle of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and  Democracy. The exact terms of the bill of indictment are: Call  for armed struggle, not followed by results. This sentence  amounts to releasing them, since the accused have already spent  three months in jail. Ghislaine Dupont asked their lawyer, Mr.  Aref, if this sentence could be construed as a gesture of  appeasement by the authorities. Listen to Mr. Aref's answer:    [Begin Aref recording] My opinion is completely different. I  believe that this sentence is an expression of unease. I say  this for two reasons. The first reason is that the acts, of  which they were accused, were not carried out. If my clients  did actually jointly sign a resolution with other political  parties in Addis Ababa, they never carried out such a  provocation. Besides, they always disputed the facts. They  said that their intentions and their acts were always to lead a  political, a peaceful, struggle in the town of Djibouti itself.  This is the first reason. The second reason is that as long as  the case is covered by the secrecy of investigation, people do  not know anything. When the case comes in the open, people  attend the trial, whatever their opinion. They are then clearly  informed of the origins and conclusions of the case. Only then  can they have a precise idea more closely tied to reality. I  believe that the sentence which was handed over today reflects  this unease. [end recording]</p>

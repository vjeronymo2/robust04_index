			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Alien settings - Radio The long evenings have given useful space for imaginative drama, and this week has by chance produced pieces with an assortment of alien settings. It also happens that on Radio 3 there was a series of four talks by Robert Wistrich, Professor of Jewish Studies at University College, London, on The Revival of Nationalism. Only one of the plays I heard had any touch of nationalism in it (and that not serious); but it was good to be reminded of foreign cultures. The Sunday play on Radio 3 continued its Polish season with Mariage Blanc by Tadeusz Rosewicz, translated by Adam Czerniawski. Its 16-year-old heroine, Bianca, is unhappy about the marriage to Benjamin arranged for her, and a lot of the play consists of her talk with her friend Pauline. We learn that she wanted to be a boy, that her mother and father never loved each other, that she thinks her grandfather 'unclean'. Much varied sex goes on among family and servants, including Bianca's 'dream' affair with Saint Nicholas, one of several sex-oriented dreams. Pauline explains the facts of life, and Bianca swears she will have a mariage blanc. To make sure of it, she cuts her hair like a boy's before the first night, and as she enters the marital bedroom she asks Benjamin to consider her as his brother. There are moments of deep understanding between the girls, and the play was originally condemned as pornographic. There is indeed much straightforward talk, dodgy at Sunday's 7.30 to 9.00 timing. I was not much impressed by the playing under Kate Rowland's direction. More blancs in Radio 4's Monday Play Lorraine Hansberry's posthumous Les Blancs. Hansberry came from prosperous black folks in Chicago and was seriously concerned with the advancement of coloured people. This play, however, is about Central Africa under the threat of revolt, a different matter altogether, and she seems only to have read about such things in books. Her African village is not convincing, especially as she has added to the indigenous company the staff of a medical mission, a liberal American reporter, a military officer who treats the Africans as peasants, and a quasi-Western member of the central family, Tshebe (Leo Wringer), who likes to be called 'Mr Matoseh'. The story concerns his problem - to join a revolt in which his relations are involved, or to go back to his textile business. There is some sinister gunfire, but few casualties. Heather Goodman was the director. We go still further afield on the World Service, with its version of Dr Strangelove in an adaptation by Kerry Shale. It comes in two parts, the first last Sunday, the next tomorrow. Shale also plays some of the characters, eight of them - five of the crew of the American B52 that precipitates the end of the world by bombing Russia; the Presidents of the USA and Russia; the RAF officer attached to the USAF; and Dr Strangelove himself, a quite small part so much distorted vocally that it is hard to understand. The mutual antagonism of the nations is, one hopes, as much a matter of history as their post-nuclear weaponry; at any rate the total destruction of life involved in Russia's 'Doomsday Machine' is no longer as threatening as novelist Peter George left it. It may be that to treat national enmity as a source of laughter is the best idea.</p>

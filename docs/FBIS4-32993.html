			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>   [Text] Education Minister Marco Alarcon confirmed yesterday  he will resign from his post to avail himself of his retirement  as a teacher. He also said German Vergara, current Arnulfist  Party [PA] deputy secretary general, will replace him.    Alarcon's resignation will be effective as of 1 July, when  his retirement papers, currently in their final processing  stage, are completed. It was also reported that Alarcon  requested his vacation time, as is his right, after having been  the education minister for three [number as published] years.    He took office on 1 April 1992, when he replaced Ada de  Gordon, following President Guillermo Endara's ousting of the  Christian Democratic Party from the government alliance.  Alarcon denied that his separation from the post of education  minister is due to discrepancies with the PA or with President  Endara.    Meanwhile, Vergara said he accepted the appointment to the  post. The current minister recommended him, and Endara accepted  the recommendation. Vergara was the secretary general of the  Health Ministry, and he acquired his teaching experience in the  interior.    PA Secretary General Carlos Young Adames highly praised  Vergara's appointment by noting he believes in the work Vergara  will embark on despite the short term he will have heading the  Education Ministry.    It was also confirmed that Bolivar Armuelles will remain  deputy education minister until 1 September, when the government  of President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares begins.</p>

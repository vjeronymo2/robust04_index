Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); and section 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public housing development regulations are published at 24 CFR part 941; demolition/disposition regulations are published at 24 CFR part 970; section 5(h) regulations are published at 24 CFR part 906.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim and final regulations for the public housing FSS program were published on May 27, 1993, at 58 FR 30858, and 58 FR 30906, respectively, and will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. (The FSS final rule simply adopts the FSS interim rule as the FSS final regulations.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Notice of Program Guidelines for the HOPE&hyph;1 program was published on January 14, 1992 at 57 FR 1522. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.850.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Fund Availability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriation Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993) (1994 Appropriations Act) makes available up to $598 million of budget authority (grants) for public housing development/Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP) under section 5(a)(2) of the USHA. Since some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from the recapture of prior year obligations, the actual amount available may be less. At the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, the available amount was $542,796,616, which included $149,534 in available carryover funds. As recaptures of funds within the Annual Contributions account occur during the fiscal year, these amounts will be made available for allocation to public housing development up to the fully appropriated amount, plus carryover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of appropriated funds (up to $29,900,000 depending on recaptures) for the development of housing designated for disabled families, and up to $119,200,000 (depending on recaptures) for activities involving MROP activities. Applications for designated housing for disabled families and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs to be published by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of funds for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the amount appropriated for development or $150 million. One half of one percent of the appropriated amount (up to $2,990,000) has been set aside for technical assistance and inspections. Units transferred or sold to residents under HOPE I or section 5(h) are subject to replacement in accordance with section 304(g) of the USHA. Based on experience, the Department will provide up to $76,059,534 for such replacements. The balance of funds will be fair shared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following table illustrates the distribution of grant authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s20,12,12 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=2 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2(Maximum)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2(Minimum)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=2 --> Housing for Disabled  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $29,900,000  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $26,635,460  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MROP Activities  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 119,200,000  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 116,139,686  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sec 18 Replacement Units  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 150,000,000  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 150,000,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Assistance/Inspections  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,990,000  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,663,547  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HOPE I and Sec 5(h) Replacement  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 76,059,534  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 63,546,250  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fair-Share  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 220,000,000  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 183,811,673  <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=2 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 598,149,534  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $542,796,616  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> C. Fund Assignments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts identified as Headquarters Reserve and (b) amounts determined incapable of geographic allocation. The amounts identified by category below are maximums.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

(Headquarters Reserve amounts are limited in accordance with section 104 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;235, approved December 15, 1989), to five percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under the USHA and section 101 of the HUD Act of 1965. Thus, Headquarters Reserve funding decisions will be made by Headquarters and may affect the distribution of grant authority shown above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Fair Share <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Depending on recaptures, up to $220 million will be fair shared to approve category 4 (``other'') applications. These fair share funds will be distributed to Areas (formerly Regions) on the basis of the following fair share factors, which reflect the most recent decennial census data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies, amount of substandard housing, and other measurable conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of errors in FY 1993 in calculating category 4 scores under the June 28, 1993, NOFA (58 FR 34670) for the Laconia Housing and Redevelopment Authority (LHRA) in New Hampshire and the Nahunta Housing Authority (NHA) in Georgia, fair share funds in the amounts of $753,400 and $759,400, respectively, will be awarded from the fair share amounts provided to the New England and Southeast Area before making FY 1994 selections, and assigned to the LHRA and NHA applications. The correction of these errors shall not adversely affect their participation in the FY 1994 rating and ranking process. If a new application is filed by the LHRA or NHA under this NOFA, they will be rated and ranked on the same basis as other applications, as if no error had been made. Any unused assignments will be redistributed, proportional to need, among remaining Areas with approvable unfunded ``other'' applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fair share and Headquarters Reserve funds are also subject to the requirement of section 213 of the HCD Act of 1974 that not less than 20 percent nor more than 25 percent of the HUD aggregate program funds covered by the statute be allocated for use in nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, public housing development fund allocations to select ``other'' applications may be modified before assignment in order to ensure Departmental compliance with this statutory and regulatory requirement (see 24 CFR 791.403(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

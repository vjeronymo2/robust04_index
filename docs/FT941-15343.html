			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: GKN prepares for Pounds 12m sale of Indian stake GKN, the motor components and industrial services group, is preparing to sell for Pounds 11.9m its 46.7 per cent stake in Guest Keen Williams, the Indian engineering and fastenings company. Its agreement to sell the holding for cash to a group of international investors will still leave GKN with a substantial presence in India through other manufacturing ventures in the automotive sector. Along with China, India is widely seen by the world's motor industry as one of the biggest potential car and truck growth markets over the coming decades. Guest Keen Williams has a more generalised business in stampings, presswork and fastenings and, like many other businesses GKN has disposed of previously, is no longer seen as relevant to the group's core activities. The buyers are a group of investors represented by Mr YF Lombard, managing partner of Bearbull Zurich, and Mr BD Bangur of Graphite India. Completion of the deal is subject to formal approval by the Reserve Bank of India. 'The sale is part of a planned divestment programme of non-strategic interests,' said Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman. It will continue to service the Indian automotive sector through Invel Transmissions (constant velocity joints), XLO-GWB Cardan Shafts (propeller shafts and universal joints) and Mahindra Sintered Products (bearings and bushes).</p>

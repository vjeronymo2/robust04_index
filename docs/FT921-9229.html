			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Lancs Enterprises doubles to Pounds 2.1m Lancashire Enterprises, the former economic development arm of Lancashire County Council, yesterday reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 2.12m and a dividend up from 5p to 11p. Turnover was up 65 per cent at Pounds 11m (Pounds 6.67m) as a result of selling economic develop- ment management and advisory contracts to a wider range of clients, which now include the European Commission, the UK government and several regional and local authorities. The company, privatised two years ago, also has regional development contracts in Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary and is pursuing others in Czechoslovakia and Albania, as well as a venture capital fund in north-west England. Its shares are traded on matched bargain basis. Lancashire County Investments has 25 per cent, but the only other disclosable holding is that of Clydesdale Bank Nominees, with 3.6 per cent.</p>

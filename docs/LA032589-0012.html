			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION  </P> <P> I found article regarding the profile of the typical woman who has an abortion  very refreshing ("Many in Survey Who Had Abortion Cite Guilt Feelings"). I was  not surprised to read that the majority of women who have abortions are college  educated, career women, who make over $40,000 per year. This runs totally  contrary to the feminist, pro-choice, pro-abortion rhetoric of the past 20  years.  </P> <P> We have been told that abortion must be available to low-income, minority women  so they can break the cycle of poverty and ignorance caused by unwanted and  poorly timed pregnancies. The truth is that minority women place a higher value  on life than do feminist and pro-choice advocates.  </P> <P> Further, the poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe  that abortion as a convenient form of birth control is just plain wrong.  </P> <P> SEAN McCARTHY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

However, foreign  currency remittance from abroad, a "major financial source" for  Secretary Kim Chong-il, stopped recently and rumors have it that  "something unusual" has happened to him. In addition, it is  observed that his power as heir apparent to President Kim  Il-song has waned.    Since the beginning of this year, South Korean firms and  Korean firms affiliated with the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], that have been engaged in trade  with North Korea, have revealed that foreign currency  remittances from abroad to Secretary Kim Chong-il have stopped.  According to a source in Seoul, the "No. 39 Office" of the  Financial Department of the Central Committee of the Workers'  Party of Korea, which handles Secretary Kim Chong-il's personal  finance, has been closed recently. There is an unconfirmed  report that Choe Su-kil, chief of the office, president of the  Taesung Bank, and a confidante of Secretary Kim Chong-il, has  been dismissed.    The "No. 39 Office," a secret organ more usually referred to  as the "party Central Committee No. 39 office," was a personal  safe for Secretary Kim Chong-il. The office collected and  managed proceeds from the exports of weapons and "loyal  contributions" made by North Korea's overseas organizations,  including the Chongnyon and North Korean diplomats posted to  foreign nations. The office managed funds with the Taesung Bank  (in Pyongyang) and the Kumsong Bank (in Vienna) under its  financial control. The office, which controlled the "party  economy" independent of the government, was a source of  financial power for Secretary Kim to help him solidify the  foundation of his succession as president.    South Korean firms are believed to have contacted Choe  Su-kil, chief of the "No. 39 Office," and other officials with  its Beijing office, to prepare for future business deals with  North Korea. Some take the view that the closure of the "No. 39  Office" is connected to the recent downfall of former Deputy  Premier and State Planning Committee Chairman Kim Tal-hyun, who  operated as a contact point with South Korean firms as a  confidante of Secretary Kim Chong-il.    Over the past few years bribery has been pervasive and the  corruption conspicuous among officials in charge of handling  foreign currency. In addition, whistle-blowing heightened  distrust among these officials while other officials close to  Secretary Kim were subject to disciplinary action. All of this  action is seen as responsible for the closure of "No. 39  Office." President Kim Il-song, father of Secretary Kim, was  the only person in North Korea who could close the office. This  kind of "reprimand" of Secretary Kim can be seen as part of  moves by President Kim Il-song to govern North Korea by himself.    Meanwhile there has been a change in the North Korean  leadership, with Kim Yong-chu, a member of the Political Bureau  and younger brother of President Kim Il-song, being reinstated  as deputy president last year after 18 years of obscurity. In  this way, the Kim family has been mobilized to keep the North  Korean system in place. President Kim Il-song is said to have  made no mention of Secretary Kim during a meeting with the Rev.  Billy Graham, creating the impression that Secretary Kim's power  has waned.    North Korea hailed its decision to pull out of the nuclear  Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) last March as a "decision by  Secretary Kim." But President Kim Il-song now appears to be  trying to deal personally with the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear development.</p>

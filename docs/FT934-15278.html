			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Industry recoils at German union's pay claim UNION calls for pay rises of up to 6 per cent for west German engineers next year and a moratorium on job cuts were rejected by employers yesterday as 'poison' for business. Gesamtmetall, the industry association, which will start negotiations with the IG Metall union next month, said such a settlement would have to be paid for with tens of thousands of jobs. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the new IG Metall president, told a news conference the claim was based on next year's expected inflation rate of between 3.5 and 4 per cent and productivity increases of at least 2 per cent. Engineering and metal employees had already paid the price of recession with 'alarming job losses and severe cuts in real earnings,' he said. Real income increases would increase spending power and demand, he argued. The unveiling of the IG Metall claim marks the formal opening of what promises to be a tense but relatively strife-free pay round in all sectors of German industry. IG Metall, with around 3.6m members, is the country's most powerful union and traditionally sets the pattern for other industry awards. While Mr Zwickel's statement was peppered with the ritual, veiled hints of possible strife, the overall tone was moderate. It indicated guarded readiness to negotiate on more flexible working times and practices, and appeared to leave the way open for a long-term deal such as last year's 21-month settlement which expires at the end of December. However, Gesamtmetall's sharp response reflected local economists' opinions that the employers hold the upper hand. According to independent analyses, west German unemployment is rising by 27 per cent year-on-year. This year alone the industrial workforce has shrunk by 7 per cent. Gesamtmetall, which has yet to make any proposals on pay, said 30,000 jobs a month were being lost in engineering and metalworking. Unit labour costs had risen 11 per cent in the first half of this year, production had fallen 14 per cent and productivity was down 2 per cent. However, observers are sceptical about many industrial employers' hopes of winning a general wage freeze, pointing to real earnings cuts in some IG Metall areas of up to 3 per cent this year, and a sharp drop in personal savings. Most preliminary forecasts for 1994 assume nominal pay increases at or near an expected 3.5 per cent inflation rate. Lex, Page 18</p>

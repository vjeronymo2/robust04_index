			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy appoints US handlers for bank flotations ITALY'S privatisation process yesterday took a small step forward with the appointment of three US banks to assist in the sale of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano. J. P. Morgan is to value the two banks, among the 10 biggest in Italy, for the treasury. Goldman Sachs has been appointed 'global co-ordinator' for the placement of shares in Credito Italiano outside Italy, while Lehman Brothers is to perform a similar role for BCI. The appointments, to be confirmed by the boards of the companies today, mark a significant inroad for US banks to a business which has so far been dominated by UK merchant banks. However, the London houses retain a role in the privatising of Italy's financial institutions. S. G. Warburg was given the mandate last month to assist in the placing of shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, another big financial services group. The stakes in Credito Italiano and BCI to be sold belong to the IRI state holding company. IRI owns 54.4 per cent of the ordinary shares in BCI and 58.1 per cent of Credito Italiano. The government has indicated it would like both deals to be completed as quickly as possible - ideally by the end of this year. However, observers doubt it will be possible to complete the valuation and preparation process in time for a placing before early 1994. The treasury had originally hoped for a trade sale of IRI's stake in Credito Italiano, or, failing that, disposal to a small group of institutional shareholders. Informal soundings early this year by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, revealed only limited interest, leading to the decision to opt for a full flotation of IRI's holdings.</p>

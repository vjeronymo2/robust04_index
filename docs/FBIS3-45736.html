The initiative is expected to put the ROC [Republic of  China]  in a better position to negotiate and avoid having -several  layers of skin peeled off," said Economics Minister Chiang  Pinkung.    Chiang made the remarks before a 17-member Taipei delegation  left for Washington to discuss temporary tariff cuts on 699  agricultural and industrial products with U.S. officials.    Washington has rejected Taipei's proposal to incorporate the  talks concerning tariff cuts on 699 items into trade and tariff  negotiations related to Taipei's bid to rejoin GATT.    Accordingly, the tariff cuts on 699 items will be a series  of  "unilateral" trade demands by the United States.    "It will be like having several layers of our skin peeled  off," Chiang said.    To avoid the unfavorable situation, Chiang said the  government would time tariff cuts to minimize their impact on  local industries.    During the upcoming tariff talks with Washington, slated for  Jan. 19-21, the Taipei delegation will relay the government's  hopes of conducting the annual "bilateral tariff concessions  talks" as soon as possible, Chiang said.    Chiang noted that the government here is unable to fully  comply with the U.S. request to reduce tariff rates on 514  industrial products and 185 agricultural items by 50 percent.    He said less than 50 industrial items, including cars and  electrical appliances, will see their tariffs reduced, while  tariffs on 185 agricultural items would remain unchanged.    The Taipei delegation will detail the reasons behind the  ROC's position to the U.S. negotiators.    Heading the delegation is Huang Yenchao, director general of  the Board of Foreign Trade. His U.S. counterpart is Robert  Cassidy, an assistant U.S. trade representative.    While in Washington, the Taipei delegation is expected to  face strong U.S. pressure to reduce tariffs on 699 items, as  relevant U.S. manufacturers and congressmen are urging that the  U.S. government use its Super 301 provision to force Taipei to  cut the tariffs.    Should Taipei reject the U.S. request, its bid to rejoin  GATT  could be affected. Washington officials earlier said the  progress of Taipei's bid to rejoin the world trade body would  hinge on Taiwans efforts to reduce tariffs.    The government here applies to enter the GATT on Jan. 1,  1990  under the title of "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan,  Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." The application will have to be  endorsed by at least two thirds of the GATT members, now  totaling around 110, to be officially accepted.    As part of the government's efforts to enter GATT, it has  decided to cut its weighted average tariff to around 3.5 percent  from the current level of 4.2 percent.</p>

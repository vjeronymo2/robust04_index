Today's agenda  reflects this trend," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  said in his opening address at the meeting of CIS foreign  ministers in Moscow today.    The forum is being attended by delegations from all 12  countries of the Commonwealth, including foreign ministers of  Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Other  countries are represented by ambassadors and deputy foreign  ministers.    Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze told  ITAR-TASS  that a Georgian delegation was taking part in a meeting such as  this for the first time, but as a new member of the CIS, Georgia  "will try to make its modest contribution to the strengthening  of the Commonwealth".    Ukrainian Ambassador Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told ITAR-TASS  that "We have certain considerations concerning the documents  examined at the forum, particularly the document on the rights  of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. We do not  understand what a linguistic minority means. In our republic  there are ethnic minorities -- Russians and Poles. Ukraine is  doing everything in its power for them not to feel that their  rights are infringed upon."</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Confident Tories pin hopes on turnround: The prospects for political parties in the local elections in Scotland SCOTTISH Conservatives, long accustomed to keeping their upper lips stiff in the face of adversity, are suddenly beaming with confidence. They believe they will do well in today's district council elections and consolidate the turnround in their fortunes that began with the general election. In the prize target of Edinburgh, Mrs Christine Richard, leader of the Tory party, says: 'I am quite convinced that we are going to win here. I believe Conservative party supporters will turn out and the disaffected ones will come back to us.' The party is still basking in delight at confounding sceptics by winning two extra seats in the general election and increasing its share of the Scottish vote - admittedly by just 1.7 percentage points to 25.7 per cent. Tories gaze at the turmoil in the opposition parties, each of which lost a seat and failed to make promised conquests - although the Scottish National party's vote went up by 7.5 points to 21.5 per cent. Yet the Tories hold only three councils, the same number as the Liberal Democrats, while the SNP has only one. Labour controls 27 of the 53 Scottish districts and the rest are held by independents or non-Tory coalitions. The Conservatives believe they will win Perth and Kinross, run by an SNP/Lib-Dem/independent coalition, and Stirling, where Mr Michael Forsyth held his parliamentary seat on April 9 and where Labour rules thanks to the spin of a coin by the returning officer after a dead heat in 1988. They hold Berwickshire, where most of their councillors are unopposed, and should keep Eastwood, and Bearsden and Milngavie, both outside Glasgow. They hope to gain seats in Aberdeen and to remove the Liberal Democrats from power in Gordon, although they have no seats there at the moment. The main goal, though, is Edinburgh, which the Tories lost to Labour in 1984. In 1988 the Conservatives took 22 wards against Labour's 32 in spite of winning 70 more votes overall than Labour. To win a majority the Tories need a swing to them of 6 per cent, although a 1.5 per cent swing would be enough to rob Labour of its majority. Even the most enthusiastic canvassers of all parties admit that the voters are suffering from election fatigue. Yet the SNP is presenting the district elections as a re-run of April 9 and is fielding more candidates than any other party. Mr Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, sees it as a 'second chance' for Scots 'to vote in the light of the general election result'. The SNP has taken up the call raised after the general election for a multi-option referendum on Scotland's constitutional future. SNP councils and individual councillors will be committed to trying to organise the referendum - offering a choice of independence, a devolved parliament and the status quo - some time next year. It remains to be seen whether many voters will ignore local issues such as poll tax levels and housing to vote SNP on a national issue. So far the party controls only one council, Angus. It takes comfort from a System Three poll last week which put its support at 25 per cent, 3 points up on the general election. The SNP expects to win control of Banff and Buchan, and of Moray, from independents. Both are in the north-east, where the SNP's MPs are. It also hopes to capture Cumbernauld in the central belt, where Labour kept control in 1988, again on the spin of a coin in a dead heat. Further gains such as West Lothian, Clackmannan and Kilmarnock will still need substantial swings from Labour. The Liberal Democrats will be under pressure from the Tories in Gordon, in north-east Fife and in Annandale and Eskdale in the south-west. As in other parts of Britain they are strong in their own local-government areas. The big question is whether Labour can motivate enough of its supporters to go out and vote. Having failed to win power at Westminster and being unable to deliver the Scottish parliament it had promised, it is the most demoralised and divided of the Scottish parties. Last week's opinion poll put its support at 36 per cent, 3 points below the general election result. Labour is protected in many districts, however, by the large swings of votes needed by the opposition to unseat it. Provided its hardcore supporters turn out to vote, its losses should be limited. If not, there will have been a political earthquake.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Assisted areas map set for EC scrutiny THE GOVERNMENT is expected this week to submit to the European Commission its redrawn assisted areas map, the subject of intensive lobbying by the regions. The map will specify areas in which companies can qualify for UK government and EC regional aid. It is receiving its final touches from Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister. Publication was expected early this year, but last month the government said it was being delayed until after the May local elections. As the EC may take up to eight weeks to decide on ratification, it may not be make public until late July. The map is expected to provoke fierce controversy by including areas of inner London and south-east England, at the expense of parts of Wales, the Midlands and the north of England. It currently covers 35 per cent of Britain's working population but Mr Sainsbury has warned that the figure may fall. Last week the DTI pre-empted publication by announcing continued development area status for the Newcastle and south Tyneside travel-to-work areas, because of likely large job losses from Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Hard grind for Tomkins Nine months after the acquisition of Ranks Hovis MacDougall, it is clearer than ever that the deal will make or break Tomkins' reputation. The trouble is the market has no firm feel which it will be, although a 5 per cent fall in Tomkins' share price yesterday, following a bout of underperformance, highlights its suspicions. If Tomkins can squeeze more value from RHM's stodgy dough then both confidence and a premium rating will be restored. That would enable the conglomerate to skip merrily on to new prey in a few years' time. With net cash of Pounds 120m at the year-end and the ability to milk yet more from its mature businesses, Tomkins should certainly have a strong launchpad. Yet worries about RHM may continue to undermine Tomkins' rating. The paucity of detailed information about RHM's progress does little to dispel doubts. Tomkins appears to have successfully managed the tricky task of maintaining market share while cutting baking capacity by 7 per cent. Combined with a surprising rise in market volumes, this has helped bring the supply-demand balance closer to equilibrium. The shedding of 2,000 jobs will also bring significant cost benefits. Still, judging by its thin contribution to Tomkins' results, RHM had still not reached the bottom of its cycle when it was bought. RHM's shareholders must be smiling at their good fortune. So far, Tomkins' response to the doubters has been: trust us. The company's fine financial record certainly commends it. But with Tomkins deriving little uplift from its existing businesses, the market is right to suspend judgment.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR LICENSING  </P> <P> A "Speaking Out" column (April 15) featured Vernon Martin, an appraiser for a  major financial institution, questioning the value of pending legislation that  would license and/or certify real estate appraisers. The appraisal profession  is unique in that until now, there have been no requirements for entry into the  profession.  </P> <P> A number of appraisal organizations exist, some more reputable than others, but  membership is purely voluntary. The most recognized and prestigious appraisal  organizations represent only a small fraction of practicing appraisers.  </P> <P> With this in mind, I can't imagine why anyone in the industry would oppose  licensing-certification of real estate appraisers. Not only is state licensing  required by Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act of 1989 (S&amp;L bail-out), but will also regulate the  activities of the large number of practicing appraisers who are not affiliated  with any recognized appraisal organization.  </P> <P> Mr. Martin believes that legal action against errant appraisers is a better  solution, apparently not realizing the cost of such litigation; who needs more  lawsuits anyway? Is fear of legal action any greater deterrent to appraisal  abuse than the possible loss of license and livelihood? I think not.  </P> <P> The writer's fear that licensing will be administered by the Department of Real  Estate is also unfounded. This is contrary to the intent of the federal  legislation, noting that both licensing bills under consideration in the  California Legislature (AB 527 and SB 2380) propose regulation of appraisers  within the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency.  </P> <P> Licensing of real estate appraisers isn't a panacea. But with proper  enforcement, it is better than the current system, which allows unqualified  and/or dishonest appraisers to do their thing with little fear of retribution.  </P> <P> MICHAEL V.

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Nissan sees break-even in Europe next year Nissan Motor's European operations should recover and break even in 1995, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'We saw red figures in 1993, and 1994 will be extremely difficult,' said Mr Tadahiro Shirai, president, but in 1995 European operations should be out of the red, he added. Mr Shirai also said European demand had likely hit bottom in 1993 at around 12.5m vehicles. 'In 1994, we do not see a significant increase, maybe 1 or 2 per cent.' But from 1995 demand should increase by about 5 per cent next year over this year's marginal gain.</p>

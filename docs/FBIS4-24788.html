			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Public Security  Ministry recently distributed a circular calling on public  security organizations at various levels to make concentrated  efforts to investigate and ban the illegal production and sale  of police uniforms and police insignia and emblems, and to  seriously crack down on the activities of impersonating  policemen.    The "circular" says: Over the past year, public security  organizations have done a lot of work and achieved some good  results in investigating and banning the illegal production and  sale of police uniforms and police insignia and emblems and  cracking down on the activities of impersonating policemen.  Nevertheless, the situation of producing and selling police  uniforms, police insignia and emblems, and police equipment by  some plants and units is still quite serious. The situation of  impersonating policemen by a small number of people is still  quite conspicuous. Some criminals bought police uniforms to  impersonate policemen and commit crimes. This has seriously  endangered public security in the society and undermined the  reputation of the people's police.    The "circular" points out: It is imperative to seriously  handle those cases involving the illegal production and sale of  police uniforms and signs, the illegal wearing of police  uniforms and insignia, and swindling by impersonating policemen  in accordance with related regulations. It is necessary to  investigate criminal responsibility of those whose cases are  serious and constitute crimes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mate Granic by Visnja </F> Staresina; place and date not given: "U.S. Support to Croatian  Integrity"]    [Text] How will the negotiating process continue after the  signing of the Washington agreement -- in other words, how to  include the Serbs in that process? What has Croatia been  promised in Washington and what will it have to do in return?  For an answer to these questions, we talked to Foreign Minister  Mate Granic in Washington the day after the ceremonial signing  of the Croat-Bosniak agreement and his many talks with  high-level U.S. officials and representatives of the European  "Group of Three."    [Staresina] After signing the Washington agreement and  talking with Mr. Silajdzic, is it more clear now how the Serbs  should be involved in the negotiations?    [Granic] Signing the agreement was the first step toward  establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that this  alliance or federation between the Bosniaks and the Croats has  become a reality not only on paper but also in practice. We  believe that most Bosniaks and Croats have accepted it, and  reports confirm that. However, the crucial question now is what  will happen next. The United States, or rather special envoy  Charles Redman, and European constituents are going to discuss  territorial demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina between the  federation and the Serbian side and, on the other hand,  sanctions imposed on Serbia that are connected both to the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to that in the United  Nations Protected Areas [UNPA]. Furthermore, the Security  Council is going to discuss the new mandate this week, and that  will mark future developments. Moreover, the role of the  Russian Federation in the negotiations with the third side has  been defined to some extent; The European Union will be more  involved in the negotiations. The framework and the location of  the negotiations, as well as the determined compromise proposal  on demarcation between the third side and the federation, are  being decided upon. Internal demarcation will be discussed  after the agreement on the final composition of the federation  has been reached.  <H5>  Demarcation Proposals </H5>   [Staresina] Are there several projects of the cantonal  demarcation between the part held by the Serbs and the  federation?    [Granic] We have heard several negotiating standpoints  recently: The Serb side is offering 45 percent of the territory  to the Croat-Bosniak side, and Mr. Izetbegovic is demanding 60  percent. That is what was said publicly. The European Union  will probably try to organize the demarcation based on the  Geneva talks -- that is, 51 percent of the territory for the  federation. The United States will probably be prepared to  apply more pressure on the Serb side to relinquish more  territory in favor of the federation.    [Staresina] Mr. Churkin said that the Croats and the Muslims  have the right to a confederation with Croatia, so the Serbs  should have the same right to form a similar confederation with  Serbia.    [Granic] In that case, Croatia would not want to form any  kind of link with the Serb confederation. There would be two  confederations. It is more likely that the Serbs will be  invited to join the federation under the same terms. That could  be a possible solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, it is  not very likely the Serbs will agree to that. They have already  indicated that. Another option is to form a very loose union  between "the Serb Republic" and the federation, but it has not  been thoroughly defined yet.    [Staresina] A loose connection between "the Serb Republic"  and the federation would preserve the borders of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The next step would certainly be a  confederate agreement between the federation and Croatia. In  that case -- the Serbs have made this clear -- they would  immediately go toward Serbia. Of course, that would result in  forming two confederations and those two confederations could  normalize all relations, even economic ones, but that is all  they could do. All formal relations -- Yugoslavia and the union  -- are out of the question for Croatia.    [Staresina] Do you also mean individual political  resistance?    [Granic] There will probably be a number of people who will  not be satisfied, but they cannot stop the process.  <H5>  U.S. and Russian Influence </H5>   [Staresina] Is there a possibility of a strong Serb-Russian  alliance in the Balkans?    [Granic] The Russians have a great influence on Serbia and  the Serb side. If the influence is coordinated with the  European Union and the United States to reach a compromise and  an honorable solution, then it could be positive. On the other  hand, any kind of support for a national minority and ethnic  community is legal, but only within the framework of  international standards and international law. We hope that  Russia's assistance will result in the following: reaching an  agreement on solving the problem of UNPA zones in compliance  with UN Security Council resolutions and European standards for  minorities and ethnic communities and to find a peaceful  solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina that will not destabilize  neighboring countries.    [Staresina] The United States has confirmed its readiness to  support a peaceful reintegration of UNPA zones, but Vice  President Gore has pointed out that quality is much more  important than haste.    [Granic] The vice president's words convey the basic U.S.  view: firm support to territorial integrity of Croatia and to  reintegration, political, and diplomatic support along with the  pressure on Serbia, of course. But they also say that it is now  more important that Croatia's politics be coordinated with the  United States and that this is a process that cannot be stopped.  Naturally, we would like to see it happen as soon as possible,  while the United States thinks it is not so important to hurry  the process. Consequently, it is important to find a compromise.  <H5>  No "State Within a State" </H5>   [Staresina] Has there been any talk about Serb autonomy in  Croatia? Did they ask for more than has been provided by the  constitutional law?    [Granic] Let me go back to President Tudjman's peace  initiative. It provides the basis for negotiations, which means  that it takes the territorial integrity and sovereignty of  Croatia for granted and that it is possible to broach the  discussion about the problem of local self-government. For the  time being, we will stick to the constitutional law. However,  it is possible to negotiate with the Serbs within President  Tudjman's initiative, which was offered to the Serbs. It is no  secret that there are different views on the problems of local  self-government and local autonomy, and Russian views are most  liberal, as Mr. Churkin has said a few times himself.    [Staresina] Do you mean a "state within a state"?    [Granic] That is absolutely out of the question. There will  be no federalization or confederalization of Croatia.    [Staresina] Have the Russians proposed any particular  model of autonomy?    [Granic] No. We mostly talked about rights rather than a  specific model. We were very categorical about not wanting  federalization or confederalization, but we said we would  discuss a firm form of local self-government.    [Staresina] Have they ever openly demanded federalization or  confederalization?    [Granic] No, but they did ask how far we would go.    [Staresina] Mr. Galbraith, the U.S. ambassador to Croatia,  has recently threatened to introduce sanctions to Croatia. Is  that still possible?  <H5>  Open Doors to European Institutions </H5>   [Granic] After signing the agreement, they only talked about  ways of helping Croatia and coordinating views. They never once  mentioned sanctions.    [Staresina] Has there been any specific discussion of  Croatia joining "Partnership for Peace"?    [Granic] We discussed everything in great detail. The  United States, or rather President Clinton, Vice President Gore,  and Secretary of State Christopher, strongly supported the  process of admitting Croatia to "Partnership for Peace." With  the European Union, we discussed membership to the Council of  Europe and associate membership to the European Union. Indeed,  they will probably wait for the federation and Croatia to do it  together. There are no more hindrances for Croatia, but they  want to do it that way. Croatia will demand that it be accepted  right away, so we will have to work out a compromise.    We talked about membership in all European institutions, the  World Bank, the deblocking of loans, and the stand-by deals.  The United States promised to help with regard to all that.    [Staresina] Belgrade radio says that there is a position in  Serbia concerning your visit to Belgrade. Do you really intend  to go there soon?    [Granic] I am prepared to go to Belgrade, if we agree on  that. However, before doing so, in accordance with the previous  agreement, the Serb -- Belgrade side -- must answer some  questions regarding negotiations about telecommunications, the  highway....    [Staresina] About accepting the Croatian area code for the  UNPA's, too?    [Granic] Yes, about that, too.    [Staresina] You also met with Turkish Minister Cetin. Will  Croatia support the Turkish proposal on including Turkish  soldiers in UN operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Granic] We suggested that they come to the occupied  Croatian territory. Croatia has very friendly relations with  Turkey.    [Staresina] Have there been any objections concerning human  rights violations in Croatia?    [Granic] We did not talk about that at all. It was  confirmed that Croatia is able to keep up with all the world  standards in the field of human rights as well.  <H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5> <H5>  The Continuity of Croatian Policies </H5>   [Staresina] What does this continuity consist of? You often  point out that the Washington agreement presents the continuity  of Croatian politics.    [Granic] It has a firm continuity because Croatia and  President Tudjman personally -- much before the referendum for  independent Bosnia-Herzegovina -- strongly advocated a  decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the Croats would have  equal rights. This continuity is present in every proposal, as  well as in the referendum and in recommendation that the Croats  say "yes" and accept Couteillero's peace plan and the Vance-Owen  plan. We had the most radical views regarding the European  Union and the Owen-Stoltenberg plan of dividing  Bosnia-Herzegovina into three republics. The present plan also  contains decentralized Bosnia- Herzegovina. Furthermore, at a  time when the Serbs are holding 72 percent of the territory and  the international community has not done anything to stop that,  the Croats in Croatia and Herzeg-Bosna will have to take a firm  stand in defending their strategic interests. But it is also  true that, as early as in August last year, when Mr. Silajdzic  and Mr. Cetin visited Zagreb, we discussed possible models of  relations that are similar to the present ones -- for example,  those between the Croats and the Bosniaks, Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Later on, we continued those talks and  President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic signed a public  declaration and a non-public agreement on 14 September. We  talked about the federation and the confederation during our  stay in Sarajevo and then in Geneva.   <H5>    [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Professionals </H5>   [Staresina] How much have the changes in the political and  military leadership of the Bosnian Croats contributed to the  success of the negotiations?    [Granic] The arrival of General Ante Roso was primarily  welcomed by the Croats, with the deep respect of the Bosniaks.  The international community also supports professionals who  carry out their tasks properly. On the other hand, there were  certainly some reproaches of the international public regarding  certain people in the previous leadership. However, that  leadership organized the resistance to the Serb aggression, an  efficient resistance, which should never be forgotten. The  appointment of Mr. Zubak was certainly refreshing for the  international community, and the Bosniak side has also accepted  him. I believe that this has contributed to the success, but I  repeat that the guidelines of the policy strategy have been the  same from the very beginning.</p>

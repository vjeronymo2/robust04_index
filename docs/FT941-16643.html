			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The Long View: Fuelling the markets The really hard part about forecasting what might happen to the global bond and stock markets in 1994 is that to succeed we must first understand what drove securities prices up so much in 1993. We can note that the two biggest equity markets, in the US and Japan, which account for two-thirds of global capitalisation, were sluggish last year in local currency terms, with returns of only about 10 per cent. Generally speaking, the smaller the market and the less the liquidity, the more likely a strong rise. Bond markets were firm everywhere and there was a remarkable convergence of bond yields in Europe, where returns are now packed closer together than they ever were in the days of the European exchange rate mechanism. Too much money and too little discrimination were the themes. Recession and intensifying competition in traded goods can legitimately explain the falling interest rates and inflation rates that have encouraged bond investors. It is not so clear, however, why stock markets have joined in the party so enthusiastically. Analysts are performing mental gymnastics in order to justify historically very expensive ratings. Concepts such as 'cyclically adjusted margins' and 'mid-cycle earnings' are being touted around; but shareholders in, for instance, Metallgesellschaft, this week's leading disaster story, may perceive this as simply an exercise in 'let's pretend'. What we know is that the direct cause of the global bull market has been the flow of capital out of the US into overseas bond and stock markets. In the first nine months of 1993, net purchases reached Dollars 98bn, including peak rates of Dollars 21bn in bonds and Dollars 25bn in equities in the third quarter. About Dollars 7bn of the Dollars 25bn went into Latin America and Asia (excluding Japan). The tap has been turned on by the hugely steep yield curve (from 3 to 6.4 per cent) in the US which has generated massive movements out of deposits. These funds have gone into, firstly, the domestic securities markets and, more recently, into overseas markets which are viewed as offering better value. Conventional wisdom is that the turning point will come when the Federal Reserve decides in its wisdom that the US economy is threatening sufficient inflation to justify raising short-term interest rates. But is this the full story? It is a puzzle that the Fed has been able to hold interest rates so low without leading to a serious contraction in the US money supply, given the weakness of bank lending. As it is, broad money has continued to grow, albeit very slowly. Part of the story has been that the Fed has itself been buying bonds. But does the Fed have hidden partners in supplying the liquidity that is driving the global capital market? After all, it seems unlikely that the US, with its notoriously low personal savings ratio of about 4 per cent, can really be supplying investment capital unaided on a scale which is fuelling a world-wide bull market. The story of the late 1980s, after all, was that America was no longer able to finance itself. The simple arithmetic is that if Dollars 140bn annualised is flooding out into stocks and bonds, and the US current account deficit is Dollars 100bn plus, there must be a flow of the order of Dollars 250bn the other way, which is replenishing dollar liquidity. The primary source of this must be Japan, which is running a current account surplus of the order of Dollars 140bn but which, on the published figures, is no longer substantially offsetting this through securities purchases (as it did when portfolio investment outflows reached Dollars 120bn in 1989, mostly into dollar bonds). The Japanese may be repaying dollar debts or purchasing money market instruments. The strength of the yen through much of 1993 discouraged Japanese investors from investing overseas. Now, however, the yen seems softer again, and we must also consider whether the weakness of the Japanese economy, a fundamental part of the global picture, will persist for another year. The officially-claimed third quarter annualised 2 per cent growth in GDP seemed freakish at best to many economists and unbelievable at worst; but was it? By propping up the busted financial system, the Japanese government is preventing the economic meltdown which threatened to turn the 1990s world-wide into a re-run of the 1930s, with Japan this time around replacing the US as the focal point of debt deflation. Largely spared financial dislocation, Japanese industry has maintained its overall output, but often at suicidal margins, so that corporate profits have collapsed by 70 per cent from the peak. This squeeze on profits means the price bubble in yen bonds (10-year yields are falling through 3 per cent) has not been transferable to equities. If the Japanese economy stays depressed, the surplus liquidity will continue to pour out - with the difference, perhaps, that portfolio assets might increasingly be bought directly by Japanese institutions rather than indirectly by American investors. Although the low level of US short rates would then become unsustainable, the impact on markets outside the US might not be serious if the alternative source of buying appeared. Japanese investors would not, though, have the same tastes - south-east Asia maybe, Latin America probably not. Recovery in Japan's economy, however, through rising internal demand, might quickly erode the balance-of-payments surplus and cut the flows of liquidity. The global bull market would end. Analysts could go back to working out next year's probable earnings per share and deciding whether an investment made sense on that basis, rather than on make-believe projections. This is by no means the whole story. The continental European recession will also generate falling interest rates and excess liquidity this year. But it is surely the benign relationship between the American and Japanese financial markets that holds the key. We should beware a shift in the delicate balance.</p>

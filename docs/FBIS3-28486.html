A dissident residing in Myongdong, Seoul, told his fellows  that it was, indeed, a great fortune of the nation to have a  marshal in the person of Mr. Kim Chong-il, a famous general with  perfect literary and military accomplishments, loyalty and  filial piety, a famous general who descended from the heaven.    A professor of Seoul National University surnamed Yi said:    "When you read works authored by Secretary Kim Chong-il you  can see that he is, indeed, an extraordinary thinker and  theoretician. When you see the socialism of the North you can  understand that he is, indeed, a great statesman.

"It is an honour and  pride not only of our people but of the world people to have  acclaimed Supreme Commander Kim Chong-il as a marshal," he  stressed.    An intellectual in Pusan surnamed Kim told his colleagues:    "Mr. Kim Chong-il is a peerless great man with clairvoyant  wisdom, rare resourcefulness and noble virtues.    "Let all of us live and fight with fortitude to be embraced  in his bosom."</p>

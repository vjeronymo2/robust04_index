			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YUGOSLAV TEEN UPSETS 4TH-SEED KENT CARLSSON IN GERMAN OPEN  </P> <P> Teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia upset defending champion Kent Carlsson  of Sweden 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 in the second round of the German Open men's tennis  tournament today.  </P> <P> Carlsson, seeded fourth, was the highest-ranked casualty on the red clay of  Hamburg's Rothenbaum club in today's action.  </P> <P> Ivanisevic, 16, was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and a semifinalist  at the Nice tournament last month.  </P> <P> Another seed was ousted when Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden defeated Andrei Chesnokov  of the Soviet Union 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Chesnokov was seeded 13th after winning the Nice event and last week's Bavarian  Open in Munich.  </P> <P> Chesnokov said he was tired after a 10-hour train ride from Munich to Hamburg.  He then opened another round in the growing dispute between some Soviet tennis  players and their federation.  </P> <P> Under Soviet Tennis Federation regulations, Soviet professionals are requested  to turn over most of their hard-currency earnings to the federation.  </P> <P> The first to rebel was Natalia Zvereva, the seventh-ranked woman player in the  world, and she was later joined by Chesnokov. The two want to keep a larger  portion of their prize money.  </P> <P> Chesnokov told reporters that a first round of talks between Zvereva and Soviet  tennis officials failed to produce an agreement, but he said he hopes for a  compromise.  </P></p>

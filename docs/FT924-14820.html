			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Clinton flares up under fire on TV and keeps his big lead in the polls GOVERNOR Bill Clinton showed his temper yesterday. He was undoubtedly provoked, his anger did not last long, and the display of it won him a round of applause. However, with all political attention in the US zeroing in on the first of the televised debates by the main candidates, due next Sunday, any variant in the confident mood of the front-runner in the presidential election assumes disproportionate significance. President George Bush's supporters are beginning to hope that a seam of weakness might have been discovered in their Democratic opponent at last. Mr Clinton had been pressed by Mr Phil Donahue, the TV talk show host, on the latest Republican attempts to discredit his character. These are mostly disseminated, without substantiation, by the ultra-conservative Washington Times newspaper, and are that Mr Clinton attended several meetings, in the US and Europe, of the anti-Vietnam war movement more than 20 years ago, that he once considered renouncing his US citizenship and, most darkly, the implication that he might have been suborned during a visit to the communist Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia early in 1970. Mr Donahue said it was clear Mr Clinton had been 'more active' in the anti-war movement than he had previously let on, and that 'we are right to ask these questions because we wonder what kind of leadership you would bring to the Oval Office.' 'You are wrong to ignore my entire public life,' Mr Clinton brusquely responded, 'which you and a lot of other people have done, and to make up your own characterisation on this so that you can once again divert people from a discussion of the things that will affect their lives.' The studio audience, sympathetic to Mr Clinton, erupted in cheering. The incident is probably trivial in itself and did the Democratic candidate no immediate harm. But it may serve as a sort of trailer for the debates themselves and the extent to which Mr Bush will seek to change the subject from the state of the national economy to his opponent's character. Mr Clinton has shown testiness before in the long campaign - as has Mr Bush. Mr Ross Perot, the third presidential candidate at the debating table, is permanently testy under questioning. The independent from Texas prefers, as he did in his first paid TV commercial on Tuesday night, to lecture audiences on what is wrong with the country. More polls yesterday confirmed the impression that only a radical change of mind by the electorate, which could be induced by some egregious mistake in the debates, can stop Mr Clinton winning the presidency. A national opinion survey for The Los Angeles Times has given him 48 per cent, Mr Bush 34 per cent and Mr Perot nine per cent, while the latest NBC poll's split was 46:32:10. Among new state polls, Mr Clinton was 20 percentage points ahead in California, 18 in Pennsylvania, 16 in New Jersey, and 13 in North Carolina. The Bush campaign seems to have written off California but the other three states are very important if the president is to be re-elected.</p>

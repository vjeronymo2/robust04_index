			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 2 MORE FIRED AT U. OF PITTSBURGH  </P> <P> New University of Pittsburgh football Coach Paul Hackett continued to make  sweeping changes in his staff, firing recruiting coordinator Bud Ratliff and  defensive line Coach Frank D'Alonzo.  </P> <P> Last week, Hackett fired assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Bob  Valesente, a close friend of former Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried.  </P> <P> Hackett told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Tuesday night that he is not ruling  out further changes.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't discount anything at this point," he said. "When you've had 20  years to put together (ideas about) a staff, you have to set sail in the  direction you want. It's really not a reflection on Bud and Frank at all. . . .  I just want to get my team in place."  </P> <P> Pitt spokesman Larry Eldridge said no successors have been chosen. He declined  to elaborate on why the two were fired except to say, "It's part of the  transition of the new head coach and the regime."  </P></p>

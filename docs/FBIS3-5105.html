			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Foreign policy speech by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to </F> the 129th ordinary Diet session -- live]    [Text] Upon opening the 129th ordinary Diet session, I  would like to deliver Japan's basic foreign policy.    First, I would like to explain my view on the international  situation. Now that the Cold War structure has collapsed, the  world is exploring the new framework of peace and prosperity.  The exploration, however, has a long way to go and the way is  rocky. The present international community, which is in  transition, is faced with uncertainty and unpredictability and  has many tasks to accomplish. In the world economy, North  America's economy is robustly recovering, but many other nations  are suffering from recession and serious unemployment. As for  regional conflicts, the first step has been taken toward  sustained peace and reconstruction in Cambodia. Signs of  settling the conflicts in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, despite  concerted efforts by the international community, are still not  visible. North Korea's suspected nuclear development and the  possible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction following  the breakup of the Soviet Union are threatening world safety.  Such global issues as poverty in developing countries, the  global environment, population, and refugees are getting  serious. In this way, the international community is continuing  to sail without a destination in these dramatically changing  waves. I believe, however, that the international community  will find a beacon to guide its voyage and the beacon is  beginning to show the path we will have to follow. The beacon is  a target that the international community will have to pursue  through cooperation and collaboration and the target is to  create a world where people can live in peace and prosperity.  The international community has increasingly expected help from  Japan, which has built today's prosperity in peace while  pursuing the target. Japan should meet the international  community's expectations and take responsibility for creating  the framework of world peace and stability. To those ends,  Japan's foreign policy is being asked to play a more aggressive  role. [applause]    Next, in line with the principles I just stated, I would  like  to outline major policy tasks with which Japan will have to  grapple. Worldwide economic stagnation and unemployment have  resulted in an increase of protectionist moves and intensifying  economic frictions. To build a fluent and prosperous world by  preventing them, it is necessary for many other nations to  promote policy coordination. It goes without saying that Japan,  which accounts for about one-sixth of the world's GNP, has a  responsibility to play a great role. The Uruguay Round was  successfully concluded last December after undergoing difficult  negotiations and I believe the successful conclusion of the  Uruguay Round is a victory for the principle of free trade, the  principle of open trade mutilateralism, and international  cooperation. Faced with various difficulties, Japan was engaged  in negotiations until the very end, and Japan insisted, to the  maximum extent, on its rice position. Japan's decision to  accept an agricultural negotiations accord, including the  establishment of a special exception of comprehensive  tariffication, contributed to the successful conclusion of the  Uruguay Round. Japan decided to accept the agricultural  negotiations accord with great pains from the standpoint of  making its due international contributions. A cabinet  ministers' meeting to sign the final documents is set to be held  in Morocco and we are making full preparations for signing  relevant agreement documents. I would like to ask the Diet to  speedily ratify those agreement documents. Japan will work to  maintain and strengthen the multilateral trade structure that is  the basis for the prosperity of not only Japan, but for the rest  of the world by scrupulously implementing the results of the  Uruguay Round in the future.    Japan's economy remains unpredictable and Japan still runs a  huge surplus. With this economic situation in mind, last month,  the government announced a package of 15.25-trillion-yen  economic stimulus measures which call for income tax cuts, an  expansion of domestic demand, and the promotion of deregulation  to revitalize the economy. I believe that promoting reform of  the economic structure by steadily implementing the package and  securing sustained economic growth led by domestic demand will  contribute to the establishment of harmonized economic relations  with foreign nations and the stable development of the world  economy. As for deregulation in particular, it will serve to  improve the quality of life for the people. I think that the  government, therefore, needs to make further efforts for the  deregulation. As foreign minister, I have felt keenly growing  worldwide hopes for peace since I took office. In response to  those hopes, Japan will have to do what it can do to fulfill  them.    North Korea's suspected nuclear development is a threat to  the peace and safety in Northeast Asia and is a major challenge  to the nuclear nonproliferation efforts. It has been decided  that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will conduct  inspections at declared nuclear sites in North Korea. Progress  in U.S.-North Korea talks will hold the key to clearing up North  Korea's suspected nuclear development for the time being. Japan  for its part will persistently urge North Korea to completely  withdraw its decision to pull out of the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), completely implement an  agreement reached with the IAEA, and come to agree with South  Korea to announce a joint declaration on denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula while keeping close contact with such concerned  nations as the United States, South Korea, and China.    From its position of seeking reinforcement of the  multinational framework and the mechanism for preventing  proliferation of mass destruction weapons, Japan supports  continuation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. We  are also playing a positive role in negotiations to enact a  multinational ban on nuclear testing, which aims to further  disarmament efforts by nuclear power nations.    Japan will also maintain its cooperative policy for those  working to abolish nuclear weapons stored in the former Soviet  Union. The Japanese Government signed the Chemical Weapons  Convention [CWC] last year, and is seeking the Diet's early  approval of the treaty. Japan will also strongly support  Ukraine's efforts to dismantle its nuclear weapons.    To cope with the recent proliferation of both weapons of  mass  destruction and conventional weapons, it is necessary to review  and reinforce multinational trade control systems. Japan will  positively engage itself in international discussions on this  issue.    Disregarding such efforts by Japan, some foreign media have  recently raised, without any grounds, questions about Japan's  nonnuclear policy. As the only victim of nuclear weapons, Japan  adheres to its triple nonnuclear principles [not to manufacture,  possess, or import nuclear weapons], and its use of nuclear  energy is limited strictly to peaceful purposes. So, I would  like to emphasize again that Japan will never develop nuclear  weapons.    It appears regional conflicts in former Yugoslavia and  Somalia have been caused by ethnic and religious antagonism and  it will be very difficult to settle them; however, the  international community is patiently dealing with the problem.  In particular, Bosnia-Herzegovina is still suffering bloodshed.  Japan will continue its efforts to obtain peace, in conjunction  with the United Nations and the individual nations concerned.  In February, the government hammered out a package of policies  for former Yugoslavia consisting of more humanitarian aid,  economic assistance to the Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia, and the reorganization of diplomatic establishments  in the region.    In addition to diplomatic efforts and economic cooperation,  Japan has promoted personnel assistance to settle regional  conflicts through participation in UN peacekeeping operations in  such nations as Angola, Cambodia, and Mozambique. Participation  in UN operations in Cambodia have cost our nation great  sacrifices of life; however, we consider that Japan's presence  made a big contribution to Cambodian peace. We would like to  express our sincere condolences to those who were killed in  helping to achieve that.    As part of Japan's assistance to peace efforts in Central  America, Japan is planning to dispatch election monitors to El  Salvador later this month. With ethnic and religious conflicts  increasing in number, it is important for us to offer counsel  for those in trouble. We would like to promote contributions  which are suitable for Japan to make.    Under our definition, a humane world is one in which people  can enjoy prosperity with the guarantee of freedom, democracy,  and human rights. At present, reform efforts are being promoted  to help the large number of people who favor democracy and a  market economy. This is a great trend of history, and Japan will  continue to offer positive support for the trend. While some  developing nations are making incredible economic progress, most  still suffer from poverty and hunger. We strongly believe the  economic and social development of these nations is a necessary  prerequisite for peace and prosperity in the world. To achieve  this, we should consider not only economic assistance, but also  comprehensive approaches which include the promotion of trade  and investments.    Japan's assistance to developing nations is the most  important pillar of its contribution to the international  community, in the sense that this is the way we can best make  good use of our experience in economic development. Last June,  the government hammered out the fifth midterm objective of  official development assistance [ODA] programs under which Japan  will offer from $70 billion to $75 billion over the five-year  period starting in the fiscal year 1994. In view of Japan's  desire to play a role in this field despite the current severe  economic situation, the government has proposed ODA spending of  1.634 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 budget plan. Based on the  government's ODA guidelines, we would like to obtain the  understanding of the Japanese public, and the appreciation of  aid-receiving nations for our peace and development-minded aid  policy. Throughout last fall and this winter, Japan has taken  the chair of international conferences on development in  Cambodia, Mongolia, Indochina, and Africa. Japan is, thus,  playing a leading role in multinational frameworks to support  development, democratization, and economic reform in developing  nations. We would like to maintain Japan's initiative in this  field.    Global issues such as environment, population, AIDS,  drugs, and refugee problems are serious concerns to the entire  world. It is urgent for developed and developing nations to  cooperate in solving these problems. In this regard, Japan  intends to actively assist developing countries in solving  environmental issues. Also, when the prime minister visited the  United States in February, he announced Japan's plan to spend $3  billion, or about 300 billion yen, over the next seven years to  assist developing nations in resolving population and AIDS  problems. The International Conference on Population and  Development is scheduled to hold its session in Cairo in  September. Population problems are closely related to  environment and development. Japan has been actively promoting  efforts to contribute to the success of the meeting. For  example, it sponsored a meeting of a wise men's conference on  population and development in January. Now that relations of  mutual dependence between countries have become deeper than  ever, it is imperative to strengthen international cooperation  to resolve the issues I have just mentioned.    Because the current international situation is severe, it is  essential for Japan, the United States, and Europe to take the  lead in promoting policy cooperation to tackle global issues.  Japan intends to continue efforts to strengthen policy  cooperation among Japan, the United States, and Europe on such  occasions as summit meetings. Even under a new international  situation, Japan's basic diplomatic policy of maintaining close,  cooperative relations with the United States based on the  security pact will never change. Japan-U.S. relations have  become more and more important for ensuring peace and stability  in the Asia-Pacific region. Prime Minister Hosokawa visited the  United States in February to hold the third summit meeting with  President Clinton. Although the two leaders failed to reach an  accord on the bilateral framework trade talks, they agreed that  the disagreement should not affect bilateral cooperation in  solving political, security, and global problems. Concerning the  framework trade talks, I myself visited Washington one day  earlier than scheduled to coordinate opinions on objective  criteria and numerical targets. I met with Vice President Gore,  State Secretary Christopher, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, and  Trade Representative Kantor and eagerly negotiated with them to  reach an agreement. However, unfortunately, the two sides  failed to find a common ground on trade issues and decided to  have a cooling-off period for the time being. Meanwhile, the  two leaders discussed international affairs relating to North  Korea, China, and Russia in their summit meeting, and their  discussions reflected the breadth and depth of the current  relations between Japan and the United States. Also, the two  nations formulated an action program to promote cooperation in  resolving global issues such as environment, population, and  AIDS problems. During my recent visit to Washington, I also met  with newly appointed Defense Secretary Perry and shared the same  view with him about the importance of the Japan-U.S. security  system. Japan-U.S. relations are currently in a tough phase  over economic problems. While working for maintaining and  deepening overall Japan-U.S. relations, I am determined to make  all-out efforts to seek a breakthrough in the deadlocked  economic and trade relations as early as possible to solve  pending issues, thus further strengthening the Japan-U.S.  partnership.    The European Union has entered a new phase of unification  after the EU Treaty went into effect. It is more necessary than  before for Japan to build relations with the EU on a firmer  foundation. Based on the Japan-EC joint declaration issued in  1991, the government will further deepen relations with the EU  as partners who share the same sense of values. Also, beyond  economic and trade ties, the government will promote dialogue  and cooperation with the EU to solve various problems common to  the international community.    Amid drastic changes in the international community,  there are many favorable factors in the Asia-Pacific region.  The region has achieved remarkable economic development under  relatively steady growth rates. Under these favorable  circumstances, various forms of intraregional cooperation are  being promoted in the region. In the political and security  fields, an atmosphere for holding dialogue throughout the region  has been rapidly growing in recent years in line with our  conventional proposal. An ASEAN regional forum is scheduled to  be held this year for the first time. In addition to member  nations of the expanded ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting, China,  Russia, and other nations will attend the forum where foreign  ministers will exchange opinions on political and security  issues concerning the entire region. I believe that it is  important to create a sense of security among various nations  within the region by promoting transparency concerning every  nation's policies through such a forum. The Asian Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference exists as a framework for  economic cooperation within the region. An informal APEC  economic conference, which was held in November last year, made  great achievements. For example, a future prospect for  intraregional cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region as well  as a direction for future cooperation were indicated at the  conference. Holding the belief that intraregional cooperation  in the political, security, and economic fields will contribute  to the peace and prosperity of the international community as a  whole, Japan hopes to take the initiative in promoting such  cooperation in the future to turn the region into the very  fountain of peace.    China is expected to become a more important entity not only  in the Asia-Pacific region but also in the international  community. Relations between Japan and China have been  developing in a favorable manner. During my visit to China in  January, I held meetings with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li  Peng, and Qian Qichen, vice premier and concurrently foreign  minister. I had frank and meaningful exchanges with them on  bilateral issues as well as on international issues about which  the two countries are concerned. Moreover, during Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji's recent visit to Japan, I took the opportunity to  have a meaningful exchange with him while keeping my visit to  China in mind. Japan intends to build future-oriented relations  between Japan and China as well as a bilateral relationship  which will result in world contributions, and intends to further  deepen cooperation between the two countries. Japan also  intends to continue to cooperate with China in promoting its  policy of reform and opening up.    The Korean peninsula constitutes an unstable factor in the  Asia-Pacific region in view of North Korea's suspected nuclear  development. Although negotiations between Japan and North  Korea on normalizing diplomatic relations have been suspended,  the government intends to tackle the issue while cautiously  watching North Korea's future moves.    Under the circumstances, our relations with neighboring  South Korea, which shares the common values of freedom and  democracy, are increasing in importance. President Kim Yong-sam  is expected to visit Japan as a state guest in late March. Our  government will exert efforts to develop a broad,  future-oriented bilateral relationship of cooperation.    In Indochina, a new government elected through free  elections  came into existence in Cambodia. Vietnam and Laos are also  implementing liberal economic reforms. Japan proposed the  organization of an Indochina development forum to deal with the  development of the whole region, and this forum is scheduled to  be held in the second half of this year. We intend to promote  international cooperation in the future through this forum and  other venues.    Democratization and economic liberalization have also gone a  long way in Southwest Asia. Japan will assist such efforts, and  work on nuclear nonproliferation in this region.    The United Nations is expected to play a very important role  in world peace and stability. Further strengthening the  functions of the United Nations is an urgent task. This year, a  working level meeting will be convened on the reorganization of  the Security Council, and wide-ranging discussions are expected  both in Japan and in foreign countries.    Japan, as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, has  exerted earnest efforts in the past two years to work for the  building of a more peaceful world. Today, there is increasing  demand by international public opinion for Japan to play an even  more active role in the United Nations. In response to such  expectations, I believe Japan should assume whatever  responsibilities it can. In promoting international cooperation,  Japan's relations with other major nations and regions are  important. President Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October was a  very important visit that laid a new foundation for promoting  relations between Japan and Russia. Parliamentary elections were  held last December in Russia following the President's visit to  Japan and President Yeltsin reshuffled his cabinet last January.  The Russian situation still remains uncertain and Japan needs to  closely watch Russia's future domestic situation. In  Japan-Russia relations, Japan sent election monitors to Russia  when the parliamentary elections were held. Both Japan and  Russia held working-level talks in February this year and they  also resumed the meeting of the working group on the conclusion  of a peace treaty. In this way, the two countries have been  engaged in brisk political dialogue. At the private level,  Japan, the United States, and Russia held the first round of the  tripartite talks in Tokyo. Thus, Japan and Russia have held a  broad-ranging dialogue. Under these developments, I will visit  Russia this month. At a series of meetings with Russian leaders,  I intend to reiterate that settling the territorial dispute and  then completely normalizing diplomatic Japan-Russia relations  will be important not only to the two nations but also to  securing the peace and security of the Asian-Pacific region. I  also intend to point out that it is important for Russia to  continue its reform policies for democratization, market  economy, and cooperative diplomacy which is conducted on the  basis of law and justice. I plan to confirm with Russian leaders  that as long as Russia continues those reform policies, Japan  will aggressively support those reform policies.    Last September, Israel and the PLO agreed to issue a  declaration on self-rule in Israeli-occupied lands and I myself  attended a historic signing ceremony in Washington. Israel and  the PLO have since worked to put the declaration into effect.  Thanks to the efforts of the United States, Israel and Syria  have held serious peace negotiations.    Japan is committed to providing $200 million in aid over  the next two years to stabilize the life of Palestinians. Of the  amount, it has already announced plans to provide $50 million.  Aid from the international community is indispensable for  promoting peace and stability in the Middle East. Japan will  strengthen political dialogue with nations in the region and  participate in multilateral talks on Middle East peace. It will  continue to assist Palestinians.    In the Latin American nations, the market economy has been  making steady progress and structural poverty remains a task to  be tackled. Japan will continue to assist those nations' reform  efforts.    In Africa, presidential and parliamentary elections were  held  last year in some nations and thus political reform is making a  headway. Many nations are gripped by unstable domestic  situations and they have difficulty overcoming their economic  problems. Japan will continue to assist political and economic  reform efforts by those nations. It also will assist those  nations through bilateral and multilateral frameworks.    To keep the world in peace and stability, it is necessary to  build a relationship of trust and deepen mutual understanding  among nations. In a bid to deepen other nations' understanding  of Japan, Japan will strengthen publicity activities and work to  promote international exchanges. Last year, Japan hosted an  international conference on Angkor Wat. It will aggressively  cooperate with developing nations to preserve mankind's tangible  or intangible cultural relics and promote their cultures.    Science and technology are the key to opening the future. It  is important for Japan to steadily promote international  cooperation to share them with other nations.    With the international situation still remaining unstable,  the number of Japanese who carry out activities abroad is  growing, and this is increasing the number of Japanese who are  involved in accidents and crimes abroad. The government will  strengthen measures to ensure safety for those Japanese. The  government also will redouble its effort to speedily airlift  back home Japanese who live in countries where civil wars or  coups occur.    As I stated, in order for Japan to accomplish diplomatic  tasks, it should respond properly to the dramatically changing  international situation and conduct flexibly its diplomacy with  a long-term perspective. I intend to work to strengthen  preparedness for the conduct of Japan's diplomacy. But it is  only possible to conduct our diplomacy with the people's  support. I intend to continue to work to win people's  understanding of Japan's diplomacy. I am in charge of conducting  Japan's diplomacy at this time which is very important to the  future of the international community and I feel awed at my  duties. I would like to solicit further cooperation from my  fellow dietmen and the people. [applause].</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Martial law in Chechnya The leader of the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya, Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev, signed a decree yesterday imposing martial law, blaming the 'continuous provocations on the part of Russian government forces' and activities of the Chechen opposition, the Interfax news agency reported. It is unclear to what extent Mr Dudayev, facing rebellion from several armed groups inside his tiny territory, will be able to enforce the ruling, due to take effect at midnight. The official Russian Itar-Tass news agency also reported that Russia's southern regional army would hold manoeuvres next week near the borders of Chechnya, which declared independence from Moscow in 1991. The last time Russia announced big troop movements near Chechnya, in November 1992, Mr Dudayev threatened to declare war on Moscow unless its forces pulled back.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified commentator: "Riots Caused by </F> Behind-the-Scenes Instigation"]    [Text] On 19 April, approximately 70 members of the Kanto  Council under the League of the Great Japanese Patriots, Japan's  right-wing organization, committed provocative riots in front of  the Korea Hall of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan [Chongnyon] Headquarters, the Korea Bank's main Tokyo  office, and the Tonghae Corporation building, after getting off  of 30 propaganda cars.    During the riots, they did not hesitate to make foolish,  absurd, and violent remarks, saying that Chongnyon should leave  Japan, that North Korea should suspend the nuclear threat to  Japan, and that the Tonghae corporation should be dissolved.  This is unprecedented and is very grave and provocative  commotion against the republic and the Chongnyon, arousing our  indignation.    Needless to say, these riots are the results of the Japanese  authorities' policy of regarding Korea as an enemy, as well as  their plots against Chongnyon, not the mere violence committed  by right-wing Japanese gangsters.    As is well known, the Japanese authorities' enthusiasm about  fabricated propaganda, as well as a commotion of pressure  against the republic under the pretext of our nonexistent  nuclear issue in collusion with the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppets is unprecedented. They have not hesitated  in making such hostile remarks, saying that they will deal  sternly with our republic, which is being threatened by nuclear  weapons, under the pretext of the so-called nuclear threat,  while talking in favor of the mastermind who creates the nuclear  threat. Also, they have desperately attempted to achieve their  goal of imposing sanctions on us.    The contents of the violent remarks made by the Japanese  right-wing gangsters during their riots are the same as those of  the Japanese authorities' hostile and vicious propaganda.  Therefore, there is no doubt that the riots themselves are  being committed by the Japanese authorities' behind-the-scenes  instigation.    The issue of Japan's nuclear armaments, not the suspicion of  our nonexistent nuclear weapon development, is the issue that  has emerged as an important one in the international community  today, and has reached a dangerous point. Much valid data has  proven the above-mentioned facts. At the same time, impartial  public opinion in the world has also sounded an alarm  [kyongjong].    We do not pose a nuclear threat to Japan, but rather Japan's  nuclear armaments have created a grave nuclear threat on the  Korean peninsula. Nevertheless, the Japanese right-wing  reactionaries have kicked up nuclear commotions against the  republic as a thief turns on the victim with a club.  Furthermore, they have committed acts of violence against  Chongnyon and its other subsidiary organizations. Therefore,  their such acts are aimed at distorting public opinion, as well  as at justifying themselves for openly carrying out Japan's  nuclear armaments, and thus propagate the nuclear threat on our  republic.    As shown by the violent remarks made by the Japanese  right-wing gangsters during the riots, this also aims at finding  an excuse to suppress our patriotic compatriot organizations  that are related to our republic, including Chongnyon.    Such criminal acts can never be forgiven, nor affect us. The  patriotic activities by Chongnyon, a prestigious overseas  organization of our republic, and its subsidiary organizations,  should be guaranteed. If something happens to Chongnyon and its  subsidiary organizations, this can be regarded as an act of  doing harm to the republic [konghwagugedaehan chimhae haengwi].  The Japanese authorities should correctly assess the situation  and should forge plans to prevent riots from occurring again in  the future. Also, they should abandon their plots of nuclear  armament and immediately stop engineering the anti-republic and  anti-Chongnyon plots.</p>

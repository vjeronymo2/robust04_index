			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS 2-A BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> CAVAZOS LEADS SANTA MARIA ST. JOSEPH TO VICTORY  </P> <P> Santa Maria St. Joseph won its first Southern Section 2-A boys' basketball  championship Saturday at the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach's free-throw line.  </P> <P> Roger Cavazos scored 20 of his game-high 32 points in the second half as the  Knights rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat Laguna Beach, 70-68, at the  Sports Arena.  </P> <P> The Knights opened the fourth quarter with a 15-2 run and Spencer MacCuish made  the front end of a one-and-one free throw opportunity with five seconds left to  seal the victory.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach missed five free throws late in the game, including the front end  of three one-and-ones in the final 1 minute 29 seconds.  </P> <P> "I thought in the last two minutes the game was ours," Laguna Beach Coach Ed  Bowen said. "All we had to do was win it at the free-throw line."  </P> <P> Instead, St. Joseph, which lost four of its first six games, improved to 20-7.  Laguna Beach is now 22-6.  </P> <P> St. Joseph led, 69-67, after a free throw by Cavazo with 1:28 left.  </P> <P> Borella, who scored 18 of his team-high 25 points in the first half, missed the  front end of a one-and-one opportunity with 1:17 left to begin the Artists'  struggle from the line.  </P> <P> The Artists had made nine of 12 free throws before the fourth quarter, but made  only seven of 14 in the final quarter.  </P></p>

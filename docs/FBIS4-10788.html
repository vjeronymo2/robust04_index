			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] Last night, on the "This Very Day" program, Basic  Industry Minister Marcos Portal informed the people on the  critical situation in the supply of electric energy in the  entire country and particularly in Havana City. I believe  Portal's detailed explanation satisfies all questions, doubts,  criticisms, and complaints on the generating capacity,  particularly in Havana City, where in past weeks, unscheduled  outages have seriously intensified.    Portal explained the reasons for the increase in outages and  the reasons why it is impossible to adhere to a plan of  scheduled outages. Tomorrow, Sunday, at 1630 local time Tele  Rebelde will rebroadcast that interview. Those who were unable  to hear Minister Portal's explanations should listen to the  words of the Minister of the Basic Industry. I believe he spoke  clearly without rhetoric, without euphoria, and with specific  facts. I am not going to summarize his words. It is better that  you listen to them without an intermediary.    I am going to refer to one aspect of Marco Portal's  discourse  regarding the exploration and extraction of Cuban oil. He  announced that the drilling of oil wells will begin in diverse  areas assigned to well-known foreign enterprises through  exploration agreements with the state at their own risk. In  other words, the enterprises cover all the expenses until oil is  found, if there is any, and after complex research.    It is obvious that these costs are very high. They range  from  millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. The drilling of oil  wells is done only when the research yields positive results.  Similarly expensive, and when the existence of oil is confirmed,  the phase of preparing conditions for oil exploitation begins  next. The fact is that the drilling process in several places is  about to begin.    Another fact that to me is of singular importance is that  there are several contracts with diverse foreign firms, many of  which are European, which are experienced in this type of work.  As Portal said, this guarantees that when the United States  decides to lift the blockade, U.S. enterprises, many of which  are currently very interested in establishing this type of  contract, can do so and will join those that already exist.  Therefore we will follow a strategy -- and I am paraphrasing --  that would seem to mark the tone for our foreign economic  relations: Never again depend on just one market for supplies to  our country or to sell our products. History has demonstrated  how risky that can be, especially if that market of buyers or  sellers is the U.S. market.    Cuba will not reject U.S. investments that adjust to our  laws, but we want to maintain a broad range and never again have  only one source. Furthermore, when U.S. enterprises are  authorized by their government to trade with Cuba, in other  words when the blockade is someday lifted, Cuba will respect the  contracts with foreign enterprises that made the investments  when the United States prohibited such transactions. It is a  principle of ethics and of knowing how to honor the  responsibilities acquired.</p>

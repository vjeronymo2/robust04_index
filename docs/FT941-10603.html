			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Hurd rebukes Chinese envoy China's ambassador to Britain was rebuked yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, for suggesting to British companies they would suffer discrimination in China because of the dispute between London and Beijing over Hong Kong. Mr Hurd said trade relations between China and the European Union would be affected if companies failed to win business for political reasons. Mr Ma Yuzhen, the ambassador, has met executives of many leading British companies doing business in China and has warned them that Chinese people would be offended by Britain's stance on Hong Kong and would therefore be more willing to deal with companies from other countries. The possibility that UK companies could miss out on the boom in Chinese investment and trade because of the Hong Kong dispute has aroused serious concern among British industrialists. British exports to China have been rising sharply, though from a low base. Businessmen, though reluctant to be seen publicly disagreeing with the government over its policy on Hong Kong, have recently been meeting ministers and officials. However, Mr Hurd told a parliamentary select committee: 'I am not saying the ambassador is exceeding his functions, but I think that British businessmen would be well advised not to take his analysis at face value.' Mr Hurd said: 'That kind of discrimination for political reasons is something which the European Union would have to take very seriously.' He said European foreign ministers had briefly discussed the subject in Brussels on Monday and that it was relevant to China's trade relations with the EU and to China's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, plans to raise the issue of trade discrimination against EU member states when he visits Beijing in the next few weeks. Officials said Mr Ma had been called to the Foreign Office and was told by a senior official that his remarks to British companies were unhelpful. Businessmen said the ambassador had been careful not to suggest that the Chinese government itself would discriminate against British companies. But he and other Chinese government officials have repeatedly said Sino-British trade was bound to suffer from poor relations resulting from the Hong Kong impasse. However, businessmen have not yet been able to identify any contract which has failed to be awarded to a British company because of the dispute.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD NO PATSY FOR IRISH;  </P> <P> ROCKET COMES TO THE RESCUE IN 27-17 WIN  </P> <P> Top-ranked Notre Dame, playing away from home for the sixth time in its last  seven games, found itself in even stranger territory Saturday.  </P> <P> Midway through the third quarter, the Irish and Stanford were tied, 14-14.  </P> <P> But then Raghib (Rocket) Ismail went 66 yards on a kickoff return to set up the  touchdown that sent Notre Dame on its way to its 17th consecutive victory,  27-17.  </P> <P> "When they tied it up and the stadium got involved, our team responded," Irish  Coach Lou Holtz said.  </P> <P> Especially Ismail, whose big return on the ensuing kickoff gave the Cardinal  possession at the 16-yard line and quieted the crowd of 86,019.  </P> <P> Stanford attempted to kick high and short of Ismail, but he raced up to handle  it.  </P> <P> "When I take it up the middle, I look for a crease," Ismail said. "Someone made  a good block and I was able to cut to the right side."  </P> <P> Stanford drove from the 16 to the one, from where Anthony Johnson went in to  break the tie.  </P> <P> Stanford Coach Dennis Green said: "Any time you have a momentum swing, it  changes the game."  </P> <P> Stanford, which outgained the Irish, 316 to 296, had pulled into the 14-14 tie  when Steve Smith, who threw a school-record 68 passes and completed 39 of them  for 282 yards, passed two yards to Ed McCaffrey for a touchdown and Tom Vardell  ran for a two-point conversion.  </P> <P> Smith said: "We came in wanting to win."  </P> <P> Said Holtz: "These guys did what they had to do, and each week it gets tougher.  But this was not one of our better performances, to be honest."  </P> <P> Ismail had gone two weeks without handling a kickoff, since returning two for  touchdowns against Michigan.  </P> <P> He got to handle one in the second quarter Saturday, but he was stopped by an  unusual penalty against return mate Rodney Culver.  </P> <P> Culver had signaled for a fair catch, so even though Ismail caught the ball,  the officials blew a whistle when he started upfield.  </P> <P> The Irish (5-0) had only one first down in the first quarter and were behind,  6-0, against a team that allowed 40 points to San Jose State a week earlier.  </P> <P> Notre Dame's embarrassed offense finally came to life in the second quarter,  putting together a 64-yard drive that featured a 29-yard pass from Tony Rice to  Ismail, and a 38-yard run by Rice. Johnson capped the drive with a seven-yard  run. Notre Dame scored later in the second period on a two-yard run by Culver.  </P> <P> It was 21-14 after Johnson's third-quarter score, and Notre Dame increased its  lead to 24-14 on Craig Hentrich's 20-yard field goal early in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Stanford (1-4) was behind only 24-17 when a pass by Smith was intercepted by  safety Pat Terrell, whose return set up an 18-yard field goal.  </P></p>

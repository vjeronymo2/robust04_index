			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MSHA will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested party, including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA will be included in the rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments, the record will remain open until August 5, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To date MSHA has received comments from the mining industry on two major issues. The first major issue reflects differing interpretations of section 202(b) of the Mine Act. Some commenters assume the respirable coal mine dust standard applies to a long-term average concentration of coal dust. Consequently, they concluded that noncompliance determinations must take shift-to-shift variability into account. Other commenters maintain that the respirable coal dust standard applies to the coal dust concentration averaged over a single shift. They concluded, therefore, that MSHA is authorized to issue a citation whenever the dust standard is exceeded on a single shift, with no allowance made for any shift-to-shift variability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second major issue involves use of the Values Table, specified in the February 18, 1994, notice, for making noncompliance determinations with respect to the respirable coal mine dust standard. Several commenters objected to the principle of citing for noncompliance only when noncompliance is indicated at a high confidence level, claiming that doing so would effectively result in an increase in the permissible exposure. Other commenters contended that the proposed values at which a citation would be issued do not sufficiently account for all sources of measurement uncertainty. MSHA specifically solicits additional comments and data from the mining community on the appropriate values at which a citation should be issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA also requests comments and data from the mining community concerning the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The impact on mine environmental respirable dust levels of using the proposed values for noncompliance determinations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Whether the proposed citation criteria, involving use of both single samples and the average of multiple samples, will reduce the incidence of overexposures on individual shifts; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Other approaches that could be utilized to detect when the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine environment is not being maintained below the applicable standard during each shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> J.

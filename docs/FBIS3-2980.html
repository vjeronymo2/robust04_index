Security Council, for playing a  more and more important role in the world organization and  international affairs.    The U.N. chief was speaking to Chinese Deputy Foreign  Minister Liu Huaqiu when they met here today.    Butrus-Ghali said the U.N. and China have cooperated very  well on U.N. affairs and important international issues.    Under the current situation, the secretary-general said, it  is quite necessary to encourage developing countries to take  part in U.N. affairs since they form the bulk of the world body  consisting of more than 180 member nations.    To encourage all developing countries to play a positive  role  in international problems is also significant to maintaining  world peace and promoting economic development, said  Butrus-Ghali.    He said the U.N. needs close cooperation from developing  countries since they can express their wishes and requests  through the world body.    Only by doing so, can the U.N. truly stand for their  interests, he said.    Referring to the World Women's Congress to be held in  Beijing  in September 1995, Butrus-Ghali said that it will be a prominent  meeting in the world.    He praised China for making outstanding preparations for the  congress.    The U.N. chief also said that the congress will exert  far-reaching influence on the promotion of women's status in the  world.    Butrus-Ghali said he will visit China this year together  with  U.N. officials in charge of the World Women's Congress to help  prepare for the congress, he said.    The Chinese deputy foreign minister agreed to Butrus-Ghali's  views on the role of developing countries, saying that they will  play a more and more important role in international affairs.    Liu emphasized that the Chinese Government attaches great  importance to the World Women's Congress.    He said the Chinese Government will make proper preparations  as the U.N. requires.    Liu arrived in Argentina on Sunday [13 March] on a visit at  the invitation of the Argentine Foreign Ministry.</p>

He stressed in his speech: It is necessary to deepen  enterprise reform, to make overall improvement, to regard reform  as motivation and efficiency as a key link, to transform the  enterprise managerial mechanism, to positively create conditions  for enterprise reform, to conscientiously implement the system  of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks, to promote  package reform with breakthroughs in key aspects, to concentrate  energy on enlivening industrial enterprises, to change the  industrial production situation as soon as possible, and to  rejuvenate Tianjin's industry.    In her speech, Li Huifen, vice mayor of the municipal  government, set forth specific requirements for the reform work  of the industrial front in 1994.    At the conference, the leading cadres at or above the bureau  level on the industrial front submitted letters of  responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks to the  municipal government. The [words indistinct] bureau and the  [words indistinct] company also introduced their experiences at  the conference.    Gao Dezhan set forth three opinions on reform and  development  of industrial enterprises.    First, it is necessary to deepen reform, make overall  improvement, and concentrate energy on enlivening industrial  enterprises.    Gao Dezhan said: The industrial front should adopt major  measures to change the appearance of the enterprises with  difficulties; and do a good job in using foreign capital, making  structural readjustment, strengthening management, developing  products, conducting technological transformation, and building  leading bodies. By deepening reform, the industrial front  should change their mechanisms; increase economic results; and  ensure to hand over more to finance, to have enterprises obtain  more profits, and to have the staff and workers gain more  benefits. We should focus the deepening of enterprise reform on  changing the managerial mechanisms. It is necessary to continue  to implement well the enterprise law and regulations; delimit  small accounting units with enterprises; deepen the reform of  the employment, labor personnel, and distribution systems;  simplify organizations; and reform and improve the  organizational management system.    Second, we should conscientiously implement the system of  responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks and ceaselessly  improve the leadership level.    Gao Dezhan said: On the basis of grasping the work of his  own department, each and every leading cadre at or above the  bureau level on the industrial front should assume  responsibility for the management of two good enterprises and  two money-losing enterprises. The implementation of the system  of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned tasks should be  examined and assessed every quarter and comprehensively be  assessed at the end of the year. The assessment of the  implementation of the system should be linked up with the  assessment of the cadres' political achievements.    Third, we should comprehensively carry out the "222"  project,  change the appearance of the industrial enterprises as soon as  possible, and rejuvenate Tianjin's industry.    Gao Dezhan said: The second plenary session of the sixth  municipal party committee stressed the necessity to carry out  the "222" project. That is, the municipality should grasp two  large enterprises of key importance, including the vehicle  industrial corporation and the [words indistinct] company, and  grasp 20 municipal-level key enterprises; and all levels and  districts and counties should also grasp 200 key enterprises.</p>

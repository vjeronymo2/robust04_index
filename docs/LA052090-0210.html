			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE HAND, ONE SHOT -- DISABLED GOLFER HAS CARDED 8 ACES SO FAR  </P> <P> Richard Saldana was on the seventh tee at the Catalina Island Golf Club, ready  to try for another hole in one; he had shot his eighth a few weeks ago. They  marvel at that in the barbershop down the hill. And they say a steel helmet  saved Saldana's life when his right hand was blown off in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Saldana stood in a right-hander's position and held a 3-iron with his left  hand. He used the stump at the end of his right arm to steady the club. As he  swung, he pulled the stump away just before hitting the ball, and followed  through with his left arm.  </P> <P> The ball soared toward the flag 203 yards away.  </P> <P> "Not another one!" said Gil Voci, who was in the foursome.  </P> <P> But this time, the ball stopped 12 feet short of the hole.  </P> <P> "You realize," playing partner Buddy O'Jibway said, "how amazing this guy is?"  </P> <P> A short man with a stomach he admits beer has greatly expanded, Saldana wore a  baseball cap, shorts and a T-shirt with the crossed-swords insignia of his old  Army unit, the 11th Armored Cavalry.  </P> <P> "A little more and that thing goes in," he said in a matter-of-fact tone as he  got back in his cart. Sipping from a can of beer, he drove down a fairway  bordered by fat palms and overlooked by mountain ridges that touched clouds.  </P> <P> This is the easygoing Saldana's island, where, like the 10 brothers and sisters  before him, he was born and reared. This is the course where he caddied as a  boy and learned the game from his brothers.  </P> <P> Now, at 44, his amazing golf feats have made him the talk of the town in  Avalon.  </P> <P> "It makes me feel like I can do something," he said.  </P> <P> After a moment's thought, he added, "This is about all I do."  </P> <P> There was a time when Saldana thought he would never do much of anything again.  </P> <P> He was a 24-year-old specialist fourth class when, during a midday Viet Cong  ambush in 1969, a rocket grenade hit the ammunition can in the personnel  carrier he was driving. In the blast's aftermath, his right hand dangled from  his wrist; it was later removed at a field hospital. The muscles in his left  arm were severely damaged.  </P> <P> Reminders remain. His left arm is scarred, and he says the stump throbs and his  ears ring constantly.  </P> <P> After the ambush, Saldana spent 3 1/2 months in a Veterans Administration  hospital in San Francisco, then returned to Avalon. "I was all bummed out," he  said. "I didn't want to go out."  </P> <P> A 1963 graduate of Avalon High School, Saldana had been a volunteer fireman  before he was drafted, and had hoped to join the Avalon Fire Department after  the service. "I didn't think about it after that, didn't think it would work  out," he said.  </P> <P> He had also worked at the Catalina Bird Farm. But the farm, a home to the  exotic birds he fed, had closed by the time Saldana returned from the war --  not that he would have had much interest in working there again.  </P> <P> "For three years I didn't want to do anything," he said.  </P> <P> But he had the support of many friends and his close-knit family. "All I did  was hang around them," he said.  </P> <P> Martan Saldana, a gardener, moved to Santa Catalina Island from Mexico in 1919.  He met Margarita Mesa a year later, and they soon were married. All of their  children have stayed on the island.  </P> <P> Angie Romo, 65, and Isabel Lopez, 64, are homemakers; Margarita Ponce, 58, is  an employee of the Catalina By the Sea souvenir shop; Ruth Sampson, 55, works  at Leo's Drug Store; Frank Saldana, 53, works at Abe's Liquor Store; Herman,  51, helps take care of the island's interior; Joe, 50, is the golf club  champion; Sylvester, 48, owns a landscaping business, and Lolo, 60, runs the  barber shop. The oldest brother, Martan, 61, died last year.  </P> <P> "Everybody cares about everybody here," Richard Saldana said. "When I was in  the hospital, I got a shoe box full of letters from the island. All of my  family and friends visited me."  </P> <P> Sampson recalled the time her brother came home from San Francisco: "We felt  worse than he did. I took care of the wounds; he had a lot of shrapnel in his  arms."  </P> <P> The sweet smell of a green liquid called Osage Rub, which Lolo applies to the  heads of his customers, filled his barber shop.  </P> <P> "It's pretty much all over town," he said about his brother's latest ace.  "Bobby Piacentini was in here the other day and said, 'Geez, I've played golf  for 35 years and haven't got one.' "  </P> <P> The walls of the sports-oriented shop are busy with pennants, photos and  paintings, as well as rosters of youth baseball teams.  </P> <P> The Saldanas have stayed on Catalina, Lolo said, because of its slow pace and  their sense of belonging. "We're all involved in community activities," said  the barber, whose son, Gilbert, is a former Avalon mayor.  </P> <P> Ed Jordan, whose hair was being cut, is the handicap chairman at the golf  course. He assessed Richard Saldana's golfing ability: "An excellent putter.  Not really long on his drives, but steady. Nerves of steel."  </P> <P> "He's proud," Lolo chimed in. "What he does, he likes to do right."  </P> <P> During his long rehabilitation, Richard Saldana had figured that he was through  with golf.  </P> <P> "I tried to play," he said. "I had a hook screwed into my stump and it was  attached to a golf club, but it didn't work right. So I forgot about it. Gave  my clubs away."  </P> <P> Roger Cadman, 40, who cleans fish at the Avalon Fish Market, remembered the day  during that period when he tricked Saldana into showing him how to hit a golf  ball. "He hit the ball well with his left hand," Cadman said. "I think he was  surprised. It got his confidence up."  </P> <P> Saldana, who has an 11 handicap, shot his first hole in one eight years ago.  Two years later, he got two in a week. All of his aces have occurred at the  Catalina course: two on the 114-yard second hole; two on the 124-yard sixth;  three on the 159-yard ninth, and one -- the most recent -- on the 203-yard  seventh.  </P> <P> He finds it hard to pinpoint a reason for such stunning success. "Yeah, it does  surprise me," he said.  </P> <P> Last Friday afternoon, Saldana was teamed with O'Jibway, Gil Voci and Jim  Wright in a best-ball match.  </P> <P> "The town hustler, we call him," Wright said.  </P> <P> "No, I just play," Saldana said, laughing softly. Nonetheless, Saldana, who  gets a monthly veteran's disability pension, gladly pocketed his winnings after  the match.  </P> <P> He lives with fiancee Kathy Emerson in the same three-story house, with its  post-card view of rooftops and the harbor, that he has lived in since he was in  the sixth grade.  </P> <P> He appreciates it when the Catalina Islander weekly newspaper runs a little  item on him now and then, but he does not believe he is considered a celebrity.  "I doubt it," he said. "I'm just around here."  </P> <P> He usually takes a walk in the morning, then goes to the nine-hole course to  play two, sometimes three rounds of golf a day. But the best time comes late in  the afternoon at Silky's, a bar near the course named for Silky Reyes, who was  the pro there when Saldana was a youngster.  </P> <P> Last Friday, there was a baseball game on TV, the mountaintops could be seen  through the small square windows up near the ceiling, and the beer and sports  talk flowed in liberal amounts.  </P> <P> Saldana kept his hat on and sat at a table with a group that included Voci,  O'Jibway, Jordan and Joe Machado.  </P> <P> "He's such a nice person," said O'Jibway, a short-haired, red-faced man who  rents boats. "He does anything to help you out."  </P> <P> Teri Gill, a regular at Silky's, came over to the table. She looked at Saldana  and said to a visitor, "He's one of the most special guys in the world."  </P></p>

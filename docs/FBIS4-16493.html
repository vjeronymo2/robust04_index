			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Irina Shchegoleva and Mikhail </F> Shevtsov]    [Text] Sochi April 15 TASS -- The government of Abkhazia  has called on the Georgian armed groups, operating in the upper  part of the Kodor Gorge, to stop hostilities and lay down arms.  The Abkhazian side, with the participation of U.N. inspectors,  guarantees the lives and safety of the Georgian groups withdrawn  from the area. Otherwise, the government of Abkhazia will take  measures to neutralise "the armed gangs", says a statement  released by the Abkhazian government today.    ITAR-TASS has learned from officials of the press service of  the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet that this statement was released  due to the recently increased activity of Georgian armed gangs  in the Kodor Gorge and in some villages of the Gali district.  Abkhazian sources report on mortar attacks on the village of  Lata and raids of armed gangs on the village of Ganakhleba, Gali  district, which claimed the lives of four men. Several people  were abducted and their whereabouts are unknown. The Abkhazian  side believes that such provocations are a violation of the  Moscow agreements on political measures to settle the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, that they seriously destabilise the  situation and are intended to torpedo the peaceful negotiations  and preparations for the repatriation of refugees.    The Abkhazian government has announced its readiness to  ensure the safe evacuation of these groups from the territory of  the republic if they laid down their arms.    In light of the latest developments, the parliament of the  Abkhazian Republic requested the Russian president and the State  Duma on Friday not to ratify the Russo-Georgian treaty until the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is fully settled.</p>

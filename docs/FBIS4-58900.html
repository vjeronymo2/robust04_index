			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Deputy Foreign Minister Muhammad </F> Hashemi's Visit to Ankara"]    [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Muhammad Hashemi held  separate talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Ozdem Sanberk,  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and Minister of Internal Affair  Nahit Mentese on bilateral relations in Ankara on 2 May. The  sides stressed the need to have bilateral relations further  improved and described the level of existing relations between  Turkey and Iran as good and constructive. During his three-day  visit, Hashemi is expected to hold talks with the Turkish  officials on important regional issues, the situation in the  Islamic world, and the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina.    The relations between Turkey and Iran, which have many  common  historical and cultural ties, have been placed on a sound basis.  The factor that requires the two countries to further strengthen  their relations is the question of safeguarding their common  interests in ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization]. Political  and economic experts are convinced that the relations between  Iran and Turkey should be viewed from three angles. Compared  with the past, the economic relations between the two countries  within ECO's framework are rather important for them. That is  why they are maintained at a favorable level.    The trade and economic cooperation between the two countries  in ECO's committees has significantly contributed toward the  improvement of their relations. As far as the political aspect  of their relations is concerned, Iran and Turkey need to take  measures to defend their common border more effectively than in  the past. In view of the fact that that matter has to be  carefully followed, the two countries concluded important  agreements on terrorism and border security during the past one  and a half years. They have done so in accordance with the  principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs.  Regarding regional issues, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have held  several summits on the question of northern Iraq. The outcome of  the summits and the bilateral relations between Iran and Turkey  show the importance they attach to the establishment of peace  and security in the region.    Iran and Turkey are two important ECO and ICO [Islamic  Conference Organization] members. As such, they have many  opportunities and resources to further improve their bilateral  relations. In view of that, Hashemi's visit to Turkey should be  assessed as the outcome of the effort the Turkish and Iranian  officials have made to further improve and strengthen the  relations between the two countries as much as possible.</p>

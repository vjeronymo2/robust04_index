			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (10): Changing markets - Leasing IF GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, had not crash-landed on its flotation take-off last month, two of Ireland's largest PLCs would now be leasing companies, each catering to very different markets. GPA whose business is almost entirely overseas, is in the big-ticket business of jet aircraft leasing, and was started in 1975 by a former Aer Lingus employee, Mr Tony Ryan, who is now one of the wealthiest men in Ireland The other Irish company whose name has become synonymous with leasing, is Woodchester Investments, seventh in size on the Irish Stock Exchange, and in control of around 30 per cent of the Irish car and two-thirds of the office equipment leasing market. It also has a small, but growing, share of the UK market and is launching into continental Europe. Its chairman, Mr Craig McKinney is a Scotsman who moved to Ireland in 1970 as a 20-year-old straight out of college, setting up Woodchester seven years later. Both companies have experienced exponential growth in the past five years. The reasons for their success have been a combination of identifying market niches at the right moment, access to the finance to fund their growth, and initially at least, the benefit of Irish tax laws which favoured their development. The market for both is changing. GPA now faces its biggest challenge since its formation - finding Dollars 12bn in finance for new aircraft purchases up to the end of the decade, after institutional investors turned away from the company at the minimum Dollars 10 per share asking price for the flotation. Perceptions of the airline industry in general are not good, but GPA has, nonetheless, managed to put in a good performance over the past two years despite the worldwide recession. Its 10 per cent corporate tax rate remains in place until the year 2005, and company strategists are convinced that sustained growth in airline seats demand will recover soon, underpinning their expansion strategy. Woodchester has a corporate partner in the shape of Credit Lyonnais (CL), one of the world's leading banks, which holds 45 per cent of the company and has the resources to bankroll plans to place Woodchester alongside the Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland as one of Ireland's leading financial institutions. WOODCHESTER came to the market 10 years ago valued at IPounds 2m. A tax regime then allowed generous 100 per cent capital write-off allowances in the first year, which created opportunities for leasing companies to offer highly competitive rates and to defer tax charges indefinitely into the future. The company grew rapidly through acquisition and now has assets worth in excess of IPounds 1.2bn. This tax regime began to change in the late 1980s, however, and, according to Mr Dan O'Connor, the group's finance director, 'capital allowance rates are now more penal than most places in Europe, so the changes have eliminated those competitors who were dependent solely on tax-driven business.' Woodchester had, meanwhile, built up a sales-aid leasing business, arranging lease finance directly through dealer outlets in both the UK and Ireland. This, Mr O'Connor says, is now far more important than the tax-driven capital allowance reasons for leasing. Unlike GPA which is investing in large assets with lifetimes well beyond the end of lease terms, Woodchester is able to conduct a highly conservative accounting policy, which leaves no residual value, and hence risk, in its leased equipment, which is typically leased over three years. Woodchester has, thus, had few problems in tapping either debt or equity markets in its expansion, and, according to NCB stockbrokers in Dublin, its current debt-equity ration of 3 to 1, 'gives it a very strong capital base with plenty of room for gearing up for further expansion.' Mr O'Connor says the strategic alliance with CL has been vital to Woodchester's growth, and that the two companies plan to combine their expertise - Woodchester applying its success in the Irish leasing business to develop into Europe through CL, and CL applying its banking expertise and financial muscle to help Woodchester expand into the retail banking market in Ireland, where its large market share in leasing limits further profits growth in that sector. Mr O'Connor says: 'The banks here are moving into the finance house business, while we are moving in the opposite direction into retail banking.' GPA and Woodchester have thus evolved along very different pathways from different ends of the leasing spectrum, but both have emerged as two of the largest companies in the Irish corporate scene.</p>

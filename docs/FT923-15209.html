			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / VW calls on UK component makers to bid for contracts VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest carmaker, has called on UK motor component manufacturers to bid for more business with the rapidly-expanding German group. The move is another warning to the German components industry that the country's high labour, social and other costs are making it increasingly uncompetitive. VW is planning investments of DM51bn over the next five years to lift total vehicle production from 3.1m to 4.8m units a year. The Wolfsburg-headquartered group includes Audi, Seat of Spain and Skoda of Czecho-slovakia. Mr Werner Svetlik, VW management board director with responsibility for purchasing, told a meeting of some 100 component companies, industry groups and government officials in Birmingham that VW is seeking a 'closer partnership' with the UK industry. He said there was the opportunity for large increases in the volume of components bought by VW in the UK. These purchases totalled Pounds 86m last year, up 15 per cent on 1990. VW, like Opel, BMW and other German carmakers, is under mounting pressures from rivals, particularly Japanese, which are benefiting from lower component and assembly costs through global sourcing policies. Mr Robert Stempel, chairman of Opel's parent, General Motors, has already warned that GM is to introduce a global sourcing policy which could mean lost business for suppliers in the US or Germany. Mr Svetlik told the potential UK suppliers that the Birmingham meeting marked the beginning of a 'new philosophy' of stronger co-operation, in which suppliers would be closely involved in VW's product development and would be awarded single-source, long-term contracts. 'The good reputation of the British component industry is well deserved and I have no doubt that British companies can meet our requirements,' he said. VW has become more attracted to the UK components industry since several hundred UK component makers became involved in supplying parts to Nissan, Toyota and Honda 'transplants' in the UK. Meeting the Japanese cost and quality criteria is accepted as having sharply raised the UK industry's competitiveness. VW forecasts gain, Page 24</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Janos </F> Kobanyai in Sarajevo on 17 March: "We Cannot Take on the Role of  Mediators"]    [Text] Geza Jeszenszky's brief south Slav [Yugoslav]  visit on 16 and 17 March could also be seen as an airplane show:  He changed airplanes four times and tried out three different  types. On the way from Zagreb to Sarajevo, the foreign minister  and his entourage, together with the whole military region's  commander in chief and his many associates, were transported by  a fast passenger carrier. On the way back, we were in the hold  of a cargo plane together with many containers, and French and  British UN soldiers. Here, we had the opportunity to interview  Jeszenszky.    [Kobanyai] Having visited Sarajevo, you have now been to all  three warring south Slav capitals. Do you now have a clear  picture?    [Jeszenszky] Since the outbreak of the south Slav war, the  intention of Hungarian foreign politics has been clear and  unaltered: To keep the conflict away from our country and to  preserve our good-neighborly relations with the old and new  states. This is not easy, although, at the negotiating tables,  the hatred that flared up in such a barbaric way between the  nations cannot be perceived, in fact, all sides keep expressing  their willingness for compromise. The situation is made more  complicated by the fact that, in addition to being neighbors, a  significant Hungarian minority is also living in the countries  in question and we have to represent their interests and  alleviate their serious problems caused by the war.    An ethnically based explosion makes people suspicious of all  national minority organizations or demands. For example, after  tough negotiations with the Croatian side, we have not even been  able to achieve that they define such administrative boundaries  in the areas in Baranja that still belongs to them through which  the Hungarian minority can have a say in local politics. The  general cultural agreement that has now been signed will provide  a chance for the attitude that is also the basis of political  views to change. Rather than Jelacic [Croatian general, led  army against Hungary in 1848], the Zrinyi brothers [16th-17th  century Croatian and Hungary family] should be symbols of our  common past.    Our intentions to keep ourselves out of conflicts and to  prevent further fragmentation have gained respect for our  country. I and Austrian Foreign Minister Mock are the ones who  have closely followed the conflict from its beginning, and we  both have tried to channel the events toward peaceful solutions.  Without much success, as can be seen. However, we do not have  the means for it, either.    However logical it may seem because of the neighborhood,  Central European experiences, and the familiarity with  sensitivities, the role of mediator cannot be accepted because  we do not have any forces of pressure or counter-forces behind  us that could be used for achieving compromises. The fact that  the Bosnian and Croatian sides are requesting peacekeeping  forces from us demonstrates the respect we have in the region.  At the moment, this is contrary to our doctrine, namely we  cannot participate in the armed conflicts of neighboring  countries, not even as peacemaking forces.    However, a number of times, I have offered Budapest for the  peace negotiations that keep changing site. This site could  offer a better and more authentic atmosphere due to its  geographical and intellectual properties. After my visit to  Sarajevo, I tend to think that these negotiations should be  conducted in the Bosnian capital. This barren scenery could  awaken the negotiating sides to the fact that the suffering of  the innocent population cannot be increased anymore and it would  compel them to find a peaceful solution, whatever it takes.    Hungary is, by all means, interested in peace. The tensions  that would be relieved by peace could also fill us with  progressive impulses -- I am thinking of the situation of the  Hungarian minorities living outside our borders. It would also  have more tangible positive effects, namely economic ones.    I emphasized, at my talks in both Belgrade and Sarajevo,  that, due to our geographic situation, we would like to play a  decisive role in restoration. This includes reconstruction and  longer term work. We would like to get access to new, or  rather, old markets in the south Slav areas. It can also be  expected that the new states formed from the former Yugoslavia  will not trade with each other for a while for emotional  reasons. With the major restructuring in Eastern and Central  Europe, we are also having market problems, therefore, a mutual  interest exists here.    However, how could we talk about concrete facts before a  peaceful settlement is in place, when we have not even been able  to achieve that we could directly present the much suffered  Hungarians in Sarajevo with a few crates of aid?    [Kobanyai] What is the "message" of the south Slav conflict,  the Sarajevo syndrome, for Europe?    [Jeszenszky] At the beginning of the century, people in this  region moved around and communicated with each other freely.  They did not hate each other. This was the work of a handful  of intelligentsia whose effect increased in certain conflict  situations. The artificial states created by the peace treaties  following World War I did not prove viable. The effects of the  tragedy that was sown at that time can still be felt. The  "victorious" countries that dictated the peace have also failed  in the long run. They have also become dependent. All this is  proved by the south Slav conflict.    It is not natural to force people with different cultures  and traditions to live together. At the same time, small,  ethnically homogeneous countries are also unviable both from a  security and an economic point of view. As early as in the  middle ages, sections of cities, cities, and city alliances of  different ethnic groups coexisted. They fulfilled supplementary  functions and organically created the regulatory systems of  their coexistence.    However, freely chosen integration cannot work without an  external force coming from above. The European Community has to  fulfill the former role of Vienna. The force that partially  failed in Sarajevo -- and this is one of the reasons that  everything that is happening there is pointing beyond itself.  Up to now, it has only made rather tame steps to curb the  bloodshed. At the same time, it also has to be seen that events  would have taken an even more tragic turn without it.    Therefore, now, the European thought, the European Community  as an integrating and conflict-solving force is also being  tested.    In the European integration, the Scandinavian and the  Benelux  countries are also maintaining their historically intimate  relations and their coordinating and conflict preventing  mechanisms. I see the Central European countries -- which are  linked together with thousands of historical cords, including  the injuries suffered from each other -- catching up with the  European Union in units like these. Austria, Slovenia, and  Hungary are on this road, and the Croatians also wish to join  this model, this is one of the reasons it is important for them  to get out of the Balkans war, even through compromises. I very  much hope that the idea of the Visegrad group will not be lost,  either, the positive changes in Slovakia give hope for this.    I see Eastern Central Europe's -- including Hungary's --  future in this integration of rapprochement that preserves the  individual characteristics. I believe in this because it is not  possible to do what I am doing without some kind of image of the  future.</p>

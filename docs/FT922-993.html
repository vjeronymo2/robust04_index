			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Genoa fearful of any storm in the port - A look at prospects for regaining past maritime glories GENOA'S hopes of reclaiming its crown as one of Europe's leading maritime centres are in danger of being dampened by renewed labour unrest, a history of which has spoiled the reputation of Italy's biggest port. Once a byword for seaborne trade, Genoa's importance as a port collapsed during the 1970s owing to abysmal labour relations, inefficiency and poor management. Crucial developments like containerisation were delayed, while constant strikes prompted shippers to look elsewhere for reliable services. Traffic shifted to smaller ports, such as La Spezia to the south, where lower costs and better services compensated for geographical disadvantages. Today Genoa is trying to make up for its past, pinning its expectations on a huge new facility at Voltri, six miles to the west. When fully operational, Voltri will dwarf all the Mediterranean's other container ports. The 1m square metre site, opening next year, will be able to handle three of the world's biggest container ships simultaneously. Volume in the first year is expected to reach 100,000 containers, rising to 250,000 in 1995 and 500,000 by the end of the decade. The project represents Genoa's ambition to regain its position in the Mediterranean, and even to challenge bigger, more established ports like Rotterdam and Hamburg for business between Europe and the Far East. Voltri's case is based on geography. The new port is closer to many of Europe's main population centres than Mediterranean competitors or big north European rivals. Mr Rinaldo Magnani, the chairman of Genoa's port authority, notes that Genoa is nearer Vienna, Zurich and Munich than is Rotterdam, and is also 430km closer to Budapest, the door to the emerging markets of eastern Europe. Offloading at Voltri rather than at Rotterdam could save up to two weeks sailing time for shippers from the Far East, port officials calculate. Depending on the type of vessel, this could make trips between Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 108,108) and Dollars 500,000 cheaper. Cargo can be discharged sooner, reaching customers faster due to Genoa's proximity to many central and southern European destinations. Genoa's problem is to convince sceptics that Voltri represents a definitive break with the old port's reputation for politicisation, poor service and bad labour relations. Mr Magnani's trump card is Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector company. Within its shift away from its core automotive business, the group is leading the development of Voltri through Sinport, a subsidiary of its Cogefar-Impresit building and civil engineering arm. Sinport, which is investing L180bn (Pounds 81.33m) in the new port, has taken 95 per cent of the shares in Voltri Terminal Europa (VTE), the company awarded a 60-year concession to run the new facility. The port authority holds the remainder of the equity. Fiat's role as shareholder and manager is being cited as proof that Voltri represents a change for the better. There are some signs of success. Mr Giovanni Leodari, the senior Fiat-Impresit executive who heads Sinport, draws attention to the opening of a new roll-on roll-off ferry terminal at Voltri at the end of June - about a year ahead of schedule. The ro-ro facility, to be used by the state-owned Finmare shipping group for a fast ferry service between the Italian mainland and Sicily, proves shippers' confidence, he says. But Mr Leodari's main job is to persuade big international 'round the world' shipping groups to berth at Voltri. Currently, the large container vessels plying the Far East to Europe route sail through the Suez canal but discharge at ports like Rotterdam rather than stopping in the Mediterranean. 'In the past, shippers weren't able to find the service they wanted,' says Mr Leodari. 'So they just by-passed the Mediterranean ports and sailed on.' Today, the big ports of northern Europe account for 77 per cent of the European Community's seaborne trade, against 23 per cent for those in the Mediterranean. The aim is to reach long-term agreements with a number of leading shippers. On paper, Voltri's case is strong - the harbour is both large and deep enough for the biggest container vessels and boasts 1,400m of linear quayside. The new facility offers an area the size of 140 football pitches for storing and trans-shipping containers. A newly-opened spur means Voltri has direct access to Italy's motorway network. Rail connections have been improved so that containers heading north can reach the main lines to Milan and Turin without having to pass through Genoa. Voltri is also aiming to create a broader package of services that could involve closer links with leading ports in the Far East. Mr Leodari would clearly like to emulate Singapore, where the volume of container traffic has grown by 20-25 per cent a year in the past five years. This month's upsurge of labour trouble at Genoa's old port could hardly have come at a worse time. . Dockers at one terminal last week refused to handle a cargo in protest at the gradual privatisation of facilities, being pushed through by Mr Magnani, himself an ex-docker. On Tuesday, dockers blocked a second attempt to restart operations. Port officials are playing down the conflict and stress it could not happen at Voltri, which will not be covered by the existing national dock labour scheme. But the incident provided an uncomfortable reminder of the sort of trouble that sent Genoa's reputation sinking in the first place.</p>

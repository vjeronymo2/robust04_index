			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Maxwell writ for Credit Suisse Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, has received its second writ in connection with assets contested by pension schemes formerly controlled by Robert Maxwell. Robson Rhodes, joint liquidators to Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned fund management company which handled most of the pensioners' assets, is seeking more than Pounds 15m worth of shares from Credit Suisse. The writ alleges that the shares were deposited during 1990 and 1991 as security for a Pounds 50m facility provided to Robert Maxwell Group. In 1992, the Mirror Group Pension Scheme filed a separate writ against Credit Suiss for assets provided to Credit Suisse as security for the same Pounds 50m loan. The civil trial for that case is set to begin next week.</p>

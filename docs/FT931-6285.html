			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Devaluation hits Spanish utilities SPAIN'S second-tier electrical utilities reported lowered results yesterday, reflecting the impact of two devaluations of the peseta in the final quarter of last year. Union Fenosa raised its group profits by just 1.7 per cent to Pta19bn (Dollars 161m) despite raising its sales by 6.5 per cent to Pta308bn, Sevillana, which raised its sales by 6.6 per cent to Pta249bn, dropped its consolidated income by 3.3 per cent to Pta12.7bn, and Fecsa, which posted a 3.7 per cent fall in sales to Pta208.6bn, registered an 8.5 per cent fall in profits to Pta15.4bn. They were penalised by the peseta devaluations of 5 per cent and then of 6 per cent in September and November respectively last year. Union Fenosa holds 33 per cent of its debt in foreign currencies and the proportion at Sevillana and Fecsa is 27 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Earlier, Iberdrola, the Spanish electricity producer, posted a 7.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pta78.5bn. The company, which has 31 per cent of its debt in foreign currencies, borrowed strongly in dollars and yen and it registered a year-on-year Pta50bn increase of its global debt at the end of last December. In contrast, Endesa, Iberdrola's state-owned rival which has only 14 per cent of its debt in non-peseta denominations, posted net income of Pta106.2bn, a 13.6 per cent increase on 1991, and raised its dividend by the same percentage to Pta408 per share. Endesa's profits were in line with those of previous years and could fuel plans by INI, the state industrial holding, to place part of the 76 per cent stake it holds in the utility.</p>

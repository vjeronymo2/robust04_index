			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brierley Invs sells BSG stake BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand investment company, has raised about Pounds 37m by selling its 29.5 per cent stake in BSG International, the motor components, distribution and consumer products group. Some 60m shares were placed with institutions at 62p apiece. Brierley made a book profit on selling the stake thanks to writing down its value last year. It probably made an actual loss after holdings costs. The group said it sold the shares because it did not have much to add to BSG and the price had reached a reasonable level. It was looking for new opportunities in the UK and the realisation of Pounds 37m cash would help that process. The switch to an investment phase followed the sale of a series of stakes in UK companies, including Vickers and Wm Low, early last year. This was to raise cash after the acquisition of Mount Charlotte Investments, the UK hotel group, for Pounds 644m. Brierley said the gearing reduction phase was concluded with last May's sale of a 30 per cent holding in Mount Charlotte to the Singapore government. BSG welcomed the divestment. 'We never knew IEP's ultimate objective' and it might have been predatory, it said.</p>

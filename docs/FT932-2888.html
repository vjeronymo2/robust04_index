			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Fiat admits Pounds 21m paid in kickbacks FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, will tell shareholders it spent over L48bn (Pounds 21m) on kickbacks to win contracts when its full 1992 accounts are published at the end of this month. The admission, part of a trend among companies enmeshed in the corruption scandal, represents a belated attempt to improve transparency for shareholders and possibly sidestep legal action for falsifying company accounts. Fiat's balance sheet will show the vast majority of bribes were paid by its construction subsidiaries. Fiat Impresit, the construction holding company, and its Cogefar Impresit subsidiary show total payments since 1990 of L15.9bn and L25.5bn respectively. In both cases, the bulk of the money changed hands in 1990, when the parent company paid L12.7bn and Cogefar Impresit over L15.3bn. The payments disclosed by other parts of Fiat are much smaller. Most of the money changed hands via foreign bank accounts, paid directly to political parties or their middlemen. In many instances Fiat justifies the kickbacks on the grounds that non-payment would have excluded the group from important markets.</p>

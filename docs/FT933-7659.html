			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Coal unions urge roof-bolt probe All THREE main coal industry unions yesterday called for an 'industry summit' on roof bolting after the collapse of a roof at Bilsthorpe colliery, Nottinghamshire, killed three men. British Coal rejected the claim that roof bolts were less safe than traditional supports and the broader criticism by the National Union of Mineworkers and some Labour MPs that safety was being sacrificed to improve productivity. Mr John Longden, British Coal's Nottinghamshire Area director, said: 'It is wrong to assume that roof bolting was at fault. The roof fall was so massive that no support system could have held it.' Mr John Meads, head of the British Association of Colliery Management, one of whose members died in the accident, said roof bolting done properly was 'safer than other forms of support'. He described as 'political scaremongering' the claim that safety was being sacrificed. 'The accident trend has been down, not up, in the past few years.' Last year saw just three fatalities at British Coal, the lowest number on record. Nevertheless the inquiry into the Bilsthorpe accident will concentrate on roof bolting. Bolts, which can cut the cost of driving new roads and of maintenance by up to 50 per cent, started to replace steel arches in many British mines in 1988. The NUM and Nacods, the supervisory union, have at national level opposed bolting for many years, while the Union of Democratic Mineworkers has generally been more supportive. But yesterday Mr Mick Stephens, the UDM general secretary in Nottinghamshire, backed the call for a bolting inquiry. He said: 'We have always had some doubts and naturally those doubts have now grown'. Virtually all 30 British Coal pits use bolts somewhere with local union agreement. Throughout the industry there is at least 100 kilometres of roof-bolted ceiling. British Coal said last night that bolting at each site was carefully controlled and a code of practice agreed with the Health and Safety Executive. Critics, such as Mr David Feikart, an energy consultant and former NUM official, say: Bolting was developed in America and Australia where pits are generally less deep than in the UK and have more uniform geological features. Bolting appears not to give the same warning noises as a creaking steel arch. People are not properly trained to understand how bolting works. Mr Feikart does not deny that safety has been improving - which he attributes to heavy-duty coalface equipment - but believes continued pressure for cost-cutting is causing problems, especially with outside contractors. He and Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, yesterday said the government was about to change mining health and safety regulations. The most controversial change abolishes the deputy function - which has traditionally combined production supervision and responsibility for safety. The NUM and Nacods have argued that the changes will provide too much discretion to mine managers to improve productivity at the expense of safety. The change was, unusually, not agreed by union representatives on the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

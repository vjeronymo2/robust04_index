			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers cheered by Maastricht progress A MARATHON Commons sitting of more than 22 hours allowing for the detailed discussion of the Maastricht bill was hailed by ministers yesterday as having broken the back of the legislation's gruelling passage through parliament. In spite of the procedural victory, however, the government still faces serious difficulties on outstanding amendments to the legislation, which threaten to unite all the opposition parties and the Tory rebels over the social chapter. The all-night sitting was a significant boost to the morale of pro-European Tory backbenchers. They had been growing increasingly angry that on several occasions the government whips had not tried to force a vote on extending the sitting because they were likely to lose. One loyalist said: 'It was nice to have a government win on Maastricht.' An official commented: 'We are in clear sight of the end of the committee stage. We are on track.' Labour admitted yesterday that unless the government was foolish in trying to force a weekend sitting it could organise matters so it could rely on Liberal Democrat support in future procedural votes. That impression was reinforced yesterday when Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, urged Labour to change its approach to the consideration of the bill. He said Labour would have to change its tactics or its credibility as a pro-European party would be seriously damaged. Labour and the Tory rebels opposed the government's motion on Wednesday night to allow the extended debate to take place, but the support of the Liberal Democrats enabled the government to win by 17 votes. The rapid progress made overnight means that the Commons was able to cover three groups of amendments dealing with the European central bank and national banking arrangements, EC economic policy and national government deficits. The progress brings closer, however, the critical vote on the social chapter which is already in the schedule, quite apart from the question of whether Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, will allow a further debate on the social chapter. This could aggravate the government's difficulties if more amendments are chosen for inclusion. The Euro-sceptics insist there is more scope for delay and some said morale was still high because their arguments were getting through. But others conceded that the main debates had been taken. Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading rebel, said that the government had 'blitzed through' the main parts of the bill.</p>

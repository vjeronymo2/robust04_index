			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Ulster's hopes begin to fade: Prospects for the Downing St declaration The air of anxious expectation has all but evaporated. The most ambitious attempt in 25 years of violence to persuade the IRA to swap the gun for the ballot box looks like running into Ulster's blood-stained ground. There are still faint hopes. No one can second-guess the IRA leadership with any certainty. But Mr John Major's government is on the verge of acknowledging that there is no immediate prospect of an end to the killing. There are no regrets in Whitehall. Many of the politicians and officials who negotiated last month's Downing Street declaration did so as much in hope as expectation. Even if, as the government now expects, the hawks in the IRA insist that the military campaign continues, the UK-Irish declaration might yet prove the foundation stone for peace. The IRA has been isolated internationally. The mood in Northern Ireland has changed. Mr Major's disavowal of any selfish or strategic British interest in the province will render the republican charge of imperialist occupation that much harder to make stick. Ministers remain hopeful that they have made a small start to a process which will lead to the progressive isolation of the men of violence. So if Mr Major is being blamed for everything else these days, few at Westminster will retract the praise with which they greeted a courageous initiative. Nor will the government's expected decision to press on without Sinn Fein with the search for an internal political settlement in Ulster close the door to the possibility of peace. Mr Major will make it clear that the talks process cannot be paralysed indefinitely by Sinn Fein's public equivocation. But that does not mean that the offer of a place at the negotiating table will be retracted. The Downing Street declaration will not be withdrawn. The British government is not going to tell the IRA that because it has not stopped killing by the end of this month, it has no alternative but to go on doing so. In the words of one insider, the IRA will continue to hold the key which could unlock the door to peace. Nor should we expect the draconian security clampdown predicted by some in the province. On one level it is simply unrealistic. As long as Northern Ireland remains part of a democracy, there is not much more the government can do beyond the measures already in place. On another, it would be foolish to allow the hardliners in the IRA to claim that they had been right all along in rejecting the peace initiative. Internment - or selective detention as it is now known - remains a real option if the violence threatens to escalate out of control. But without an equivalent move in the republic, the costs could be higher than the benefits. The government has not changed its view that there is a significant faction at the highest levels of the IRA in favour of a political settlement. For all his attacks on Mr Major in recent days, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, is still seen as a dove. Viewed from London, the position of Mr Martin McGuinness appears more obscure. In spite of his repeated denials of involvement in the military campaign, Mr McGuinness is said to be the chief of staff of the IRA. The assessment in London is that in recent weeks his stance has straddled the peace and war factions. But overall, the opaque picture which emerges from the intelligence reports circulating around Whitehall is that the opposing camps of IRA doves and hawks have concluded that no deal could be struck without splitting the movement. Mr Adams and his allies are unwilling or unable to contemplate that prospect. For his part Mr Major indicated again yesterday that he will not be drawn into the dialogue sought by Mr Adams to 'clarify' the Downing Street declaration. In London's view the Sinn Fein leader is seeking negotiation, not clarification. His recent insistence that Sinn Fein could take no decisions until its convention at the end of February is seen as part of the same strategy. Mr Major must be conscious, however, that it will not be easy to relaunch talks on a political settlement without Sinn Fein. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, has invested too much political capital in the exercise to admit now that it has failed. He is likely to press for further efforts - clarification if necessary - to entice the IRA to the negotiating table. The prime minister will also have to persuade Mr John Hume, leader of Ulster's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, that he is not giving up too soon. Without the agreement of Mr Reynolds and Mr Hume there is no prospect of a deal among the province's constitutional parties.</p>

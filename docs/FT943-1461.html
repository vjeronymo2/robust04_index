			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (1): Competition for new deals is intensifying - Entrepreneurs who are trying to launch businesses face increasing difficulties in finding early finance On the face of it, the UK venture capital industry is having a rip-roaring year. Contrary to the expectations of many in the industry this time last year, more than Pounds 1.5bn has been raised from sources in the UK, the US and elsewhere for new funds during 1994, according to estimates by the British Venture Capital Association. This fund raising has been encouraged by a burst of private equity-backed flotations in the last 18 months which have transformed the returns of some otherwise poor fund performances. This promising replenishment of funds masks, however, a continuing decline in availability of true venture capital. Less than 10 per cent of the new funds raised will be directed towards early stage investments or towards companies pioneering new products in new markets. And there are few signs that this long-term decline will be reversed. 'It's a real issue, no question about it,' says Doug Brown, chairman of Advent International Europe, an investor in growing technology-based companies. 'Entrepreneurs who are trying to get businesses started will find it difficult to find early finance and will have to seek alternative sources  -individuals, family, strategic interests.' Among the small number of funds which have raised capital for early stage investments is Schroder Ventures, which raised a Dollars 100m life science fund. This fund-raising followed a rush to the London stock exchange by bio-technology companies in 1993, and will be invested internationally. Otherwise, the funds have been raised by venture capital groups which focus on late stage development capital, providing acquisition finance for private companies ahead of flotation or management buy-outs. This emphasis on late stage capital is perhaps not surprising. As the private equity investment industry matures in the UK, better comparative performance records have become available. Early stage companies take longer to provide their backers with the opportunity to realise their investment. Moreover, funds focused on this area have simply not performed as well as those which have backed more established businesses. As a result, fewer development capital companies are laying out their stall as providers of capital to early stage companies. To criticise them for ignoring start-ups is like criticising butchers for not selling fish. In fact, the UK may be returning to a more normal level of investment in early stage companies after an aberrant surge. In the early 1980s, many relative newcomers to venture capital piled into early stage companies and start-ups, tempted by US successes, such as Apple and Compaq. The UK has proved very different to the US, however. In the first place, there are not enough viable deals to justify the hiring of in-house expertise by more than a small number of venture capital funds. There are exceptions, such as the managers of the Schroder life science fund. But it is not surprising venture capitalists lacking that expertise are wary. Furthermore, the UK is a much smaller market. As if developing a new product or service was not risky enough, smaller companies in the UK need to attack international markets much earlier in their lives than their US counterparts. There are also more interesting questions than whether the UK venture capital industry is somehow failing early stage businesses. Why, for example, are more early stage companies not seeking corporate partners to help them develop products and bring them to market? And equally, why are large corporations not considering backing more start-ups in their field? Irrespective of the amount which early stage venture capitalists have raised in this latest fund raising round, they have more than a passing interest in the health of later stage development capital and the buy-out funds. A repeat of the poor investments of the late 1980s would hurt the cause of private equity investors generally. An even more crucial question is whether the UK industry has matured enough to resist going out and spending the wall of new money too quickly. One prominent venture capitalist says there will inevitably be a return of bad deals - such as Isosceles' purchase of Gateway and the Magnet management buy-out - on which many people burned fingers. 'There will be significant competition for some time forward,' he says. 'It will follow the same cycle. Funds are going to try to compete by going multinational, or by being user-friendly and cheap, doing turnarounds and focusing on specific sectors.' Prices might already be creeping up - 'there is evidence that financial buyers are outbidding trade buyers in businesses where there are trade synergies to be had,' says David Shaw, managing director of NatWest Ventures. Underpinning these optimistic valuations is a faith that the economy is strong, that interest rates are going to remain relatively low and that the stock market will continue to look healthy long enough for there to be a profitable exit. Some others including Candover, which recently raised a fund, disagree: 'There has been a tendency to try to get an auction going among financial buyers,' says Candover's chief executive, Stephen Curran. 'But the competition has not increased. The amount of money has not changed over last few years - it replaces existing funds.' If prices are rising, there will be a tendency for the amount of debt in deals to rise in order to maintain targetted real rates of return. What has also changed in the last six months is that the banks have returned in force. As Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital says: 'The banks' marketing departments have locked the credit department in the cupboard.' In recent years, most deals have been structured with as much debt as equity, but most venture capitalists say the ratio of debt to equity has now risen to two to one. As the banks, notably Midland Bank, have poured back into the market, fees and interest spreads on debt have both come down from more than two per cent to under two per cent. What is more, there are signs that the mezzanine finance suppliers, such as Intermediate Capital Group, which floated this year, are trying to provide more expansion capital and acquisition finance for private companies. Few observers believe debt to equity ratios of 10:1 will quickly return but there is concern - 'the crossover point into lunacy is when people have to deal their way out of debt, through asset sales, rather than trade their way out of debt,' says Shaw. On a more positive note, there is little doubt that a larger proportion of funds raised is now concentrated in more experienced hands as institutional backers become more selective. Undoubtedly, competition will get tougher for deals. Vendors of companies are more demanding and venture capital houses which wait to be introduced to deals, rather than rooting them out themselves, will only get the more thumbed-over transactions. There is also no doubt that the industry could do with an increase in deal flow. What venture fund managers would dearly like to see is a resumption of large corporate acquisition activity which has always led to disposals in the past. 'The real question is whether we're right in believing there's going to be an increased flow of opportunities resulting from the unwinding of acquisitions and deals that were made in the late 1980s,' says Candover's chairman, Roger Brooke. 'The ability of ourselves and everyone else in the industry to invest will depend on whether we are right.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gallie van Rensburg] </F>   [Text] President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Clarence Makwetu,  leader of the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC], met last night for  the first time on South African soil -- and publicly crossed  swords. Their little intimate gathering at a business forum in  Johannesburg went off well. President de Klerk joked about it,  and after his speech he walked up to Mr. Makwetu.    The two smiled broadly while shaking hands and posing for  BEELD's photographer. They had met earlier in Swaziland.    Mr. de Klerk was the speaker at a business forum last night  for the magazine ENTERPRISE. Mr. Makwetu had attended the  meeting as a member of the magazine's committee.    President de Klerk apparently only became aware of Mr.  Makwetu's presence in the audience when the announcer said he  only wanted to say for the sake of Mr. de Klerk that Mr. Makwetu  was also attending the occasion.    President de Klerk said this was an indication of the change  in the country that the two of them were in the same room. Not  so long ago the policy of the PAC had always been that it would  not meet President de Klerk in South Africa.    In his speech President de Klerk attacked the ANC's [African  National Congress] economic policy. He made a strong appeal for  an economy based on private entrepreneurship.    During question time Mr. Makwetu said he had promised  himself  he would not ask a question. But he had to put into the correct  perspective certain utterances by Mr. de Klerk.    He said the ANC's economic policy had not yet been  implemented. No one, he said, could therefore say the ANC policy  had already failed. Private entrepreneurship had failed through  mismanagement.    What guarantee was there that free entrepreneurship will not  again be mismanaged?    President de Klerk said in his reply he was looking forward  to interesting discussions with Mr. Makwetu. South Africa did  not implement true and full free entrepreneurship. A socialist  policy had been applied in most cases, he said.    People in the predominantly black audience reacted to his  speech with laughter, particularly when he spoke about the  National Party's economic policy or when he attacked the ANC.    Mr. de Klerk said: "Your laughing is an indication that you  are still caught up in the past.    "It is a far-reaching experience for me as a white man to  say  that we have a common fate with black people.</p>

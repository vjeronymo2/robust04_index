			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: FORD PAYING THE PRICE FOR EARLIER FAINTHEARTEDNESS  </P> <P> Donald Petersen, who is taking early retirement as chairman of Ford Motor Co.,  told a friend recently that he feels he is leaving Ford in good shape, but that  he is worried on one point: Ford -- and other U.S. car companies -- trail  Japanese car makers in engine technology and will have to work hard to close  the gap.  </P> <P> Petersen is being clear-eyed on both counts. Ford is sound today, profitable  and well financed, but it faces a challenge in engines.  </P> <P> And the story behind that challenge -- and even Petersen's retirement at 63,  say some analysts -- illustrates just how tough and daunting the global car  business is these days. Also, at a time when Lee Iacocca, the outspoken  chairman of Chrysler is touring the country decrying "a national inferiority  complex," the Ford story offers a glimpse into the reasons behind that complex:  Many Americans suspect that their best and brightest firms have lost the will  to compete.  </P> <P> Ford was the success of the 1980s, a venerable company that woke up to find  itself facing the specter of bankruptcy in 1980 -- when it lost $1.5 billion --  but which recovered its old skills and finished the decade with profit and  stature. Ford earned $3.8 billion last year on $96 billion in sales -- almost  three times its sales in 1980.  </P> <P> Ford was the auto industry's style setter with the aerodynamic Taurus and  similar cars, and it leads in more than style. The company rejiggered factories  and labor relations in the 1980s and has become the low-cost producer among  U.S. auto makers. "Some of Ford's plants are the equal of anything in Japan,"  says analyst Maryann Keller, of Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney . Ford, in  short, met the challenge of reducing manufacturing costs while bringing out  eye-catching cars.  </P> <P> Yet Petersen is right to worry. Because these days a company no sooner meets  one challenge than another pops up. Ford will have to spend more than $3  billion a year for the next five years on new engines that offer more power in  smaller or lighter cars, and could lower fuel emissions in all cars.  </P> <P> Japanese car makers are already proficient in such multivalve engines, and Ford  acknowledges that that could be important. The engines will give car makers  more flexibility in meeting the tougher fuel-efficiency and emissions standards  anticipated in the '90s, explains John Huston, Ford's chief power-train  engineer. That's why the company is pressing ahead and hopes to have a variety  of such engines, along with advanced electronic transmissions, in its cars by  the 1992 and '93 model years.  </P> <P> The question arises: If the engines are important, why didn't Ford have them  sooner? Did it lack technology? Or money?  </P> <P> The answer is money -- but due more to a lack of confidence and unwillingness  to invest than to a lack of dollars. The early 1980s brush with financial  disaster frightened the Ford family, which controls 40% of the stock. So when  the crisis passed and profits grew in the mid-1980s, Ford used some of them to  buy into other businesses. Ford wanted an anchor against the uncertainties of  the automotive industry, which included the prospect of a U.S. market crowded  with foreign cars, both imported and U.S.-made.  </P> <P> In financial services, Ford bought First Nationwide and other savings and loan  companies, and later spent $3 billion to acquire the Associates, a commercial  credit firm. "Detroit thinks of finance as secure," explains analyst Keller,  "because even in poor years for car sales, the credit companies -- Ford Credit,  GMAC, Chrysler Credit -- were always profitable."  </P> <P> Beyond finance, the car companies veered into aerospace, seeking technology as  well as supposedly steady military business. Ford bid on Hughes Aircraft, which  General Motors eventually acquired, and considered buying Lockheed. Chrysler  bought Gulfstream Aerospace.  </P> <P> But caution has a price. Because they spent on diversification instead of  engines, Ford lacks new products now, says analyst Arthur Davis of Prescott  Ball &amp; Turben, and has to watch while competitors come out with new models.  </P> <P> And the lack of new, powerful engines may also have hurt Ford's program to  renovate its Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars. The renovated models  initially were overweight and underpowered, say analysts, and that difficulty  may have led to Chairman Petersen's early retirement.  </P> <P> So, big consequences resulted from a spell of faintheartedness. However, it's  not a permanent disability. Ford has lately reawakened to the competitive  threat and is selling diversified subsidiaries -- Ford Aerospace and New  Holland farm machinery -- to raise cash for the automobile business. It will  push ahead with its own engine development and, meanwhile, procure engines for  several of its cars from Japanese companies, including its joint venture  partner Mazda. Ford remains one of the best and brightest U.S. companies, and a  probable winner in the new decade as it was in the last.  </P> <P> But Americans might ask themselves why it is that Japanese car makers are the  ones with the engines.  </P> <P> The answer, of course, is simple and obvious: They looked ahead, saw a need for  lighter, yet powerful cars and invested in developing engines that would make  such cars possible. They invested in their business, in other words. When U.S.  companies get back to doing the same, competitiveness and American  self-confidence will return.  </P></p>

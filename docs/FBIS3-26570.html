Public utility enterprises refer to enterprises dealing in  public services such as water supply, heat supply, gas supply,  postal service, telecommunications, and transportation.  According to the "Regulations," public utility enterprises may  not use their advantageous positions to obstruct fair  competition from other businesses, nor are they allowed to  infringe upon consumers legitimate rights and interests.  Specifically, public utility enterprises are prohibited from  taking the following competition-restricting measures:    -- Demanding that their clients and consumers can only  purchase and use relevant commodities provided by them but not  similar commodities provided by other dealers that meet  established technical standards;    -- Demanding that their clients and consumers can only  purchase and use relevant commodities produced or sold by  dealers designated by them but not similar commodities provided  by other dealers that meet established technical standards;    -- Compelling their clients and consumers to purchase  unnecessary commodities and accessories provided by them and  unnecessary commodities provided by dealers designated by them;    -- Using commodity quality and performance inspections as a  pretext to obstruct clients and consumers from purchasing and  using commodities provided by other dealers that meet the  established technical standards.    If a public utility enterprise commits one or more of the  aforementioned offenses, the concerned industry and commerce  administration department must order it to stop the practice  and, according to the seriousness of the case, may impose a fine  ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 yuan. If a public utility  enterprise refuses to accept the punishment decision and  continues its illegal practice, this constitutes a new offense  and the enterprise in question should be more severely punished.</p>

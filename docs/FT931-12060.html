			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris losses ground after interest rate speculation CORPORATE news dominated trading yesterday, while the stronger dollar also helped to lift a number of markets, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS, however, retreated after good morning gains on a rumour that base rates were to be raised. The banking sector fell: Paribas, which after the close reported provisional 1992 earnings below some analysts' expectations, lost FFr10.60 at FFr363.20; Societe Generale eased FFr13 to FFr586; and Suez slipped FFr1.50 to FFr255. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's high of 1,801.26, fell steadily in the afternoon to close 8.43 lower at 1,772.21, down 2.6 per cent on the week. Options expiry boosted turnover to FFr3.1bn. Alcatel, accounting for 10 per cent of the day's volume, recovered some of Thursday's losses with a rise of FFr10 to FFr620, while Lafarge Coppee, whose US unit reported disappointing 1992 earnings, eased FFr12 to FFr307. FRANKFURT saw some individual moves on company news as the DAX index closed 4.01 higher at 1,571.85, down 1 per cent on the week. Turnover stayed low at DM4.3bn, down from DM4.8bn on Thursday. Volkswagen ended DM4.80 up at DM278.30 with a single large order hanging over the market and Allianz, the insurer, rose DM18 to DM2,072 for a two-day gain of DM38 on further talk of derivatives market influence. Metallgesellschaft fell DM10 to DM329, down DM22 on the week, on a sharp drop in profits and the confirmation of a dividend cut. Among second liners, tough staff reductions at Kugelfischer, the ball bearings company, took the shares up DM3.50 to DM88.50; but PWA, the papermaker, fell DM6.50 marks to DM154 as it reported a collapse in 1992 profits. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by the firmer dollar and stronger oil prices with Royal Dutch up Fl 2.00 at Fl 147.90 as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 97.6, down 1.2 per cent on the week. Daf slipped Fl 1.15 to Fl 6.05 in spite of news that it had secured short-term financing; investors remained worried over long-term prospects. ZURICH was supported by strong domestic demand in a moderately active session. The SMI index finished 18.5 higher at 2,091.1, a fall on the week of 0.5 per cent. Roche certificates led industrials higher with a SFr60 rise to SFr4,100 after falls earlier in the week, when investors were reported to be switching out of the stock. Sandoz certificates added SFr30 to SFr3,110. Adia fell SFr11 to SFr157 after Thursday's SFr27 decline in further reaction to its worse than expected results. SMH was in demand after favourable press comment on the prospects for its Swatchmobile plans. The registered shares rose SFr60 to SFr1,555. MILAN saw renewed strength in Fiat and the Comit index rose 8.89 to 486.91, a rise of 0.9 per cent on the week. Fiat ordinary fixed L340 higher at L4,340 and firmed to L4,410 after hours in response to the better than expected results for 1992, announced after the close on Thursday. The positive tone spilled over into other industrials but the market also derived some strength from good results from Banco Lariano. The shares, widely held domestically, rose L350 to L4,950. Montedison, down almost 14 per cent since the beginning of the week, firmed L30 to L1,130, while its parent Ferruzzi rose L33 to L1,136. The pick-up was attributed to the lack of any more of the bad news that had dogged the shares during the week and recurring speculation that Montedison might be planning a disposal. BRUSSELS was lifted by a stronger steel sector. The Bel-20 index was 7.37 higher at 1,188.25, up 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr1.3bn. Cockerill added BFr6 to BFr100 while Clabecq put on BFr10 to BFr376. STOCKHOLM recovered some of the ground lost during in previous session with a rise in the Affarsvarlden index of 15.9 to 895.0, down 1.9 per cent on the week. Electrolux B gained SKr7 to SKr217 ahead of its 1992 results due next Thursday while Ericsson, the day's most active issue, saw its B shares improve SKr4 to SKr176. DUBLIN returned to the attack again after Thursday's interlude, and continued speculation that the punt will be devalued saw the ISEQ overall index rise 15.68 to 1,271.05, up 15.68 per cent on the week. Brokers said that the punt looked safe for the weekend but that senior blue chips including Bank of Ireland, up 2 1/2 p at IPounds 1.84, CRH, 6p better at IPounds 2.13, and Smurfit, up 8p at IPounds 2.58, were bought on the view that the government, sorely tested this week, will not be able to hold out much longer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 29                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1078.05     1079.24     1079.03     1080.65 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1149.95     1150.01     1150.86     1148.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1081.59     1082.87     1080.29     1079.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1148.86     1149.29     1150.11     1148.15  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 28    Jan 27    Jan 26    Jan 25    Jan 22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1072.70   1072.28   1084.24   1077.68   1091.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1148.06   1147.45   1156.52   1146.87   1156.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1083.68 ; 200 - 1152.38 Low/day: 100 - 1077.53  200 - 1144.23.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

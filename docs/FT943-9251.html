			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Chemicals storage to be reviewed Severn Trent Water is to carry out an urgent review of the storage of hazardous chemicals near rivers following a pollution incident earlier this year. The review is one of 28 recommendations in a report commissioned by Severn Trent after organic chemicals entered the River Severn in April when they were discharged into a sewer in Shropshire. Mr Victor Cocker, Severn Trent managing director, said all the recommendations would be acted on, and some had already been implemented.</p>

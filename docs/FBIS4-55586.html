			<p>BFN     [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, May 17 (AFP) -- NATO  warplanes buzzed Tuzla Tuesday [17 May] at UN request after  Bosnian Serbs shelled the Moslem city's airport, but the  aircraft did not open fire, a UN spokesman said. UN Protection  Force spokesman here Jen Kirk did not specify how many planes  took part in the operation. He said the planes were called in  at 2:00 p.m. (1200 GMT) after seven shells hit the airport of  the northern Bosnian city while the first plane to arrive in a  month was being unloaded. No one was injured in the shelling.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Cardoso set for presidential run Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is expected to resign today in order to run for the presidency later this year. His likely successor is Mr Rubens Ricupero, a respected diplomat and former ambassador in Washington. Mr Cardoso has been strongly pressured by his party, the Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB), to run for the presidency, but he is leaving the finance ministry at a critical moment. An anti-inflation plan he has negotiated through Congress is not yet fully in force and may be undermined once he leaves. According to Brazil's constitution, he must resign by April 2 to run in the October polls. Financial markets reacted calmly to the expected transition. Mr Ricupero was not Mr Cardoso's first choice as his replacement, but the former ambassador has said he supports Mr Cardoso's economic measures. He is also friendly with several of the leading economists in Mr Cardoso's team. Mr Ricupero is well versed in economic affairs from his stint in Washington, where he was involved in Brazil's negotiations with the international financial community, and in trade matters. He was replaced as ambassador last year by President Itamar Franco who was annoyed at international reaction to a massacre of street children in Rio de Janeiro. Since then Mr Ricupero has worked as minister of the environment with responsibility for the Amazon.</p>

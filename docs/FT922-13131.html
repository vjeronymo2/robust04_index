			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn to sell shipping arm POWELL DUFFRYN, the distribution, storage and engineering group, has sold a 60 per cent stake in its Stephenson Clarke subsidiary, one of the most famous names in the British shipping industry. In a deal which values the fleet at Pounds 19m, Powell Duffryn has sold the stake to unidentified private clients of Hambros Bank, which financed the purchase. Powell Duffryn has received a total of Pounds 16.6m in cash, comprising Pounds 5.9m for the shares and Pounds 10.7m repayment of inter-company debt. It has also been released from external obligations of Pounds 1.2m. The buyers will eventually acquire the remaining 40 per cent of Stephenson Clarke when Powell Duffryn has received a maximum of Pounds 6m from its share of the shipping company's profits. Powell Duffryn will remain in shipping services, but this deal is the latest in a series of disposals and acquisitions which has seen it increasingly focus on engineering activities. Last week the group completed the sale of its remaining foundry interests - Powell Duffryn Castings and Ham-worthy Precision Machining  - to European Automotive Components for Pounds 4.8m in cash. In October the group received Pounds 30m from the dissolution of its quarrying and brickmaking joint venture with Hanson, the UK conglomerate. Mr Bill Andrews, chief executive of Powell Duffryn, said these cash inflows would help reduce group gearing from a percentage in the low 40s at its half-year at the end of September to about the low 20s. On the engineering side, Mr Andrews said he intended to both invest and consider further acquisitions in com-bustion technology, railway bogies and marine products such as pumps and compressors. He wished to concentrate on businesses where the group had at least a European position, and preferably could become world players. Last May Powell Duffryn bought the combustion operations of Dresser Holmes from Dresser Industries of Dallas for Pounds 5m, and last month it paid Pounds 4.5m for another combustion technology company, Peabody Engineering of Connecticut. Powell Duffryn has also recently invested Pounds 13.7m in the consortium it leads which in December successfully bid Pounds 180m for control of the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, the first major trust port to be privatised. In spite of this continuing restructuring, Mr Andrews said Powell Duffryn was happy to stick with its fuel distribution and storage businesses, which last year produced the bulk of the group's trading profits. The Stephenson Clarke management team in Newcastle will continue to operate the fleet under the non-executive chairmanship of Mr Geoffrey Walker, the managing director of Powell Duffryn Shipping, which continues to own Cory Brothers and the group's other shipping services interests. Stephenson Clarke made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m in the year to March 31 and its fleet had a net book value of Pounds 22.4m.</p>

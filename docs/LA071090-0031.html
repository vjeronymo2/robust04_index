			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET OFFICIALS SPLIT ON IDEA OF AID FROM WEST  </P> <P> Could Western billions bail out the beleaguered regime of Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev?  </P> <P> "This is not Poland or Hungary, this is 300 million people," one skeptical  Soviet economist said Monday, shaking his head at the daunting size of the  task.  </P> <P> What will probably be a prominent topic at the Houston summit of industrialized  democracies -- Gorbachev's reported appeal to the West to give a boost to the  reeling and shortage-plagued Soviet economy -- evokes conflicting feelings  among Soviet movers and shakers, with some even recommending against accepting  cash aid.  </P> <P> "Economic help in the form of money to the Soviet Union is not needed," said  Anatoly A. Sobchak, the progressive mayor of Leningrad. "If this money is put  into the hands of government bureaucrats, it will not be used in the right way.  . . . In no way should money be put into the hands of the bureaucrats."  </P> <P> Though many Kremlin officials spoke squeamishly about even the concept of "aid"  from the West, there was little dispute about the dire straits that the  country's economy has fallen into after five years of Gorbachev's perestroika  reforms, defined by one current Moscow joke as "when you're finally allowed to  open your mouth but there's nothing to put in it."  </P> <P> Panic buying recently caused salt and macaroni to disappear from Soviet stores.  The Kremlin spent the equivalent of $500 million on food imports as shortages  -- in the words of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov -- left the market  "destitute" and the citizenry increasingly disgruntled.  </P> <P> The vastness of the rescue job needed and the relative modesty of the means  under study are shown by simple arithmetic. West Germany is pushing for a  Western aid package of more than $15 billion. Such "massive" aid would be only  about $50 for each Soviet citizen.  </P> <P> Soviet officials who spoke to reporters during the Communist Party congress  inside the Kremlin said they would accept help from the West -- but only if no  strings are attached.  </P> <P> "To dictate conditions to such a country as the Soviet Union, a great power, is  embarrassing," said Georgy K. Shakhnazarov, an aide to Gorbachev. "We aren't  taking orders."  </P> <P> Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, in charge of the poorly performing  agricultural sector, objected vehemently to assistance if it is predicated on  Western-style economic changes "such as the move toward a free-market economy  or private property," concepts that the orthodox Marxist has consistently  opposed.  </P> <P> But Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the foreign minister, seemed to be willing to offer  guarantees that the Kremlin's reform course would continue, though he brushed  off the U.S. demand for an end to the Soviet underwriting of Fidel Castro's  Cuba as being a matter for negotiations with Havana alone.  </P> <P> Help from abroad, Shevardnadze said Monday, "will undoubtedly help perestroika,  democratization and modernization in our society." He said donor nations would  also benefit from increased commercial contacts.  </P> <P> Significantly, while chatting with journalists, Shevardnadze said he disliked  the word pomoshch, or "aid," to describe what the West is considering. He  referred instead to "credit, technical cooperation, personnel training, joint  ventures and joint projects."  </P> <P> For many people of Shevardnadze's generation, who were told when young that  their country would overtake the United States in general prosperity within  their lifetimes, even the slightest suggestion that they might appear to be  going to the West hat-in-hand must be galling.  </P> <P> "For 70 years, people were told that no cooperation was possible with  foreigners, that every foreigner was a spy or an enemy," Leningrad Mayor  Sobchak said.  </P> <P> According to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, Gorbachev made a  plea for help from the Group of Seven countries now meeting in Houston in a  letter received by President Bush last week. But "Vremya," state-run  television's main news program, told viewers Monday only that the letter  mentioned a "widening of economic cooperation" and made aid sound like an idea  thought up by the West.  </P> <P> Soviet officials interviewed gave varying wish lists for how to use Western  help.  </P> <P> Pavel G. Bunich, the economist who reminded reporters in the Kremlin that his  country is much bigger and more populous than Poland or Hungary, said what the  Soviet Union really needs is technical and management training, rather than  imports of consumer goods.  </P> <P> Shakhnazarov, who presumably was relaying Gorbachev's thinking, said Western  technology is wanted for the rapid construction of small-scale businesses to  manufacture consumer products and food, as well as help in carrying out  market-style reforms in banking, finance and management.  </P> <P> The government official charged with finding a way out of the economic crisis,  Deputy Prime Minister Leonid I. Abalkin, said the country needs to  "immediately" buy consumer goods, develop food-processing plants and light  industry and court foreign investment in industry.  </P> <P> He said credits from the West would buy the Kremlin time to implement its plan  for the transition to a "regulated market," a proposal that touched off a  near-panic when it was made public in May and officials disclosed that it would  mean an average doubling of food prices.  </P> <P> "We're talking about credit to stabilize conditions; that's what we need,"  Abalkin said.  </P> <P> Whatever the Western leaders' decisions turn out to be, the magnitude of the  steps needed to revitalize the Soviet economy were sketched by Sobchak.  </P> <P> Farming and food-processing sectors in the Soviet Union now function so poorly  that in the Leningrad region, a staggering 50% to 75% of the crops harvested  never make it to market, rotting or disappearing somewhere in the food chain.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's second-largest city, where more than 4 million people live,  doesn't have a single drugstore where "a person can come in and buy any drug,"  the mayor said.  </P> <P> What are needed now are "real projects" for Soviet-foreign economic  cooperation, like the construction of such a drugstore or a factory to make  bricks, Sobchak said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE DISCOVERS AN OFFENSE IN 9-5 CONFERENCE WIN  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge baseball team experienced an awakening Saturday in a  9-5 win over Cal State Los Angeles at Matador Field.  </P> <P> Northridge (12-10 overall), which defeated the Golden Eagles for the second  time in as many days, finished its first round of California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. play with a 7-5 record.  </P> <P> The Matadors will play at UCLA on Wednesday in the first of 11 consecutive  nonconference games before resuming CCAA play April 5.  </P> <P> "We have been slumping lately," said Northridge Coach Bill Kernen, whose  Matadors had dropped four conference games in a row before sweeping the series  with Cal State L. A. (9-14, 2-3 in conference play).  </P> <P> "(Saturday's) game was the first time that we had an actual offense and just  didn't wait for someone to hit a home run," Kernen said.  </P> <P> It also was the first time in six games since a 7-6 victory over Chapman on  Feb. 27 that the Matadors had scored more than three runs.  </P> <P> Saturday marked the first collegiate start for freshman left-hander John  Bushart (1-0). The former Thousand Oaks High standout came into the game with a  14.52 earned-run average in 4 2/3 innings. But Bushart pitched seven strong  innings against the Golden Eagles, allowing two earned runs on three hits.  </P> <P> "He pitched a tremendous game," Kernen said. "He's been waiting his turn and  finally got his chance."  </P> <P> Northridge erupted for seven runs in the fifth inning to break a 2-2 tie.  </P> <P> Kyle Washington knocked in two runs on a bases-loaded single. Eric Johnson had  an RBI double and Craig Clayton hit a run-scoring single.  </P> <P> Northridge also got help from Golden Eagle reliever Todd Johnson, who threw  back-to-back wild pitches with the bases loaded to bring home two more  Matadors.  </P> <P> Cal State L. A. scored two unearned runs in the second inning to take a 2-0  lead before Northridge tied the score with a run in each of the third and  fourth innings.  </P> <P> The Golden Eagles added a run in the sixth and another in the eighth to cut the  Northridge lead to 9-4, but reliever Todd Denhart retired Abdom Pinon on a  groundout to end the rally. Steve Soliz homered in the top of the ninth and Cal  State L. A. had runners at first and second with one out. But Steve Velasquez  flied out to center fielder Greg Shockey, who threw out David Adams trying to  advance to end the game.  </P></p>

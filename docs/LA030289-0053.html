			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: BUFFALO ROAM AGAIN -- NOW TO U.S. TABLE  </P> <P> The American bison is back. There are more buffalo grazing on the grasses of  this nation now than there have been since the mid-1800s. According to the  American Bison Assn. in Denver and the National Buffalo Assn. in Ft. Pierre,  S.D., there are between 60,000 to 80,000 head of bison in America and another  10,000 to 20,000 in southern Canada.  </P> <P> That's not many compared to the estimated 60 million that inhabited North  America when Columbus discovered it in 1492, or even compared to the 20 million  that still roamed the Great Plains in the 1850s. But compared to the 254 that  existed in the entire world (one was in a zoo in Calcutta, India) in 1910, I  think it is safe to say the American bison is making a comeback.  </P> <P> There seem to be three major reasons why the past few years have seen an  accelerated growth in people's interest in the buffalo, according to several of  the producers I have talked to across the country.  </P> <P> One is the tremendous interest that has developed in the past decade or so  (since the Bicentennial in 1976, I think) in American cuisine.  </P> <P> Whatever that is, it must include the American bison. The only other meat  products that I can think of truly indigenous to America are the country ham  and feedlot beef.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Protein, Less Cholesterol  </P> <P> The second reason has to do with perceived or perhaps real, but in any case  well publicized, health benefits of buffalo meat. Buffalo is reported to have  25% to 30% more protein than most other domestic meats, less than half the  cholesterol and about one third the fat and calories. I'm not sure I "buy" all  that, but then I have come to suspect any nutritional claim made by almost  anybody who wants to sell me something. What I do buy when I buy buffalo is  taste. Buffalo steak comes about as close to being what a good steak should be  as any steak I've had in a long time.  </P> <P> I find it interesting that all of the millions of American bison that were  slaughtered on the Western Plains in the late 1800s were not killed for their  meat. It was the buffalo hide that was prized. Buffalo hides brought as much as  $1,500 in London and Paris. That's a lot of money even today. Imagine how much  it was in 1880. The only other part of the buffalo that was not left to rot in  the hot prairie sun was the tongue. That was the only part the "white man" had  any taste for.  </P> <P> In 1870, according to Western historian Sam Arnold, 72 freight cars loaded with  nothing but buffalo hides and tongues were shipped out of Denver to the East.  Tongue today is not as popular as it once was, nor are hides; 'tis buffalo  steak that folks have discovered a taste for. "Buffalo steak," Sam said,  "tastes the way a beef steak would like to taste."  </P> <P> Arnold grills the steaks over charcoal, after first coating both sides well  with oil. After turning, the steaks are seasoned with his own Western Seasoning  Salt; a mixture of 1/3 garlic salt, 1/3 red pepper, 1/3 black pepper and 1/3  lemon crystals. (Lemon crystals can be found in the spice section of most  supermarkets; in drug stores, where they're labeled "citric acid crystals"; or  in Jewish deli's, where they will likely be called "sour salt.")  </P> <P> While you are not apt to find buffalo meat in the meat case of your local  supermarket in the immediate future, at the rate the national herd of American  bison is growing it won't be long. There are a growing number of ranchers,  large and small, raising buffalo. Some like the Hulk Ranch in Pierre, S.D.,  have 3,000 head or more; others, like Wray and Roma Dawson at Phistlewood Farms  in Chantilly, Va., have only 75 to 80 head. "They're fun to raise," Roma told  me, "good to eat, and they kind of help us make ends meet."  </P> <P> Most producers sell to consumers by direct mail either from their own  USDA-inspected plant or through a USDA-inspected processor. All sell steaks and  roasts and ground buffalo, some sell buffalo sausage products and jerky and a  few even sell that Epicurean delight of days gone by -- buffalo tongue. Here  are some places you can buy buffalo today.  </P> <P>  -- Durham Night Bird Game &amp; Poultry Co., 650 San Mateo Ave., San Bruno,  Calif. 94066; (415) 873-5035.  </P> <P>  -- Butterfield Buffalo Ranch, Beloit, Kan. 67420; (913) 738-2336.  </P> <P>  -- Hulk Buffalo Ranch, P.O.

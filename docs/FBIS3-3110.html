President Bill Clinton notified congressional leaders of the  extension on Monday [14 March].    Any resumption of nuclear weapons testing would have to be  approved by Congress.    "The President will decide next year whether to extend the  moratorium beyond September 1995," White House Spokeswoman Dee  Dee Myers said.    The U.S. Congress has set a September 1996 target for an end  to nuclear tests.</p>

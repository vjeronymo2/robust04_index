			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Mitsuzuka - one putt away from premier: LDP faction leader is out of the bunker and on course to win JAPANESE politicians are fond of comparing their fortunes to those of golfers. A year ago Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka was trapped in a deep bunker. His faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic party was falling apart, and other leaders were settling old rivalries by excluding his allies from senior government posts. Now Mr Mitsuzuka is a short putt from the prime ministership. The turmoil within the LDP has left him with the largest faction, and he heads the party's Policy Affairs Research Council, which is leading debate on constitutional and political reform. It is a comeback highlighting the importance of what Japanese politicians call 'the recovery shot'. The present tasks for Mr Mitsuzuka, 65, are to stay out of scandal's way and project a statesman-like image. In the quest for that image he has recently been pressing the case for political reform. Yesterday Mr Mitsuzuka told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister: 'We need political laws to stop corruption, like those introduced by Gladstone in 1883 (The Corruption and Illegal Practices Act).' The comment recognises that the expense of Japanese politics tempts players to take illegal donations and provide unethical favours, as was the case during the Tokyo Sagawa scandal. Mr Mitsuzuka yesterday insisted that the scandal involving a trucking company was 'a thing of the past' and 'of interest only to academics'. He may be underestimating the anger of ordinary Japanese over the affair, which involved payments to leading politicians and the prosecutors' lenient treatment of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former 'godfather' of Japanese politics, who was fined only Y200,000 for the illegal receipt of Y500m (Pounds 2.7m). But it is true that Japanese prosecutors have closed the casebook on Sagawa. The public does appear to be losing interest in the case, with the result that Mr Miyazawa's popularity is on the rise, from the depths of 12 per cent at the height of the scandal to around 20 per cent. Faction heads such as Mr Mitsuzuka are fortunate that new political groups are struggling to get funds from recession-hit Japanese companies, while an imperial wedding scheduled for June has provided a welcome distraction from scandal. In professing his enthusiasm for political reform, Mr Mitsuzuka said the country's multi-seat constituencies were the cause of Sagawa-like scandals and should be a replaced by a single-seat system similar to that of Britain. Yet a cheaper political system would undermine the power of patronage that comes from running a faction and dividing up constituencies with other faction heads. Mr Mitsuzuka admits that political reform may 'hurt me personally', but change is necessary because 'politics is a public thing and we must think of the next generation'. But he has also suggested in recent days that the reforms need not be introduced rapidly. Both Mr Mitsuzuka and Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister and the other likely candidate for the leadership, have hinted that Mr Miyazawa may run for a second term as prime minister when his term expires in September. Yet Mr Miyazawa often appears to lack confidence and has been considered an uninspiring leader at a time of political and economic crisis. Not that Mr Watanabe or Mr Mitsuzuka will necessarily provide enough inspiration to ensure the longer-term survival of the old order, but the collapse late last year of the Takeshita faction, then the largest, has left them at the helm of the party's destiny. The health of Mr Watanabe has been questioned while Mr Mitsuzuka argues that his experience as a foreign and trade minister qualify him to handle a tense trade relationship with the US. He said yesterday that 'it is no surprise' that bilateral tension has risen with the coming of a new US president, since Mr Bill Clinton had campaigned on economic issues and Japan appears to be one of those issues. But Mr Mitsuzuka will need to work to erase a popular perception that his faction is 'right wing' and, perhaps, not the best to be presiding over a sensitive debate on a wider role for the Japanese military. And he is thought by some colleagues to lack the negotiating skills necessary to secure the passage of important legislation. Mr Mitsuzuka can claim credit for being the first Japanese leader to caution the Chinese government over its military build-up. During a visit to Beijing late last year he expressed concern over plans to expand naval offensive capacity and the rapid upgrading of technology by the People's Liberation Army. 'We are not too accommodating towards China. I tell the Chinese at every opportunity that it is not in their interests to have the world against them on the issue of human rights,' he said. On the debate over the so-called 'peace clause', Article Nine of the constitution, which renounces the use of force to settle disputes, Mr Mitsuzuka said changing the constitution, technically, was a very simple matter. 'All we have to do is add a new section to the existing Article Nine explaining that a United Nations request would override that clause.' However, he acknowledged that winning public support for such a change is a 'delicate problem'. He suggested that 80 per cent public approval will be needed before the constitution is changed, or added to before Japan can take a more active international role. Having prospered, so far, from the upheaval within the LDP, the newly-confident Mr Mitsuzuka quoted Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. In assessing the need for further change in Japan, he said, those who do not respond 'adequately' will be 'left behind by the flow of history'.</p>

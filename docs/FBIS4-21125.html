The report places the country in the dock and notes that  corruption is widespread in Colombia, particularly in the  judicial branch. [passage omitted describing contents of report]    The policy of surrendering to justice which the State  Department criticizes has also been a controversial issue in  Colombia.    We consulted congressmen who approved the Penal Procedure  Code:    [Begin recording] [Senator Hernan Echeverri] We politely  reject this insinuation and this sort of U.S. intervention in  our domestic affairs.    [Representative Ramiro Lucio] The Colombian Congress,  autonomously--without consulting the U.S. State Department, the  Belgian Justice Ministry, or any other authority anywhere in the  world--decided to approve the Penal Procedure Code basically  including the antidrug policy that the national government  presented to us.    [Senator Alberto Santofimio Botero] What is happening is  that we are increasingly losing our sovereignty. We are going  to wind up asking the gringos what we are to do in order to  issue laws in Colombia.    [Representative Edmundo Guevara] It is easier to see the  mote in your brother's eye than to see the beam in your own. It  is in the United States where sentences are negotiated. We  copied from them. [end recording]</p>

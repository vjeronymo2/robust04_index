			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY BUILDS ITS EDGE AT THE LINE, 72-66  </P> <P> Four more for two. It has a certain ring to it.  </P> <P> Perhaps not as poetic as 'One more for four' -- Simi Valley High's official  motto for this season that told of its desire to win a fourth consecutive  Marmonte League title -- and probably not as realistic. But mottoes are really  only rallying cries.  </P> <P> And by virtue of a 72-66 win over Santa Barbara in the first round of the  Southern Section 5-AA Division playoffs Wednesday at Simi Valley, the Pioneers  can go ahead and rally all they want. Should they keep winning, the Pioneers  have four more playoff games.  </P> <P> Simi Valley will play Long Beach Millikan at a site to be determined by a coin  flip today.  </P> <P> "Look how far we've come," said guard Steve Carnes, the lone returnee from last  season's 4-A champion. "People didn't even expect us to win league and now  we're in the second round of the playoffs."  </P> <P> And, interestingly enough, the Pioneers advanced because of their clutch  free-throw shooting -- an advantage usually enjoyed by playoff-toughened teams.  </P> <P> Simi Valley made 13 of 17 free throws in the final 1:58, 16 of 23 in the fourth  quarter and 30 of 44 (68%) in a tightly called game that had 52 calls.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara, the Channel League's third-place representative, was awarded 16  free throws and made 10. Five Dons fouled out to only one player for Simi  Valley. Santa Barbara Coach Bob Purdy, who appeared fairly ruffled by the calls  during the game, was diplomatic afterward.  </P> <P> "It wasn't the refs," he said. "We played rotten."  </P> <P> The Dons had a chance to roll over in the fourth quarter when they trailed by  13 with 5:10 to play. But an 11-0 run brought Santa Barbara to within 57-55  with three minutes left before Simi Valley began its free-throw exhibition.  </P> <P> Carnes made four in a row, then missed one.  </P> <P> Jeff Marciano split a pair with 57 seconds left.  </P> <P> George Talledo made good twice with 40 seconds left.  </P> <P> Marciano made two of four (he missed two technical foul shots) with 33 seconds  remaining, then added two with 16 seconds left.  </P> <P> Carnes finished off the Dons with three seconds left, making two.  </P> <P> "We did get a little tense," Carnes said, "but we got our act together and made  our free throws."  </P> <P> Carnes finished with 21 points and Marciano, who made five of six three-point  shots, had 24. Marciano was the picture of confidence halfway through the third  quarter, pulling up on a fast break to hit his fifth three-point shot of the  game.  </P> <P> "He hit a couple with a guy hanging right on him," Purdy said. "Nothing you can  do about that."  </P> <P> While Carnes and Marciano carried the scoring load, forward Dennis Cook was  doing a number on Santa Barbara's front line -- namely sophomore center Matt  Purdy. Purdy, who averages 15 points a game, scored three -- all in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> "They told me he's a good scorer," Cook said. "But I figured he couldn't score  if he didn't get the ball. And I guess I did my job."  </P> <P> Purdy made one of five field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> Cook and Marciano actually have some playoff experience. They were added to  Simi Valley's playoff roster last season and saw limited playing time.  </P> <P> "Two minutes and 43 seconds," Cook said with a laugh. "But I can't be sure."  </P> <P> Said Bob Purdy, who is Matt's father: "Our big guys could've killed them. I  don't think any of them had more than four points."  </P> <P> Simi Valley led at halftime, 28-25, again on the strength of its free-throw  shooting. The Pioneers made 10 of 14. Santa Barbara made four of six.  </P> <P> Paul Perkins, however, led the Dons back. He scored 18 of his game-high 25  points in the second half, including 12 from three-point range. The Pioneers  staved off Perkins' run, however, from one-point range.  </P> <P> "Four more for two?" Bradshaw repeated. "That's a good one."  </P></p>

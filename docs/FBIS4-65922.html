			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rory Watson report: "Brussels Covers Up $18 Million Golden </F> Handshake Plan"]    [Text] Controversial plans to give golden handshakes to  several hundred senior European Commission officials, at a cost  to taxpayers of up to $18.4 million a year, have secretly been  put on hold until after June's European parliamentary elections.    Senior Commission officials feared a backlash of public  criticism at the very moment when governments are urging voters  to take an active part in the Union to elect new members to the  European Parliament.    The scheme, first mooted this month by Karel van Miert, the  commissioner for personnel, would have opened the door for up to  450 senior staff to retire early on 70 per cent pay. Their  desks are needed to make room for newcomers from the four  applicant countries due to join the Union on 1 January next year.    But the idea sparked off a fierce revolt from Van Miert's  colleagues. The commissioner was told in no uncertain terms  what the likely public relations consequences of such a move  would be. He was told to come back by the end of July with  other less politically and financially damaging ways of  integrating into the Commission the new officials from Austria,  Finland, Sweden and Norway.    Senior advisers representing other commissioners also raised  serious doubts over the original estimate that 1,800 posts,  ranging from senior administrators to secretaries and  messengers, plus a further 900 research and linguistic staff,  will need to be created in the three years following the arrival  of the four in the Union.    One senior member of the commission staff said: "Who says we  need this number of new officials? You cannot say just because  a country has such a size of population it should have so many  officials. We have to justify them in concrete terms, according  to the tasks to be done. Also, do we really need to use costly  golden handshakes?"    Golden handshakes are not new to the Union. They have been  dangled in front of senior officials in Union institutions every  time new countries join.    First used in 1973 when Britain, Ireland and Denmark became  members, they were most recently applied in 1980 when Spain and  Portugal entered the then European Community.    On previous occasions, to qualify for a guaranteed 70 per  cent of their final salary until retirement officials had to be  more than 55 and to have worked for the Commission, Parliament  or Council of Ministers for at least ten years.    Ironically, despite the growing hostility within the  Commission to golden handshakes, some predict pressure for the  scheme from the European Parliament's political groups.    For them, it would be a simple ruse to encourage flagging  senior staff to leave after the elections, paving the way for  the promotion of younger colleagues.    Ensuring a suitable contingent of Union officials is not  just  a matter of national pride for governments. It also guarantees  their influence and views are represented in the various  institutions. With Austria and the three Scandinavian countries  set to be net contributors to the EU (European Union) budget  they are certain to insist on a sizeable number of  Euro-officials.    The dilemma facing the Commission of satisfying these  demands  without unduly inflating its own staff or wasting public money  is a direct, but unforeseen, result of the drive by EU  government leaders to bring the four new countries into the  Union from next year.    "They pushed to have these countries in the Union," said one  official. "Now let's see if they are prepared to pay for it.  Governments not only have to give their financial go-ahead for  new staff posts they must also approve the special legislation  needed for the golden handshakes."    Under Van Miert's scheme, half of the l,800 enlargement jobs  would be met by creating permanent posts. Of the remainder,  half would come through golden handshakes and the rest through  the normal departures.    Nor do Commission officials believe relying on turnover  would  defuse the debate. "About 300 people a year leave the  Commission. If we reserved the posts for the new applicants, it  would mean that when nationalities left they would be replaced  by Austrians and Scandinavians," said a senior official.</p>

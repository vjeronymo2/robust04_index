			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Clinton to make growth and jobs package first priority MR BILL CLINTON said yes-terday that measures to create jobs and stimulate growth would be his first priority after taking office next year, in spite of tentative signs that the US recovery is gathering momentum on its own. The president-elect said he was committed to reducing the budget deficit but warned that a fairer tax system, involving larger burdens on the wealthy, would be an essential part of a multi-year deficit reduction programme. Mr Clinton was speaking at a joint press conference with Democratic congressional leaders in Little Rock shortly after the Federal Reserve reported a 0.3 per cent increase in industrial production last month compared with September, larger than expected in financial markets. The production increase was the latest in a series of more encouraging economic figures including reports on Friday of an unexpected surge in retail sales in October and a rebound in consumer confidence early this month. Mr Clinton said he saw no evidence yet of a 'long-term strengthening in manufacturing'. He saw nothing in the latest numbers to suggest he should do less to stimulate the economy than he promised in the campaign. Mr Clinton's economic package is expected to include a temporary investment tax credit to stimulate business capital spending and an acceleration of public infrastructure projects. A cut in capital gains tax rates on some forms of investment is also possible. Economists who advised Mr Clinton during the campaign said the fiscal stimulus was likely to be worth Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.4bn) to Dollars 40bn or roughly 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Asked if the stimulus would take precedence over efforts to reduce the budget deficit, Mr Clinton said: 'I do not believe that you can reduce the deficit without restoring economic growth.' He indicated that measures to reduce the rate of growth of healthcare costs and to shift the burden of taxes on to the wealthy would be essential components of his deficit reduction plan. People would accept the 'pain' of deficit reduction more readily if it was seen to be based on 'tax fairness', he said. During the campaign, Mr Clinton said he would raise taxes on the top 2 per cent by about Dollars 80bn over four years. Japan and Clinton, Page 4 Clinton to mend fences, Page 6 US stocks, Page 37</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Economic weight-watchers: The G7 meeting may be routine, but the issues it faces are not The choice of venue says it all. In September 1985, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the world's leading industrial democracies met in Manhattan's prestigious Plaza Hotel to launch a new chapter of international economic policy co-ordination. Seventeen months later, in February 1987, they assembled under the chandeliers of the Louvre Palace in Paris to announce a bold currency stabilisation pact. Tomorrow that co-ordination process continues - but in a Long Island suburb of New York within 20 minutes' drive of JF Kennedy airport. The prolonged recession in the English-speaking countries and slow growth elsewhere have presented the Group of Seven nations with bigger economic problems than in the mid-1980s when their main concern was to push an overmighty dollar lower. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the break-up of the Soviet Union have thrown up challenges for the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy and Canada that were undreamed of only three years ago. But tomorrow's meeting is likely to show that international economic policy co-operation has only limited potential to change the world. The G7, which some thought would evolve into a 'directorate' for the world economy after the Louvre Accord, now works best as a forum for information exchange, with the ministers and central bankers deciding their economic and monetary policies according to the Sinatra doctrine of 'doing it my way'. Officials preparing tomorrow's talks have stressed the routine character of the meeting. For the past four years, the G7 has gathered around this time to discuss the world economy and carry out the 'mutual surveillance' of each economy's performance with the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Tomorrow's meeting will see another session of this economic weight-watchers' club. After lunch, the discussion will focus on the economic crisis in the former Soviet Union. The talks are due to finish after just six hours, so that Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary, can join millions of other Americans in watching the Superbowl on Sunday. The tight schedule will allow some visiting ministers, including Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, to hurry to the airport and home to deal with domestic political concerns. On the other hand, it would be wrong to write off this latest instance of high-level hobnobbing as no more than an expensive photo opportunity. While the complexity of international events has apparently taught the G7 humility, adversity may be fostering solidarity. Officials preparing the meeting hope that the atmosphere will be more constructive than in recent G7 gatherings, which have been marked by disputes between the US and Germany, Europe's strongest economy, over economic policy priorities and how best to share the financial burden of helping eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics move towards the market economy. The Bundesbank's decision in December to raise its key interest rates to levels last seen in the 1930s, however, makes wholehearted agreement between Washington and Bonn improbable. The US will press its main trading partners to put greater stress on promoting economic growth, while the German government, faced with a rash of double-digit pay claims, will underline its determination to keep bearing down on domestic inflationary pressures. But US Treasury officials, at least, believe the slowdown in growth in Germany and Japan, and the absence of recovery in the recession-hit English-speaking members of the G7, may contain the seeds of a new international consensus on economic management that may solidify around the time of the spring meetings of the IMF in late April. The US Treasury draws encouragement from the US-Japanese growth strategy unveiled in Tokyo earlier this month by US President George Bush and the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. Although the agreement was criticised by many as little more than a rehash of existing domestic policy commitments, it bore some fruit last week in the shape of joint US-Japanese action on the foreign exchange markets to curb the dollar's rise and limit trade friction between the two countries. However, there seems little chance that the US and its European trade partners will agree similar pacts in the near future. Germany will be unable to start relaxing its tight monetary policy until wage pressures are brought under control. The UK and France must keep interest rates high, because they are committed to keeping their currencies in the bands of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Nor have the G7 governments much fiscal room for manoeuvre. There are likely to be some adjustments. Treasury officials in Washington indicate that President Bush's State of the Union message next Tuesday will signal fiscal changes to boost growth in the short term in spite of the chronic US budget deficit. With a general election looming, Mr Lamont is under growing pressure to squeeze what fiscal stimulus he can from his March 10 Budget. And the US may press France to relax fiscal policy to offset low growth this year. But these will be changes at the margin and unlikely in themselves to reverse the steady scaling back of growth forecasts in the big industrial countries. The budgetary constraints confronting all industrialised democracies are one reason not to expect agreement on large-scale financial assistance for Russia and the other former Soviet republics from the G7 meeting. Although the Russian authorities and their western advisers have made impassioned pleas for multi-billion dollar stabilisation funds to support the rouble and Russia's price reform, the G7 is unlikely to move before the republics have become members of the International Monetary Fund and subject to IMF discipline. The prevailing view was summed up by Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under secretary for international affairs, in an interview with BBC Television last weekend. He warned that economic reform in the former Soviet Union would be a long process which could not be bought by simply pumping in western financial assistance. It was premature to think, for example, of forming a stabilisation fund for the rouble. While senior G7 officials privately express grave concern about economic developments in the former Soviet Union, the ministers are unlikely to do much more than push along the process of turning the republics into IMF members. 'We hope to get to a point where the G7 ministers can agree on the right parameters for entry,' one senior official said. A US Treasury official said the G7's aim was to have Russia in the IMF in the next few months. Such a limited outcome would disappoint expectations in the former Soviet republics and elsewhere. But G7 officials believe that the republics must do more to make themselves attractive to western investors. On the other hand, Germany is expected to warn that the economic and political instability in the republics, and growing uncertainty about the security of the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal, could be contributing to the weakness of world growth by depressing investor and consumer confidence. There is little that finance ministers can do about the threat of nuclear proliferation. But they can hope to boost confidence in other ways. One would be to rekindle hopes that the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks can be brought to a speedy and successful end. More than one G7 delegation has suggested making a strong statement about the trade talks at the conclusion of the Long Island meeting. However, the finance ministers have done this before, with little sign that their appeals have had any effect on the negotiators in Geneva. This time could be different, particularly if the finance ministers can enlist their heads of government behind the cause of trade liberalisation. As growth in the G7 countries converges near to zero, freer trade is one of the few engines of recovery left to economic policymakers.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARSENIO HALL  </P> <P> A hearty rooof, rooof, rooof to Arsenio Hall for his efforts to entertain  audiences while maintaining his own cultural uniqueness and style. I suggest  that the so-called mainstream WASP America give African-Americans and other  people of color the dignity of their own cultural expression. It would go a  long way in relieving you of the burden of your own cultural elitism and at the  same time expose you to a diversity of ethnic expression that can only be a  learning experience for the better.  </P> <P> RONALD BROWN  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuriy Kobaldze, head of the Public </F> Relations Center of Russian External Intelligence; Kobaladze  speaks in Russian with superimposed English translation;  Kobaladze remarks recorded]    [Text] The United States Government has filed a law suit  against an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aldrich  Hazen Ames, and his wife, Maria Ames, on charges of spying for  the former Soviet Union and then Russia. The United States  Justice Ministry claims that the Ames couple has spied against  the United States since 1985. The U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher has lodged an official protest with a Russian  diplomat who was invited to the Department of State. In Moscow,  the U.S. Ambassador Pickering voiced a similar protest at his  meeting with Russian Foreign Ministry officials. Radio Moscow's  reporter, Aleksandr Peripetchko has asked the chief of the  Public Relations Bureau of Russia's external intelligence, Yuriy  Kobaladze, to comment on the arrest of the American couple on  charges of spying for Russia:    [Kobaladze] Firstly, it is unclear for what reason the  Russian external intelligence is believed to be involved in that  affair. This question should be addressed to the Americans,  those who made the arrest, those who formulated the charges,  U.S. Administration officials. This is not our business. We  never comment on such issues. This is a generally recognized  practice for all secret services. The Russian intelligence is  no exception. No comments are made on whether this or that  person was, or is, involved in intelligence operations. All  professionals are perfectly aware of that. So is the public at  large. This is the reason why I refrain from any comments.    [Announcer] A BBC report said that the United States does  not  want another round of mutual expulsions, so frequent in the Cold  War years. Yet it hopes that Russia will recall from the United  States those diplomats who have worked with the Ames couple.  Washington would also like to hear promises from Moscow that  nothing of the sort will happen in the future. What does the  public relations official of the Russian external intelligence  think of that? Yuriy Kobaladze:    [Kobaladze] If we avoid focusing on this concrete episode  and  speak in broader terms, the Russian intelligence has never  pledged to curtail intelligence activity. No other Western  intelligence, including the American one, has ever done so  either. Moreover, Washington keeps saying that in the wake of  the break-up of the Soviet Union, its interest in Russia's  problems and in the problems of other former Soviet republics  has grown and not reduced. The Americans say they must increase  the presence of the intelligence in that region. They have  talked a great deal about what they call human intelligence.  This euphemism means recruiting agents. The American  intelligence and other foreign secret services have been very  active in that respect.    [Announcer] One of Russia's central dailies, IZVESTIYA,  earlier this month published an interview with the chief of  Russia's Federal Counterintelligence, Mr. Golushko. In that  interview he said outright that several people have been  arrested on spying charges. The damage one of them has caused to  Russia is similar only to that of the Penkovskiy affair in the  60's. This is only one of the examples of how active Western  secret services have been in Russia. Washington seems to be  expecting Moscow to take certain steps to restore stability in  its relations with the United States, the more so since the  United States President Bill Clinton has described this as a  very serious incident. Is that so? Yuriy Kobaladze:    [Kobaladze] What we would like to say is that individual  episodes should not be used to build up tensions in Russian-U.S.  relations. That is a Cold War tactic. If we really live in a  new world, a world of cooperation and good-neighborliness, it  would be senseless to fan this hysteria.    [Announcer] One cannot but agree that even in this changing  world, an intelligence service will remain so. It will continue  to have its own specific interest and use its own means. It  remains to be seen whether this episode will have a negative  effect on Russian- U.S. relations or not.</p>

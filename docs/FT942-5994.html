			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Pirate disc sales double to 75m Worldwide sales of pirate compact discs doubled to 75m units last year, almost exclusively as a result of unauthorised production in China, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. The IFPI said it expected CD piracy to increase further, unless China took steps to enforce copyright law. The federation, along with Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has proposed that legitimate manufacturers mark CDs with a four-digit code which would indicate where they were made. Sales of unauthorised music cassettes fell last year, however, to 675m units from 680m in 1992. There were substantial falls in pirate cassette sales in Mexico and Poland. The level of pirate music sales in both countries remained high. Unauthorised sales accounted for 62 per cent of all recordings sold in Mexico last year and 67 per cent in Poland. The value of pirate recordings sold last year on either CDs or cassettes fell to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 2.1bn in 1992. The federation said it would be wrong to draw any comfort from the decline, which was the result of lower retail prices and exchange rate movements. The federation said the pirates appeared to be getting less for their recordings. The average worldwide price of a pirate cassette, outside China, fell 10 per cent to about Dollars 2.70 last year. The price of a CD outside China fell from just under Dollars 13 in 1992 to just under Dollars 12 last year. Chinese pirate producers saw CD prices fall even more sharply, from nearly Dollars 11 in 1992 to Dollars 4.50 last year. Despite the activities of unauthorised Chinese manufacturers, the US was the biggest market for pirate products last year in value terms.</p>

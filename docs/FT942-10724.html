			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (6): Solution to flooding sought Aid donors from 15 countries gather in Dhaka at the end of this year to set in motion a Flood Action Plan for Bangladesh, writes Sheila Jones. The plan follows a five-year programme of studies and pilot projects across the country into ways of preventing disastrous flooding. This first stage of the plan, costing Dollars 150m, was initiated in 1990 after the disastrous floods of 1987 and 1988. The work started only after initial studies of damage, flood policy and structural solutions carried out in 1989 by France, the US and Japan with the government of Bangladesh. A review of the latest work, co-ordinated by the World Bank and funded by aid donors and the United Nations Development Programme, is due in July. The aim is to agree on a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the country's chronic flood problem. In coastal areas, cyclones cause more damage, but they are much harder to predict and are considered virtually impossible to control. A separate study of cyclone-prone areas is in progress at a cost of about Dollars 75m. Pilot projects on flood mitigation are under way on the Brahmaputra, testing the effectiveness of embankments and river regulators. Study groups have also examined the pattern of flooding and regional needs, river bank protection, the encroachment of water onto agricultural land and ways of stabilising shifting rivers and of securing adequate drainage. Bangladesh is 80 per cent floodplain. Its land is shot through with rivers. The largest are the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna. The country is vulnerable to catastrophic floods that destroy crops, homes, livestock and the infrastructure, but seasonal flooding is essential for food and life. The Flood Action Plan thus advocates the principle of 'controlled flooding'. 'The basic policy is to allow normal flooding, which farmers and fishermen need, but to keep out unwanted floods, the ones that do damage,' says Mr Hugh Brammer, an agricultural specialist and adviser on the Flood Action Plan. River embankments would keep out unwanted floods, while regulators would be open at other times to allow for normal flooding and drainage. Mr Brammer adds that public participation is a vital part of the project because of the need for local maintenance and operation, and the possibility of conflicting interests between, for example, farmers and fishermen. He admits that the programme is ambitious. 'But you simply cannot leave people exposed in this way. It took the Netherlands 600 years to create a system of embankments and regulators. We don't have that time in Bangladesh.'</p>

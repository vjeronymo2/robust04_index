			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, January 4 (SNARK)--Vladislav Ardzinba, the  Abkhazian Head, expressed his skeptical attitude to the  Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations which should take place on  January 11. Speaking yesterday to the Gudauta radio Ardzinba  said that Abkhazia will never be the part of Georgia. Abkhazia  won the war, that's why Abkhazia should determine the conditions  at the negotiations.    Meanwhile, Aleksandr Kavsadze, Shevardnadze's representative  in the conflict zones, told SNARK the war was without the  victors and vanquished. He is of the opinion that Ardzinba is  being supported by the concrete political forces who are deeply  interested in the tension in the region.</p>

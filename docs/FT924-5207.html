			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Euromark futures fall SHORT-DATED Euromark futures lost several basis points yesterday after the Bundesbank failed to change officially posted rates at its fortnightly council meeting, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank's decision not to ease policy was widely expected in both foreign exchange and interest rate markets. But several dealers said yesterday that there will be more intense speculation about a cut in German interest rates in the run-up to the next meeting in a fortnight's time. At the moment, the market is assuming that there will be a cut in German rates, but that it will come in the New Year. The December Euromark contract fell back 12 basis points from its opening level, to a close of 91.22 yesterday. At this level, the contract assumes that 3-month money will be only 9 basis points lower by the middle of next month, effectively ruling out a change in German rates in 1992. That view was compounded yesterday by a poor inflation figure in the German state of Bavaria, showing the at the cost of living had risen by 0.6 per cent in the month to mid-November for a year-on-year rise of 4.0 per cent. The Bundesbank has made it clear that domestic inflationary pressures are still of great concern and yesterday's figure will add to pressures not to ease policy. Futures dealers continue to assume that there will be a significant cut at the start of 1993 although prospects for this have dampened a little too. The March Euromark contract fell 19 basis points from its opening level yesterday to a close of 92.24. At this level, it still assumes that there will be more than 100 basis points off 3-month money by the spring. In the rest of Europe, markets were very quiet in the wake of the turbulence of Monday and Tuesday. the exception was Ireland, where the central bank said that the overnight rate will be hiked to 100 per cent on Monday to ward off speculation against the Irish punt. By contrast, the December French franc futures were virtually unchanged at 89.99, pricing in no change in 3-month money before the end of the year. The franc was mostly stable on the foreign exchanges, and the Bank of France drained a net FFr7.9bn of funds, leaving its intervention rate at 9.10 per cent. There was little change in sterling cash rates, with 3-month money closing at around 7 1/4 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.55bn, most of which was removed in the afternoon.</p>

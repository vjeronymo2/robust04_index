			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Washington, 11 May -- The Embassy of the State  of Kuwait in the United States categorically has denied reports  by a local U.S. newspaper on the visit of the high-ranking  Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to Washington that is scheduled  for next week.    The responsible official at the embassy told KUNA today that  the newspaper's report, citing sources at the embassy to the  effect that the predominant impression is that the Kuwaiti  delegation's visit was coming at an unsuitable time and without  being preceded by any coordination measures, was "entirely  untrue and unrealistic."    The source pointed out that the "intensive program that has  been prepared for this visit clearly shows that officials at the  U.S. Administration and the Congress welcomed the visit and  expressed readiness to meet the delegation. Numerous high-level  meetings have been arranged with the leaderships of the Senate  and the Congress, in addition to meetings with high-ranking  officials in the administration, be it at the White House or the  State and Defense Department levels.    The diplomatic official at the Embassy of the State of  Kuwait  in Washington said that the program of the Kuwaiti parliamentary  delegation's visit, headed by Assembly Speaker Ahmad 'Abd  al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, includes press and media conferences with  the leading U.S. newspapers and media institutions in the  capital, Washington. [passage omitted]    He concluded his statement by saying that "all these efforts  are undoubtedly at variance with the newspaper's report, which  regrettably has not contacted the officials at the embassy who  are responsible for this visit to verify the truth of the  statements that the newspaper published."    The source said that "the embassy was not aware that any of  its members had made statements to any newspaper or any other  quarter that were contradictory to what we have said."</p>

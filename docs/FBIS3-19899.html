[Stolpe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert.    [Wickert] Mr. Stolpe, the coalition among the Social  Democratic Party [SPD], the Free Democratic Party [FDP], and the  Alliance 90 has collapsed. You are now heading a minority  government. Is it possible for you to continue governing?    [Stolpe] Well, the most important news of the day for us in  Potsdam is that the government is able to function, that the  cabinet is complete, and that we can continue to fulfill the  numerous tasks without delay. This is certain for the time  being. Whether we will be able to achieve majorities on certain  issues will simply depend on whether the solutions that we  prepare are convincing -- solutions that were supported by many  others during the preparatory phase, for example. Let me repeat  this once more: The government will continue to function.    [Wickert] You have adopted an uncompromising attitude. You  demanded that Mr. Nooke from the Alliance 90 should withdraw his  statement that you lied about your past to the investigation  committee, that there is no other way. Why did you adopt this  tough position?    [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, this was not toughness. I was simply  interested in clarifying the matter. All my friends and I had  the impression that the fact that I was condemned in advance was  no longer a basis for cooperation. In addition, we had the  feeling that one of our -- former -- partners was interested in  exacerbating the situation and in ensuring that additional  questions were raised and more documents were provided.  Cooperation was simply no longer possible. I had no high  expectations. I only asked for a withdrawal of the advance  condemnation and suggested waiting until the investigation  committee presents its results. I also asked for a certain  reliable cooperation in the interest of the tasks that have to  be fulfilled. My wishes were ignored, and thus we are no longer  three partners but only two -- the Social Democrats and the  Liberals.    [Wickert] Well, you will have to continue governing. There  have been contradictory statements by officials from the  Christian Democratic Union. On the one hand, new elections are  demanded, but on the other, it has been assumed that new  elections will not take place because the Landtag members are  not yet eligible for a pension.    [Stolpe] This is certainly not the only reason. You must  also take into consideration that elections are scheduled for 11  September anyway. In fact, I am interested in completing  important tasks in a sensible way. The citizens of Brandenburg  are simply entitled to good results of our work. Early  elections would only be the last resort if we were no longer  able to function. However, since this is not the case, I  believe we will be able to conclude our work successfully.    [Wickert] You are saying that this is not the case. Yet  since you are now heading a minority government, you must be  tolerated. Will you also accept toleration by the Party of  Democratic Socialism?    [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, in the Brandenburg Landtag -- as in  other landtags -- the results are important. There is always  the possibility of coming to an agreement in the committees.  Even when the coalition among the three parties still existed  and we held clear majorities in the committees, we also took  into consideration the views of the opposition. We purposefully  sought agreement on certain issues. I suppose that this will  pay off in the next few months. The issues that we still have  to settle have largely been supported by all members of the  Landtag.    [Wickert] Mr. Stolpe, this was the first coalition between  the SPD, FDP, and Alliance 90 in Germany at the provincial  level. Can you imagine that such a coalition might also work at  the federal level, or was yours an individual case?    [Stolpe] Mr. Wickert, we have never claimed to be a model.  We have always been aware that we have a special situation here  east of the Elbe or in eastern Germany. Three years ago when we  assumed office people predicted that the coalition would not  even last 100 days. We have managed to survive over three years.  We struggled to reach joint positions and have done a good job.  I would say that this was useful for Brandenburg. However, we  do not claim that it should serve a model for other governments.    [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Stolpe.    [Stolpe] Good evening.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Stubborn recession finds industry near wits' end BRITISH industry has reached a critical point. 'There is no sign of an end to the recession, no bright horizons. Our backs are right up against the wall. The only stuff we can take out now to cut costs is stuff that will really hurt.' That gloomy assessment of the choices facing industry, from Mr Fred Heaton, managing director of the bolting division of T&amp;N, the engineering group, is echoed throughout British manufacturing. Most companies were prepared for a recession lasting about a year. Few had planned on a severe one lasting for much more. Many manufacturers have come through the last year by shedding staff, squeezing working capital and dropping plans to renew their car fleets. It is a common refrain for chief executives to claim that they have not had to cut into the fabric of their businesses. But the longer the recession continues the greater the risk that industry will suffer long term damage. Now manufacturers face the prospect of cutting into the lifeblood of their businesses - from investment in training to major capital investment programmes to re-equip factories. Few industrialists believe the recession will lift before the late autumn. Mr Heaton of T&amp;N said: 'We planned on being out of recession within a year. We knew we could go through a year without cutting product development. The last plan we drew up projected some improvement this October but we are starting to rule that out now.' There is a growing scepticism about official forecasts of when the recovery will finally arrive. As Mr Stuart Moberley, finance director of McKechnie, the Midlands engineering group, puts it: 'This recession is very stubborn, people have started to realise that there will no quick fix.' Most companies have already made deep cuts in their workforce. With those staff have gone central post rooms, large computer systems have been replaced by smaller ones, sales staff are driving cars with old plates and secretaries are averting their eyes from discoloured paintwork. The claim that this recession has not inflicted a drastic toll upon industry is borne out at groups such as Benjamin Priest. Employment has been cut by about 30 per cent, yet the company claims major capital spending plans have not been cut back - yet. Mr John Ainsworth, managing director, said: 'In the last recession we had a number of companies which were never going to be profitable. That is not true this time. What we have left are varied and profitable businesses which are poised for the upturn. We are not carrying lame ducks.' Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of the 600 Group, the engineering company, says it has managed to cut costs enough to allow continued investment in research and development and to break even despite a 50 per cent dip in new orders for machine tools. 'We are shedding staff but we are not seeing productive capacity destroyed for ever in the way it was during the last recession,' he said. Indeed some companies claim their spending upon innovation and training has become more important as companies find ways to raise productivity and open up markets without buoyant demand to help them. Mr Tony Frith, chairman and chief executive of Concentric, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals and electrical components maker, explained: 'We have not cut back on engineering or training. We are spending more on training to make people more effective, to generate productivity gains in a recession your have to spend more on people.' Many companies also claim that innovation has become more important to them in the recession because the only way to maintain production volumes is to expand their share of a smaller market through offering more innovative products. One of the most striking attempts by a company to sell its way out of recession has been deployed by W Canning, the speciality chemicals and electronics group, which has boosted spending on innovation to create environmentally friendly chemicals for use in waste disposal and transferred a large portion of its sales effort from the UK to export markets. Mr David Probert, chairman, explained: 'In a recession our customers are more receptive to new ideas because they need new products to create sales much more than when demand is booming.' Groups such as Wagon Industrial, the Telford-based engineering and automotive group, are taking a different approach in an attempt to combine tighter cost control with innovation. Mr John Hudson, chief executive, explained: 'The growth of the 1980s will not be repeated. To earn decent profits we will have to do something more dramatic than simply allow ourselves to be pulled out from recession. So we have started a strategic review of our cost base, merging factories for instance, not just to see ourselves through the downturn but to make sure we can make good profits with the slower growth of the next few years.' There is an additional reason why the pace of innovation may not be slowing as expected. Many British companies, in the automotive industry for instance, are long-term sub-contractors to larger international groups which assemble vehicles. These customers set the pace of innovation their suppliers have to match if they want to remain as suppliers in an intensely competitive car market. Consumer goods groups such as Hoover, the washing machine manufacturer, claim they are maintaining investment despite a sustained fall in demand which has forced it to lay off hundreds of staff at its Welsh factories. Mr Ian Kyd, Hoover's UK financial controller, commented : 'We need to invest because, if we do not, we will be left behind. We have not changed our product development plans at all.' Most British manufacturers are responding to this recession with more vigour and confidence than the recession of a decade ago. Managers have a clearer sense of their priorities. But while the recession may not be cutting a swathe through British industry, the fabric is starting to get very frayed in places. The mechanical engineering and metal working industries, which went into the recession with a weak record for profitability and investment, are seeing the closure of many small and medium-sized sub-contractors. There are worries that industry has become so intent on surviving the depths of recession that it will fail the test of recovery. Mr Gaskell at the 600 Group said: 'The risk is that there will be fewer companies at the end of this and we may not be able to respond quickly enough to growth when it comes because stocks are so low and factories are so lean.' Mr Tom O'Connor, deputy chairman of Elta Plastics, is concerned about the long-term damage which may have been done to industry's relations with banks. 'The biggest danger is that companies and banks will be weaker financially and, so far, more cautious about investing. The banks simply are not making the funds available. We should be investing now for the upturn.' Industry has come through the past year largely by taking the most obvious escape route: aggressively cutting costs. The next year could be even tougher. The pressure will not let up but the escape routes will be fewer, narrower and less obvious.</p>

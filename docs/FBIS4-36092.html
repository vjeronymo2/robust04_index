			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The Nonaligned Movement's  foreign ministers 11th conference devoted much of its final  session to the issue of the Israeli raids against south Lebanon.  Several foreign ministers and delegation heads addressed the  session on this subject.    Head of the Lebanese delegation Hisham Dimashqiyah remarked  that yesterday's Israeli aggression against the country  constitutes a declaration of war. He warned that the peace  process is endangered and that the UN Security Council and the  United States and Russia, the two sponsors of the peace  conference, must put pressure on Israel.    Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that the Israeli  aggression against Lebanon is not directed against one  particular country but against the entire world community and  the cosponsors of the peace conference. He added that this is  not the first such aggression and will not be the last and that  Israel's repeated assaults on the Arab parties participating in  the peace process illustrate the Israeli design to ruin the  peace process and smother the opportunity to attain peace.    Head of the Egyptian delegation Nabil al-'Arabi emphasized  his country's backing for Lebanon and its support for a  comprehensive and just Middle East peace. He said Israel must  halt these acts, which threaten the peace operation and  contravene international law. He pointed out that peacemaking  needs a favorable climate and the attack on Lebanon posed a  threat to the Lebanese nation.    The head of the Saudi delegation said he adds his voice to  that of the other delegation heads in expressing profound  concern and strong condemnation of the Israeli aggression  against Lebanon. He stressed that Saudi Arabia supports the  Lebanese people and wants the peace process to continue. He  urged that UN Security Council Resolution 425, which provides  for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, be implemented.    PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi accused Israel  of  deceiving the world. He said what is really happening between  Israel and Palestine now is a new form of battle which, although  it involves no violence, is a fresh stage of struggle.    Qaddumi added that Israel's acts of piracy in Lebanon, such  as its abduction of Lebanese citizens, prove that it does not  seek peace but is persisting in its efforts to derail the peace  process. He said regional peace is still far away.    The head of the Libyan delegation reiterated support for  Lebanon, condemned Israel, and urged the Security Council, the  United States, and Russia to intervene to salvage the peace  operation.    The Yemeni and Moroccan foreign ministers also declared  support for Lebanon.</p>

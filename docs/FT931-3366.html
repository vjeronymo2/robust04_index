			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (9): The New Age wave of economics MELTDOWN by William Houston Smith Gryphon Publishers, Pounds 15.99, 202 pages FROM TIME to time dogged scientists and economists try to find patterns in the chaos of long-term data. You will have heard of Nicolai Kondratieff, a Russian economist under Stalin who perished in Siberia after predicting that capitalism would revive after the 1930s depression, benefiting from an underlying 45- to 60-year cycle. You have probably not come across, however, the work of Raymond Wheeler, a psychology professor from Kansas who identified a 1000-year climatic cycle, or the New Mexico scientist Iben Browning, grandson of a Cherokee Indian, who detected a volcanic cycle of 8.85 years' duration. Little of this is given much credence by conventional economists and scientists, but the fact is that such mainstream experts have failed to predict or explain the worst slowdown in the world's developed economies since the depression of the 1930s. It is left to fringe writers like William Houston to explore the reasons for our plight. Not that Mr Houston is any kind of nutty doomster. He is a practical man, an engineer and company doctor who several years ago foresaw Britain's current slump. In this book he explores the possible reasons for the renewed depression, although without clearly disentangling the effects of credit cycles from those of climatic variations with possible astronomical or volcanic origins. He expects a prolonged depression through the 1990s, and the book is designed to offer practical suggestions about survival - both physical and financial. Lacking a precise theoretical framework the book can seem contradictory: for instance, Mr Houston appears unsure whether in the US inflation or deflation is a bigger danger, and in fact he appears to suggest there could be both at different stages. In the UK he fears that government income will fall by a third between 1990 and 1994, requiring drastic cutbacks in spending. But he argues that the government should still aim to balance the budget. It will be up to entrepreneurs to seize new opportunities and benefit from cheap capital. His prescriptions range from eminently logical recommendations of new forms of work to rather dotty suggestions that in a dry climate we should switch our diet to buckwheat, millet and seaweed (let us hope it does not come to that). But at least William Houston is prepared to be unorthodox, and that is important when the green shoots of conventional economic wisdom have proved so misleading.</p>

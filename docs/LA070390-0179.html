			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENGLISH REQUIRE SPARK, GERMANS, MORE OF SAME  </P> <P> Here is a capsule look at the English and West German soccer teams, which will  play in the second World Cup semifinal game Wednesday at Turin.  </P> <P> ENGLAND -- A controversial top seed in Group F, the English have lived up to  the FIFA's pre-tournament ranking.  </P> <P> The offense, led by striker Gary Lineker, John Barnes, Chris Waddle and Peter  Beardsley, has been inconsistent.  </P> <P> However, the experience of the squad showed Sunday when, trailing lightly  regarded Cameroon 2-1 with eight minutes remaining in regulation, England  scored on a penalty kick by Lineker and then beat the Africans 3-2 on another  penalty kick goal in overtime.  </P> <P> The experience comes from the several players who played in the 1986 World Cup  in Mexico, along with Manager Bobby Robson. The team won't give up many goals  -- Terry Butcher and Des Walker are excellent defenders and 40-year-old  goalkeeper Peter Shilton has played more full international games than any  other player in history.  </P> <P> But the English need some spark from the midfield, where Neil Webb and Bryan  Robson are recovering from injuries.  </P> <P> WEST GERMANY -- Unlike the last two tournaments, when the Germans were lightly  regarded and made it to the championship game, this German team came in  considered a favorite and has played like one. The players have experience,  skills and savvy. And an explosive offense.  </P> <P> West Germany also might be the deepest team in the field. It's defense is  physical, often punishing. The West German defenders are decisive with their  tackles, strong in the air and quick to counterattack, and the attackers will  wear down defenses.  </P> <P> Up front, Voeller and Juergen Klinsmann, both with three goals, lead a  high-powered offense that has also seen midfielder Lothar Matthaeus score four  goals. The backfield, led by sweeper Klaus Augenthaler, Juergen Kohler and  Andreas Brehme, is also tough.  </P></p>

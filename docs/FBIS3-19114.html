			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gianluigi Da Roldt: "Maroni: It Is Our Job To </F> Lead the Government"]    [Text] London -- Roberto Maroni [Northern League lower  house floor leader] has no doubts, the Northern League alone  offers a true turn toward free trade in Italy. [Northern League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi's candidate for prime minister sought  to explain this to the City of London, to dozens of financiers  who handle multibillion lire deals and who want to know whether  Italy can be a "fertile ground" for investments and, in  particular, be politically stable.    Maroni, accompanied by Senator Giancarlo Pagliarini and  Lombard League Secretary Luigi Negri, did his best. He met  people from Morgan Grenfell, Mercury, Barclays de Zoete Wedd,  and Japanese Nomura, the world's largest investment company.  Bossi's lieutenant left the answers to the more technical  questions to Pagliarini, reserving for himself the description  of the political framework and stressing, on a couple of  occasions that "it is we who will be winning these elections."    The style of the League's visit to the city was purposely  one  of "understatement," low-keyed compared with [secretary of the  Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto's visit on 25  February: short, direct meetings at the offices of the  financial groups, a "cut and thrust" in English, in the first  person, by either Maroni or Pagliarini, very pragmatic. With a  pinch of venom at the end of the speech at Barclays, Maroni  commented: "We are not here for the elections. We were invited  and therefore we came to talk to investors and to financiers,  not to London School of Economics students."    But Roberto Maroni's interventions all started from the same  point: "We are the political force which in these years has  come into the limelight with an increase in votes which would  impress anybody." Someone in the know, as if living in Milan,  asked him about his relationships with ally [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi, about Fininvest's financial difficulties,  and whether the League intended to bring in a law on television  news.    Maroni took the question head-on. "I believe that after 28  March a leadership problem will present itself inside the  electoral coalition which we are a part of. The electors will  decide: We have the North, let us see what position Berlusconi  will take in the South." In substance, sharing Umberto Bossi's  line, Maroni gives the impression of distancing himself more  politely from Berlusconi: It is the League which should be at  the rudder of the change, it is the League's men who can ensure  political change in Italy.    On the issue of TV news, Maroni gave no joy to anyone hoping  for new polemics: "We have already spoken, also with  Berlusconi, on this topic. We are against monopolies, both  private and public, and will therefore be proposing a  broadcasting act, also an antitrust law covering other sectors  such as newspapers. In this way Berlusconi will be able to  prove that he is a great entrepreneur and not, as people say, a  favorite of [former Prime Minister] Craxi."    However, Bossi's lieutenant wanted to insist on the  political  stability which the "pole of freedoms" was offering. "We and  Forza Italia have a free trade program which is 95 percent  similar. Hence, if we win, Italy can make a fresh start. If the  `pole of the left' wins, on the other hand, the problems will  start all over again. They agree on almost nothing between  themselves." And what about the government? Could there be  switches in alliances? To which Maroni curtly replies: "If we  govern, we will do so only with our ally." Pagliarini, on the  other hand, spoke about the Italian public debt and the INPS'  [National Agency for Social Security] "black hole." It is the  problem of getting the economy running: "Even if we were to cut  public employees' salaries by 10 percent, we would not achieve  major results. The problem is one of increasing the domestic  product and promoting investment. Nor does raising taxes serve  anything, Italian companies are already under oppressive fiscal  pressure." For Pagliarini, the solution is to be found in  fiscal decentralization, in the reorganization of the state, in  a cultural jump toward free trade, and "direct responsibility  for expenditure and receipts," also in the South.</p>

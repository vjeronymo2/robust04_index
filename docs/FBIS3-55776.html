			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F> Shushkevich by Valyantsin Zhdanko; place and date not given:  "Belarus and Collective Security. Is the Scandal To Continue?"]    [Text] Belarus joining the CIS collective security  system. Currently, this issue, on which so many discussions were  held half a year ago, has quietly disappeared from the press,  and has almost been forgotten by the people.    However, over the upcoming weeks, this issue will  probably again become the number one topic in the legislature  and a reason behind the fierce battle for power.    In Ashgabat, a Belarusian delegation headed by Prime  Minister Vyacheslav Kebich participated in work on drafting  documents concerning collective security. There have been  reports that our CIS partners do not want to accept the  stipulations, on which Belarus insisted while signing the  agreement.    [Zhdanko] There have been contradictory rumors about  Belarus signing the agreement.    [Shushkevich] Belarus signed the agreement on joining the  CIS collective security system long ago. However, there are  still certain forces here which are ready to treat this issue  differently. It is interesting that our partners have far fewer  doubts. For example, in an interview with INTERFAX, Viktor  Samsonov, chief of the Headquarters for Coordinating Military  Cooperation of CIS countries, stated that Belarus joined the  system of collective security and fulfilled all procedures. In  the same INTERFAX bulletin, Mechyslav Hryb questioned this fact.  Since the honorable chairman of the Supreme Soviet committee  had such doubts, I have asked lawyers to further analyze the  issue. What is the result? As a matter of fact, there are no  doubts, however there is a question of terminology. The point  is that the Vienna convention provides for joining agreements by  signing them or by issuing a statement saying that they will be  ratified. The 10th paragraph of the agreement on collective  security says that one can join the agreement. It does not  provide for signing it.    [Zhdanko] Cannot one remove the ambiguity of this  situation?    [Shushkevich] On 31 December, I sent a letter to CIS  Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya. I informed him that I  legalized the agreement in the same way Azerbaijan and Georgia  did. However, since the Supreme Soviet requested that I not  join the agreement but sign it, I replied that, had I done so, I  would have actually confirmed our joining the agreement, and I  cited the Supreme Soviet resolution attaching stipulations to  it. The stipulations, as is known, prohibit the participation  of our troops in any actions abroad and activities of armed  forces of the countries that have signed the agreement on our  territories, without Supreme soviet permission. It was not only  this issue which forced me to write the letter. I was surprised  that Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich, the head of our delegation,  did not sign certain ordinary documents regarding collective CIS  security at the meeting in Ashgabat. These were a resolution on  further work on a draft protocol of the agreement on collective  security, the resolution "On Key Measures for Implementing the  Agreement on Collective Security," a protocol on terms and  procedures of joining the agreement, and a resolution on  appointing the secretary general of the Collective Security  Council. Had I been well and able to head the delegation, I  would have unconditionally signed the documents. I believe  that, having consulted the Supreme Soviet Presidium, I will  still have an opportunity to announce that we are ready to sign  the documents.    [Zhdanko] But, immediately after the Ashgabat  meeting, the prime minister explained why Belarus had been  forced to play an observer's role during debate on this issue.    [Shushkevich] I do not like when somebody tries to  complicate something simple. If the head of the delegation --  the prime minister -- had been convinced that I had not signed  the document, he could have demonstratively stated that he would  do it. He had the right to do so as the head of a delegation  appointed by the Supreme Soviet. But such a question did not  arise, since it would have been nonsense. Therefore, I believe  that this is just part of a campaign to prove that somebody does  not want to do anything against the interests of Belarus.    [Zhdanko] Assuming that the procedures for signing the  agreement were violated, is the Foreign Ministry responsible for  this?    [Shushkevich] In countries with statehood experience, their  official state structures establish appropriate procedures. If  the Foreign Ministry believes that I did not properly sign the  agreement, it is its responsibility to inform me about this and  indicate which procedures were not fulfilled. The Committee for  National Security could have done the same as well. But,  instead of doing this, they began ununderstandable hysteria. I  sent this letter to clarify the situation.    [Zhdanko] Is it possible that Belarus will join the  system of collective security, having stipulated certain terms  and its special status within this structure?    [Shushkevich] The stipulations adopted by the Supreme  Soviet, in my opinion, contradict, to a certain degree, the very  sense of the agreement... One must realize that our  stipulations can be approved only if this is agreed with all  countries which have signed the agreement without any  stipulations. I believe that our diplomats should handle this  issue. I have not seen any move by the Foreign Ministry and the  Cabinet of Ministers which would be aimed at implementing the  Supreme Soviet resolution. In a previous letter to leaders of  CIS countries and the latest one, I could not conceal the  stipulations -- I was obliged to reveal them. When will the  issue be finally solved? When the Supreme Soviet adopts a  resolution on ratification. If the stipulations are approved,  they should also be accepted by other countries. Should this  not occur, we should annul the stipulations. I believe that  preparing the agreement for ratification would be the best form  of work for today, as well as completing a thorough analysis of  the question of whether our joining can be accepted with such  stipulations.</p>

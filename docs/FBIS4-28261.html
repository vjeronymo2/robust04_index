			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Focus" by Takehiko Kajita: "Hata Under Constant No- </F> Confidence Threat From Here On"]    [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  is skating on thin ice as head of a precarious minority  government in the face of strident demands from a mighty  opposition camp for the mass resignation of the cabinet or a  snap general election.    With the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget passed  through the decisive House of Representatives on Wednesday, the  focus of attention has shifted to whether the Hata  administration can survive after the budget legislation becomes  law.    The once-dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has already  given public notice that it intends to file a no-confidence  motion against the Hata cabinet once the budget is enacted, in a  move to wrest back power after nearly a year in the opposition  bleachers.    "The continued existence of this cabinet is not beneficial  to  Japan," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori asserted Tuesday.  "It would result in a deepening of the current political chaos."    As the governing coalition lacks a majority in the 511-seat  lower house, it is within the LDP's power to topple the present  government in a no-confidence vote -- unless the second-largest  opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan],  moves to obstruct the effort.    The SDP, the largest force in the previous administration of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, walked out of the coalition in  April, leaving Hata with Japan's first minority government in 39  years and fanning speculation that his cabinet would collapse as  soon as the budget was adopted.    Even so, it is unclear whether the SDP will automatically  join forces with the LDP to bring down the six-week-old  government.    If a no-confidence motion is indeed rammed through the Diet,  Hata will be torn between two harsh choices -- resigning or  dissolving the lower house for a snap general poll.    A mass resignation of the cabinet would open the way for the  LDP's return to power, an idea the SDP can hardly feel  comfortable with.    As the main opposition party during the LDP's 38-year  unbroken rule that ended last August, the SDP well knows that  while it can work with the LDP to force Hata from office, it  cannot cooperate in governing due to wide policy differences.    On the other hand, if the premier were to call a general  election on his own initiative, a feud would be triggered within  the SDP over any concerted action with the LDP to overturn the  Hata administration.    Dozens of SDP lawmakers say that an election under the  current multiseat system would be tantamount to the demise of  political reform, as the Diet has already legislated a set of  electoral reform bills introducing a mixture of single-seat  voting districts and proportional representation for lower house  polls.    Masao Sakon, a reform-minded SDP rank-and-filer, warned that  he and others within the SDP may have to quit the party if the  leadership moves to cooperate with the LDP in defeating the Hata  government through a no-confidence vote.    "If such a situation arises, we may have to make a certain  decision," he said.    Nor is the LDP monolithic.    As the nation's years of efforts to achieve anticorruption  political reform will not be capped without the enactment of a  yet-to-be-formulated bill drawing a new electoral map,  pro-reformers within the LDP have also been against a general  election under the moribund old system.    "I think a no-confidence motion will ultimately not be  submitted," a senior coalition official said on condition of  anonymity.    Hata, a veteran politician and staunch advocate of political  reform, for his part has underscored the need to contest the  next lower house election under a revamped system that goes into  force only after the redistricting bill is acted upon.    The chief executive has so far shown no interest in SDP  Secretary General Wataru Kubo's proposal for quitting on a  voluntary basis after passage of the budget and before a  no-confidence vote so as to fashion a new coalition government,  possibly with the participation of the SDP.    "If the voluntary resignation proposal was offered with an  eye to returning to the coalition, the motive was impure," said  Yoshiaki Iisaka, professor of political science at Tokyo's  Gakushuin University.    It is almost impossible to make a fresh start even if the  SDP  returns to the coalition, because the party once opted to leave  the ruling alliance, Iisaka predicted.    In any case, it is certain that between now and the June 29  close of the current ordinary Diet session, Hata's fragile  administration will face intensifying attacks from the  opposition forces.    "This Diet session will wind up without an extension and the  current state of political flux will likely drag on until  September," said another senior coalition official who requested  he not be identified.</p>

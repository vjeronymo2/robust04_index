			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz blazes a trail in US - David Waller on the group's plans to obtain a listing on the NYSE OVER the past six weeks, Daimler-Benz and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have hammered out an agreement which is likely to have profound implications for some of the world's largest companies - and for the world's largest capital market. The agreement means that Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial company with sales approaching DM100bn (Dollars 61.4m) in 1992, will later this year become the first German company to obtain a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Hung Tran, head of DB Research, the research arm of Deutsche Bank, said: 'The move will give (Daimler) direct access to the world's biggest capital pool - helping them to diversify their sources of capital at a time of increasing global competition for capital.' Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director of Daimler-Benz, said yesterday that the the company decided to 'go it alone' towards the end of last year. The move, he said, was a recognition that the company's shareholder base must be reoriented to reflect the growing internationalisation of the group's business. 'We were on the way to becoming a global company and I began to realise that I might have been caught in an anachronistic way of thinking,' Mr Liener said yesterday. 'Just as English has become the language of international business, Anglo-Saxon accounting has become the accounting language worldwide. I thought it was foolish to go on trying to play Don Quixote tilting at windmills.' He says he met with flexibility on the side of the SEC. 'A similar process of rethinking was underway there, too. They were afraid that (without European companies) that the New York market would fall back from being the world leader and become provincial.' Although Daimler made the bulk of the concessions in its negotiations with the SEC, the US agency displayed some flexibility of its own. It did not insist that Daimler provide a full US-style accounting of its earnings for the three years prior to 1992. Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC chairman, said yesterday that the agency had agreed 'that it was not necessary for the company to incur inordinate costs to develop every detail of information with respect to prior years' financial statements' as normally required under US accounting procedures. Mr Liener argues that much of the accounting adjustment will be relatively painless. Group accounts - rather than those prepared by the German holding company and four main operating units - already comply to a large extent with US accounting rules. The DM4bn released from 'hidden reserves' will not affect the group accounts and 'will not be used to pay dividends'. More detail will have to be given more often, he says. Goodwill of DM4bn on acquisitions will have to be written off against the profit and loss account, but as the amortisation period is likely to be 40 years, the impact will not be drastic.

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Venezuelan judge orders 83 arrests A Venezuelan judge has issued 83 warrants against some of the country's most prominent businessmen in connection with the collapse of Venezuela's second largest bank, Banco Latino, in January. Criminal Court Judge Diamora Ramirez de Simancas ordered the arrests of two ex-presidents of Banco Latino, members of the board of directors and deputy directors, bank officers, and Mr Roger Urbina, the superintendent of banks, who was charged with concealment. Also charged was Mr Ricardo Cisneros, one of the wealthiest men in Latin America, whose family owns large industrial and commercial holdings in Venezuela and the US. Mr Cisneros was formerly a member of Latino's board, and the Cisneros group of companies reported that it owned 3.5 per cent of the bank's stock. Mr Cisneros and his brother, Gustavo, own the Organizacion Diego Cisneros in Venezuela as well as the Spalding, Evenflo and Pueblo Xtra supermarkets in the US. Mr Gustavo Cisneros has denied wrongdoing by him, his brother or his family companies in the Latino affair. The Cisneroses formerly owned Paternoster Square in London and the Galerias Preciados chain in Spain. Most of those involved are believed to have left the country, even though the authorities had issued international travel bans against members of Latino's board in January. The judge asked the government to initiate extradition proceedings against any of those charged who are found overseas. The warrants covered charges that included illegal appropriation, fraud, and falsification of financial statements. Arrest warrants were issued against two ex-presidents of Latino, Messrs Gustavo Gomez Lopez and Giacomo Leon, and a list of others that reads like a Who's Who of Venezuelan businessmen and investors. It is not clear how far the current legal actions will proceed.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOK RAPS IDEA THAT SMALL BUSINESS IS BEAUTIFUL;  </P> <P> COMPANIES: AUTHORS SAY LARGE FIRMS OFFER HIGHER WAGES, BETTER BENEFITS AND MORE  JOB SECURITY.  </P> <P> The 1980s venerated the small company as lean and mean -- the engine of the  economy and the backbone of the business world. Small business was seen as a  nest for creative, happy workers, a wellspring of new jobs and the birthplace  of innovation.  </P> <P> Here come the '90s. A new book due out in June bashes those notions and argues  that, rather than "small is beautiful," small is, on average, not very pretty  at all.  </P> <P> Large companies -- those with more than 500 employees -- offer higher wages,  better benefits and more job security, the authors say. Large and small  companies appear not to differ much in the amount of training they give their  employees, and job satisfaction apparently isn't dependent on company size.  </P> <P> And the notion that small firms create the jobs that fuel the economy is a  myth, the authors maintain.  </P> <P> James L. Medoff, a Harvard University economics professor and co-author of  "Employers Large and Small," to be published by Harvard University Press, said  the positive image of small companies comes from Americans' ingrained distrust  of any large organization.  </P> <P> "We are really a Populist society," Medoff said in an interview. "We have come  to believe that anything small is good."  </P> <P> But in business, he argued, the positive image of "small" has given the  small-business-owner lobby so much power that the small-business employee  suffers.  </P> <P> "There are two American work forces," he said. "One is the 50% of the labor  force that is employed by large companies. It is treated well, and the  government watches over it. The other (small-company employees) is not watched  over at all."  </P> <P> The aim of the book -- co-authored by Charles Brown of the University of  Michigan and James T. Hamilton, a Harvard teaching fellow -- is to present  evidence that public policy favors the large-company employee.  </P> <P> "Good policy should be impervious to size," Medoff said. "If unsafe working  conditions are no good, they're no good for everybody, and small companies  shouldn't be exempted."  </P> <P> One powerful illustration of the small-business punch was last fall's repeal of  Section 89, a part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 addressing company benefits.  Some businesses might have had taxes imposed on their benefits; businesses with  fewer than 20 employees would have been required to offer a health plan to all  workers.  </P> <P> Groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of  Independent Business banded together, pulled out all the stops and insisted on  unconditional victory on Capitol Hill. In the end, the benefits-tax law  remained unchanged.  </P> <P> The research of Medoff and his colleagues paints an unflattering picture of  small companies:  </P> <P> *Job creation: The oft-quoted statistic is that small business is responsible  for eight out of every 10 new jobs. Medoff looks at the creation rate of those  jobs as well as their duration. Small Business Administration data does indeed  show that small business was responsible for more than its share of current  jobs: 63.5% of the total in 1980-86 and 59.7% in 1976-82.  </P> <P> But the book argues that a more accurate way of looking at the numbers is to  look at industries: The jobs are actually coming from industries -- such as  consulting, financial services, real estate and health care -- that are  dominated by small companies.  </P> <P> Industries in which 60% or more of the workers are employed by small business  -- about half of private-sector employment -- accounted for 85% of the increase  in net employment in 1981-86, according to SBA figures.  </P> <P> In other words, when the economy grew, certain industries were stimulated, and  small businesses in those industries rode the wave of job growth.  </P> <P> Small-company jobs also are less likely to remain in the economy, Medoff said.  Employment in small firms that existed in 1981 declined by about 10% over the  next four years, while employment in large firms existing in 1981 remained  essentially unchanged.  </P> <P> Employment has shifted toward industries dominated by smaller firms. At the  same time, it has shifted away from small firms in those industries. So, Medoff  said, a policy favorable to small business is not necessarily going to generate  new jobs.  </P> <P> * Working conditions: Although confessing that solid data is hard to come by,  Medoff and his colleagues conclude there is a slight increase in pay associated  with working at a large location-"the exact opposite of what one would expect  if larger workplaces had inferior working conditions."  </P> <P> Citing length of time in a job as evidence of job satisfaction, Medoff said  Labor Department surveys show that those working for large companies are less  likely to change their employer. There also appears to be more internal job  movement among workers of large firms.  </P> <P> * Salary: Large employers offer much higher wages than smaller ones. The  average wage of workers in large firms was 35% higher than their counterparts  in small firms, according to 1983 Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.  </P> <P> Many explanations are possible for the existence of such a pay gap, Medoff  said. It could be because larger establishments require higher levels of skill  or training.  </P></p>

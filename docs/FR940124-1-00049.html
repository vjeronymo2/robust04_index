			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.25&blank;Additions to or Substantive Changes in Educational Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 496(a) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies that are reliable authorities as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. Section 496 does not specifically address the manner in which accrediting agencies evaluate either new programs begun by institutions after their last grant of accreditation or preaccreditation or programs that are substantially changed after the institution is accredited or preaccredited. However, the Secretary believes that an agency cannot be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution if the agency does not assess those new or substantively changed programs. Accordingly, in &sect;602.25 of the proposed regulations, the Secretary establishes the framework for a policy that accrediting agencies must have to address additions to and substantive changes in educational programs. Specifically, in &sect;602.25(a) the Secretary proposes that an accrediting agency may include within its previous grant of accreditation or preaccreditation an educational program that an institution initially offers or substantively changes after that grant of accreditation or preaccreditation only if the agency specifically evaluates and approves the program. The Secretary proposes this requirement based upon the past actions of some accrediting agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain accrediting agencies that accredit institutions offering specific prebaccalaureate vocational education programs have, on occasion, extended their accreditation to additional programs that these institutions offered after being accredited, without evaluating the quality of those additional programs, even though the additional programs were totally unrelated to the programs initially accredited. For example, an accrediting agency that accredited an institution that offered cosmetology courses extended its accreditation to additional programs that the institution subsequently offered in jet airplane mechanics and air conditioning and refrigeration without ever evaluating the quality of those additional programs. The Secretary believes that this practice violates the purpose of accreditation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, the Secretary believes that prior approval of programs is not necessary in all circumstances, a belief shared by negotiators, although no consensus was reached as to the circumstances. In &sect;602.25(b) the Secretary proposes an exception to this requirement if the institution notifies the accrediting agency of the new or substantially changed program before it is offered, and the new or substantially changed program does not provide prebaccalaureate vocational education. The Secretary proposes this exception because the Secretary believes that new bachelor and higher degree programs are thoroughly reviewed by a variety of entities before they may be offered. Most institutional accrediting agencies, for example, require institutions to have thorough internal reviews of all new degree programs by curriculum committees, governing boards, and other appropriate units within the institution and to obtain appropriate state authorization for those new degree programs before they are offered. However, even though an accrediting agency may not be required by these proposed regulations to evaluate a new or substantially changed program before it is offered under &sect;602.25(b), accrediting agencies are certainly free, and encouraged, to do so under their own policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary acknowledges that the task of deciding which programs should require preapproval by accrediting agencies is a difficult one and seeks suggestions from commenters. For commenters who suggest that preapproval be allowed for prebaccalaureate vocational education programs that are ``related'' to a previously accredited program, the Secretary requests specific suggestions on how to determine whether the new or substantially changed program is ``related'' to the other program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes that most accrediting agencies already have a definition of ``substantive change'' but observes that there is considerable variation among agencies as to what this term means. Most agencies' definitions generally include the following kinds of changes: a substantial change in the length of a program, its content, or both, as, for example, when a secretarial program increases from 1200 clock hours to 1600 clock hours to provide a 400-hour component in office automation; a change from a traditional 15-week semester format to an alternate weekend format; and a change from a certificate program to an associate degree program. The Secretary seeks to require preapproval for these and similar types of changes and proposes that an agency's definition of a substantive change in an educational program include, at a minimum, a substantial change in the number of clock or credit hours, the number of weeks, or the content of a program, a change in the type of program offered, a change in the credential awarded for completion of the program, and a change in the manner in which the institution measures the educational quantity of the program from clock hours to credit hours. The Secretary invites comments on this approach as well as suggestions for alternative approaches to defining which types of programs require preapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Secretary acknowledges that the proposed requirement for a substantive change policy may result in increased costs to agencies and, in turn, institutions. However, for the reasons noted above, the Secretary believes the benefits far outweigh the costs. The Secretary also wishes to note that there was general consensus among non-Federal negotiators about the appropriateness of including a substantive change requirement in the proposed regulations. However, not all of the negotiators agreed that the approach proposed by the Secretary was appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rafael Angel Calderon has received the  best evaluation in his entire term as president. The results of  the latest Multispecialty Development Counselors (CID/Gallup)  poll, which was conducted from 3 to 6 January 1994, indicate  that favorable opinions on his administration surpassed the  negative ones by 42 points.    Fifty-one percent of the 1,010 Costa Ricans polled by CID  evaluated Calderon's work favorably. Out of those 616, 35  percent said his work had been very good, and 65 percent said it  had been good. In addition, 37 percent maintained that his  government's work has been neither good nor bad; 9 percent had  an unfavorable opinion; and 3 percent did not reply.    Calderon started his government in 1990. The opinions  against him were two points higher than the favorable ones in  November of that year. He continued to fall in the ratings  until he got to minus 25 points in July 1991, which was his  lowest point. From then on the favorable opinions started to  increase, however, mainly because the period of economic reforms  "with a high social cost" ended and current Presidency Minister  Rolando Lacle--who is responsible for the official government  campaign called "Costa Rica excels" [Costa Rica se supera]--was  appointed. This perception of improvement is more frequent  among people with a higher education and those who are Social  Christian Unity Party followers and who intend to vote for  Miguel Angel Rodriguez.    It is evident that when the Calderon Fournier administration  ends the president will have the satisfaction of having obtained  the backing of most citizens, making him the president who has  received the second highest rating from Costa Ricans. In  increasing order, at the end of their presidential terms,  Rodrigo Carazo had a minus 65 points, Luis Alberto Monge had  plus 25, Rafael Angel Calderon plus 42 points, and Oscar Arias  plus 60 points, which is the highest score received by a  president.    As in Arias' case, a president's popularity or high scores  for a good administration are not decisive factors to win a  campaign, as, after Arias' term, his party's candidate, Carlos  Manuel Castillo, lost the elections.    There is a relation between the political party, the  president's opinion, and the way people perceive the country's  future, however. The polls show that the Social Christians as  well as citizens with a higher education are more optimistic  when appraising the perspectives for the next two years. This  indicates that the current government's work has given them  confidence for the future. In total, 28 percent of Costa Ricans  believe the future will be better, 29 percent that it will be  worse, 28 percent that it will be the same, and 15 percent did  not answer that question.    If two lines where drawn--one to measure pessimism and the  other optimism--we could see how, according to the CID/Gallup  studies, expectations have been decreasing constantly. In 1990,  negative expectations scored 65 percent, and this figure stands  at 29 percent. In contrast, the feeling that the country's  situation is going to improve has shown a sustained growth.  Only 6 percent of Costa Ricans thought this way 14 years ago,  and 28 percent do so now.    On this occasion, the poll asked what special benefit did  the  community, where the pollee lived, obtain from President  Calderon's government. In order of importance, the granting of  bonds, especially for housing, and the building and repair of  roads were the specific benefits the people mentioned more  often. Less frequently mentioned were the community centers and  homes developed by First Lady Gloria Bejarano. The latter was  the opinion of 35 percent of the people polled. In addition, 47  percent of the citizens believe the government has done nothing  for their community, and 18 percent had no opinion. The  unfavorable opinions prevailed among those who live in the  interior of the country and National Liberation Party followers.</p>

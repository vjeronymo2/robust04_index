			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Nervous over deficit and dissidence: Stephen Fidler and Ted Bardacke assess the devaluation yesterday of the Mexican currency In the end, something had to give in order to break Mexico's vicious economic circle. What gave was the exchange rate. The government of President Ernesto Zedillo, which took office on December 1, yesterday oversaw the first one-step devaluation of the Mexican peso since December 15, 1987. There is no guarantee, though, that the step, a surprise to many foreign investors, will take the economic pressure off Mr Zedillo's government. His conundrum was this: the exchange rate, used for six years as a tool to fight against inflation, had become increasingly overvalued. This contributed to a current account deficit that, this year, is expected to exceed Dollars 28bn (Pounds 17.9bn), 8 per cent of gross domestic product. To sustain the capital inflows to finance the deficit demanded higher and higher interest rates, which was slowing the economy. Worries about an economic slowdown made foreign investors even more wary about Mexican risk. Their concerns were heightened - intensifying capital flight - during the last couple of weeks as political tensions in the southern state of Chiapas mounted. Also, if the conflict in Chiapas were to become more intense, speculative pressure could have become overwhelming. The government may have judged it better to act now, than to move in panic later. The move yesterday formally lowered the floor of the peso by 15 per cent. The permitted daily slide remains unchanged, which suggests a further possible 4 per cent depreciation of the floor over a year. The peso fell close to its new floor yesterday,which, together with 10 per cent depreciation of the currency seen earlier in the year, means a peso fall this year of close to 25 per cent. However, government officials said, the peso was likely to revalue once Chiapas calmed down, which should be in a matter of weeks. 'We ran into a problem of expectations. If you look at the macro numbers, we are doing just fine. But, with Chiapas, there was a lot of pressure and there was no way to keep resisting it,' said one. Reactions yesterday were divided. Mr Rudiger Dornbusch, economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, who has long advocated a devaluation, said: 'For Mexico, this is sheer liberation. They have been living a big lie. With rising interest rates, rising non-performing loans at banks and a growing current account deficit, it could not go on.' But Mr Geoffrey Dennis at Bear Stearns, the New York brokerage which until Monday was advising clients that they should believe the government's stated no-devaluation policy, said that the move 'had created a major long-term problem of credibility for the Mexican government.' Investor reaction was seen as critical because Mexico's financing requirement will remain large next year. Devaluation should bring down the current account deficit by spurring exports, but it will not come down very quickly and could still be Dollars 25bn. Mr Dornbusch said that now was the time for 'smart money' to move into Mexico, with the currency at appropriate levels. But some stock market analysts said the devaluation would be successful only if seen as a unique event, rather than the first of a series. 'If confidence in the currency is restored, then interest rates ought to fall, investment will increase and economic growth be very strong next year,' said one analyst. 'But, if the markets don't react well, it could be the beginning of a long downward spiral.' If confidence is maintained, most economists said, short-term peso interest rates - which on Monday rose above 20 per cent - will fall. While the decline will be limited by expected further rises in US interest rates, it should benefit smaller companies which have been unable to borrow in dollars and whose growth has been particularly hurt by current policy. The main risk is inflation. Mexico is now considered unlikely to reach its target of 4 per cent annual inflation for 1995 - inflation this year is estimated at 6.9 per cent - which prospect is fuelling worries that the benefits of economic growth will be erased by spiraling prices. The key economic variable in the medium term will be the behaviour of wages. If the government succeeds in keeping down pay increases, the new strategy will be sustainable. If wages start to rise - and the agreement which the government secured with the trade unions and businesses early yesterday morning should help counteract this - the gain for Mexican competitiveness will be lost in higher prices. While sharp devaluations of European currencies in 1991-92 did not increase wage pressures, economists point out that it is hard to find as many beneficiaries from devaluation in Mexico's relatively closed economy (trade accounts for some 15 per cent of GDP) as in the more open European ones. Devaluation will be unpopular among the Mexican middle class, whose sense of well-being is tied more closely to the price of US imports than to interest rates. The immediate impact on big Mexican companies, most carrying a heavy load of dollar debts, is also likely to be negative. Companies such as Telmex, Cemex, Televisa, and Aeromexico were hit hard by exchange write-downs in the first quarter of 1994, when the peso fell by nearly 10 per cent. With the new devaluation before the end of the year, 1994 profits will take an even bigger hit. The Mexican stock market, however, generally reacted positively to the news yesterday. Prospects for lower interest rates, renewed confidence in the peso and faster growth should help the market, the analysts said. Even so, the currency move is an abrupt change of tack for Mr Zedillo, after pledging that he would continue the economic policies pursued by the administration of President Carlos Salinas, which ended only 20 days ago. Foreign investors, not to speak of many Mexicans, will be wondering how firm Mr Zedillo's other policy pledges are.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCOUNTER SERVICES  </P> <P> As the owner of a successful Help-U-Sell real estate office, I read with great  interest David W. Myer's (March 12) discount brokers article as well as the  response from several brokers in your "Letters" column (March 26).  </P> <P> The response of these brokers typifies the lack of research and naivete of some  so-called "full-service" competitors.  </P> <P> We are licensed brokers and members of the local Board of Realtors. We submit  (when it is in our seller's best interest) many of our listings to the Multiple  Listing Service, put our phone number on the yard sign and in newspaper  advertisements, screen the buyers, draw the real estate contract, cover all of  the legal requirements and usher the transaction through escrow just as does  the "full-service" brokerage. We are, in fact, a full-service brokerage.  </P> <P> Why don't we charge a 6% commission? Because we don't hire hundreds of  inexperienced licensees to knock on doors, cold call on the telephone, hand out  little trinkets and spend 80% of our time just looking for clients. And we do  not sell a "full-service package" unless the property and situation warrant it.  </P> <P> TIMOTHY E. McCAULEY  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Despite the fact that Hashim Badr-al-Din confessed,  in his statements to the police and in court, that he struck  al-Turabi, the final verdict was that he was innocent of the  three charges against him, which related to general assault,  assault with intent to cause bodily harm. Perhaps the factor  that did the most to turn the tide of the case in the suspect's  favor was the contradiction in witnesses' false testimony,  costing them the case.    The Canadian defense attorney, Gary Barnes, focused on an  attempt to demolish the statements of the prosecution witnesses,  chiefly the major prosecution witness Ahmad 'Uthman Makki, a  member of the NIF's leadership cadres, who was accompanying  al-Turabi when the assault occurred in Ottawa Airport. The  defense attorney succeeded in causing one of the Somali  prosecution witnesses, who had accompanied al-Turabi (as a  bodyguard, according to the defense attorney), to acknowledge  that his testimony before the court and in his statements to the  police had been false, and that another witness had dictated to  him what to say.    The defense attorney also tried to cast doubt on the  narrative of the chief prosecution witness about the way the  incident took place. He was thus trying to prove that the  witness had not actually seen the assault on al-Turabi, hence  his testimony did not reflect the whole picture of the assault.    It appears that the defense strategy and the contradiction  in  witness statements, together with the fact that al-Turabi did  not give statements to the police or the court because he did  not recall the details of the assault, combined in the end to  lead the jury to a verdict of not guilty on all counts for the  defendant.  <H5>  Selections from the Sessions </H5>   We now present some selections from one of the sessions  between the defendant's lawyer and the star witness, Ahmad  'Uthman Makki, in order to convey one aspect of the atmosphere  in the court and considerations of the case. The session began  with the following exchange between the defense attorney, Ms.  Morand, and the witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki:    [Morand] Mr. Makki, do I understand that the place of your  residence, and of your family, is Sudan?    [Makki] I live in Sudan, but my family lives in Chicago.    [Morand] I understand. You are also, sir, a religious  preacher at the present time.    [Makki] That is true.    [Morand] As I understand it, you engage in this preaching in  Sudan and abroad, in the United States.    [Makki] That is true.    [Morand] You were a member of the Sudanese parliament--in  what years?    [Makki] That is true.    [Morand] In what years?    [Makki] That was from 1986 until mid-1989.    [Morand] And at that time, you were also the editor in chief  of a periodical.    [Makki] Correct. It is a prominent newspaper in Sudan.    [Morand] Yes. What was the name of that newspaper?    [Makki] AL-RAYAH. The Banner. (He explains its meaning in  English.)    [Morand] When you got to the airport in Ottawa, what  happened, sir?    [Makki] We got to the airport at 1855 (on the evening of the  assault), or about five minutes before take-off. I was the first  one to go into the main terminal. We were heading toward the  escalator to go to the upper floor, to the gates.    When we had gone 10 steps into the building, I saw two  Sudanese individuals, one of them a very tall man--he was the  same person I had previously seen in front of the (Canadian)  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was shouting at us. I mean, he  was, that he said, as I recall, some words.    [Morand] What were those words?    [Makki] He said, "Stop. Where are you going?"    [Morand] What language was he speaking?    [Makki] Arabic.    [Morand] Yes. And who was he addressing when he said that?    [Makki] He was speaking to Dr. al-Turabi.    [Morand] When you heard these shouts, what did you do?    [Makki] I expected him to attack Dr. al-Turabi, because I  saw  him raise his right arm, trying to hit Dr. al-Turabi. So I tried  to prevent him by grabbing his arm. Then he hit me on my right  arm, I mean, my right eye, smashing my glasses. Then some blood  flowed from my eye or from my nose--that is recorded in the  hospital records. I fell to the ground, but I stood up  immediately in order to prevent any other attacks on Dr.  al-Turabi.    [Morand] Yes?    [Makki] At the same time, the other person who was with us,  Mr. Rashid (Muhammad Ibrahim Rashid--the Somali attendant) stood  in front, I mean, beside Dr. al-Turabi. He had a baggage trolley  to prevent (Badr-al-Din) from hitting Dr. al-Turabi, but I saw  him (Badr-al-Din) hitting Dr. al-Turabi on the head.    [The Court] You saw the accused hit al-Turabi on the head?    [Makki] Correct.    [The Court] With what?    [Makki] The palm of his right hand.    [Morand] What did al-Turabi do at that moment?    [Makki] Oh, he fell to the ground.    [Morand] Yes?    [Makki] Many--I mean, spurts of blood flowed out of his  mouth, from his nose, and he was sneering.    [Morand] He was doing what?    [Makki] Sneering.    [Morand] Sneering?    [Makki] Yes.    [Morand] Would you explain to the court what you mean by  this  word you used, "sneering."    [Makki] Yes, like this. (The witness makes a snoring sound.)    [Morand] Oh, you mean snoring.    [Makki] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.    [Morand] Thank you.    [Makki] Then blood came out of his mouth. Yes, it was  flowing.    [Morand] What did you do after that?    [Makki] I covered Dr. al-Turabi, because at that moment the  attacker had paused for a few seconds to see what Dr. al-Turabi  was doing. I was afraid that he would advance and attack him  again, so I covered Dr. al-Turabi myself, and after that I tried  to get the police.    [Morand] Sir, it is not clear to me what you mean. When you  say that you covered Dr. al-Turabi yourself, what did you do?  How did you cover him?    [Makki] I placed myself--    [Morand] Oh, you mean you placed your body...    [Makki] Like this. Yes, with my body. That's right.    [Morand] Thank you. You indicated that you called for the  police.    [Makki] Yes.    [Morand] Dr. al-Turabi was on the floor, and you indicated  to  the court that he was making a snoring sound, and that you saw  blood. What can you tell the judge about his (al-Turabi's)  consciousness or unconsciousness?    [Makki] He was unconscious. He was not conscious at all.    [Morand] As far as you know, where is Dr. al-Turabi now?    [Makki] In Khartoum.    [Morand] When was the last time you saw him?    [Makki] About two weeks ago.    [Morand] How was his general health two weeks ago?    [Makki] Better than it was a year ago, but he was still  ailing. He is still receiving some treatment.  <H5>  Heated Battle </H5>   When the prosecuting attorney had finished her questioning,  the defense attorney, Gary Barnes, began his cross-examination  of the witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki; this was the  cross-examination that turned at times into a heated battle of  words. Portions follow:    [Barnes] You came from Toronto (to Ottawa) with Dr.  al-Turabi, is that so?    [Makki] It is.    [Barnes] Right. Who traveled along with you from Toronto?  Was  there a large group with you, or was it just the two of you?    [Makki] From Toronto to Ottawa?    [Barnes] To Ottawa, yes.    [Makki] Mr. Sayyid Muzaffar. We were three.    [Barnes] Right. Were you traveling under your own names?    [Makki] For myself, yes.    [Barnes] But Dr. al-Turabi did not travel under his real  name.    [Makki] He did travel under his real name.    [Barnes] He traveled under his real name?    [Makki] Yes. His name is Hasan 'Abdallah al-Turabi. His  father was 'Abdallah. In Sudan, we use the father's name, and  that is why he traveled under the name Hasan 'Abdallah.    [Barnes] So his reservation for the flight was in that name?    [Makki] In the name 'Abdallah H.    [Barnes] Right. Did he ever use the name Loony?    [Makki] Loony?    [Barnes] Yes.    [Makki] Never. No.    [Barnes] He never used this name at all?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] Do you know any other person to use this name?    [Makki] Loony?    [Barnes] Yes.    [Makki] No. Never.    [Barnes] You changed your flight plans. You were supposed to  leave Ottawa at 1200.    [Makki] That is true.    [Barnes] You changed it to seven o'clock.    [Makki] That is true.    [Barnes] Only the people who were with you knew of this  change, because it was a last-minute decision.    [Makki] No. That (the change in plans) may have been half an  hour before.    [Barnes] Do you know who arranged the itinerary of your  visit  to Ottawa from Toronto? Did you arrange the flight?    [Makki] No, Mr. Muzaffar did that.    [Barnes] As far as you know, how many people knew of your  travel plans?    [Makki] I have no idea.    [Barnes] When did you find out for the first time that you  would come from Toronto to Ottawa with Dr. al-Turabi?    [Makki] Several days before our arrival in Ottawa, because I  had some contacts with Mr. Muzaffar regarding the itinerary here  in Chicago, I mean, in Ottawa, and also in Toronto.    [Barnes] There were some problems in Toronto because of  demonstrations, isn't that so?    [Makki] There was no big demonstration. About five or six  people waited in front of the hotel and chanted. So I can't say  there was any big demonstration, but to me it means that there  were persons who knew of our flight plans.    [Barnes] Had you traveled with Dr. al-Turabi prior to this?    [Makki] Yes, many times.    [Barnes] It is not unusual for there to be demonstrators in  the places that he visits, isn't that right?    [Makki] That was the first time we had had that experience.    [Barnes] Hadn't you ever seen a demonstration prior to that  in the places you visited with Dr. al-Turabi?    [Makki] Against Dr. al-Turabi?    [Barnes] Yes.    [Makki] No. Never.    [Barnes] No demonstration at all?    [Makki] Never.  <H5>  Witness Accused of Fleeing </H5>   Some of the long discussion between the defense attorney and  the witness revolved around the identity and nationality of  al-Turabi's companions, as well as their reasons for  accompanying al-Turabi, and whether some of them were personal  bodyguards. Then the questioning moved on to the manner in which  the assault occurred in the airport. There came a point where  Makki said that the accused, Hashim Badr-al-Din, tried to escape  from the airport after the assault. The defense attorney opposed  this story and the following discussion took place:    [Barnes] You say that he (Badr-al-Din) was trying to flee,  and that they caught him?    [Makki] Correct.    [Barnes] Were there many people at that time? I mean, other  people in the airport?    [Makki] Everyone was taken by surprise, I mean, by what had  happened.    [Barnes] I am telling you, sir, that he (Badr-al-Din) did  not  try to escape at all, and that as soon as the incident took  place, he stood where he was and stayed there, repeating  slogans; and that at no time did he try to flee.    [Makki] I have no knowledge of that.    [Barnes] But you told us a minute ago that he tried to flee.    [Makki] No, I said that he tried to flee, but you said that  he did not try to flee, and that he remained standing there. Is  that what you mean?    [Barnes] I am telling you, sir, that he retreated one step  and stood repeating slogans until the police arrived.    [Makki] No, sir. I will explain to you very clearly. First  of  all, after he struck Dr. al-Turabi, and then hit me, then he  fought with Ibrahim (the Somali attendant), Dr. al-Turabi was  lying on the ground while he (Badr-al-Din) stood for a few  minutes looking at al-Turabi to make sure that his mission was  accomplished. Dr. al-Turabi was bleeding, and I was shouting for  the police to come and help. At that time, (Badr-al-Din) was  convinced that Dr. al-Turabi was dead, then, as I recall, he  tried to flee.    [Barnes] So, sir, if other witnesses came and said that he  (Badr-al-Din) did not try to flee, and that he stayed put, they  would be wrong.    [Makki] I said that he was trying to leave the place after  hitting Dr. al-Turabi and hitting me.    [Barnes] Is it part of your job to protect Dr. al-Turabi?    [Makki] My job is not to protect him, but I am one of his  aides.    [Barnes] Are you one of his bodyguards?    [Makki] No, I am not a guard and never have been. I have  never received training to be a guard.    [Barnes] Did you go anywhere near the escalator (inside the  airport) during the fight?    [Makki] No. Never.    [Barnes] You never went anywhere near the escalator?    [Makki] Never. I stayed near him (al-Turabi).    [Barnes] I am telling you, sir, that this is exactly what  you  did after you were hit. You fled and hid behind the escalator.    [Makki] No, never. I did not say I fled, but when I stood  up,  I mean, after--I mean, after I got up from the ground. I said  that I tried to be a little far off from him (Badr-al-Din), to  protect Dr. al-Turabi. But I did not ever go near the escalator,  because the escalator was sort of far from where the incident  took place.    [Barnes] So you would be surprised to hear some witnesses  say  that you fled behind the escalator. You would not agree with  this, I suppose.    [Makki] Absolutely not.  <H5>  Nature of the Visit </H5>   The discussion moved on after that to other points relating  to Dr. al-Turabi and his current occupation in government, and  whether he enjoys wide influence in the present government.  Makki responded by saying that this was debatable. The defense  attorney came back to ask Makki whether he had ever seen  demonstrations against al-Turabi, and the following exchange  took place:    [Barnes] Were you with him (al-Turabi) in Britain?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] No?    [Makki] No, but I was with him in the United States.    [Barnes] You have previously said that there were no  demonstrations against him (al-Turabi), there was no person  shouting against him in the United States.    [Makki] No, according to my recollection. But I read in one  of the papers that there was a demonstration in Washington. In  Sudan, some people said that they demonstrated against him, but  you asked me about myself.    [Barnes] You have seen no demonstrations?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] Do you have any official position in the  government?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] When was the last time you worked in it officially?    [Makki] I have never held government office.    [Barnes] Thank you. What precisely is your occupation now?    [Makki] I am a religious preacher.    [Barnes] Right. And so you travel a great deal in this work?    [Makki] Yes, I usually go to give lectures and attend  conferences.    [Barnes] So it is your church, I mean your religious group,  that pays.    [Makki] It is not a church, but an Islamic group, the  Islamic  Call Organization.    [Barnes] Call, you said?    [Makki] Yes, in Khartoum.    [Barnes] Do you know of the Muslim Brotherhood?    [Makki] Yes.    [Barnes] Are you a member (of that group)?    [Makki] I was a member, but there were conflicts a  long time back.    [Barnes] When did you end your membership in this group?    [Makki] That might have been more than 15 years ago, maybe  12.    [Barnes] The group you are with now, is it an international  organization?    [Makki] I am not a member of any group.    [Barnes] Fine. You said the Islamic Call.    [Makki] No, it is not an international organization. Its  headquarters is in Khartoum, but it has activities in nearly all  African countries.    [Barnes] When you were a member of Parliament, what party  did  you belong to?    [Makki] The Islamic National Front.    [Barnes] Is it like the Muslim Brotherhood?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] You mentioned that you had never been employed by  the Sudanese Government.    [Makki] Correct.    [Barnes] But you know the ambassador.    [Makki] The ambassador where?    [Barnes] The Sudanese ambassador here in Ottawa.    [Makki] Oh, the charg&eacute; d'affaires.    [Barnes] Yes.    [Makki] Yes, I have been introduced to him.    [Barnes] Is he here today (in the courtroom)?    [Makki] Yes.    [Barnes] And you have doubtless discussed this case with  him.    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] When you come to Ottawa you stay with him.    [Makki] Yes, I usually do.    [Barnes] Why did you not contact him when you came here on  25  May?    [Makki] Because we had a meeting with the minister of  foreign  affairs, and he had nothing to do with this meeting, because we  were not on an official visit.    [Barnes] But you came here in order to speak about the  Canadian Government's policy on Sudan.    [Makki] The basic reason we came here was to open a dialogue  between our Islam, between our Islamic movement in general. We  did not come here to speak on behalf of the Sudanese Government  or Canadian-Sudanese relations. That is not our business.    [Barnes] But it was discussed during the meeting. They  discussed civil rights abuses in Sudan with you.    [Makki] They talked about Sudan, Algeria, Afghanistan, and  Lebanon, about the Islamic world in general.    [Barnes] Is that because Dr. al-Turabi is not only a  representative of Sudan, but also of the Islamic movement, which  is a global organization? It is not a matter relating to a  single country.    [Makki] I cannot say that he is a member of a specific  movement. He is a thinker and a prominent figure.  <H5>  Funding the Trip </H5>   [Barnes] Someone must have been paying your expenses, to  make  it possible for you to travel and hold meetings with the  government and so on. Someone must have purchased the tickets.  Who paid these costs?    [Makki] A friend of ours.    [Barnes] Only a friend who suddenly appeared to cover  everything?    [Makki] Correct.    [Barnes] The source of the funds was not an organization or  anything similar?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] The government did not pay any part of the costs?    [Makki] Absolutely not.    [Barnes] When you decided to come to Ottawa, why did you not  contact Sudanese individuals to coordinate between you and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs?    [Makki] Here in Ottawa? Because I met people. I met him (the  Sudanese charg&eacute; d'affairs) when we were university  students.  He knows me. Then I contacted him after the incident, and was  introduced to him. It is common for Sudanese to go and stay as  guests with a Sudanese official, even though there may be no  common denominator linking them to the government. It is an  extremely social practice.    [Barnes] So the charg&eacute; d'affaires is someone you've  known  since university days.    [Makki] I didn't know him well. I mean that it was not  really  a friendship. But I was president of the Union of Students at  the time, and he knew me. I mean that a lot of students knew me.    [Barnes] But when you came to Canada with Dr. al-Turabi you  did not contact him even though he was a person...    [Makki] No, no, I contacted him when I was in Toronto. I  mean, we had a telephone conversation when I was in New York,  only as a friend. Perhaps because he was very interested in Dr.  al-Turabi's visit, because he (al-Turabi) was deputy prime  minister or something like that. So he was interested in his  safety, and for that reason I phoned him and we talked.    [Barnes] You mentioned that you do not work in the  government  or anything like that, and that you avoided government contacts  and became a religious preacher. Is that correct? This is your  occupation now, and your work. I mean, your working as a  religious preacher.    [Makki] Yes. But I have not been a member of the government,  and did not leave government work prior to becoming a preacher.    [Barnes] Are you still a member of the Islamic National  Front  Party?    [Makki] No. It was dissolved (banned), and I did not...    [Barnes] It does not exist at all?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] When did it cease to exist?    [Makki] 1989.    [Barnes] Did you join any other party after that?    [Makki] No.    [Barnes] Thank you, sir. I have no further questions.</p>

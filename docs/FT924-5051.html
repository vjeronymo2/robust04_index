			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading HEAVY TRADING in derivatives markets played a leading role in driving the London stock market ahead yesterday, writes Terry Byland. Buyers flooded into stock index futures when Wall Street came back from Thanksgiving Day sending the December contract sharply higher. At best the December contract was at 2,793. By the close, the contract stood at 2,785, a premium of 30 against cash and about 20 on the fair value premium, which allows for dividend flows and carrying costs. There was heavy arbitraging between cash and futures. The contract traded 7,786 contracts. However, traders warned that some of the dealing reflected position closing and speculation ahead of the end of the equity trading account. In the new account which opens on Monday fair value premium will shrink to around 5 points. Turnover in traded options, however, slipped to 24,489 contracts from 25,759 on Thursday. United Biscuits was the top traded stock option with 2,185 contracts.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] With the exception of TONG-A ILBO, all  Seoul vernacular morning papers on 25 May merely provide  straight reports of North Korea's recent notification to the UN  Forces side that it was replacing its negotiating body to the  Military Armistice Commission [MAC] with a Panmunjom mission of  the Korean People's Army [KPA]. The moderate TONG-A ILBO  carries, on page 2, a 600-word article by reporter Pak Che-kyun  entitled "The Significance of North Korea's `establishment of a  Panmunjom Mission'."    Reporting on North Korea's notification, the article  comments  that "this attempt of North Korea aimed at incapacitating the  MAC, stems from its intent to topple the present Armistice  Agreement system. What is more, it is a product of its  hitherto-employed tactics to replace the Armistice Agreement  with a peace agreement."    Holding that the conclusion of a peace agreement with the  United States is an overriding goal of North Korea designed to  promote the relations with the United States while excluding  South Korea, the paper says "Regardless of the North's stance,  the ROK and U.S. Governments are assuming a stance that the  present Armistice Agreement should be adhered to. Hence,  chances are high that the two governments will again call on the  North to abide by the Armistice Agreement through a  government-level statement or a Panmunjom channel."    The article then predicts that "despite North Korea's  stubborn persistence on instituting the Panmunjom Mission," the  issue would not be a big problem for the MAC system because "the  function of the MAC itself was already paralyzed" ever since an  ROK general was appointed as a senior member of the UN Forces'  side to the MAC.    The article then concludes: "Accordingly, the ROK Government  is expected to cope with the issue by proclaiming its basic  stance to `convert from the present armistice state to a peace  state between the North and South' as stipulated in the  North-South Agreement."</p>

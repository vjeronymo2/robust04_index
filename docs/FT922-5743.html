			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Defiant Bond loses licence to indulge in overkill MR Alan Bond, the fallen idol of corporate Australia, managed a wry smile to his family before being taken off to the Perth police cells yesterday, convicted of corporate dishonesty and facing up to five years in prison. Mr Bond's apparent resilience did little to comfort his former wife Eileen and children John and Craig, who were clearly upset by a verdict they had feared but not expected. But it showed that, in Mr Bond's mind at least, the Alan Bond story may not yet be over, in spite of the double blow of bankruptcy and a criminal conviction within two months. Ironically, it was that kind of determination in the face of adversity which made Mr Bond the favourite son and most prominent citizen of the Western Australian city he made his corporate base for more than 30 years. Starting with a one-man painting company, Mr Bond built an international media, brewing and property business which made him the best known of Australia's entrepreneurs. At his peak, he won the 1983 America's Cup, was rich enough to shower presents worth millions of dollars a year on friends and family, and was lauded as 'a great Australian' by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister. Less than two years ago, he was still chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, a quoted flagship with assets of about ADollars 10bn (Pounds 4.1bn), and Dallhold Investments, a private company with extensive property holdings. Now Bond Corp is being restructured by its creditors, Dallhold is in receivership, and Mr Bond is bankrupt, with debts and contingent liabilities of more than ADollars 700m. The trigger for his downfall was an ill-advised attack on Lonrho, the British company managed by Mr Tiny Rowland, which convinced many of Bond Corp's bankers and creditors that the group was technically deficient. But the underlying cause was Mr Bond's failure to recognise that the 1987 stock market crash had ended the period in which entrepreneurs could bank on continually rising asset values to finance their borrowings. Mr Bond's influence on corporate Australia, and his confidence after the crash, were exemplified by the rescue of Mr Laurie Connell's Rothwells merchant bank, which provided the background for the events which led to the trial. Rothwells suffered a run on its deposits in the days after the crash, and would have been unable to continue in business without the rescue, in which Mr Connell contributed ADollars 70m, shareholders ADollars 150m, and the state government a further ADollars 150m by way of a guarantee against bank loans. Mr Connell told the court that the rescue could not have succeeded without the participation of Bond Corp, which helped to recruit support from prominent companies such as Mr John Elliott's Elders IXL (now Foster's Brewing), Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, and Mr Brian Yuill's Spedley group. Mr Bond said no one expected the rescue to fail. But Rothwells collapsed only a year later, setting off a series of inquiries into the way the rescue was handled, and the close links between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia. It was those inquiries which brought Mr Bond to court yesterday, charged with dishonestly concealing the existence of a ADollars 16m success fee from a businessman recruited to underwrite Rothwells' share issue. Mr Bond was the first important business figure to face trial over the Rothwells rescue, but he will not be the last. Another 19 people have been charged with more than 250 offences, including Mr Connell, who faces 78 charges. In addition, a royal commission into Western Australian business links with politicians is expected to report in October, and further inquiries are being carried out by the Australian Securities Commission, the federal corporate watchdog. Mr Bond will discover today whether he is to serve a prison sentence or pay a fine of up to ADollars 20,000, or both. Meanwhile, his trustee in bankruptcy is still trying to trace what happened to millions of dollars worth of personal assets in Australia, the UK and elsewhere.</p>

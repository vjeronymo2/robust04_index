			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Currency movements supply focus as trade slows FOREIGN exchange move-ments continued to provide a focus for activity in the bond markets, but the pace of activity slowed slightly as investors and dealers yesterday paused to examine the sharp recent movements in currency and bond rates, and in some cases decided to reassess recent shifts. GERMAN bond prices retraced some of the gains they made earlier in the week, but dealers said the declines appeared to represent a temporary correction rather than a shift in sentiment. Prices shed  3/8 -point after the latest provisional inflation data for February from several German regions showed less of a slowdown than dealers had hoped, prompting worries that any further cuts in interest rates could be delayed. THE JAPANESE market continued to forge ahead, buoyed by the strength of the yen. Comments by Mr Yosihiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, that another discount rate cut could not be ruled out helped spur enthusiasm for the market. The 10-year No 145 benchmark was yielding just 3.79 per cent when the Japanese market closed yesterday, down from 3.93 per cent at Tuesday's close. However, analysts warned that most of the good news was already in the market and foreign investors might start taking profits following the rally in both the Japanese bond and currency markets. For the moment, the market is being supported by Japanese domestic investors loath to buy Japanese equity or property. THE weakness of sterling yesterday undermined the gilts market, which had been in a fairly bullish mood. The March gilt futures contract at the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange ended at 103 1/16 , down from 103 25/32 at Tuesday's close. The Bank of England announced that it had finally finished selling two tranches of gilts totalling Pounds 1.35bn, announced on February 16. The slow sales of the issue did little to reassure traders. While the currency remains chronically weak, foreign investors are unlikely to help absorb future gilt issues. US TREASURY prices ended a five-day record-setting spree to move broadly lower yesterday afternoon as the market reacted to weak bidding at the Treasury's Dollars 11bn five-year note auction. In spite of a substantial drop in price, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond remained comfortably below the 7 per cent level through the day. In late trading, the long bond was off  27/32 at 102 15/16 , yielding 6.887 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/8 lower to yield 3.960 per cent. There was little reaction to news that durable goods orders fell 1.7 per cent in January, slightly less than the 2 per cent the market had expected. The Federal Reserve arranged Dollars 2.5bn in customer repurchase agreements when Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend to each other, were trading at 2 15/16 per cent. The open market intervention, which adds funds to the banking system, was expected to counter a seasonal drop in vault cash - cash held by banks to satisfy reserve requirements. There was no policy meaning associated with the action. The Fed's perceived target for the rate remains 3 per cent. Bond and note prices started to tumble after the afternoon auction, where the five-year note had a yield of 5.23 per cent, well above the widely-expected 5.16 per cent to 5.17 per cent level. ITALIAN bonds outperformed most other European markets, after a difficult couple of days, by staging a small rally when it emerged that the Christian Democrat party will back prime minister Giuliano Amato in Thursday's confidence vote.</p>

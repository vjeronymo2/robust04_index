			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SLATES REPRIMANDED FOR FUND-RAISER ROLE  </P> <P> In a terse and scolding letter to Planning Commissioner Roger Slates, Orange  County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder has requested that he submit a written  statement detailing his involvement in reportedly soliciting funds for an  Assembly candidate from developers who have projects pending before him.  </P> <P> The letter, released Thursday, recounts a telephone conversation that Wieder  had Sunday with Slates, whom she appointed to the Planning Commission last  year.  </P> <P> "I really gave him a tongue-lashing. The whole thing was stupid. . . ." Wieder  said in an interview. "I told him I wanted him to put everything he told me in  writing."  </P> <P> The Times reported last week that Slates helped host a dinner on behalf of 58th  Assembly District candidate Peter von Elten. The affair was held in a private  dining room at a Trabuco Canyon restaurant owned by Planning Commission  Chairman Stephen A. Nordeck. The article quoted several of those who attended  as saying that both commissioners urged guests -- including representatives of  some South County developers -- to contribute to von Elten's campaign.  </P> <P> State law prohibits members of appointed boards or commissions from soliciting  campaign contributions of $250 or more from individuals who have matters  pending before them.  </P> <P> Nordeck has strongly denied soliciting any funds or taking part in the dinner;  Slates has repeatedly declined to comment.  </P> <P> Wieder said she would not disclose what Slates told her about the evening until  he submits his written explanation. She said that in her 12 years as a  supervisor, however, this is the first time she has made such a request.  </P> <P> In her letter to Slates dated May 21, Wieder wrote: "Our discussion relative to  the evening at the Trabuco Oaks Restaurant held last Tuesday and your related  involvement was explained by you to me in detail.  </P> <P> "As I told you, it was totally inappropriate and poor judgment for you to have  been involved in such a political activity. As a county planning commissioner,  you hold a very sensitive and responsible public role that cannot be tarnished  in any way."  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said Thursday that he also has talked to Nordeck,  whom he appointed to the commission last year. He said that Nordeck's behavior  demonstrated a "lapse of judgment" that "should not have been allowed to  occur." Vasquez said he questioned Nordeck earlier this week about the dinner  and that Nordeck continued to deny involvement beyond being present on and off  throughout the evening in his capacity as owner of the restaurant.  </P> <P> Vasquez said, however, that since that conversation, additional questions about  Nordeck's involvement have been raised and that he plans to interview the  commissioner again. Vasquez declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> "I would say in my opinion there was a lapse of judgment," Vasquez said,  "because I feel it is very important to strive to preserve a level confidence  that is essential in public office."  </P> <P> Both commissioners are reportedly on vacation this week and could not be  reached for comment Thursday. ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR and GEORGE FRANK  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Virginijus Gaivenis: "The Lost Millions"] </F>   [Excerpts] Under the 18 May 1992 resolution of the  Government of the Republic of Lithuania, the former Supreme  Council Security Department received $870,000 to supply the  Volunteer National Defense Service with defense and  technological facilities not produced in Lithuania. After the  Prosecutor General's Office had expressed interest in the  utilization of this sum, officials from the State Inspection  Department carried out an inspection and submitted their  conclusions in late January. Thus, it turned out that the  government headed by G. Vagnorius had allocated $870,000 to the  Security Department, while the acquired special purpose  facilities (arms, ammunition, bulletproof jackets, and so on)  were worth only $393,705. Inspectors failed to establish where  the remaining $476,295 had gone, because they did not find any  documents in the former Security Department and banks justifying  the utilization of the residual sum.    The Lithuanian Bank Department of Hard Currency Operations  transferred the entire $870,000 to the account of the  London-based firm "Ligistics [as published] Development Inc" in  the Bank Hapoalim back on 26 May 1992. The current Lithuanian  Bank leadership also confirms this fact. However, none of the  leaders of this bank or the Security Department dared provide  information about the size of the remaining sum in the firm's  account, because the very contract for the purchase of all these  special facilities is missing. According to state inspectors,  the current government must establish the total of the unused  residue allocated to the Supreme Council Security Department and  retrieve it. This opinion is also shared by the Lithuanian  Prosecutor General's Office which sent a letter to the prime  minister immediately after receiving the conclusions of the  State Inspection Department, requesting him to render assistance  and authorize the Lithuanian Bank to examine the actual  situation. Recently, the Prosecutor General's Office received a  reply from Prime Minister A. Slezevicius which reads that  "executing the government decision of 3 February 1994, the  Lithuanian Bank reports that it failed to acquire any additional  information concerning the utilization of the $870,000 which the  Government of Lithuania allocated to the Supreme Council  Security Department and later transferred to the account of the  London-based firm "Ligistics Development Inc." in the Bank  Hapoalim, and the residue money. A. Slezevicius maintains that  due to the negligence of the requirements for accounts of  material assets, book-keeping, and balance accounts, the  Republic of Lithuania incurred a $476,295 loss. [passage  omitted]    Some sources maintain that A. Skucas, former chief of the  Supreme Council Security Department, recently paid a visit to  the Prosecutor General's Office and tried to persuade it that  the total of $870,000 had been spent to buy special facilities  in the United States. However, the U.S. State Department and  special services banned the shipment of arms to Lithuania  because the country allegedly did not want to impair its  relations with Russia....</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan's petrochemical  industry should do more to cut costs in order to maintain price  competitiveness against imports, a government advisory panel  said Wednesday [18 May].    Japanese petrochemical companies are performing well in  their  competition with foreign products with the import ratio staying  at a low 9.0 percent in fiscal 1993, the Petrochemical Supply  and Demand Coordination Council, an advisory body to the trade  minister, said in a report.    The council said this reflects better services provided by  the domestic industry in nonprice fronts, such as better quality  products, well-organized after-sales services and better  distribution-related services.    But it added maintenance of such services, often made at the  expense of a product price increase, has put a heavy financial  burden on Japanese petrochemical firms, making their business  operations less profitable.    In order to keep price competitiveness while providing the  same services, the industry needs to curtail costs in  production, sales, and research and development, the council  said.    The task, however, is impossible unless the Japanese  petrochemical industry goes through comprehensive structural  reforms, including formation of joint sales and manufacturing  companies and the industry's overall reorganization through  mergers and acquisitions, for efficient business operations, it  said.    The report calls for a drastic review of Japanese  petrochemical firms' export strategy in which they tend to offer  products at bargain prices abroad simply to maintain factory  utilization rates.</p>

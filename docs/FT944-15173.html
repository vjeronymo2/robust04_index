			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rise in oil prices sends Dow lower Wall Street Declines in government bond prices amid fresh concern about prospects for higher interest rates set the tone for a subdued session on US stock markets yesterday, with share prices ending with an easier tendency after lacklustre trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.39 at 3,917.54, but was well off its low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed 1.30 down at 467.66, while the American SE composite dipped 2.04 to 456.72 and the Nasdaq composite softened 0.97 to 764.81. Trading volume on the New York SE was 260m shares. After putting together a string of impressive gains over the past few trading days, analysts were expecting to see a pull-back in blue chip stocks some time this week. It came yesterday morning as falling bond prices gave investors an excuse to sell, or keep out of the market altogether. Bonds fell because of a rise in oil prices, which always rattles inflation-sensitive fixed-income investors, and because of a statement from Ms Susan Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor, that the US economy was 'surprisingly' strong. The comment suggested that the economy is still growing at a rate faster than the Fed expected, and led the bond market to conclude that another interest rate increase to slow economic growth would be announced by the Fed soon. The concerns were shared by stock market investors, who are equally troubled by the thought of another monetary policy tightening. There have been five interest rate increases already this year, and the markets fear that further rises could undermine not just economic growth, but also corporate earnings growth in the coming quarters. For now, however, companies continue to post impressive quarterly earnings. Yesterday, among stocks benefiting from better than expected profits were Merrill Lynch, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 35 1/4 , Sun Microsystems, Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 32 1/4 , Citicorp, Dollars 1 1/4 ahead at Dollars 44 1/8 , and Apple Computer, Dollars 1 1/2 firmer at Dollars 41 1/4 . Philip Morris's earnings also exceeded analysts' expectations, although not by much, and the 27 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 1.2bn failed to excite investors, who bid the company's stock down Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 in busy trading. Another stock that fell in spite of a strong third quarter was Sprint, which dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 even though the long-distance telephone group's earnings of 66 cents a share beat the consensus forecast of 63 cents. Polaroid shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 after announcing third-quarter earnings of 62 cents a share, up from 52 cents a year ago but well below most Wall Street forecasts. Drugs stocks were mixed. Merck, following modestly disappointing results, slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 . Pfizer rallied from early weakness to finish Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 72.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: OEM tumbles Pounds 57,000 into the red With the announcement of a Pounds 57,000 pre-tax loss for 1991, Office &amp; Electronic Machines has set out its plans for the future. Activities now comprise a small office furniture and office stationery business in Burgess Hill, Sussex, but this is too small to be viable. The directors feel the company needs to be much larger and expect that over the next few years it will evolve with a number of stakes in a wide variety of businesses, some listed, some not, in a number of industries. In the short term they believe that considerable opportunity exists for a well-financed investment in the property market. In the last few weeks they have entered into a joint venture to develop, on a forward funded basis, a series of industrial warehousing complexes. The company's 1991 loss compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 68,000 and was struck on total turnover of Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 12.6m). In continuing activities there was a deficit of Pounds 233,000, after an operating loss of Pounds 668,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.43m. Losses per share were 3.1p (earnings 6.3p). Again there is no final dividend, which makes the total for the year an unchanged 0.1p.</p>

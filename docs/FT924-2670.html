			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cruising into the lecture room 'You should be able to walk into a room, stand in front of a board of directors or a group of students and start making your presentation in 30 seconds,' says Jeremy Bent, marketing director of Daltek, which has launched a presentational tool called the Cruiser. It consists of a notebook computer with a detachable screen (or pallet), a 2m character expandable memory, and a detachable hard disc, writes Andrew Fisher. The Taiwanese-made product, in black and white (Pounds 2,395) or colour (Pounds 4,995), is aimed at making things easy for the non-technically minded who want to get their message across with a minimum of fuss and maximum effect. Its screen fits any overhead projector and no special lighting conditions are needed. Daltek Distribution: UK, 081 450 3488.</p>

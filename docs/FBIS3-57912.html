			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 5 (AFP) -- French President Francois  Mitterrand gave his approval for independence for the Bank of  France on Wednesday [5 January], four days after the date  initially planned and after having ensured a key role for one of  his followers, Michel Sapin.    Mitterrand signed a law creating a Monetary Policy Council  as  part of measures, required under the Maastricht Treaty for  European monetary union, giving the central bank independent  responsibility for the money supply, key interest rates, lending  arrangements and bank reserve requirements.    But the government is to be responsible for the overall  exchange rate framework and the franc's exchange rate.    Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said Wednesday  afternoon  that the Bank of France's independence would "at least equal  that of the Bundesbank," thanks to the powers granted to the new  council.    He said the law changing the central bank's status "is of  such nature as to create a stable environment, the best possible  one for carrying out monetary policy."    The council is composed of the governor, two vice governors,  and six members named on Wednesday.    One of those appointed was Michel Sapin, 41, who was finance  minister in the outgoing socialist government headed by the late  Pierre Beregovoy.    Sapin had held to Beregovoy's "franc fort" (strong franc,  with a pun on Frankfurt, Bundesbank headquarters) policy  throughout massive speculative runs against the franc in 1992,  and in 1993 during the dying months of the socialists' years in  government under their socialist president.    Officials at the presidential Elysee Palace said that  Mitterrand had told conservative RPR [Rally for the Republic]  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur that he would not sign the list  of members if Sapin were not appointed, for reasons of balance  and pluralism. He wanted a politician among the nine council  members.    The Prime Minister's Office agreed to this Tuesday evening,  the Elysee officials said.    Sapin announced that he was resigning as a member of the  executive committee of the Socialist Party with the full  agreement of party leader Michel Rocard. He said he remained a  party "member and a militant."    The governor of the bank, Jean Claude Trichet, was appointed  in September. The government renewed the mandates of the first  deputy governor, Denis Ferman, and of the second deputy, Herve  Hannoun, on Wednesday.    Trades unions and agriculture are not represented on the  Monetary Policy Committee.    Reliable sources said the president of the big FNSEA  [National Federation of Unions of Farm Operators] farmers'  union, Luc Guyau, had opposed appointment of the president of  the Brittany Ferries company, Alexis Gourvennec, and unconfirmed  reports said his name was withdrawn at the last moment to be  replaced by that of Denise Flouzat, 65, a university economics  professor.    In 1991 she was appointed president of an association,  "Demain la France" (Tomorrow France), which was created by  Charles Pasqua and Philippe Seguin -- two leading conservative  politicians who opposed the Maastricht Treaty.    Hannoun is seen as the second socialist on the committee  with  Sapin. He had been the head of Beregovoy's private office.    Another of those appointed was Michel Albert, aged 64, who  was named president of the state-owned AGF insurance company for  the third time in 1992. He is a convinced European and an  admirer of the German model of capitalism.    He helped draft the manifesto of the Radical Party in 1969,  has worked for the European Investment Bank, and was  Commissioner for the Plan from 1975 until 1981, when he was  appointed to the AGF.    Observers said that his departure from the company would  enable Balladur to replace him with someone to his liking to  handle company privatisation.    Another appointee was economics journalist and broadcaster  Jean Boissonnat, 64, a co-founder of EXPANSION business  magazine. Albert and Boissonnat, who are seen as Christian  Democrats, have written a book called "Crise, Krach, Boom".</p>

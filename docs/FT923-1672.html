			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Lord Hanson to put son on board HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is planning to promote Mr Robert Hanson, son of its chairman, Lord Hanson, on to its board as a director. The move is part of a number of proposed board changes to be announced by the end of the month. Mr Hanson, aged 31, who is currently an associate director, joined the group in 1990 from NM Rothschild, the investment bank which advises Hanson. He is expected to be appointed to the board along with Mr Graham Dransfield, aged 40, Hanson's senior solicitor, who joined the group in 1982. Mr Alan Hagdrup, aged 59, a director since 1974, is expected to step down from the board. One of Hanson's advisers yesterday confirmed the board changes. 'The decision to promote Mr Hanson has been taken by the senior directors of the group and not just by his father.' If appointed, Mr Hanson will be by far the youngest director. Mr John Raos, aged 42, who is chief operating officer of Hanson Industries, the US arm of Hanson, is the youngest member of the board. The board appointments still have to be ratified by the non-executive members. They are not expected to oppose the moves. The appointments will then go to shareholders for ratification. Mr Hanson has been part of the conglomerate's acquisition team reporting to the vice-chairmen, Mr Martin Taylor and Mr Derek Rosling.</p>

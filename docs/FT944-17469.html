			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BT firm ahead of figures A shift to perceived high quality defensive stocks continued yesterday, with BT once again high on the buying list of institutions seeking good yields and strong potential dividend growth against the market. BT shares settled 8 1/2 firmer at 372 1/2 p on relatively high turnover of 15m as more telecoms analysts appreciated the company's fundamental strengths, and following a series of meetings with the telecoms giant. Much of the buying interest was said to have emanated from the US. The company is scheduled to announce second-quarter figures on November 10, with analysts looking for pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 700m, a dividend increase of 6 per cent-plus and good news on inland call volumes.</p>

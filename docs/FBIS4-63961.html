According to the press center  of the Black Sea Fleet, the commanders of formations, groupings,  and units gathered today at the headquarters of the Black Sea  Fleet to sum up the results of winter training. It was noted at  a sitting of the military council that the fleet had  successfully carried out its tasks in the past six months and  was prepared to implement the programs of summer training.    The sitting of the military council devoted particular  attention to the problem of injuries of servicemen during  military training and operating the equipment.</p>

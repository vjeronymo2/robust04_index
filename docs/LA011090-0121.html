			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> BASTANCHURY ROAD GROUP SEEKS VOTE  </P> <P> Fullerton residents fighting to halt the planned widening of a one-mile stretch  of Bastanchury Road near their homes moved Tuesday to put the issue on the  ballot.  </P> <P> Mary B. Homme, president of the Save Our Bastanchury group, submitted a  proposed initiative to the city clerk's office.  </P> <P> If approved by voters, it would require city officials to make certain that  street improvements do not result in additional noise.  </P> <P> Under state election laws, the Fullerton city attorney has until Jan. 24 to  examine the petition and write a summary and title for it before the group can  begin gathering signatures.  </P> <P> Group members will begin circulating the petition around early February, Homme  said. For the initiative to qualify for the November ballot, 10% of the  registered voters in Fullerton, or about 6,000 people, must sign the petition  within six months.  </P> <P> The $3.7-million project would widen Bastanchury from four to six lanes from  Euclid Street to Harbor Boulevard. Last year, the City Council twice voted to  reaffirm its decision after Save Our Bastanchury members protested.  </P> <P> "They say (widening is) going to decrease (noise), but they're basing it on the  time same number of cars traveling (the wider road). My feeling is if you add  two lanes, you're going to increase traffic, and that's what increases noise,"  Homme said. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Israel denies continuing use of torture The Israeli Defence Force command last night 'unequivocally denied' a human rights organisation's allegations that security forces are continuing systematically to torture and abuse Palestinian detainees. In a 316-page report the well-respected New York-based Human Rights Watch, claims security forces are still using beatings, physical force, abusive body positioning, sensory deprivation and psychological pressure to obtain confessions. 'Any means of torture or violence against detainees is forbidden under Israeli law and any confession extracted against the free will of the detainee is inadmissible as evidence,' the IDF said. The report, released today, alleges the abuses have continued despite last September's Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. Of the 36 cases it has documented, 10 are said to have occurred since the peace agreement. 'The abuses are not isolated excesses but constitute a pattern that could persist only with the acquiescence of the government of Israel,' it says. Mr Uri Dromi, the government spokesman, said: 'Basically, we welcome this report because we think no country or organisation is above criticism. We always use these reports to check ourselves and see where if at all we were wrong, and how to improve our-selves and refrain from exceeding what the law allows.' Human Rights Watch claims Israeli interrogators use a 'systemised, co-ordinated and increasingly painful regime of physical constraints and psychological pressures' over days and weeks, 'in a manner calculated to inflict extreme pain and mental anguish without leaving lasting physical traces'. Human Rights Watch accuses Israeli doctors and medics of complicity in torture and ill-treatment of Palestinians during interrogation by security officers and soldiers. The report carries an interview with an Israeli sergeant who says he beat a blindfolded Palestinian suspect with a club. The sergeant claims he broke many bones and that other interrogators would sometimes pour a liquid like acid on suspects' wounds. Of the 36 ex-detainees interviewed, 42 per cent alleged they were beaten on the testicles; 94 per cent said they had been deprived of sleep for up to several days; 29 per cent said they had been deliberately placed in over-cooled rooms, and 59 per cent said they had been shackled to pipes or rings embedded in the wall. Israel admits certain practices, including hooding suspects with canvas bags, confining them to small chairs and using moderate physical pressure. But it says all these physical methods are highly regulated and do not add up to torture and ill-treatment.</p>

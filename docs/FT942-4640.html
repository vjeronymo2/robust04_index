			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Spain Voting Sunday. The main Spanish parties all favour closer European integration, with no clear division over European policies but with differences of emphasis. The governing Socialist party and conservative Popular party support economic and monetary union. Both want a stronger European parliament. Socialists put more emphasis on employment, the PP on control of public spending and deregulation. Both want farm policy better adapted to Spanish interests. The Communist-led United Left proposes a decentralised federal model for Europe, with the parliament exercising full legislative powers and control over the Commission. It also argues for agricultural reform. On EU foreign policy, both want more co-operation in the Mediterranean and with Latin America. LIKELY RESULT: Opinion polls give the Socialists only about 31 per cent of the vote, with the PP taking between 37 and 40 per cent. The United Left is predicted to show strong gains with up to 15 per cent of the vote.</p>

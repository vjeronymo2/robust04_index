Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JACKSON ON REDS DISABLED LIST  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Reds placed left-handed starter Danny Jackson on the 15-day  disabled list today, retroactive to Tuesday, because of recurring stiffness in  his left shoulder.  </P> <P> It is the second time in recent weeks that Jackson, 28, has been sidelined with  shoulder ailments. He is 4-2 with a 2.95 earned run average in 14 games this  season, 13 of them starts.  </P> <P> The Reds replaced Jackson on the roster by calling up left-hander Chris Hammond  from the Class AAA Nashville Sounds, where Hammond is 14-1 with a 2.17 ERA.

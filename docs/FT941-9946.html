			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mobile telephone business drives Ericsson profit rise Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, more than doubled profits in 1993 on the back of booming sales of mobile telephone equipment. The company's pre-tax result climbed to SKr3.1bn (Dollars 388m) from SKr1.3bn, as sales soared 34 per cent to SKr62.9bn. The dividend was raised by SKr1 to SKr4.50 per share as income per share rose to SKr10.30 from SKr3.20. In an upbeat statement about prospects, the group promised a further rise in earnings in 1994. 'Despite uncertainty in the international marketplace and intensified competition, I feel optimistic about our development,' said Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson president. The pre-tax result was struck after a SKr305m extraordinary goodwill write-off. This held back profits in the fourth quarter, when they only rose 5 per cent to SKr1.24bn from SKr1.18bn. Excluding currency movements, full-year sales were up 20 per cent on 1992. Orders also benefited from the weaker krona, rising 27 per cent to SKr67.6bn. The order intake has risen for nine consecutive quarters. Radio communications, which includes cellular operations, has overtaken public communications as Ericsson's largest business area. Sales there rose more than 70 per cent last year. Ericsson is the world leader in sales of mobile telephone systems, with a market share of more than 40 per cent for analog systems, and 50 per cent for GSM digital systems. Mobile phones will again be a key component to profits growth this year, with the public telecommunications side proving more sluggish. The group warned: 'There is substantial uncertainty in the international market for public telecommunications, which is characterised by lower investments and intensifying price competition particularly in the major industrialised countries.' It hopes to compensate for this by picking up orders in other markets, particularly Asia. Ms Angela Dean, telecoms analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, said: 'Ericsson's growth has to come on the mobile side and improved margins. In public telecommunications, the group will have to do the best to keep sales stable while controlling costs.'</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: NatPower goes to law over US deal National Power, the electricity company, has filed a law suit against Transco Energy of Houston, a gas trading company, in a dispute arising from a Dollars 150m (Pounds 97m) deal between the two companies last year. It says Transco 'materially mis-stated' the value of Tren-Fuels, a fuel services subsidiary of the Tevco power stations company bought by National Power in the deal. Tren-Fuels, was valued at Dollars 17m to Dollars 25m at the time of the purchase in June last year, according to the law suit. National Power said it invested another Dollars 6m in Tren-Fuels. But when it hired an investment banking company to sell the subsidiary, the highest offer was Pounds 1,000, according to the suit. Under the agreement, Transco is obliged to refund a portion of the Tevco purchase price if National Power sells Tren-Fuels for a loss within five years. National Power accuses Tren-Fuels of violating federal and state securities laws. It acknowledges in the suit that Transco has accused it of failing to expend enough effort in trying to sell Tren-Fuels. National Power said yesterday that it hoped to reach a settlement with Transco. It did not feel the dispute was material in the context of its US business.</p>

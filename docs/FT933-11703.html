			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Packaging industry given deadline for recycling waste THE packaging industry has been given until the end of the year to draw up plans for recycling between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of all packaging waste by the year 2000, the government said yesterday. The move would make a 'significant contribution' towards the government target of recycling a quarter of household waste by the end of the century, ministers said. The proposals drew a mixed response from industrialists and environmentalists in the wake of the recent crisis in the German recycling scheme. While German households have enthusiastically sorted rubbish, industry has been reluctant to use recycled material. The result has been mountains of unwanted waste plastic. Mr Cameron Mclatchie, chairman of British Polythene Industries, one of Europe's largest polythene film producers, said yesterday that the government's emphasis on recycling household waste was unrealistic. 'It does not make environmental or economic sense, although it is politically easy to tell people they should recycle. It's what they want to hear,' he added. 'We are not making a lot of money' recycling industrial plastic waste at the moment 'and we are not prepared to invest further until it becomes profitable'. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, criticised the lack of statutory targets in the measures. But Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said 'if the industries concerned cannot satisfy us by Christmas that they are committed to achieving the objectives . . . we will need to move towards a legislative approach'. Mr Gummer is inviting senior packaging industry figures to produce plans within five months for reaching the targets. He has stressed that he wants to avoid the 'alarming imbalance in some (European) schemes . . . between what is collected and the ability to reprocess it'. Some industrialists and consultants questioned whether recycling might be environmentally damaging due to the extra transport and energy costs involved. Ms Jane Bickerstaffe, technical director of Incpen, the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, said: 'The logistics of collecting waste into usable quantities are quite horrific.'

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool There are no wool sales in the primary markets this month and prices are nominally static. However, currency fluctuations affecting the US dollar and the closely related Australian dollar have lately tended to cause price reductions in Europe. Sterling's recent softness within Europe itself may have been a factor causing a minor revival in business in tops and yarn in the past couple of weeks, but this is not widespread nor has it been experienced by major market sectors. A feature of the limited market recovery for wool in the past eighteen months has been its concentration in the knitting rather than the woven sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondent Vladimir Dmitriyev for TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- An aide of Chechen President  Dzhokhar Dudayev was wounded in a gangland shootout and placed  into the central hospital in Groznyy, CRIME-PRESS learned on  Monday from Chechen opposition members from the Nadterek region  of the southern republic who are currently staying in Moscow.    The sources added that R. Labazanov, who is Dudayev's aide  on  most important issues and a close friend of the rebel president,  is being guarded by over 200 armed people.    According to the sources, Labazanov is heading a gang of 500  gunmen whose major business is kidnapping of girls who are then  sold as prostitutes to Central Asia, the Middle East or northern  Africa. The girls are reportedly smuggled out via Georgia and  Azerbaijan.    The sources said that the Labazanov's gang is especially  active in the Nadterek region which is known for its resolute  opposition to Dudayev. They try to intimidate the people by  violence, robberies and murders and thus establish control over  the region, they added.</p>

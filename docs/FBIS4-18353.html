			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described  as unfortunate, unsubstantiated, and a very bad example of  journalism yesterday's THE WASHINGTON POST report in which,  among other things, journalist (Dean Falkland) referred to an  excessive massing of Greek troops on the border with Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM].    Mr. Venizelos stressed that he was struck by the lack of  historical basis in the text and how far away it was from the  actual facts. It is obvious to everyone who has an elementary  knowledge of the area and its history, Mr. Venizelos noted, that  Greece is the basic guarantor of security, stability, and  normalcy in the southern Balkans. It is well known, the  government spokesman added, that Greece is the most friendly  state toward Skopje; this is proven by our proposals submitted  to Cyrus Vance on finding a solution to the problem.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Technology: Electronic voting out for the count - Technically Speaking WHEN British voters enter the polling booths on Thursday the closest they are likely to come to high technology is a pencil sharpener. Television may dominate the hustings, but electronics so far has no place in the polling station or at the election count. For 120 years, since the 1872 Ballot Act, voters in UK general elections have cast votes in the same time-honoured way - by placing a pencil-mark cross in a box on a ballot form next to the candidate of their choice and then posting the slip through a slot in the top of a metal box. At the end of polling day the ballot boxes are collected. In town halls and public buildings all over Britain returning officers supervise the teams of office workers who manually sort and count the votes for each candidate. With a bit of luck the result will be announced in most constituencies sometime around midnight. Generally the system works reasonably well, if a little slowly. But in many other parts of Europe - Germany, Portugal, Spain and Denmark, for example - as well as North America, the system has been replaced in part, or totally, by mechanical or electronic systems. Should the UK modernise its system? Some parliamentarians think so. Earlier this year the Commons Home Affairs Committee published a report which suggested that a US-made automatic vote counter manufactured by American Information Systems (AIS) should be tested in a parliamentary by-election. The AIS machines are based on high-speed optical character readers (OCRs). Voters mark a specially printed ballot form by filling in an oval or a cross. The form is then placed in a ballot box and fed into the OCR after the poll has closed. In one process the machine can count and tabulate the number of ballot papers in each box, the number of votes for each candidate and the total votes cast. Ballot papers with incorrect marks are fed automatically into a separate hopper for adjudication. The machines are capable of reading 400 ballot papers a minute and cost about Pounds 10,000 each. Based on the British general election in 1987 when an average of 50,000 votes were cast in each constituency, one machine per constituency would take about two hours to count the result, excluding verification which takes about an hour and a half. This is about the same length of time as a manual count, so to achieve real time savings it would be necessary to use two or more machines per constituency. OCR counters come into their own, however, when there are a large number of candidates for different posts - in some American elections voters use the same ballot form to vote for everyone from the town dog catcher to the President. In the UK similar OCR systems are used by the Electoral Reform Society to count votes in complex trade union and other elections. The machines used by the society can count about 5,000 ballot papers an hour and, according to the society, are accurate and reliable. This combination of speed and accuracy is a powerful selling point for OCR vote counters, especially in elections such as the current British one where victory margins could be extremely slim and lengthy recounts look likely. There is also a good case for automating vote-counting when more than one post is up for election, or when local, national and European elections coincide, as is increasingly likely to happen in the future. The UK Commons committee acknowledged that eventually it might make sense to move to a fully electronic voting system - with electors pressing buttons or touching a computer screen to make their choices. Britain's electoral system may change in the next few years - with or without the possible introduction of proportional representation. This, plus the availability of the technology, should make electronic voting irresistible.</p>

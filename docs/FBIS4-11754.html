			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chief adviser to the </F> Palestinian negotiating team, by Fadi Isma'il on 31 March; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Husayni] First of all, I believe that if the  measures that are taken do not include the evacuation of the  settlers from Hebron they will not lead to a solution to this  problem and the fuse will continue burning with the possibility  of a real eruption. Hence, I believe that none of these  measures will lead to a solution as long as the settlers stay in  the heart of Hebron.    [Isma'il] There were some reports today that the Palestinian  police will start to arrive in Gaza and Jericho early next week,  before the anticipated Israeli withdrawal. Does this mean that  agreement on the details of self-government is only a matter of  time?    [Al-Husayni] If by the arrival of the Palestinian police you  mean the arrival of some administrators to prepare for the  arrival of the Palestinian police and if this is done before the  complete Israeli withdrawal, then this might be reasonable. But  if Palestinian policemen enter areas that are still under  Israeli control, I believe it will not have positive results.  What is needed is to have the Palestinian police enter the  areas from which the Israeli forces withdraw and exercise full  authority there. Otherwise, there will be new eruptions.</p>

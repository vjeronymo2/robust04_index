			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Doubts mar launch of Japanese securities watchdog THE Tokyo stock market's first official securities watchdog began work yesterday, amid doubts that it would succeed in restoring investor confidence in the market. Mr Toshihiro Mizuhara, chairman of Japan's version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said the body's mission was to create a market that can deserve the trust of investors. But market participants remain sceptical of the commission's effectiveness because of its closeness to the finance ministry - which appoints its members - and its small staff. The commission has around 200 members compared with the 2,900 at the SEC. Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, chief researcher at Japan Securities Research Institute, said the new commission lacked resources and independence, and would have to rely on the ministry for its operations. The ministry yesterday said it would reduce the number of official notices and oral guidance of its securities bureau to make its administration more transparent. The move follows criticism that the ministry's securities administration, based on unclear oral guidance, had been one of the causes behind last year's securities scandals.</p>

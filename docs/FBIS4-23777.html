			<p>BFN     [Text] Eight public enterprises, including Transnet  [Transportation Network] and Eskom [Electricity Supply  Commission] have been identified as likely to play a key role in  rebuilding and revitalizing the economy. The enterprises are  said to be substantial earners of vital foreign exchange.  Zinhle Fithane reports.    [Begin recording] [Fithane] Addressing a media conference at  the Union Buildings in Pretoria today, Public Enterprise  Minister Princess Stella Sicgau said Eskom's primary role was to  provide electricity in the rural areas. Eskom has already  incorporated all the electricity facilities previously run by  the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and  are confident that they will have the ball rolling by the end of  the year.    [Eskom spokesman Bongani Khumalo] We are rolling. We are  rolling now, and by the end of this year we will be fully in  motion. We are talking to people in the past TBVC countries with  a view to eventually taking over the supply of electricity. We  are looking at the best options possible and we would like to  see people in those areas electrified. You will be mindful of  the fact that those people are mostly in the areas that could be  classified as rural areas and this is a priority, as it is the  priority of the new government -- that we should electrify those  people.    [Fithane] Meanwhile, Public Works Minister Mr. Jeff Radebe  has given a progress report on the implementation of a public  works program.    [Radebe] The responsibility now rests on the government to  ensure that the broad parameters and the contents of this  important piece of work by the National Economic Forum is  actually adopted by the government with the specific purpose of  implementing it so that we start the process of solving the  unemployment problem in our country.    [Fithane] In a lengthy report, the minister outlined the  National Economic Forum's three-phase plan for a public works  program. The three phases indicate how the program will be set  up, but it will be at least another year before the program  actually begins to create jobs. [end recording]</p>

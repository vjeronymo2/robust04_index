Security Council.    Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, meeting his Japanese  counterpart Tsutomu Hata in the U.S. capital Saturday, widely  discussed Seoul-Washington-Tokyo front on the North Korean  nuclear problem and reached such agreement, Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said here.    Hata, in a clear show of change in past lukewarm position,  expressed Tokyo's full support for economic sanctions against  North Korea if necessary, Chang said.    Han explained that Seoul and Washington agreed to try  dialogue to solve the North Korean nuclear problem to the last  moment during his visit here and asked for Tokyo's cooperation.    Hata, expressing sympathy to diplomatic efforts, added that  should the United States enter into sanctions against North  Korea, Japan would cooperate under the boundaries of its law.    The Han-Hata meeting confirmed Seoul-Washington-Tokyo's  comprehensive agreement and cooperation on North Korean nuclear  issue, Chang said.</p>

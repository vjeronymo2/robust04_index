			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 10: Pakistan had withdrawn  voluntarily and unconditionally on Wednesday its  loudly-publicised draft resolution it moved on February 25 at  the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) at Geneva on  alleged violation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir.    This is nothing new for Pakistan. This is the third time in  a  series when Pakistan repeated the performance. For the first  time it moved such a draft resolution at the UNHRC session in  Geneva last year and for the second time at the 48th session of  the UN General Assembly in 1993. Despite much propaganda and all  the fanfare that followed, it refrained from tabling such a  draft. On all these occasions it failed to mobilise necessary  support.    India hopes that these failures would induce Pakistan to  look  at all outstanding Indo-Pakistani bilateral issues, including  the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in a constructive way and agree  to start talks with India with a view to settling the issues  bilaterally.    This hope was expressed by the new Foreign Secretary, Mr.  Krishnan Srinivasan, at his first-ever press conference here on  Thursday that lasted for about 30 minutes.    Mr. Srinivasan also hoped that Pakistan's response to the  six  non-papers India gave to Pakistan and the Indian response to  Pakistan's two non-papers would be constructive and soon the  Foreign Secretary-level dialogue would resume.    Giving the details of what happened in Geneva on Wednesday,  the Foreign Secretary stated that the Iranian resolution, which  facilitated the Pakistani withdrawal, was unilateral.    Claiming that India was always confident of winning the  vote,  Mr. Srinivasan stated "we wanted the vote to be held at the  earliest" as we were confident a majority of those voting would  go against Islamabad.    He said the withdrawn resolution stood automatically lapsed  and Pakistan would have to start de novo at the next  session of the UNHRC. This was confirmed by the United Nations  secretariat as there was confusion whether the resolution was  deferred till the next session.    Mr. Srinivasan said although Pakistan had announced its  intention a day earlier to amend the resolution by dropping the  reference to sending a fact-finding mission to Kashmir, it  remained in its original form till the last moment. The dilution  of the resolution was intended to gain the support of more  countries as a majority of them did not want to get involved in  a territorial issue. Also, the resolution had not mentioned the  country to which the fact-finding mission would go.    Before the resolution was withdrawn, Iran made a statement  that India had agreed to facilitate the visit of a group of  Ambassadors of Islamic countries to visit Kashmir.    Besides Iran, 15 countries, including China, Syria,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Tunisia, Libya, Nigeria, Brazil and  Australia, asked Pakistan to withdraw the resolution.    He denied that there was any linkage between the Pakistani  withdrawal and the Iranian suggestion for team of Organisation  of Islamic (OIC) countries Ambassadors' visiting Jammu and  Kashmir. The Iranian suggestion was not binding on India.    But any Ambassador stationed in India, excepting those of  Pakistan and Libya, could visit any part of India, including  Jammu and Kashmir, and report to his government as fact-finding  was the normal duty of an Ambassador, the Foreign Secretary  asserted. "They are most welcome to do that," he added.    Mr. Srinivasan pointed out that Ambassadors of 10 countries,  including four Islamic nations, were already in Kashmir Valley  to see things for themselves. One of the Islamic nations was  Senegal, the present chairman of the OIC. Three others,  including Iran, were to join them but could not do so due to  preoccupation. There was no restrictions. India was prepared to  extend whatever help these Ambassadors require, he added.    Mr. Srinivasan said that there was no scope for Iran or any  other country on to mediate the Kashmir issue.    Referring to Iran's statement at Geneva on Wednesday that it  would continue to work towards resolving the Kashmir issue, Mr.  Srinivasan made it clear that India was neither bound by it nor  did it constitute mediation. India had not made any compromises  on the issue, he stated emphatically.    He added that Iran had made the statement on its own  initiative and New Delhi would welcome it if Teheran succeeded  in persuading Islamabad to create a climate for a constructive  dialogue between India and Pakistan.    The Foreign Secretary lauded the role of Iran and China in  persuading Pakistan to withdraw the resolution unconditionally.    Mr. Srinivasan said Pakistan, despite making at a prestige  issue, had to withdraw the resolution unilaterally because of  lack of support. The Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, had  telephonic talks with many heads of government and State to  enlist support for her country's resolution.    The Pakistan government even deputed senior ministers and  officials to various countries for this purpose.    He said the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit  to  Germany and the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh's  meeting with the European troika and French leaders helped to  place the Indian viewpoint more clearly and lucidly. These  interactions proved vital for support to the Indian stand.    He said India had been able to convey the cause of human  rights violation in the State and Pakistan's attempt to  internationalise the issue in violation of the Shimla agreement.  He said there was a great transparency in "our policy towards  Kashmir."</p>

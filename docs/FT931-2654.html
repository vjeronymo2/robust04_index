			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil acts on Budget proposal as profits leap RENTOKIL Group, the environmental and property services concern, yesterday became the first company to recommend an increased dividend to compensate for changes in the rate of advance corporation tax announced in Tuesday's budget. The company is recommending a 36.5 per cent net dividend increase so its gross dividend is lifted in line with earnings, by nearly 30 per cent. Rentokil said it did not want shareholders receiving gross dividends or paying higher rate income tax to lose out because of the changes. 'We wanted to put shareholders in the same position they would have been if the Chancellor had not changed (the rules),' according to Mr Christopher Pearce, group financial director. Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive, said the increase aimed to compensate pension fund shareholders rather than Sophus Berendsen of Denmark, Rentokil's parent company, which was also affected by the ACT changes. Rentokil said pre-tax profits increased 29 per cent, from Pounds 94.6m to Pounds 122.4m, in the year to December 31 helped by growth in continental Europe and by currency factors. At the interim stage, profits increased 21 per cent to Pounds 51.1m. Operating profits increased 27 per cent to Pounds 117.7m. Because the company uses year end rather than average exchange rates, there was an Pounds 8.8m exchange rate gain following sterling's fall in value in the last quarter. Interest income increased from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 4.65m as the company's net cash position more than doubled to Pounds 60.2m. There was an extraordinary cost of Pounds 7.64m to complete work recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency at a wood treatment site in Virginia. The total cost of cleaning up the site has now risen to about Dollars 22m (Pounds 15.4m). No further provisions are expected. Earnings increased 28 per cent to 8.018p. A final dividend of 1.67p is proposed, to make a total of 2.31p (1.692p) for the year. COMMENT If one wanted to be nasty, one could argue Rentokil's pledge of 20 per cent growth 'forever' was met last year through default rather than design. Without sterling's exit from the ERM and the decision not to adopt FRS 3, which would have turned the extraordinary into an exceptional, profits would have been only 12 per cent ahead. However, that 'only' is still impressive given a downturn in the UK which showed the company is not recession proof. The real question is how long Rentokil deserves its heady premium. Forecast profits of Pounds 146m this year put the shares on more than 23 times. The company and its stock market supporters believe 20 per cent growth will be easy this year and there is still much scope for expansion in Europe and the Far East. Even so, following their giddy rise since last September the shares look in need of a breather, notwithstanding yesterday's 6p fall to 244p.</p>

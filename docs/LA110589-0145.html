			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRISH NOTCH 21ST WIN IN A ROW;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME: SCHOOL RECORD FOR CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES IS TIED IN 41-0 ROUT OF  OUTMANNED NAVY.  </P> <P> How does a team win 21 consecutive games? Talent, lots of it. Just ask Navy  Coach Elliott Uzelac.  </P> <P> "It was pretty obvious Notre Dame had too many horses for us," Uzelac said  after his Midshipmen lost to top-ranked Notre Dame, 41-0, Saturday.  </P> <P> "I don't think we played that poorly, but at times they made us look poorly."  </P> <P> Navy (2-6) remains winless against Notre Dame (9-0) since 1963.  </P> <P> The 21 consecutive victories ties the school record set by teams coached by  Frank Leahy, 1946-48, beginning with Army and ending with a tie against USC.  </P> <P> "I didn't even mention it in the locker room after the game," Notre Dame Coach  Lou Holtz said.  </P> <P> The Irish, whose last loss was to Texas A&amp;M on Jan. 1, 1988, figures to  easily set a school record of 22 consecutive victories next Saturday they play  host to Southern Methodist, a struggling team that resumed football this season  after a two-year suspension from the NCAA.  </P> <P> "If we want to hold the score down, we'll pass on every down," Holtz said.  </P> <P> Against Navy, quarterback Tony Rice completed only one of eight passes for 28  yards with two interceptions.  </P> <P> But Rice led a rushing attack that gained 414 yards. Ricky Watters rushed for  134 yards and one touchdown, becoming the first Irish player this season to  rush for more than 100 yards.  </P> <P> Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, Notre Dame's speedy flanker and return specialist,  suffered a groin injury in the first half and did not return.  </P> <P> The shutout was Holtz's first in his four seasons as coach. The last one for  the Irish was a 42-0 victory over Army on Oct. 15, 1983.  </P> <P> Rice ran six yards for a touchdown 1:15 into the game and Rod Culver ran 11  yards for a touchdown on the Irish's next possession.  </P> <P> Navy's David Lerch interrupted the next Irish drive by intercepting a pass by  Rice, but the Middies' Alton Grizzard was sacked for a 14-yard loss on third  down and Watters rushed for a 48-yard touchdown on the next possession for a  21-0 lead.  </P> <P> Billy Hackett's 27-yard field goal made it 24-0 at halftime, and he kicked a  39-yarder on Notre Dame's first drive of the second half.  </P> <P> Navy advanced to the Notre Dame 34 in the third quarter, its deepest  penetration, but Grizzard fumbled and Eric Simien recovered for the Irish.  </P> <P> Dorsey Levens' two-yard touchdown run and Ted McNamara's one-yard plunge  completed the scoring.  </P></p>

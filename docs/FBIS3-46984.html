He said that  Indonesia believes a solution to the nuclear crisis in the  Korean peninsula will boost mutually beneficial economic  cooperation and ties among the countries of the world. At the  same time, it will also contribute to the creation of world  peace, security, and prosperity.    Continuing, Minister Murdiono explained that Indonesia, as  chairman of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], has been monitoring  the issue of the nuclear program with concern. The NAM chairman  [President Suharto] is concerned about the postponement of the  third round of negotiations between the DPRK and the United  States, the direct talks between the DPRK and ROK, and the talks  between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency. On  the occasion, Minister Murdiono said that the NAM chairman sent  Nana Sutresna to the DPRK in December 1993 as the NAM's  representative to advise the authorities on how to solve the  issue through negotiations. [passage omitted]    According to Murdiono, the NAM representative has been  assigned to continue monitoring developments surrounding the  nuclear issue in Korea.</p>

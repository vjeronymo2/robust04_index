			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rebecca Maer, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Seven human rights workers in a British  Parliamentary delegation have been arrested by security forces  in southeastern Turkey, according to colleagues and the  Kurdistan Information Centre in London.    The Foreign Office said they were aware of the reports but  had no independent confirmation.    A spokesman said: "The embassy in Ankara is in touch with  the  Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs."    The group, investigating alleged abuse of human rights, was  seized by Turkish military officials in the village of Malabadi,  some 20 miles from Diyarbakir, main town in Turkey's Kurdish  region.    They are part of a 24-strong delegation headed by Lord  Avebury, chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group.    A colleague in one of the three other groups elsewhere in  Turkey said the seven were travelling by car from Diyarbakir  when seized at Malabadi at around 8am London time yesterday.  Nothing further had been heard from them by 8.30pm. They are  human rights campaigner Miranda Watson from Peterborough,  barrister Joy Hankins from London, and an interpreter known only  as Mr Diyviren, thought to be from Sheffield.    Also in the team are Margaret Ward, Kevin MacDermot and  Felan  McMahon, all from Ireland and New Zealander Peter Grant.    The group is the latest of several observer teams to go to  south-east Turkey to investigate allegations of massacres,  arrests and burning of villages by security forces in response  to a campaign by Kurdish separatists.    Other British human rights investigators on a similar  mission  were arrested in the same area last November and released after  26 hours.</p>

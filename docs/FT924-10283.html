			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Salinas declines pressure to stay President Carlos Salinas of Mexico has ended speculation that he might alter the nation's constitution to enable him to seek re-election after his first term expires at the end of 1994, Damian Fraser reports in Mexico City. Addressing congressmen, the president said: 'I will not promote, nor accept the promotion of any measure to modify the principle of no re-election.' Mr Salinas is still only 44, relatively popular and clearly happy in office - all of which fuelled speculation that he might seek another term.</p>

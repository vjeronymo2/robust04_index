			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN BLVD. DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> As a small-business person in Marina del Rey, I would like to ask these  developers one question: Who in their right mind, with the necessary money to  spend, will stay (or for retailers, go to shop) in such an overcrowded,  gridlocked area? Everything that now makes the marina a nice place to be, will  be destroyed and business will therefore go out of business.  </P> <P> As for the Marina Place Mall in particular, for those in Culver City who think  it will enhance their city's image, think again. The developer plans to call it  Marina Place. Even General Telephone will probably say it's in Venice.  </P> <P> ANDY PEARLMAN  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

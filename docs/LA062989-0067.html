			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN CLAIMING TO BE DEPUTY CONFRONTS SCHULTE ON TV SHOW  </P> <P> When gay West Hollywood City Councilman Steve Schulte agreed to appear on a  talk show this week presented by the Rev. Pat Robertson's Christian  Broadcasting Network, he didn't expect it to be fun and games.  </P> <P> And it wasn't.  </P> <P> First, he was accused by a teen-ager in the audience of having a mental  disorder because he is gay. Then, a young mother railed against what she said  was the evil of homosexual relationships. A rival guest on the program chided  Schulte and another gay guest for living immoral lives.  </P> <P> The program, Scott Ross Straight Talk, was taped last week at Venice Beach. It  was shown Tuesday on the CBN Family Channel, available to about 45 million  cable television subscribers nationwide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Among the First  </P> <P> Schulte, who has appeared on similar programs in the past, went on the show to  talk about West Hollywood's domestic-partnership law, which provides gay  couples and other unmarried partners with certain legally recognized benefits.  </P> <P> West Hollywood is among a small number of cities -- including San Francisco,  Berkeley and Madison, Wis. -- that have such laws. The ordinances were  described by host Scott Ross as "striking at the very foundation of the family  structure as we know it."  </P> <P> The councilman took most of the criticism in stride.  </P> <P> "You come to expect it, but I always view these kinds of programs as the chance  to reach an audience that would otherwise be unattainable," said Schulte, who  has appeared on the Sally Jessy Raphael Show and twice was a guest of Orange  County TV host Wally George.  </P> <P> However, even Schulte admitted to being taken aback by a man in the audience  who claimed to be a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy assigned to West  Hollywood. The man expressed displeasure at having to deal with gays as part of  his law enforcement duties, calling the gay life style "disgusting."  </P> <P> An estimated 35% of West Hollywood's 37,000 residents are gay, and gay  activists have long accused the Sheriff's Department of insensitivity toward  gays.  </P> <P> "I'm a deputy sheriff in the city of West Hollywood and I deal strictly on a  lot of my runs with homosexuals, and I can't understand why so many people want  to go to that kind of life style," the man said. "I think homosexuality is  disgusting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Have the Right'  </P> <P> Responded Schulte: "You have the right to be disgusted by whatever you want to  be disgusted by. I hope you're raising your kids in a decent manner. I also  hope you're telling them that not everybody is like you . . . and that it's OK  to be different, whether gay or straight."  </P> <P> Although the man did not give his name on the program, Mark Vandervelden, an  aide to Schulte who attended the taping, said he overheard the man introduce  himself as Rene Jackson.  </P> <P> That piece of news, relayed to the Sheriff's Department by Vandervelden at  Schulte's request, quickly sent sheriff's officials scurrying to find out who,  if anyone, from their ranks would be so bold as to insult a city councilman on  national television.  </P> <P> "We don't have anyone here by that name," said Capt. Rachel Burgess, who heads  the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station. "As a matter of fact, I've checked with  personnel, and they show no one with that name associated with the department,  period."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, she and other officers at the West Hollywood station viewed the  broadcast and concluded that the man was an imposter.  </P> <P> "No one here has ever seen the guy," she said.  </P> <P> Schulte, who characterized the man's views as "repugnant," said he never  believed that the man was really a sheriff's deputy.  </P> <P> "I was taken aback when he said who he was," Schulte said. "My first reaction  was not to believe him. I didn't think anyone from there (the Sheriff's  Department) would be that undisciplined or that out-of-line on national TV.  </P> <P> "I kind of got the feeling that some of the people in the audience were planted  by someone."  </P> <P> The program was taped outdoors near the Venice Boardwalk before an audience of  about 75 people. Audience members who participated in the broadcast included  gay-rights activists and people opposed to the gay life style.  </P> <P> Schulte's chief antagonist on the program was Lou Sheldon, an Orange County  minister and founder of the Traditional Values Coalition.  </P> <P> He dismissed domestic-partnership laws as "undermining the moral fabric of  society," and said that sanctioning living arrangements between unmarried  couples threatens to "wipe out those things that have made this country great."  </P> <P> In February, West Hollywood began offering medical insurance coverage to  unmarried partners of city employees, including gays and lesbians.  </P> <P> Yet, West Hollywood's domestic-partnership law -- among the first measures  championed by the gay community after the city was incorporated in 1984 --  remains largely symbolic.  </P> <P> It provides domestic partners with jail and hospital visitation rights similar  to those of spouses. But the city does not have a major hospital, and the only  jail is a Sheriff's Department lock-up facility where visitors are not allowed.  </P></p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Apprentice scheme expected An apprenticeship scheme for people aged from 16 to 19 is expected to be suggested by the chancellor in the Budget tomorrow, Lisa Wood writes. The scheme would replace Youth Training and would aim to give qualifications up to the National Vocational Qualification level three, which is a crafts-level qualification. At present most YT students aim for NVQ level two. Funding for the scheme would be related to the acquisition of skills. Youth Training has had a poor image among participants and employers. Growing numbers of young people are preferring to remain at school or college rather than join YT. The Department of Employment's Pounds 1.8bn training programme is likely to be cut in the Budget, with schemes catering for unemployed adults believed to be vulnerable.</p>

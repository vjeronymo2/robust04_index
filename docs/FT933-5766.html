			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (5): In need of investment - Ghana GHANA'S achievements since its Economic Recovery Programme began in 1983 shows that adjustment works, say its proponents. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. World Bank officials argue that Ghana shows that adjustment, if properly pursued, need not mean greater poverty or fiscal austerity. The share of tax revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. And the sketchy evidence, according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on average, adjustment has shifted resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions. Nor can this growth record be explained by aid flows alone. Ghana remains heavily dependent on gross aid flow, totalling 8 per cent of GDP a year. But, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses, the net resource transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared with a sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent. There is another factor in Ghana's success, which World Bank officials prefer not to talk about: politics. Ghana's former military government has consistently tried to align its interests with the rural poor. The government also built an impressive record, over 10 years, before putting its popularity to the test at last autumn's elections. Ghana's record does seem to show that structural adjustment is necessary for an acceleration in economic growth. But it also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is insufficient for an accelerated growth and a rapid fall in poverty. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. The government plans to accelerate its growth rate to 8 per cent a year over the next decade, but it lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and physical infrastructure, and the civil service is weak. Meanwhile, the domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow commodity base for export earnings, manufacturing exports are tiny, foreign investment minimal. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990, compared with 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in Thailand. Success will be assured only when, and if, this investment starts to flow. Failure would be a serious blow to adjustment in Africa.</p>

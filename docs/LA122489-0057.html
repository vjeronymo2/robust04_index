			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: SILENT NIGHTS AND HOLLY DAYS ABOARD SHIP OFF ANTARCTICA  </P> <P> The carols began playing over the ship's public-address system on the day  before Christmas, and as usual, with those holiday tapes, every fifth melody  was "The Little Drummer Boy."  </P> <P> Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  </P> <P> I sat alone by a window in the ship's lounge and, over the top of a book by the  explorer Ernest Shackleton, I stared at the ice of Antarctica.  </P> <P> It was the most peaceful Christmas Eve I'd ever known; quiet, cozy,  uncomplicated. No rushing. No shopping. No open houses. And too cold to go  outside and play.  </P> <P> Across the lounge, three white-haired fellows were swapping travel tales. The  odd exotic word drifted my way: Borneo, Sherpa, Xian. I saw that they were  listening to each other. There is time for such luxury at sea.  </P> <P> A Christmas Eve without parades -- just a line of crystal fog that drew an  opaque curtain around our ship, there near the bottom of the world. I pushed my  book aside and wrapped up in a blanket.  </P> <P> In the library, an Australian rancher was busy with water colors. The ship's  doctor studied an atlas. A woman from the island of Sark scratched happily at  post cards, which would not be mailed until we reached Chile in two weeks. ("Of  course, you may post them at the Polish scientific station on the day after  Christmas," our leader had said. "But they might not leave Antarctica until a  supply ship comes in six months.")  </P> <P> Simple acts, if any at all, seemed called for. In my cabin, I cleared a space  beneath the porthole and arranged five blue limpet shells that I had collected  in the Falkland Islands. They were keyhole limpets, and I had found a beach  littered with them, in lavender, rose and blue.  </P> <P> The fog moved closer. We were the center of a small ring of ocean. We were the  keyhole in the limpet. We were the most people for thousands of miles, the 80  of us on that ship.  </P> <P> The fog was blinding bright, and when I turned away from the porthole, white  circles followed, full moons that bounced on the walls and into the mirror,  like the blue dots that burn in your eyes after a flashbulb pops.  </P> <P> But enough of drifting dreams. I remembered that I had one Christmas errand. I  needed a snip of tape so that I could attach a sprig of Russell lupine to a  sack from the Falkland Islands Company store.  </P> <P> The lupine was from the garden of a child named Poppy, whom I met on tiny West  Point Island. She had handed me a nosegay as I left to sail farther south.  Packages were adorned with blue petals and green stalks. It seemed wondrous in  this world of icebergs and glaciers.  </P> <P> As I left for dinner, I saw that a California couple had come prepared. Printed  cards on each door said: "From our cabin to yours, Merry Christmas."  </P> <P> A fir tree had been decorated in the lounge, and flickered with green and red  lights. I wondered if it had traveled with us from Uruguay, where we began this  journey; I had not seen many trees since.  </P> <P> We had breakfast in our cabin on Christmas Day: coffee and hot chocolate, bran  muffins and orange marmalade, a ripe banana and pears. We traded gifts. I gave  him a glacial blue marker pen and two linen towels showing Falklands maps and  penguins. I also gave him a fisherman's sweater, knitted by the wives of Port  Stanley.  </P> <P> He gave me snow-white long underwear, trimmed at the neckline with lace. Far  too fancy for the Falklands general store, I thought, and then saw the  Nordstrom label.  </P> <P> Christmas lunch was a feast of Smithfield ham and roast turkey, baked yams and  pumpkin pie, homemade ice cream and baklava. It was borne by a Greek named  Babis, who had brought our breakfast tray.  </P> <P> After the last hearty toast, we put on red parkas and walked out on the  sun-splashed deck. It was warmer now, and snow was beginning to fall. Fat  flakes stuck to our hair and wool gloves.  </P> <P> Music began booming from the loudspeaker.  </P> <P> Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.  </P></p>

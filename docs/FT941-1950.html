			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine votes 'Ukraine has not yet died,' is the apt title of the Ukrainian national anthem. As Ukrainian voters prepare for parliamentary elections on Sunday, their nation's existence is as imperilled as ever. The elections give Ukrainians a chance, perhaps the last, to set their political house in order. Optimists dream that Sunday's elections could oust Kiev's ex-communist leadership and bring in a new guard better equipped to introduce market reforms. The new people who might be able to lead Ukraine to the market at last could be businessmen and factory directors from Russian-oriented eastern Ukraine, or they might be reformist nationalist politicians from the western and central regions of the country. Unfortunately, these dreams are likely to remain just that. Since reform candidates have been unable to form a single bloc, the reform vote is likely to split, giving the victory to ex-communists. An even greater danger is that the Sunday elections will further confuse Ukraine's already muddled political scene. On average, eight candidates are running in each constituency, while Ukrainian law requires 50 per cent voter turn-out to elect a member of parliament. An extreme possibility is that these stringent requirements will make it impossible for voters to elect a viable parliament. Mr Kravchuk has hinted that he would then introduce direct presidential rule, a dream for him, but a nightmare for Ukrainians who live with the hyperinflation he has created. More likely, the elections will produce an amorphous new parliament, although many constituencies will first require run-off elections between the two leading candidates. The legislature might be more paralysed than its predecessor, which at least has a working national-communist majority. In any case, the new legislature will face the same political obstacle to radical reform as the present one. Politicians fear that such reforms would initially cause the worst pain in the Russified Donbass region. Thus the right economic medicine would endanger Ukraine's fragile statehood. All of this is bad news for the west, which is coming to view Ukraine as a bulwark against Moscow's expansionism, particularly now that Russia is taking a harder line toward the 'near abroad'. Ukraine needs political and economic support if Russia is to be discouraged from provoking a potentially devastating conflict with its important neighbour. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian government is unable to use economic help constructively. Worse, the elections are unlikely to change this unhappy situation.</p>

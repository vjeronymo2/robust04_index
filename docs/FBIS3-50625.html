According to  Decree No. 1834, engineer Miguel Horacio Gini Espinola was  appointed today as Antelco board of directors chairman,  replacing Colonel Eduardo Yasuo Kishi Ichikawa, a general staff  school graduate, who tendered his resignation from the post.    As a matter of fact, these changes within Antelco further  aggravated the already tense relations between President Juan  Carlos Wasmosy and [Colorado Party President] Blas N. Riquelme.    It was reported that the Colorado Party president challenged  the removal of his brother-in-law, Jose Luis Yanez, from the  Antelco board of directors.    It was reported that Colorado Party President Blas N.  Riquelme went to Government Palace to visit the president of the  Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and to challenge the removal of  his brother-in- law, Jose Luis Yanez, from the Antelco board of  directors.    This is the first time that I have left worried after an  audience with the president of the Republic, the Colorado Party  leader said.    [Begin recording] [Riquelme] We will discuss it. I will  hold a news conference at the appropriate time.    [Unidentified reporter] What did the president tell you?    [Riquelme] No. I am telling you that I left worried.    [Reporter] Would you resign?    [Riquelme] Within the next few hours I will know what I will  do (?to be able to) ...    [Indistinct questions by several unidentified reporters who  speak at the same time]    [Riquelme] We will see. We will see.    [Reporter] Was your resignation requested?    [Riquelme] Thank you very much. No. That is all.    [Reporter] For party reasons?    [Riquelme] Party reasons.    [Reporter] Party issues?    [Riquelme] Party issues.    [Reporter] Was your resignation requested? Will you resign  as party president? [end recording]    After talking with Riquelme at his residence, [Colorado  Deputy] Ismael Echague explained the tense atmosphere and the  concern over the tense relations between the president of the  Republic and the Colorado Party president.    [Begin Echague recording] I am aware that there actually  have been some setbacks. A request had been made, had been sent  to the executive branch by the Colorado Party executive board  president, Mr. Blas N. Riquelme. This request was not  satisfactorily dispatched by the executive branch. Therefore,  this caused the Colorado Party president's personal anger and  prompted the drawing up of a communique that will be released  within the next few hours. [end recording]    Nevertheless, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stressed that  there are no problems over the changes made at Antelco. He said  he just exercised his constitutional rights to remove government  officials and that his government is far from being dictatorial.    [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] Blas N. said this.  In his speech, he said ...    [Wasmosy, interrupting] That is his business. I just  exercised my rights, to which a president is entitled. That's  it.    [Reporter] What did you specifically do, Mr. President?    [Wasmosy] Nothing, gentlemen.    [Reporter] What was Mr. Blas N. Riquelme's attitude?    [Wasmosy] Ask him.    [Reporter] There has been talk that you removed his  brother-in-law, Blas N. Riquelme's brother-in-law, Luis Yanez,  Mr. Yanez.    [Wasmosy] Well now, I can do ...[changes thought] I believe  I can reorganize all the organizations using my criterion. I am  our country's administrator.    [Reporter] But Blas N. Riquelme asked you not to remove him.    [Wasmosy] Ask him.    [Reporter] Deputy Ismael Echague said a dictatorship is  hatching at Government Palace.    [Wasmosy] This is Ismael Echague's business, miss. [laughs]  The government is far from being dictatorial. Well now,  good-bye. [end recording]    Concerning this issue, we must report that the news  conference announced by Ismael Echague never materialized,  although there have been successive meetings. A meeting is now  being held at the Colorado Party president's house. Present at  this meeting are other Colorado Party executive board members  like Dr. Diogenes Martinez, Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, National  Republican Association [ANR -- Colorado Party] legislators, and  ANR grass-roots leaders.    Let's wait for developments.</p>

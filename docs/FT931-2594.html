			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointment at marginal cut in German discount rate THE GERMAN government bond market fell on disappointment at the Bundesbank's move to lower the discount rate yesterday by only 50 basis points, though other core European bond markets saw rate cuts in the wake of the German move. Long-dated UK government bonds also bounced higher yesterday on a surprise fall in unemployment figures, continuing a rally that has picked up after Tuesday's Budget. The Bundesbank's cut in the discount rate to 7.5 per cent, together with the decision to leave the Lombard rate unchanged at 9 per cent, disappointed the bund market, which had hoped for a cut in both official rates. Although the move lowers the floor for official money market rates, which currently stand at 8.25 per cent, it was taken to reflect the Bundesbank's intention of resisting pressure for cuts in interest rates too soon. The German announcement was followed by rate cuts in Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands. Rates in France remained unchanged as the franc weakened and 10-year bond prices slid by a third of a point. On Liffe, the June bund futures contract opened at 95.95 and climbed to 96.05 before the Bundesbank news. The contract then slipped to 95.50, before gaining some ground to end the day at around 95.77. GILTS, meanwhile, bounced by nearly a point at the longer end of the yield curve, as the market seized on signs that the UK economy was picking up, though not in a way that threatened a rise in inflation. Unemployment levels fell for the first time in three years, adding momentum to a market already buoyed by the firmer pound. The June long gilts contract on Liffe opened at 106 3/32 and closed at 107, around its highs for the day. The 9 per cent gilts due 2008 jumped by three quarters of a point, pushing the yield down to 8.06 per cent. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at Warburg Securities, said: 'A strong pick-up in the economy will take some of the sting out of the public sector borrowing requirement. What the market is looking at is non-inflationary growth, and it likes what it sees.' The strength of the market fuelled expectations that the Bank of England could today announce a gilt auction. Under the new 10-day notice period, announced at the time of the Budget, this would allow the Bank to complete an auction by March 31, ahead of the start of the new financial year. Current demand suggests it would auction either 10-year bonds, to meet demand from foreign investors, or longer-dated paper aimed at UK institutions. US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday, lifted by a follow-through of Wednesday's late buying and supported by decreasing imports and exports in the January trade deficit data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 1/32 at 104 9/32 , yielding 6.786 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  3/16 higher to yield 3.839 per cent. Bullish investors were encouraged by a commerce department report of slower exports and imports for January, which gave some weight to the theory that consumer spending would weaken.</p>

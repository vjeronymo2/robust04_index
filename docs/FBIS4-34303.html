			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Taranco Palace was the seat of the meeting between  the Argentine, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan presidents in which the  bid for dredging the Martin Garcia channel [in the River Plate]  was awarded. The chiefs of state reaffirmed the intent and need  for a regional integration system, and the importance this  system has for the area's countries, and to which Chile's desire  to become a member of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] must  be added.    Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle firmly pointed out  the common projects the country has with Argentina and the fact  that they have a solid footing, emphasizing the dredging of the  Martin Garcia and Mitre channels. Lacalle explained the current  stage in which the two countries now are permanently sharing the  costs and maintenance of the common projects. He added that the  [Paraguay- Parana Rivers] waterway, the road network, and the  Colonia [Uruguay]-Buenos Aires bridge are projects that ratify  the confidence and overall actions that go beyond governments,  and he termed these initiatives a "positive vision of goodwill  with an eye on regional integration."    Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy termed the meeting  a  historic event, and he highlighted the fact that the Argentine  and Uruguayan presidents are undertaking the dredging of Martin  Garcia channel, which is something that marks the intention of  uniting, of integrating the region's countries, and he pointed  out Mercosur as a sign of the desire to integrate. Wasmosy  indicated that his country cannot remain outside this effort  because Paraguay needs a sea outlet with lower freight costs in  order to become more competitive in international markets. He  also referred to the importance of the waterway that will join  the region's five countries.    Argentine President Carlos Menem emphasized the integration  process, indicating that these three brother countries are  walking a common path that is leading them to regional  integration. He referred to the River Plate Treaty and the  Maritime Front signed 21 years ago by then-Presidents Juan Maria  Bordaberry and General Juan Domingo Peron, pointing out that  even at that time Peron spoke about regional integration,  stressing that countries must be "united, not dominated." Menem  said trade "is the soul of nations," indicating that the river  projects are very important and help link countries. He  announced that within a few days that Salto Grande  [hydroelectric project on the Uruguay River] will be put into  operation with Paraguay's Asilerta Dam [as published] and thus  integrate it with the free trade zone as its central objective.  Menem also indicated that the Chilean Government had submitted a  note in which it indicates that it has the intention of joining  Mercosur, in other words, expressing its concern regarding an  expansion of the integration spectrum.    Lacalle said that for Uruguay this treaty means the  "definite  opening of its river ports to international trade with an outlet  to the Atlantic that has a depth of 32 feet." He added that the  treaty also means that the ports of Nueva Palmira and Montevideo  will be given a new life, and the same will apply to all the  ports within the basins of the Paraguay, Parana, and Uruguay  Rivers. Lacalle said: "This must be complemented with the  importance of the waterway--3,000 km of rivers--that has a  common legal statute that was ironed out by five nations and  will allow the products of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia,  southern Brazil, and Uruguay to reach the Atlantic, and thus the  world."    The Uruguayan president believes it "is an undertaking that  will be written into history as one of the most truly  influential and real endeavors of our countries."    Menem said the documents' signing means "the end of a  process  that began more than 20 years ago with the signing of the River  Plate Treaty on 19 November 1973. This cycle began at that time  and it concludes with the documents that were signed today that  will make the Parana River, the Martin Garcia channel, and, of  course, the River Plate navigable."    Referring to reports about alleged threats received by  Argentine Ambassador to Uruguay Alicia Martinez Rios, Menem  said: "All of us involved in the world of politics receive  threats. Moreover, he added that he had to acknowledge that  Martinez Rios has a lot of courage and is very enterprising. And  I also must acknowledge that in a large measure it is thanks to  her and her always-positive attitude that this document has been  signed."    On leaving Taranco Palace, the three presidents chatted with  the media.    Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy gave his opinion on  the ceremony that had just concluded. He said: "Both for Bolivia  and Paraguay, in their role as landlocked countries, these  documents that were signed today (yesterday) basically mean that  we have an outlet to the Atlantic through two very important  corridors."    "I would like this project, which has concluded happily  today, to be joined with another outlet to the Atlantic that is  located just a little more to the north: the port of Pederneira  [Brazil] "so the Southern Cone countries will really become  integrated when the Itaipu Dam is completed and inter-river  navigation begins."</p>

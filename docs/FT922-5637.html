			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan and Madrid gain in quiet trade MOST bourses were closed for the Ascension day holiday, but Milan and Madrid produced gains yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN, which had broken its rising trend on Wednesday, returned to the upgrade yesterday with the Comit index closing 1.97 higher at 494.62. A strong performance by the banking sector, assisted by foods, provided the base for yesterday's recovery. Last week's rally had centred on the industrial sector, noted Mr Michele Pacitti of County NatWest; banks had been left behind, partly because there were (somewhat unlikely) rumours that the state might sell off part of its holdings in Credito Italiano and BCI. Credito Italiano gained 4.4 per cent on what some dealers described as short-covering, closing L74 higher at L1,773; Banco di Roma closed L67 higher at L2,005, but surrendered L5 on the kerb; and, on-screen, BCI touched a high of L3,195, but settled back to L3,155, up L30 at the close. MADRID generally ignored the half-day general strike, which appeared to have limited success, with reports of public transport running normally in many parts of the country. The unions had called the action in protest at the government's public spending cuts. The general index gained 1.03 to 259.04 in volume of some Pta10bn, with strong foreign interest noted. Telefonica, Repsol and Iberdrola accounted for some 30 per cent of market volume. The telecommunications group gained Pta5 to Pta1,165 with some 1.2m shares traded. The company has been gaining ground since announcing earlier in the month that it was to raise its dividend - the first time since 1979. Iberdrola II advanced Pta47 or 9 per cent to Pta547 following comments on Wednesday by the chairman of Iberdrola I that the merger of the two utilities should be completed by the end of the year. The banking sector was generally firmer following weakness this week after reports that some banks faced bankruptcy this year. Santander was Pta90 stronger at Pta4,765, having lost Pta250 over the past few days. DUBLIN, which had been easing backwards this week, started lower and stabilised later yesterday, the ISEQ overall index closing only 0.44 lowerat 1,381.36. Mr Paul Burke of Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin said that the apparently flat trajectory of the market this year had concealed early strength in industrials and foods - the former broken recently by disappointing 1992 prospects for Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging group - and a early lag in performance by Ireland's financials which have since come through to support the market. ISTANBUL fell sharply following a rise in interest rates at Wednesday's three-month Treasury bill auction. The index closed down 58.37 at 3,233.16 in turnover estimated at TL117.5bn, down from TL130bn previously. The Treasury sold bills worth TL1.67 trillion, up from TL241bn in the previous auction. Prices of 61 shares fell, 18 rose and 42 finished unchanged. Among active stocks Eregli rose TL50 to TL3,250 while Tupras and Cukurova Elektrik were both unchanged at TL3,700 and TL5,300 respectively. South Africa was also closed for a public holiday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 28**                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am    11 am     12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm    close 1195.31  1195.61  1194.96  1194.34  1194.54  1194.21 1194.89  1195.22**               Day's High  1195.80    Day's Low  1193.74             May 27    May 26    May 22    May 21    May 20            1194.56   1198.37   1197.48    1187.57   1187.62  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ** Partial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

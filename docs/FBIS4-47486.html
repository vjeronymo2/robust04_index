D. Mukhamedyarov, doctor of technical </F> sciences, and G. A. Krasnov; UDC [621.384.32:629.78]:574]    [Abstract] Methods for computing the characteristics of  thermal imagers, especially their resolution, applicable to test  objects in the form of line test patterns, which in some cases  makes possible approximate extrapolation of the results to an  evaluation of the possibility of identifying specific objects on  the basis of empirical expressions, continue to be improved. An  analysis is based on computation of the signal-to-noise ratio  when resolving a three-element test pattern. A merit of this  form of analysis is that it is possible to use analytic  expressions for determining the intrasystem parameters of IR  instruments from the measured values of the characteristics of  the complex in which it is a component part when solving the  direct problem or determining the characteristics of the complex  from the measured values of the parameters of the IR instruments  when solving the inverse problem. The proposed method for  determining the probability of resolution makes it possible to  evaluate the admissible design errors in IR instruments  attributable to technological constraints. In accordance with  the described method the probability of resolution of a three-  element test pattern by an ensemble of aerospace instruments  under ground conditions can be determined when using an  experimental test stand (an annotated block diagram accompanies  the text). This resolution is 0.8 for a spatial frequency of the  mires _u_ = 0.0333 m[.sup]-1[/] and a radiation contrast of  the scale and test pattern _D_T = 3 K. In this case the  discrepancy between the experimental and computed data does not  exceed 4%. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.</p>

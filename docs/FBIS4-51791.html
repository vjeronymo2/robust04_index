			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- China may officially  open its doors to South Korean motor vehicles as early as July  or August, sources at the Korea Automobile Manufacturers  Association (KAMA) said Tuesday. The Chinese have presented to  Korea a proposal on joint manufacture of 25 auto parts including  fuel systems, bearings and ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) and they  are currently discussing the matter, the sources said.    Liu Keming, vice president of the China National Automobile  Import and Export Corp., will visit Seoul around June and decide  on whether to approve Korean car imports after touring  automaking and car parts manufacturing sites here.    A KAMA official, who recently attended the working-level  meeting of the Korea-China Automobile Industry Association  conference held annually in rotation, said Liu would be bringing  a blueprint on how many cars China intends to import. He said  it was "a matter of time" before Korean cars make inroads into  China as the latter is coming around to the idea, predicting  July or August after Liu returns from his tour and winds up the  necessary procedures.    Beijing lifted its ban on car imports to some extent last  year by formally allowing in 16,000 American autos and  unofficially approving 8,200 Korean cars made by Daewoo Motor  Co. The automobile industry associations of the two countries  agreed to hold the first joint conference in Beijing or  Changchun from Sept. 12-16 during the last working-level meeting  April 13-16. China is expected to spell out its policy on  Korean motor vehicle imports, including ways to promote  investment in the completed car and auto parts industry and  cooperation in parts at the joint conference.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Letter (5): Time to decide how Europe might be better managed Sir, With companies removing management layers, and political devolution rife worldwide, why should the EC add political and bureaucratic layers? A loose alliance of competing nation states is best for Europe, where best-of-breed methods and ideas would quickly assert. Our competitors would run rings around a monolithic Maastricht EC, just as we did to Russia. Good for the Danes. Ernest Spratt, 6 Salterns Close, Hayling Island, Hants</p>

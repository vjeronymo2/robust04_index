			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Consequently, broad public and commercial use of the NII hinges upon implementing technologies, policies, and practices that not only ensure that users of information systems have access to information when and where they need it, but that subjects of information records are able to protect themselves from unauthorized or inappropriate use of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Americans will not use the NII to its full potential unless they trust that information will go where and when they want it and nowhere else,'' declared Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs at OMB and chair of the Forum. ``The Federal government is a primary user of the NII and thus a catalyst for change. Yet the NII will be designed, built, owned, operated, and used primarily by the private sector, making it essential that security on the NII be considered in partnership with the public.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To address these critical issues, the Vice President formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF). The IITF is chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and is comprised of senior Administration officials having expertise in technical, legal, and policy areas pertinent to the NII. The mission of the IITF is to articulate and implement the Administration's vision for the NII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the IITF to address the cross-cutting issue of security in the NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the IITF, the President has established the U.S. Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure. The Advisory Council represents industry, labor, and public interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce on issues relating to the NII. Mega-Project III, one of three work groups of the Advisory Council, is responsible for addressing security, intellectual property, and privacy issues as they relate to the NII. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Structure and Content of Public Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Security is linked inextricably to broad public use of the NII. The technologies, policies, and procedures used to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally produced and transmitted information, information products, and services on the NII will determine whether, how, and to what extent digitally linked information services will be broadly used in such critical sectors as health, education, finance, and insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development of policies and procedures that will ensure the security of commercial and non-commercial information and communications on the NII requires study from different perspectives, whether that of the subject of the information, the user of the information, or the creator of the information. The Forum and Mega-Project III seek input from parties who represent these views in the areas of health, education, finance, and insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Solutions to these concerns will come vita technical solutions, as well as legal and policy mechanisms. The Forum and Mega-Project III seek input in this area as well. Specifically, what legal measures, policy mechanisms, and technological solutions, or combinations thereof, can be used to effectively protect the security of health, education, financial, and insurance information delivered or made accessible on the NII? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will be assembled to discuss the following topics with a panel of senior Administration officials, members of the Security Issues Forum, and members of the Advisory Council, and to field questions and comments from other members of the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Position statements for the meeting, ``Security for Financial and Insurance Information in the NII,'' should address four principal questions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. How do you envision the NII being used by the finance and insurance industries to provide enhanced products and services to customers or to improve operations? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

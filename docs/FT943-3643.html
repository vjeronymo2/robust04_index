			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Quebec separatists sweep to victory in provincial elections The separatist Parti Quebecois swept to victory in provincial elections in Quebec yesterday, setting the stage for a divisive referendum on the future of Canada's only French-speaking province. However, with a number of returns still to be declared, it appeared the PQ's victory might not reach the landslide proportions suggested by recent opinion polls. An hour after the polls closed last night, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that PQ candidates were elected or leading in 80 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly. The outgoing Liberals, who want Quebec to remain part of Canada and who had won a clear majority in the 1989 election, were elected or leading in 45 constituencies. Opinion polls had projected PQ wins in 80 to 90 seats, with no more than 40 seats for the Liberals. Besides the Liberals' unexpectedly large number of seats, federalist forces were encouraged by the early results, which suggested that the PQ would win less than 50 per cent of the popular vote. The PQ, led by former economics professor Mr Jacques Parizeau, has promised to hold an independence referendum some time in 1995. But opinion polls have consistently shown that a clear majority of Quebeckers is opposed to an outright split from Canada. Political observers have concluded that many voters turned to the PQ mainly to reflect their desire for a change in government. The PQ's last term in office, between 1976 and 1985, was marked by a humiliating defeat in a 1980 referendum for a loose form of sovereignty. PQ leaders have indicated that they plan to wage a much more vigorous pro-independence campaign in the next referendum than they did 14 years ago. One advantage they will have is the presence of a large group of separatist MPs, belonging to the Bloc Quebecois, in the federal House of Commons in Ottawa. Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister and an avid federalist, was due to make a statement on the election result late last night. In addition, the premiers of the other nine provinces, who will play a crucial role in shaping public opinion ahead of the referendum, are due to discuss their strategy in a telephone conference call this morning.</p>

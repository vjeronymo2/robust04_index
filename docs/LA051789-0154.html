			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MIDDLEWEIGHT GAINS 30TH VICTORY  </P> <P> Unbeaten middleweight Danny Morgan of Minneapolis gained his 30th victory with  a seventh-round knockout of Mike Pollitt in the main event of a pro boxing show  in Tyndall Armory.  </P> <P> Referee George DeFabis, worried about a badly swollen right eye Pollitt  suffered in the third round Tuesday night, halted the bout after Morgan decked  his foe with a solid left to the head at 1:25. Thirty seconds before the  knockout, Pollitt had knocked Morgan down for an 8 count, then appeared to  punch himself out before Morgan ended the match.  </P> <P> Ray Mercer, 1988 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, gained an easy victory,  knocking out Dave Hopkins of Gary a minute into the first round.  </P></p>

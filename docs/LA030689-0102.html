			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> LATVIAN PROTEST FOR TV VOICE QUELLED  </P> <P> Hundreds of police today broke up a protest by demonstrators seeking greater  access to state-run media in the Baltic capital of Riga, tearing down banners  and arresting 30 people, an activist said.  </P> <P> Dozens of protesters gathered in front of Communist Party Central Committee  headquarters in Riga to protest restrictions on Latvian state television, said  Boris Sokolov, a member of the Democratic Union, an independent political  party. Access to television is considered especially important because of the  nationwide campaign before March 26 elections to the Council of People's  Deputies, a new national assembly that is to choose the country's president and  the Supreme Soviet (Parliament).  </P></p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (3): Squeezed between two blocs - Foreign policy / An innermost wish to be part of the European Union 'Baltic countries will never again be forced against the innermost wishes of their people into any relationship with the Russian state; but they would themselves be foolish to reject close and co-operative arrangements with a tolerant and non-imperialistic Russia which genuinely wished to overcome the unhappy memories of the past and to place her relations to the Baltic peoples on a basis of real respect and disinterestedness.' George Kennan, the US diplomat whose analysis of the post-war Soviet Union showed much (but not enough) of his country's foreign policies, produced few better insights than that. More than 40 years after it was written in 1951, it provides a consensual framework for the conduct of a Latvian foreign policy seeking to consolidate a national security which it still sees as fragile. If there is an 'innermost wish' at the core of the policy, it is manifest in a national consensus, which sees Latvia's future as within Europe and, specifically, within the European Union. To achieve that, it - with its neighbours, Estonia and Lithuania - struggled determinedly to escape from the failing Soviet Union. Unlike the other Soviet states which largely received their independence as a result of the Soviet collapse, the Baltic states took their statehood first - and in doing so, greatly hastened that collapse. The anti-Sovietism, and anti-Russian feeling which that long-suppressed urge produced is now being consciously modified into the offer of a civilised neighbourliness - an offer which has yet to be fully taken up by a Russia still raw over the loss of empire, even though President Boris Yeltsin, more than any other leading Russian politician, gave the Baltic states the space within which to regain control of their nationhoods. 'We are between two big blocs still,' says Mr Valdis Birkavs, the Latvian foreign minister. 'Our only guarantee of security is strengthening ourselves, not from the military point of view but in sticking to the right policies and making ourselves attractive to investment. The Singapore, or Hong Kong, of the Baltic, if you like. That is the only guarantee now - not one provided by the west.' Mr Birkavs has been the dominant figure in Latvian foreign policy for the past 18 months - as prime minister until the coalition that he led fell apart in the summer and then as foreign minister in the re-formed coalition from September. As prime minister, he suffered the loss of Mr George Andrejevs, then foreign minister, whose links with the KGB were revealed: the resignation strengthened Mr Birkavs's grip on foreign policy. Still the chairman of his party - Latvian Way, the main coalition partner as in the last government - he remains the leading strategist in the development of his country's delicate geo-political niche. The disengagement from Russia has been - apart from an eruption of violence by Soviet special forces in Riga in January 1991 - peaceful, if fraught. This year, an agreement on the withdrawal of the remnants of the once numerous army contingent was initialled in March, signed in April and finalised in August - leaving the Skrunda radar base as the one remaining Russian military base. Economic disengagement has been less complete, but is impressive. From an almost total dependence on the markets of and supplies from the Soviet Union  -largely Russia - Latvian foreign trade is now 50 per cent oriented to the west. 'We could,' says Mr Birkavs, 'make our entire orientation to the west and, as it were, shut up our borders with Russia. But it would be bad for us and bad for them. We face west but we also want the best relations possible with our neighbours. A successful and democratic Russia is our best hope.' Though Russia is at the centre of Latvia's 'ostpolitik' it does not define it. Successive Latvian governments have striven to develop independence and strengthen relationships with Ukraine and Belarus - there are substantial Ukrainian and Belarussian communities within the 40 per cent of the community which is Russian rather than Latvian speaking - and with the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The engagement with Europe has been over the past year a similarly rapid process. In February, the government signed Nato's Partnership for Peace programme, designed in part to provide a halfway house for states such as Latvia, anxious to strengthen military alliances with the west while allowing the Nato member countries to reassure Russia (also a member) that it was not being surrounded by a military bloc. In late spring and summer, in a flurry of activity, Latvia initialled an agreement for associate partnership with the European Union; negotiated and signed a free trade agreement with the EU and passed an amended citizenship law - which by scrapping the system of small quotas of resident non-ethnic Latvians allowed to take citizenship each year - cleared the way for full membership of the Council of Europe. Like the other two Baltic states, Latvia benefits from the patronage of the other Baltic countries which have been since the war securely in the western ambit - especially Germany and Sweden: Mr Carl Bildt, the latter's former prime minister, has been a strong champion of the three states' independence. Writing in the current issue of the journal International Affairs, Mr Bildt says that 'the security of the Baltic nations needs to be assured by integration with the institutions of the west. The neo-imperialist forces in Russian political life must be contained by the process of democratic reform and partnership in international co-operation. If we succeed, it augurs well not only for the stability of this part of Europe but for Russian policy towards the rest of the world as well.' For Mr Birkavs, the achievements of this year must be followed, he says, by a period in which 'Latvia prepares herself for full membership of the EU. We must no longer demand that Europe does things for us: we must make the reforms that will allow us to be a full partner.' Much has been achieved quickly - for three main reasons. First, Russia has been acquiescent because it had a democratic-minded president and because it has been too weak to be anything but acquiescent; second, the main world states which had never recognised the Baltic states' incorporation into the Soviet Union moved quickly once they felt they could to bolster independence; and third, because political forces with at least the tacit support of most the bulk of the Latvian population have remained in power and have been able to speed along a range of important agreements. But there is internal opposition: it has come in the first place from the powerful agricultural lobby, whose political voice, the Farmers' Union party, pulled out of the Birkavs-led coalition because it could not get stiff tariffs to protect farm produce - and that because the government was determined to bring customs policy in line with the Gatt and EU requirements. It remains a serious lobby - one which is increasingly vocal.</p>

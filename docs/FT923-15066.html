			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / People: Time Products turns the clock back Richard Langdon, one of the City's veteran company doctors, is signing off from another of his former patients. He has handed back the chairmanship of Time Products to Marcus Margulies (right), whose family has been involved with the company for many years. While Time Products, Britain's leading watch distributor, was never in as serious a financial condition as FNFC, another of Langdon's patients, it has benefited from his conservative touch at the helm. A former senior partner of accountants Spicer and Pegler, he took over the Time chairmanship in 1984 after the company had reported a big loss and cut its dividend following an ill-judged expansion into Hong Kong. The 49-year old Margulies, a well known figure in the international watch industry, had been chairman of the company for seven years before Langdon was recruited. He said yesterday that Langdon had transformed his family-run company into a proper business. Although it is suffering like the rest of the watch industry, it has Pounds 20m of net cash, and its strength now lies in brand marketing and distribution rather than manufacturing, the cause of many of its previous problems. Langdon, who is 73, has been shedding several of his directorships including the chairmanship of FNFC and deputy chairmanship of Chemring. However, he will remain a non-executive director of Time. Meanwhile, Frank Frame, a recently retired deputy chairman of Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, has been appointed deputy chairman, and Keith Brooks, who has been responsible for building up Time's Sekonda brand, has been promoted to joint managing director. Roger Tsui, managing director of Remex, has resigned from the board following Time's decision to dispose of its Hong Kong trading operations.</p>

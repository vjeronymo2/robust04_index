Asked about the  opposition of Ministers Murilio Hingel (Education), Henrique  Santillo (Health), and Leonor Franco (Social Welfare) to the  composition of the fund, Fernando Henrique Cardoso said that  those who are against it should resign.    If any minister works against the economic plan, he should  have the courage to resign, said Cardoso after holding a  confidential meeting with President Itamar Franco at the  Brasilia Air Base.    Cardoso alerted President Franco to the problems in having  the emergency fund approved and to the need for the government  to firmly maintain its proposal.    Cardoso said: "The government is united. The creation of the  fund is a government decision."    He reiterated to the president -- as he did last week during  the carnival celebration -- that it would not be wise to make  any concessions on the cuts made to the budget to create the  emergency fund. The president organized a meeting with the  ministers who were dissatisfied with the economic team but he  later cancelled the meeting.    The ministers of education, health, and social welfare  worked  with Congress to change the composition of the fund because they  want a higher budget for their ministries. Minister Cardoso, who  was irritated by the ministers' behavior, did not give in to the  pressure and President Itamar did not disavow him either.    Cardoso said: "There is nothing to negotiate in the  proposal.  The government will not give up the goal of zero deficit. As  Congress already approved it in the first round, I do not  believe it will change its point of view either because it is  hot or it is cold."    Constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim  (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do  Sul] said he rejected the 31 amendments to change the fund's  composition, thus keeping the proposal approved in the first  round.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / ITC willing to look at further bid for Channel 5 franchise THE Independent Television Commission is prepared to re-advertise the Channel 5 franchise within months if a bidder comes forward with the necessary money. Earlier this month the ITC rejected a bid for the franchise by Channel Five Holdings, a Thames Television-led consortium, mainly because of what it called insufficient shareholder commitment to the project. The commission said it would begin a review on what to do with the frequencies set aside for the channel, which can reach three-quarters of the UK population. 'If at the beginning of the review someone says 'we think we can do it and we know where the money is coming from', then I think there is a re-advertising job to do fairly quickly,' said Sir George Russell, ITC chairman. He did not rule out a reconsideration of Channel Five Holdings' original application if there was clear evidence within a few weeks that the Pounds 175m needed for the project was in place. 'Can we do something immediately? I don't know,' Sir George added. 'If the question is put to us, we will have to test out what the law is and what the rules are. It is something we have never faced before.' Thames and its consortium partner, Time Warner, the US-based media group, are exploring the possibility of trying to raise the money within the next three months and asking the ITC to reconsider. The consortium's bid foundered mainly because Time Warner was only committed to a 10 per cent stake on top of Thames's 35 per cent. A possible further 25 per cent investment by Time Warner depended on main board approval. Other potential investors - Capital Cities/ABC and Cox, the US media companies; Pearson, owner of the Financial Times; and Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail - expressed interest but not commitment. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the ITC believes it can only award a franchise if it believes it will be viable over a 10-year period. The commission cannot award a licence in principle and then see whether it can be made viable before the licence is actually granted. Meridian tones down TV contrast, Page 4</p>

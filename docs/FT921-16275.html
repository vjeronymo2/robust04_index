			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Maxwell directors told of cash transfers NON-EXECUTIVE directors of Maxwell Communication Corporation were told three months before his death that Mr Robert Maxwell had transferred Pounds 275m in cash from the public company to his private interests. The bulk of transfers took place between March 31 - the end of MCC's financial year - and July, according to an investigation by Price Waterhouse, the accountants acting as administrators to MCC under UK insolvency law. Mr Peter Laister, chairman of MCC and one of the non-executive directors, confirmed to the Financial Times yesterday that MCC's finance director, Mr Basil Brookes, had informed the non-executives of the transfers in August. Mr Brookes had become alarmed at the size of the debt owed by Mr Maxwell's private companies and had been monitoring it 'for a few weeks', Mr Laister said. A government official with a close knowledge of the inquiry said the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) would be looking into why the non-executive directors did not tell MCC's shareholders in the summer about the transfer of funds. The SFO said yesterday it would be investigating all aspects of the removal of cash and investments from MCC, as part of its probe into the collapse of the Maxwell empire. Mr Laister said he was convinced that none of the non-executives was 'party to anything associated with wrongdoing'. He believed the same was true of those executives who were not members of the Maxwell family. Though much of the loan by MCC was repaid by Mr Maxwell, the transfers have contributed to a reduction in MCC's net worth of at least Pounds 1bn and represent a substantial factor in the collapse of the Maxwell empire. Under company law and stock exchange rules, shareholders normally need to be informed if a public company enters into a financial transaction with one of its own directors. In some cases, shareholder approval is required. Mr Laister said he took legal advice from an independent firm of solicitors, Macfarlanes, when told about the inter-company loan. 'If we had been advised that we needed to make an immediate shareholders' declaration, we would have done so. We were never advised that,' he said. The non-executives then obtained letters from Mr Maxwell and his son, Kevin, saying that the funds were not being used to purchase MCC shares. It is illegal for a company to facilitate the purchase of its own shares without obtaining shareholder approval. Mr Laister said the non-executives had been advised that the priority was to secure repayment of the funds. They received a commitment from Mr Robert Maxwell that funds would be repaid. Mr Laister said they were told in the autumn by Mr Kevin Maxwell that the amount owed by the private companies had fallen to nothing. In the event, there was still Pounds 73m outstanding. Including other inter-company debts, the private companies owed MCC more than Pounds 350m in July. Price Waterhouse has told banks, owed Pounds 1.3bn, that the pressure put on Mr Robert Maxwell by the non-executives to repay the loans to MCC may have led him to extract funds from his public companies' pension funds, and also secretly to raise money by transferring a 56 per cent shareholding in Berlitz, the language instruction company, out of MCC's control. 'We may take legal action against the directors,' a banker said. Banks are also examining whether they have a case against MCC's auditor, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. Mr Laister said the question of whether loans from MCC to the private companies should be disclosed were discussed 'in general terms' with Coopers before August. However, Coopers said it only became aware of the big loans in October. US court agrees plans for MCC proceedings, Page 8</p>

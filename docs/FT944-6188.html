			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): VAT scheme for second-hand goods Businesses dealing in second-hand goods will come under the European Community (EC) Seventh VAT Directive on second-hand goods. From January 1 1995 the margin scheme of accounting for VAT will be extended to all second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors' items except precious metals and gemstones. An effective reduced VAT rate of 2.5 per cent will be introduced on imports of certain works of art, antiques and collectors' items currently exempt from VAT at import. Any supplies of goods made through agents, including auctioneers, when acting in their own names, will be treated for VAT purposes as supplies made to them and by them. An accounting scheme for auctioneers will be introduced which will ensure they continue to pay VAT only on their fees.</p>

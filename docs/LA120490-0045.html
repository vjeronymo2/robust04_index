			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SLOW GOING: Few will be surprised by the commuting habits (above) revealed in  the newest Orange County Annual Survey: Most people drive to work alone, half  of them on freeways, in virtually identical proportions as in 1982. . . . How  does this reconcile with the survey's finding of increased concern for the  environment (A1)? When it comes to commuting, "people don't perceive that they  have significant alternatives at this point," says pollster Mark Baldassare.  "It's just not as easy as recycling."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW WE GET TO WORK  </P> <P> 1990 figures  </P> <P> Drive alone: 83%  </P> <P> Over 20 minutes: 39%  </P> <P> Use freeways: 50%  </P> <P> Work outside Orange County: 17%  </P> <P> Source: Orange County Annual Surveys, UCI Jeffrey A. Perlman and Kathie  Bozanich  </P></p>

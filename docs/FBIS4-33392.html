			<p>BFN     [Text] Economy Minister Ignacio De Posadas has described  the promises by presidential candidates in Bella Union about  helping the economic recovery of sugar-producing farmers as  "cheap and lying demagoguery."    In a clear reference to [Former President] Julio Maria  Sanguinetti and [Montevideo Mayor] Tabare Vazquez, whose names  he did not mention, De Posadas said the promises they made  regarding subsidies "are cheap and lying demagoguery because  neither of them has the slightest intention of fulfilling their  promises."    Speaking on the radio program "New Time for Everyone," De  Posadas said "the development of the sugar industry in  Uruguay...is irreversible and those who made those promises to  the Bella Union people are lying."    Sanguinetti and Tabare Vazquez visited Bella Union and  questioned the government policy. De Posadas said: "One of them  is new to lying. The other is older but, despite the promises he  made in Bella Union to help the sugar cane producers and sugar  industry, during his administration he allowed the sugar beet  industry to collapse without implementing any measures. One must  remember this."    Ignacio De Posadas spoke about the university conflict,  saying it is being "politicized, radicalized, and lied about."    He questioned the "unrealistic terms" with which salary  demands are being made. He said: "If the 6-percent wage  increase authorized by Congress is granted, or if any other  increase is granted, the quality of Uruguayan education will  remain exactly the same."    De Posadas said that while students showed great imagination  in their marches and their demonstrations, "they filed away the  deans' university reform proposals, thus avoiding a discussion  on their future. No effort is being made to really solve the  problem."</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Japanese salarymen reach for the tabloids In an effort to ease the boredom of a long and crowded commute, many Japanese salarymen reach for the tabloid sports dailies, rolled up in high pillars at the front of newstands, before boarding their trains to work. And the tabloids seldom disappoint. While office workers get their mainstream dailies delivered to the door, the sports tabloids, lacking the extensive distribution systems of the large newspapers, try to lure readers with their colourful front pages and lurid headlines. The downmarket tabloid papers provide their readers with a mish-mash of coverage - last night's baseball and soccer results, photos and comics of scantily clad women, the latest in showbiz gossip and the recent goings on in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district. The sensational, and often bizarre stories, together with unrestrained assaults on the mainstream press and public figures, have continued to attract more readers. The top four sports tabloids - Sports Nippon, Nikkan Sports, Sankei Sports and Hochi Shimbun - with a total circulation of 2m, have seen their sales rise by 2 to 3 per cent a year, while circulation growth at the mainstream dailies has been flat for the past few years. The frustration among white collar salarymen as a result of the prolonged recession has also helped the tabloids' sales. The mocking captions, anti-establishment attitudes, and of course the smut, have even caught the imagination of elite businessmen, who strictly limit the scanning of such papers to the trains, away from office and home. Political coverage, usually tucked alongside advertisements for sex telephone lines and office workers' blue suits, has recently managed to find its way onto the outside pages. Bypassing any attempt at high-handed analysis, the tabloids have opted to provide their readers with frivolous information about politicians and the squabbles in Nagatacho, subjects usually untouched by the morning dailies. When the new cabinet was announced last week, Sports Nippon and Nikkan Sports carried tables which provided blood types, horoscopes, and heights and weights of all the ministers. Nikkan wondered if Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, a Virgo with blood type O, could manage the helm. With the political interests and coalition turmoil becoming too complicated for the tabloids - and the ordinary Japanese - to follow, the downmarket press have made things simpler by lambasting Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's strategist. Mr Ozawa's comparison of last week's creation of the parliamentary alliance 'Kaishin' or innovation, to an extra-marital affair was picked up by every tabloid. 'It doesn't matter how many women one sleeps with. If the Socialist Democrats feel jealous they have only to come and join us,' he said in response to the outcry among the socialist members, who have been strongly opposing any grand union among political parties. In an article beside a photo of Tonya Harding, the Nikkan Gendai called Mr Ozawa an 'immature and defective human being,' condemning his sexist slurs. Meanwhile the television commentators over the weekend poked fun at Mr Hata's questionable ability as a leader. One prime time programme offered film clips of newly appointed ministers clad in their 1920s-style suits, scrambling for photogenic positions at the ritual picture taking of the cabinet. Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, and Mr Mutsuki Kato, agriculture minister, seemingly unaware of the rolling camera, ignored Mr Hata's protests to let the 'women in the front,' and shoved aside fellow cabinet members to stand in the front row with the prime minister.</p>

The Statistics Bureau said the output of industrial firms  hit  366.4 billion yuan ($42.6 billion) in December, up 29.8 percent  from the same month in 1992.    The increase was 6.2 percent higher than the average  industrial output growth in 1993.    Bureau economists said banks eased their controls on the  money supply late last year, spurring industrial production at  the end of the year.    In December, banks lent 40.4 billion yuan ($4.7 billion)  more  than in the same month in 1992, they noted.    Inspired by the relaxed financial situation, retail sales  also jumped 35.3 percent over the same one-month period last  year to reach 155 billion yuan ($18 billion).    This was 5.6 percent higher than the year-on-year monthly  growth rate in November 1993.    The bureau said the rebound in production and sales was  partly attributable to the government's new reform measures.    In December, when the central government decided to reform  its tax system and further deregulate prices, grain and  household electrical appliances became hot sellers on the  domestic market.    The buying spree for agricultural products and  high-value-added durables triggered a year-on-year consumer  prices growth of 23.9 percent in the 35 largest cities, the  bureau noted.    The volume of grain sales increased by 1.41 million tons  over  December 1992.    The counter-measures adopted by the government have,  however,  worked to stabilize the market prices of grain and cooking oil,  while the State Council is taking steps to control the prices of  other commodities bureau officials said.    However, the taxes and profits generated by State firms  listed in the government budget also doubled from December 1992  to the last month of 1993.    State factories, which only experienced a 5.5 percent  increase in output in November last year, had a year-on-year  increase of 13.9 percent in output which totalled 174.9 billion  yuan ($20.3 billion).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Command of the Arab </F> Socialist Ba'th Party on ocassion of the party's 47th  anniversary in April]    [Text] O sons of our lofty nation, O militant Ba'thists:  [word indistinct] the 47th anniversary of the founding of your  party, the ASBP [Arab Socialist Ba'th Party], the masses of the  Arab nation and its militant pan-Arab and patriotic forces greet  this anniversary with the honor it deserves and extract from it  living meanings of the objectives of the contemporary Arab  revolution.    This prominent pan-Arab occasion represents a historic scene  full of good deeds carried out by generations that raised the  banner of the Ba'th and followed the path of the founder  president, may God have mercy on his soul, who illuminated our  road toward realizing the objectives of the great Ba'th Party  through his enlightened thought and generous sacrifices.    The 47th anniversary embodies the same spirit that prevailed  at the party's beginning, represented by the steadfastness of  great Iraq, under the leadership of mujahid comrade Saddam  Husayn, the symbol of our nation's struggle and the sign of its  glory and firm stands in defense of pan-Arabism and Islam. The  faithful people's conviction that the nation deserves its  affiliation to its deep- rooted history and to gain victory over  its enemies is becoming stronger.    It is an immortal anniversary that takes us back to the  starting point to become aware of the relation between the  founding of the party and the nation, and inspire us to carry  out historic action and embark on a message-bearing role in  accordance with the party's principles and in continuation of  its tradition, and shouldering the trust of Arab socialist,  democratic, and unionist struggle.    The founding of the party ushered in the beginning of ripe  pan- Arab and militant action and transformed it into a popular  movement capable of contributing to the civilized character of  the nation through long popular struggle against the factors of  its [word indistinct] and abandonment of its message-bearing  role.    The Ba'th movement has set the course of resurgence and  introduced organized and unified Arab action as a way to achieve  salvation. Since the beginning, the movement found itself  facing a difficult test and unique experience that require  seriousness, harmony with its objectives, and ability to work  for the nation through viewing life as a message and jihad.    After 47 years, the answers to the questions posed by Arab  struggle and its challenges to the party's vanguards and  organizations will continue to be linked to the readiness of the  Ba'thists to discuss facts frankly with the people and resort to  the party's militant principles and moral pillars represented in  truth, love for the people, unselfishness, and commitment to the  nation's interest and Party programs. All these principles and  pillars continue to be standards for evaluating the party's  march to determine how well this march is in line with the  principles and to remedy any contradiction with these principles.    The Ba'th Party has set its path based on faith in the  people  and the justice of the Arab cause, and through a special  approach and comprehensive vision of the contradictions in the  Arab situation. the party has worked, in an honest and  principled manner, to decisively confront this situation in the  interest of the masses. The close ties with reality and the  people provided the party with a firm opinion and position, and  the ability to predict the future and develop the experience in  order to know the facts of the historic stage and its trends,  based on the revolutionary Arab ideology.    The Ba'th Party has translated its deep-rooted ideology and  struggle, objective approach, and openness to the Arab and human  heritages. This gave the party its distinguished nature that  reflects the movement's characteristics and historic birth. The  Ba'th Party was founded during a stage full of totalitarian  ideologies and beliefs and integrated thoughts in the fields of  arts and social and human sciences, which had the ability to  influence. They enjoyed frameworks, establishments, and  political, economic, and cultural influence to the point that  they almost prevented the emergence of anything new and blocked  any living expression about the identities of the developing  peoples as a result of this influence and productivity.    The Ba'th has proven its presence by its comprehensive  ideology. It saved the Arab fate and Arab thought from  perdition, from imitation, and from being at the wrong end of  the stick. It emphasized its role as a positive and creative  movement whose establishment was dictated by the nation's  circumstances and its ambitious aspirations. This movement  resulted from the deeply felt spiritual tribulations of the  nation and from its values of freedom, justice, self-respect, as  well as its humanitarian approach.    The Ba'th did not confine its struggle to ready-made  ideologies or to rigid concepts that outline the desired Arab  society. It did not adopt a comprehensive universal outlook,  but remained committed to its role as a revolutionary and  faithful pan-Arab movement that will be working for hundreds of  years. It will not acquiesce to abridged missions, becoming  just an ideological school, or agree to a diminished size,  becoming only a movement held captive by improvised positions  and transient reactions. The Ba'th knows its civilized role and  the basic components of its effort to pinpoint the historical  moment through which the modern Arab resurgence is passing. The  Arab struggle for this resurgence coincides with an imbalance in  this age's materialistic civilization. This gives their  struggle a missionary and humanitarian dimension that  contributes to redressing this civilization and participating in  the establishment of a new world based on faith and spiritual  munificence. That is why the anniversary of the party's  establishment remains a constant call to return to the sources  of faith. The more time passes, the more the need to widen the  course of these sources, removing the residues and obstacles of  the experiment, so they can regain their purity.    The Ba'th assumed its role in shaping Arab unionist  awareness. It led the battle for values and objectives against  the forces of the fait accompli and the advocates of  isolationism and regionalism [word indistinct] its nation in  front of a conspiracy that seeks to return it to the era of  decline and stagnation. Thus, it assumed the responsibility of  moving the Arab state of affairs in an upward historical  direction. It maintained the incandescent flame of the pan-Arab  movement for half a century as a unionist and humanitarian  movement. Many unionist movements disappeared in many parts of  the world, gave up their role and their objectives and submitted  to international maneuvers and the interests of influential  countries at the expense of their aspirations and legitimate  objectives.    The secret of the Ba'th's pursuit of its vanguard pan-Arab  role is its confidence in the nation's capabilities. Struggle  can unleash the best potentials. This has made it, throughout  its history, the selfless friend of the Arab masses, waging the  Arab nation's fierce battles. It produced tangible results and  transformations for this nation, starting with its participation  in confronting the usurpation of Palestine, the constant  confrontation of Zionism and the reactionary alliances and  regimes, the attainment of the first unity in the modern Arab  history, the toppling of secessionist anti-Arab regimes deeply  involved in the conspiracies against unity, and the struggle to  attain the people's objectives, foremost being oil  nationalization, tackling issues of minorities, and setting up a  broad popular movement throughout the Arab homeland devoted to  championing the pan-Arab cause.    Topping the list of the Arab struggle's gains is the Ba'th  convergence with Iraqi spirit and aspirations, in a historical  meeting that expressed the depth of Iraq's militant and  civilized personality, unleashed its heroic potential, and  placed this militant country, after the success of the glorious  17-30 July Revolution, at the center of the Arab nation's battle  against the schemes to liquidate the Arab cause and the  conspiracies against the future. The Ba'th placed in Iraqi  hands, conscience, and minds the requisites for the major  unleashing of forces and the great achievements of a lofty  people.    With its civilized heritage and its unique past and present  pan- Arab role, not to mention its achievements in the field of  liberation, its sharp Arab perception, the audacity of its  Ba'thist vanguards, and the genius of its struggler leader  Comrade Saddam Husayn, Iraq has renewed its position under the  Ba'th banner as the focal point and shield protecting the nation  by freeing its political decision making and its economic,  scientific, and military achievements, burying the aggression at  the eastern gate of the Arab homeland in the glorious Saddam's  al-Qadisiyah. It embodies the brilliant face of resurgence and  is the proof of the nation's salubrity and the platform from  which it proceeds to liberate Palestine. From this premise,  Iraq's becoming the target for the abortion of the plan for Arab  resurgence reconfirms the importance of the strategic  imperialist constants in the Arab homeland. Thus, the Mother of  Battles summed up the importance of Arab security vis- a-vis the  perils it faces. In essence, it was of a defensive nature,  although it contained a spirit of rejection and confrontation of  the despot. It mobilized the nation's comprehensive outlook  toward the requisites of life, and expressed the commitment of  the will and the Arab moral and ethical configuration that does  not accept the prevalence of materialistic concepts and the  violation of Arab sovereignty and honor.    This clairvoyant perception of the values of truth and  justice has made the Arab nation fully aware of its posture and  of the inevitability of its victory in the battle of values.  This perception has made it possible to specify the points of  weakness among the ranks of the aggressors and to foresee the  imminent downfall of the powers of hegemony, despite their  unrestrained whims and the clamor of media disinformation that  aims at glorifying the sole superpower and embellishing its  arrogance.    Confidence about the future does not reflect unjustified  optimism. Rather, it is based on a profound understanding of  the Mother of Battles' repercussions and an ability to inspire  the masses of the Arab people. This confidence emerged after  the course of events was monitored, the international situation  was digested, the balances of power were assessed, and history  deeply studied. All this tells us that the enemies' course and  interests are in constant contradiction with human will. More  importantly, this confidence has provided a clear picture of the  Arab nation's abilities to be involved in great actions of jihad  and construction when requirements and factors of progress are  accompanied by genuine policies.    From the outset, it has been clear that the subsidence of  the  wave of unilateral control of the fate of the world is a matter  of time, which will not be long. This is clear despite the  heavy price paid by humanity, especially the Iraqi people, who  confronted a military aggression and continue to be subjected to  an oppressive siege, because of the continued unilateral  hegemony.    O sons of the glorious Arab nation, O Ba'thist strugglers:  The Ba'th Party has pointed out the modern pan-Arab movement's  maturity and ability to express its essence and objectives. At  the same time, the Ba'th Party continued to view pan-Arab issues  as a militant incentive and an instigator for yearning for an  Arab awakening. Arab unity was and will be a cultural framework  capable of maintaining the Arab nation's existence and ability  to remain at the level of its message. Unity will continue to  be the Arab nation's chance to achieve progress, improve its  status, and emphasize its united identity. Unity is not a  momentary need or a fallacy brought about by transient  circumstances or by dreamy ideological adventures. Therefore,  Arab unity is not a slogan raised today, to be forgotten  tomorrow. In the past, whenever they sensed weakness or  retrogression among the ranks of the Arab nation, hostile  foreign powers, reactionary regimes, and advocates of  parochialism attempted to undermine the idea of unity and waged  systematic wars against it. All this has one purpose, namely,  to ensure the role of the usurping Zionist entity as a force  obstructing Arab advancement.    The regional plans aiming at obliterating pan-Arab identity,  resisting Arab unity, and granting the Zionist entity geographic  legitimacy and a stronger hegemonic role have proved lame and  unachievable. Those plans take advantage of the climate of  retrogression and disintegration and the role of colluding Arab  regimes to weaken the trend of liberation, democracy, and unity,  and to distract the masses' attention from their battles and  real concerns. They offer false, useless solutions that only  increase the masses' poverty and dependence on foreigners. At  their best, such solutions can be described as being an  expression of the state of affairs of the impotent ones, not of  the Arab nation and its conscience.    The failure of regional policies and their role in weakening  joint Arab action can be responded to only by action in  accordance with a realistic, militant unionist plan, starting  with an objective understanding of the phases of the struggle  for unity and by providing the practical requirements for  advancement. This plan should replace impotent and deceptive  plans built on regional and international deals at the expense  of our people's interests, principles, and future.    O masses of our militant people: The Palestinian Arab issue  has remained a sensitive parameter that signals ebbs and tides  in our Arab situation. It has been a measure of the situation  of the masses and the level of their preparedness to wage major  battles. Since its establishment, our party has viewed this  issue as the essence of the Arab nation's ordeal and the core of  the Arab cause. This stand proceeds from the party's realization  of the extent of the danger posed by the Zionist scheme and the  Jewish state's role of obstructing the Arabs' natural unity.  the party's stand also stems from the prominent position of the  Palestine question in the conscience of the masses and in the  formulation of the modern pan- Arab consciousness and the Arab  masses' collective approach to the Palestine question as a  crucial issue.    Since its early beginnings, Palestine has been a basic part  of the Ba'th Party's struggle. the party has been present on  the Palestinian scene throughout all the stages of struggle,  offering known sacrifices that culminated in the Mother of  Battles and Iraq's glorious stand when the al-Husayn and  al-'Abbas missiles pounded the usurping entity. The armed  Palestinian resistance, the valiant intifadah, Iraq's victory in  the al-Qadisiyah battle, and the momentum provided by the Mother  of Battles have embodied the course of liberation, the need to  provide the requirements of balance with the enemy, and revived  hopes for the historic solution and set it as a strategic  target. In contrast, the abortion of the will of liberation,  emptying the Palestine question of its content, and the agent  Arab regimes' adoption of a course aiming at liquidating the  Palestine question have provided an atmosphere for maneuvers and  the adoption of political effort as an alternative that  disregards the resources of struggle, future chances, and the  positive factors that can lead to weakening the enemy front and  rectifying the regional and internal balances of power in our  nation's interest.    And thus involvement in political and informational work in  approaching the settlement strategy began to assume a more  clear-cut character. At the same time there was an increasing  loss of direction and a dilution of principles and enthusiasm  for liberation, caused by temptations to accommodate the status  quo under external and Arab pressures. The hardships to which  the Palestinian Arab people are being subjected are being used  as a pretext to recognize the Zionist enemy and to go along with  the scheme to transform the bulk of the land of Palestine into  disputed territory.    Developments unfolding in the Palestinian arena highlight  two  contradictory positions -- the position of the intifadah masses  adhering to the goal of liberation and the fight to get  recognition for the Palestinian people, and the position of the  so-called settlement and dealing with [words indistinct] or  reserve to achieve one strategy.    The bloody and outrageous massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque  redrew part of the picture after a long spell of haziness,  reminding Arabs and the world of the tragedies and ugliness of  occupation and the hidden intentions of aggression. It exposed  the lie of international legitimacy that is being driven into  the background by the savagery of Zionist terror. An incident  of this enormity provides fresh evidence of an aggressive nature  that warrants a determined stand against present challenges and  a better grasp of the truth about the enemy and the dichotomies  of the human and moral and cultural aspects of the Arab-Zionist  conflict.    The belittlement of our nation's rights and the Hebron  massacre's implications furnish proof that coexistence with an  enemy that denies the most basic conditions of life and  aggresses against the most cherished sanctities is an  impossibility.    Thus, the wretched attempts at brain-washing and cutting us  off from our history in order to transform Palestine into a  bridge for the Zionists to cross into the region are part of the  culture of what was termed peace and settlement that seeks to  promote the slogan of absorbing the Zionist entity. Such a  slogan was bandied about in the past as a test balloon by  suspect circles and reactionary regimes to sound out the  reaction of the masses. This slogan was meant to serve sinister  ends. It has been repeated [words indistinct] supported by a  variety of factors to trumpet the humanitarian dimension of  containing the Zionist entity, given our nation's potential  possession of the edge promoting the notion that the Arab nation  can afford to accept peace and conciliation with Israel and  recognize its theft of Palestine today with an eye to winning  the conflict in the future. This is an oversimplification  caused by shortsightedness. The Zionist entity's existence is  an imperialist creation brought about by division, subservience,  and backwardness. This fact does not fall under the heading of  a normal exchange of normal relations in the region. Palestine  is the focal point of a vibrant pan-Arab struggle, and will  remain so until it retrieves its Arabism. The Palestinian cause  has assumed its status as a central issue for Arabs by virtue of  the fact that Palestine was stolen, and due to the very nature  of the conflict. The political dimension of the issue has  assumed a special dimension. We should, therefore, refuse to  marginalize it and thwart the Arab regimes' attempts to ignore  it. This is despite the importance of other central Arab issues  that determine the directions of Arab struggle and engage the  attention of the masses.    Our Arab nation views the Palestinian issue as a central  cause. The conspiracies to liquidate it only underscore the  importance of working to help it, pursuing the patient struggle  for liberating Palestine. For this reason, the masses of the  occupied territories are providing the finest examples of  courage and heroism and adherence to rights. They are turning  the chapters of the tragedy of occupation and coercion into fine  chapters of jihad, just as the uprising of the Arab masses in  Egypt was an eloquent response to the advocates of normalization  and a damnation of the regime that imperialism had devoted to  advance its agenda.    These features that throb with the preparations of the Arab  masses to pursue the struggle are the most conclusive proof that  the Arab nation has wagered on its own resources and the  awareness of its children as they counter attempts to sell the  settlement to our nation.    Militant Arab masses; militant Ba'thists: Since the Ba'th  took its first steps in the struggle, it has undertaken the  responsibility of instilling the spirit of faith and freedom and  confidence in the Arab nation. Its militants have pledged  themselves to a disciplinary line that reinforces in them and  the Arab masses the feeling of pride in our history and the Arab  character and a cultural role enemical to shaky allegiances and  a fascination with the glitter of false modernity.    For decades, it has continued to champion a meeting of  hearts and minds between progressive Arabism and Islam, between  the Arab character and Islam, to promote communication with  nations and peoples to advance the causes of mankind. In this  context, the intellectual, spiritual, cultural, military, and  political victory scored in the glorious battle of Saddam's  al-Qadisiyah has provoked the aggression, because the  colonialist West succumbed to its aggressive instincts and  reestablished the complexes dwelling within its centuries-old  memories to nip in the bud the potential for true renaissance  demonstrated by Muslims and Arabs, to neutralize them by  crippling the forceful role of Iraq, which embodies the Arabs'  quest for progress as well as the heroic defense of Arabism and  Islam.    Hence, the jihad waged in the Mother of Battles was the  epitome of adherence to principles, a manifestation of the  determination to uphold basic values pertaining to the freedom  of peoples, and an attempt to promote international relations to  free them from the spirit of custodianship, and of the  domination of world colonialism.    Our nation's discourse in its jihad mission, manifested in  addresses by the leader of the faithful grouping, mujahid  comrade Saddam Husayn, strengthened the people's hope that the  new wave of domination would subside, that the forces of faith  and jihad would triumph against brutal powers and tyrannical  invaders everywhere.    In this climate, which was highly significant and in which  intentions became crystal clear, steadfastness turned into a  living example, and began to bear fruit. The rejection of and  opposition to the U.S.-Zionist hegemonic course and its tyranny  have begun to be felt, particularly after the halo surrounding  this course began to fade because it does not uphold the values  of justice and equality, because it opposes the peoples'  interests and aspirations, because contradictions exist among  those who enjoy spheres of influence and want to share the  booty, and because of the emergence of the dynamism of  scientific and technological advancement, which is bound to  impact on the international economic situation, thanks to the  newly-created regional blocs that are increasingly affecting  international relations by various means.    The militant and patient Somali people have set another  splendid example by vindicating the peoples' rights, as well as  their ability to resist foreign intervention and the violation  of national sovereignty. The Somali people have been able to  make the aggressive Western alliance leave their territory,  defeated and at a loss, not to mention the grave moral and  political losses it sustained.    Day after day, the attempts and pressure to impose U.S.  domination subside. These attempts and pressures are no longer  useful, given the fact that there is less need for U.S. military  protection in various parts of the world due to the end of the  Cold War, and because the U.S. role in international investments  is declining. Consequently, the United States has lost the  seminal momentum in the world economy that it used to expand its  influence.    Hence, threats to use force and pressure are becoming  burdensome at a time when such threats cannot serve as a means  to promote what officials called the new world order, which has  proven to be a cover for evasion and deception. This has  prompted some quarters that promoted this order to act against  it, and to utterly abandon it.    The evidence for this is that the international policy  pursued in the context of the unipolar order is experiencing a  bottleneck. This is because the game of involving basic values  and human destiny in international politics has backfired. The  covers and slogans of democracy, human rights, anti-war  sentiment, and environmental protection have called into serious  question the double standards employed, as manifested in the  successive crises and the marathon race to reclaim colonialist  influence. This has demonstrated the lack of balance, as well  as the propaganda content of all the political covers used by  hegemonic forces.    Consequently, the upcoming phase is that of the erosion of  hegemony after it was used to oppress and punish peoples, and to  threaten their security and sovereignty with economic boycott,  aggression, and economic embargoes. At the same time, it is the  phase in which the rejection of domination and subjugation will  mature and turn into international rebellion and disobedience.  What is currently taking place in Russia is a referendum on its  independent national choices. It is a manifestation of the  importance of rehabilitating its international role and its  national pride, which was trampled by the United States and its  allies. This trampling of pride has become so objectionable  that the Russian people are being pressured into abandoning all  components of their sovereignty in return for deceptive and  sweet promises that have caused Russia to lose its unique  standing among the international community of nations. Russia  has almost become subservient.    O sons of our glorious Arab nation; O you militant  Ba'thists:  On this glorious anniversary, one cannot escape the analogy  between the phase in which the party was launched and the  current phase in terms of the need to reestablish an Arab  consciousness of the rules of the game at this point in time,  the need to end the state of stagnation, and the need to work to  reactivate intellectual and militant thought to highlight the  jihad implications of the Mother of Battles and the spirit of  heroism epitomized by the unique leadership of leader President  Saddam Husayn, given the qualitative challenge the Mother of  Battles posed to the nation, the challenge that is targeting the  axioms of the pan-Arab struggle.    Therefore, Arab strugglers are required to make persistent  moves to promote their struggle, because this is required by the  need to rid the potential for renaissance of the burdensome  negative phenomena which have pushed Arabs backwards. This is a  must if we are to have a good understanding of the dialectics of  renaissance and decline, an understanding that enables us to  cope with the current circumstances and employ proper  intellectual and aggressive criteria to reach an objective  assessment of the phenomena of this dialectic.    Spontaneous popular vigilance during the Mother of Battles  was the result of an awareness of Iraq's pan-Arab stand and  national awakening. Responsibility for maintaining clarity and  developing the struggle require the consolidation of the masses  with jihad principles and the enlightenment of the people about  the objectives of the nation's battle, its historical depth, and  cultural content.    Our nation's fate is to repulse the colonialist foreign  onslaught, prevent infiltration into national ranks, and stop  the exacerbation of its contradictions. We must hold fast to  the principled course in order to remain steadfast in the face  of old and new plots.    The forces of the Arab nation can abort the plots of  fragmentation and the internationalization of internal problems.  They can mobilize their potential to lift the blockade of Iraq  and coordinate their plans and stands to reject hegemony and  plots of submission. They can maintain their gains with the  unity of the Arab masses and reinforce democratic and united  achievements.    In light of the Arab masses' struggle, history, and  objectives, militant action should be revived in national and  pan-Arab life to restore the shining face and honorable role of  popular Arab struggle. Our political parties and unions, our  Arab intellectual and artistic bodies, and all vital  organizations in the nation are required to wage the decisive  battle -- each according to their position and capabilities --  to maintain the spirit of resistance of the Mother of Battles.  They are called on to wage an uprising to decide the fate of  our conflict against occupation and aggression, on the path of  awakening and cultural rejuvenation.    The living nations, which face difficult circumstances and  wage struggle, look forward to turning events, no matter how  great they are, into factors of strength for the future.    Let all honest good people pool their efforts to prepare the  factors of steadfastness and confrontation on the basis of  principled and historical grounds so the achievements of the  Arab revolution and struggle will be established deep in the  heart of Arabs and human history.    By providing a creative framework to move the masses, and by  establishing a large-scale militant Arab front in light of a  faithful future pan-Arab plan, our nation will restore its  strength and proceed with its jihad to resume its cultural role.  It will seize the historic initiative through the strength of  principles and the will of people.    On the party's anniversary, Ba'thists call on our nation to  sharpen their determination, to move toward the integration and  unity of the Arab struggle strategy, and to develop formulas and  levels of action to hallmarks of steadfastness and victory and  to build the new Arab homeland and new Arab individuals who know  their role and who have faith in their mission.    Long live the Arab nation and its steadfast sons in Iraq and  Palestine in defense of Arab future and rights. Long live the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the symbol of the nation's unity and  the inspirer of its generations. Faithful greetings to the  Ba'th founder and the inspirer of its generations. Greetings of  love to the mujahid leader Comrade Saddam Husayn, the knight of  the nation and the leader of its awakening.    Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of our  nation;  the martyrs of Palestine, the Ba'th, the al-Qadisiyah, and the  Mother of Battles; all the martyrs of its crucial causes.    [Signed] The National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party, April 1994</p>

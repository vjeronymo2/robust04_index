			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Thyssen Given the deteriorating German economy, it is natural to wonder whether yesterday's dividend cut from Thyssen will be its last. After all, British Steel cut its dividend last year only to omit its interim this. Germany may not yet be facing a UK-style recession, but its steel producers confront some particular handicaps compared with European rivals whose currencies have devalued. Still, things would have to get much worse for Thyssen's new dividend, which is nearly twice covered, to come under threat. Yesterday's preliminary - and incomplete - figures suggest that operating profits held up better than many expected. The 33 per cent fall in 1991-92 net profit will have been struck only after as yet undisclosed provisions for steel rationalisation which should boost net profits by some DM200m from 1993-94. The question for the current year is how much other businesses will contribute to offset continuing weakness in steel. Budd will clearly benefit from any US recovery, and there may be a modest gain from a stronger dollar. But the German market for capital goods will hardly be anything other than depressed. Even a secure net yield just below 4 per cent thus looks low. Earnings will doubtless snap back with economic recovery, but that will need help from the Bundesbank.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VISIT TO POLICE OPEN HOUSE PROVES A HAPPY DUD  </P> <P> A Westchester man stumbled on a mortar shell while housecleaning Saturday, and  assuming the worst, he loaded the explosive in a car and drove two blocks to  the nearest Los Angeles police station.  </P> <P> And although the vintage shell was a dud, no one knew for sure until about  11:15 a.m., when police declared safe the area around the Police Department's  Southwest Division station on West Martin Luther King Boulevard, Sgt. Tim Tyree  said.  </P> <P> Frank Nalepa, 35, took his discovery to the station at 9:45 a.m., pulling up to  the curb at the station's front doors with the 8-inch-long, 60-millimeter shell  in the back seat.  </P> <P> The Westchester man, who said he found the shell in a garage while helping  relatives clean out a Harvard Boulevard house to ready it for sale, suspected  his find was an inactive souvenir but vowed not to take chances. "Instead of  leaving it for the next owner, I figured I'd take it to somebody who could  dispose of it properly."  </P> <P> Police reacted by closing off a one-block stretch of Martin Luther King  Boulevard and evacuating people from an auto repair shop and a restaurant  across the street, Tyree said. Bomb squad officers were then called to examine  the device and haul it away, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, inside the station, about 20 officers who were on duty were told to  go to the back of the building and stay there while the mortar shell was  investigated. Another 70 or so people, including police and local residents  attending the station's first open house, were already milling about a parking  lot in the rear of the building.  </P> <P> "We were real low-key about it," Tyree said, noting the open house was held  behind the station and away from the commotion. "And they thought it was part  of our everyday routine."  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Bossi holds up coalition deal The populist Northern League led by Mr Umberto Bossi is holding up the formation of Italy's 53rd postwar government by insisting on his party being given the key Interior Ministry portfolio. The dispute over the post was due to have been settled on Tuesday night at dinner hosted by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the premier-designate and Forza Italia leader, for Mr Bossi and Mr Gianfranco Fini, head of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The MSI/NA is the third main partner in the Freedom Alliance that won the March general elections. Yesterday, however, the issue was still unresolved and Mr Bossi called for a 'period of reflection'. He threatened earlier this week to stay out of the government if the League failed to get the post for one of its members; the principal candidate is Mr Roberto Maroni, the movement's number two. Mr Bossi is gambling that Mr Berlusconi will not wish to form a government with the neo-fascist MSI as Forza Italia's main ally.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECORDING THE EXOTIC;  </P> <P> VISUAL ANTHROPOLOGY HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE FILMING OF 'NANOOK OF THE  NORTH'  </P> <P> Timothy Asch, director of USC's Center for Visual Anthropology, sees a  not-too-distant day when new anthropological research will be published  complete with accompanying films, stored on a 3-inch videodisc in a pocket  inside the book jacket.  </P> <P> Asch, who co-produced with anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon a series of  ground-breaking films on the fierce Yanomamo Indians of South America, sees a  number of ways in which his science will benefit from the explosion of video  technology, which puts ever-more-sophisticated cameras into ever-smaller and  easier-to-use packages.  </P> <P> "The type of knowledge and expertise that anthropologists have could, in  collaboration with ethnographic film makers, turn into a tremendous resource,"  Asch told an audience at the 12th annual Symposium of Man held recently at Cal  State Fullerton.  </P> <P> The use of film to record non-Western cultures is nothing new, stretching back  at least to "Nanook of the North," Robert Flaherty's famed 1921 docudrama about  an Eskimo family. Since the '20s, cultural anthropologists have often turned to  film as a way to record the people and cultures they study.  </P> <P> But sound synchronization in the field was not practical until about 1960, and  film equipment has until recently been cumbersome and difficult to use under  the often-trying conditions that greet anthropologists. Advances in film and  especially video technology, developed primarily for the entertainment  industry, have revolutionized ethnographic film making, Asch said.  </P> <P> As director of the USC master's degree program in visual anthropology, Asch is  training film makers who will collaborate with field anthropologists to record  data that was once the exclusive domain of notebook and sketch pad.  </P> <P> One advantage to recording a culture on film or video is that several  scientists can view the same piece of data, rather than having to rely on one  person's observations, according to noted ethnographic film maker Patsy Asch,  Timothy's wife. In some instances, the ability to repeatedly view a film is  another advantage, as in the case of dance kinesics or studying intricate  rituals.  </P> <P> But most importantly, the films often serve as a final record of many tribal  cultures that are being decimated by the destruction of tropical forests and by  other encroachments of civilization.  </P> <P> "The tribal world is disappearing at a staggeringly high rate, one that is  accelerating on a day-by-day basis," said Chagnon, another of the panelists. A  professor at UC Santa Barbara since 1984, Chagnon's 25 years of studying the  Yanomamo has formed the basis of one of the best-known case studies in cultural  anthropology, one that is found in most introductory textbooks.  </P> <P> Chagnon, who concentrates on Yanomamo tribes in southern Venezuela, said he has  seen changes in the culture each time he returns (13 visits, totaling 50  months). The Yanomamo of northern Brazil, meanwhile, have been virtually wiped  out in recent years, since the discovery of gold on their land in 1987  attracted more than 40,000 prospectors virtually overnight.  </P> <P> The Yanomamo of southern Venezuela, meanwhile, may have a better chance of  survival precisely because the films of Tim Asch and Chagnon have given them a  place in the public consciousness, Chagnon believes.  </P> <P> "There are groups like the Yanomamo and the bushmen (of southwest Africa's  Kalahari Desert) who have become very, very significant in the minds of lots  and lots of people," Chagnon said. "Because they have been documented in a very  positivistic, straightforward, scientific way, (that) can now be used to help  them to survive the destruction that is going on. . . . They have become  symbols. They represent the tragedy of all other tribal people in all places on  Earth."  </P> <P> Apart from Chagnon's assertions on the potential political uses of ethnographic  film, other panelists raised doubts about its scientific importance.  </P> <P> "I don't think that technology is going to save us," said Jay Ruby, an  anthropology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia and editor of the  journal, Visual Anthropology. "CD ROMs and 8-mm video and high-resolution  television are not going to help us think."  </P> <P> Rather than training more people to make movies, Ruby suggested teaching  students how to analyze and interpret filmed data. "I think we're drowning in a  sea of images, and I'd like to argue that we take fewer pictures and start  thinking more, because I'm very bored with continually seeing basically the  same lame ideas on the screen," Ruby said.  </P> <P> "I work with some students who are just technological wizards but don't have a  single thing to say," Ruby said. "They're all dressed up with nowhere to go."  </P> <P> One panelist, John Homiak, is an archivist with the Human Studies Film Archives  at the Smithsonian Institution. More than 5 million feet of film and video are  stored in the archives, Homiak said, but he thinks the resource is woefully  under-utilized.  </P> <P> That is largely because most anthropologists want to make their name with their  own field research, Tim Asch said, rather than by studying the research of  other anthropologists. But, he added, the collected films and videos will take  on more importance as time goes on and the tribal cultures recorded for  posterity continue to be diluted and sometimes obliterated.  </P> <P> Imagine, he said, if there existed a film record of an Aztec sacrifice, or of a  vintage performance of Shakespeare's "King Lear" at the Globe Theatre. It may  be 100 or 200 years before the archives are truly utilized.  </P> <P> "You have to go for the long term," Asch argued. "It's important to take visual  anthropology seriously."  </P></p>

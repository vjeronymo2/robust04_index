			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan sluggish despite labour accord SUMMER holidays in Europe, and the Independence Day holiday in the US were reflected in low turnover figures from bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN surprised many observers by not performing as strongly as expected following the weekend agreement on wages. The Comit index closed up 2.77 at 540.83. The labour accord raises hopes of a cut in interest rates in the near future, probably in the order of 50 basis points, analysts remarked. However, in spite of this positive news, the overall mood continued to be dampened by Ferruzzi group shares, with Montedison losing another L40 or 5.5 per cent to L680. The chairman of the Consob is due to testify today to parliament on the group's situation. Telecommunications stocks, which have been one of the strongest performing sectors in recent weeks, also eased on worries that privatisation might be delayed: Stet lost L40 to L3,610. FRANKFURT eased in quiet trading, the DAX index sliding 5.64 to 1,692.17 as turnover fell from DM6.2bn to DM4.6bn and Siemens and Volkswagen came under pressure. Siemens finished DM3.30 lower at DM612.50 after the electrical major made downwards revisions to its 1992-93 sales and orders forecasts and said that earnings would be hit by the overall rise of the D-Mark against the dollar. A large sell order, technical consolidation after recent strong gains and further developments in the inter-company strife over the departure of Mr Ignacio Lopez from GM to Volkswagen left VW DM4.50 lower at DM355.80. Among second liners, Altana fell DM8.70 to DM506.20 as Dresdner launched a DM100m Eurobond issue for the company. ZURICH consolidated, some investors selling chemicals for banks ahead of the banking sector's half-year results season. Dealers said that the pressure on chemicals was light as Ciba-Geigy bearers fell SFr14 to SFr697 and the SMI index fell 4.8 to 2,364.0. UBS bearers made the strongest showing in the banking sector, rising SFr18 to SFr1,134. Hoare Govett says in a review of European banks that there is considerable further upside before the banks even get close to the ratings which they enjoyed before they began their long period of underperformance in the mid-1980s. PARIS drifted lower in an unenthusiastic session, the CAC-40 index losing 15.72 to 1,925.44. Turnover was also low at FFr1.8bn. Rhone-Poulenc, which announced last week a four-for-one share split next Monday, and yesterday set a price of FFr563 for the sale of its 35 per cent stake of Rousell Uclaf, lost FFr14 to FFr571. MADRID's turnover fell from Pta16.5bn to Pta9.3bn as the general index closed 1.97 lower at 257.42, Banesto falling Pta80 to Pta2,155 as James Capel described it as 'at best a hold'. AMSTERDAM saw a good gain in KLM, up Fl 1.00 to Fl 27.10 but otherwise the market was negative and the CBS Tendency index finished off 0.2 at 112.3. HELSINKI rose on strength in Nokia, up FM6 at FM191, together with low money market rates. The shares have been helped higher by news last week that it was to increase the size of an international share placement. The Hex index gained 2.62 per cent to close at 1,204.0. VIENNA fell by 1.7 per cent but volume was reported low as the ATX index fell 14.55 to 825.45. TEL AVIV, down 1.4 per cent, lost most of Sunday's gains in a late sell-off as the Mishtanim blue chip index lost 2.78 to 197.17 in active turnover of Shk226m. WARSAW shot up again, this time by 8.9 per cent as the WIG passed the 4,000 barrier for the first time to close at 4,005.1. Turnover was high at 478.1bn zloty (Dollars 28m). ISTANBUL was depressed by weekend violence in central Anatolia where 36 people were killed and the composite index lost 97.7 to 11,697.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 5                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                   Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1196.82    1196.91    1197.62    1197.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1252.22    1252.94    1254.00    1253.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                  13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1197.12    1197.03    1196.89    1197.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1252.62    1251.48    1252.81    1253.51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 2     Jul 1    Jun 30    Jun 29    Jun 28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1201.31   1213.21   1208.99   1207.97   1210.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1259.19   1270.98   1266.14   1263.58   1265.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1198.27; 200 - 1254.06 Low/day: 100 - 1196.45; 200 - 1251.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

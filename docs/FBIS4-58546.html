			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, May 4, IRNA -- An informed source in German  Government here Tuesday quoted British circles as saying that  there is no evidence to link Iran with the Irish Republican Army  (IRA).    While British press and the government have added fuel to  London's latest smear campaign, other European official sources  have ignored the matter.    A German Foreign Ministry spokesman Tuesday told IRNA that  his government can not comment on British accusation against  Iran.    According to Swiss "NEUE ZUERCHER ZEITUNG" the British  Government's allegation is based on MI6 intelligence service of  that country.    The paper also said that the British intelligence service  has  provided a Greek paper with the information on Iran's aid to the  IRA, to give London the pretext to take diplomatic measures  against the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

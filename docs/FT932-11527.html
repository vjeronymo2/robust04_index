			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Smaller companies lead recovery SMALL manufacturing companies are leading the economy out of recession with the first improvement in output for three years, the Confederation of British Industry's Smaller Firms' Trends Survey published today shows. On balance, manufacturers reporting an increase in output in the four months to April outnumbered those reporting a decline by 4 percentage points. This increase was lower than had been expected in January but contrasted with the manufacturing sector as a whole, which recorded output broadly unchanged, the CBI said. Business optimism also rose by a balance of 33 percentage points, the largest margin for six years. Export orders were the main area of improvement for both small and large companies. The survey, the first such by the CBI since the March Budget, covered 800 companies with fewer than 200 employees. Further increases in output over the next four months are expected by 21 per cent of companies on balance. A net balance of 25 per cent of small companies expect orders to increase in the next quarter. Small companies broadly expect to maintain their spending on plant and machinery over the next 12 months but a balance of 16 per cent intend to make further cuts in investments in buildings. In general, small companies are more optimistic about investment than larger ones. Small company spending on training and innovation is expected to increase. The rate of job-shedding has slowed markedly and is much lower than among manufacturing companies as a whole. Small companies expecting to take on staff over the next four months outnumber those expecting to cut jobs by 3 percentage points. In export markets more small companies were able to raise prices than cut them for the first time since April 1991. Domestic prices, however, continued to be cut, although at a much slower rate. Both export and domestic prices are expected to increase over the next four months. Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said: 'This is good news for the smaller sector and for the creation of wealth in our economy as a whole.' Britain has missed out as an innovator in the manufacture of specialist equipment to protect the environment, says a report published by a House of Lords committee today.

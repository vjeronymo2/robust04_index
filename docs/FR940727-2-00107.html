Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Section A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 205 relating to the execution of odd-lot orders (1) to eliminate the odd-lot differential for market and limit orders; (2) amend provisions relating to the price at which odd-lot limit orders are executed; and (3) delete, reposition or re-number various provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders in Rule 205, Section B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current Exchange rules, market odd-lot orders to buy or sell, as well as marketable limit orders, are executed with no differential charged. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> orders to buy or sell ``at the close''). In order to enhance the competitiveness of Exchange odd-lot execution procedures, the Exchange has determined to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders (except for non-regular way executions under proposed Section C(2) of the rule) without a differential. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures for executing odd-lot market orders are currently being implemented on a pilot basis, extended until August 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33584 (February 7, 1994), 59 FR 6983 (February 14, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 205, Section A(2) would require that limited orders to buy (sell) be executed at the price of the first round lot transaction which is at or below (above) the specified limit price (the ``effective transaction'' price). Sell limited orders marked ``short'' would be executed at the price of the first round lot transaction which is at or above the specified limit and which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick). Marketable limit orders would continue to be executed in accordance with procedures applicable to market orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> limited orders to buy an offer, sell on bid, ``immediate or cancel''; buy or sell marked ``or on close'') would be deleted. Provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades in Section C would be deleted and subsumed by new Section C(2) (Non-Regular Way Trades). A differential could be charged on such executions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (26): Year of hope and disappointment - Russia / John Lloyd looks at a country both moving forward and stuck, trembling on the brink of development, yet still with a deep inhibition at every level RUSSIA'S reforms have stalled. Inflation in August reached nearly 30 per cent, production continues to fall (though at a slower rate than earlier this year),foreign investment is estimated to be no more than Dollars 1bn in this current year, oil production continues to decline, the budget is in huge deficit and the tax take is falling. The history of the past year has been one of hope and disappointment - a typical cycle in Russian reform since the late Eighties, when a turn to the market was first adumbrated in the reform-Communist period ushered in by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. In this context, the hope was the apparent victory within the cabinet for the renewal of a tough macroeconomic policy under the leadership of Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of finance, with the support of other reformers in the cabinet: a policy which had the explicit support of President Boris Yeltsin and, abroad, of the Group of Seven industrial countries, which pledged a headline figure of Dollars 44bn to support Russia. The hopes were raised by the convincing victory won by President Yeltsin in the referendum on trust in himself and his policies on April 25: and further strengthened by his declaration of intent to move to a new constitution and new elections in the near future. A timetable had been mapped out, a structure given, a sense of confidence engendered. The disappointment has come when these hopes have not been realised. The static conflict between president and parliament which the referendum was thought to have broken has re-formed, more intractable than ever. Inflation, said to have been curbed and brought down to 15 per cent a month, has gone back to 30 per cent: the main reason, say the reform economists, is the continued issuing of credits by the Central Bank in defiance of an agreement with the government to keep credit advances on a declining curve through the end of the year. Sure it is that a Central Bank with a different philosophy from that of the government is a source of instability: however, it is fair to say that the government itself has lost what coherence it had. At least two rival conceptions of how to run the economy fight it out within the cabinet: one, put up by Mr Fyodorov and nominally accepted by the president, would continue the line of relatively tight controls, while the other, put up by Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy prime minister for the economy, calls for extra state investments, an end to voucher privatisation and an explicit acknowledgement that reforms cannot continue through the macroeconomic means once favoured. In such conditions, the IMF, which has since the beginning of 1992 acted as the facilitator and watchdog of the reform process, has considered itself to have had no choice but to delay implementation of the programme agreed by the Group of Seven in spring of this year. Though no final decision has yet been announced, it seems clear that the second tranche (Dollars 1.5bn) of the Systemic Transformation Facility created as a way of injecting support into the Russian budget quickly will not be paid this year - and will not be paid at all until the Russian house is put in order. This may concentrate the minds: and it is possible that reforms will be put back on track. A clutch of reform-minded Ministers besides Mr Fyodorov - chief among them Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation - continue to fight, and sometimes to win, battles for the cause of creating a market economy. However, the balance of power seems to be swinging against them: and even if they remain in the cabinet, their authority is narrowing and their useful political lives - at least this time round, for these are young men - appear to be shortening. It is hard to say, however, how far the demise of this reform group will destroy reform. Clearly, stabilisation of the currency, a real lowering of inflation and the imparting of a renewed dynamism to Russian enterprises are not likely in the near future. Clearly, too, the men who wait to succeed the reformers are those who would continue, albeit in modified form, many of the central-command-economy practices with which they still feel most familiar. The doubt concerns what has already been released from central control - or rather how amenable it is to coming under control once more. Russia is, at least in part, a European country with a relatively well educated citizenry  -the most well educated of which, moreover, are now picking up new methods of work and study as the old system decays about them. Privatisation, above all, continues - albeit fitfully. Large numbers of small businesses and shops have been privatised. Enterprises of medium and large size are also now coming under the hammer, and some giants are now in the private sector. It is the case that the shops are still as surly as ever and (to Western eyes) uninviting: it is the case, too, that the enterprise culture remains the same, with 'private' managers still demanding soft credits from the state to keep often unviable enterprises, or unwanted production, on the road. But private enterprises are not the same as state ones. The onus has passed to the government to wean the plants off the state by refusing easy credit. Managers may still be kept afloat, but they must also make deals and even find markets in ways they did not before. It is far from a consumer or an enterprise society: to the new arrival, it appears forbidding, grimy and obsolescent: the barriers and impediments accumulated over decades are too great for a revolution of that kind to happen quickly. But the fact that some movement is visible from below moderates the pessimism gained from the view from above: it gives the observer a double vision, of a country both moving forward and stuck: trembling on the brink of development, yet still with a deep inhibition at every level.</p>

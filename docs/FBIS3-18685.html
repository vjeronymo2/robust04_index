			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Martin Winter report: "Remembrance Without German </F> Diplomats"]    [Text] At Chancellor Kohl's wish, German diplomats have  been forbidden to attend celebrations held in their host  countries to commemorate "military events during the last few  months of WWII." To participate in celebrations aimed at "peace  and reconciliation," the diplomats need individual permits from  Bonn.    The confidential circular, whose existence was confirmed to  FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU by the Foreign Ministry on Friday [4  March], mainly concerns the embassies in France and the Benelux  countries. These countries will hold celebrations in 1994 to  commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Allied forces' fight  against the Germans. The major event of this kind will be the  one commemorating the landing of the Allied forces in Normandy  on 6 June 1944, which began the liberation of France from the  German occupiers.    The reason behind this ban is that Kohl is annoyed with the  Allies. According to U.S. and French Government circles, Kohl  had again tried informally to get an invitation this year as he  had done 10 years ago on the occasion of the 40-year anniversary  events. Like 10 years ago, Kohl was told this time that only the  heads of government of the Allied countries would take part in  this celebration. Thus, U.S. President Bill Clinton, French  President Francois Mitterrand, and Queen Elizabeth II will meet  in Normandy in June.    According to the circular, which, coalition circles say, was  produced at the chancellor's express wish, diplomats are not  allowed to attend smaller events either. The reason that  diplomatic circles give for this unusual ban is that many of the  celebrations are purely military in character, in which one does  not want to participate. According to diplomats, this circular  is, however, a distinct change over previous years, when there  was no strict ban of this kind.    The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] considers this  circular to be a "setback" for relations with these countries.  SPD Foreign policy spokesman Karsten Voigt said that "the steel  helmet faction has got its way" in the Foreign Ministry and the  Chancellor's Office. These people still fail to realize that  "the German Reich had to take a defeat so that the German people  could be liberated."</p>

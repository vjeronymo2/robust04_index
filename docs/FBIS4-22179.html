			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Genrikh Ongirskiy, deputy general designer </F> at the "Antonov" Aviation Scientific-Technical Complex, by Yuriy  Kozlov under "Aircraft" rubric: "`Water Is Up to Our Chin but We  Are Still Breathing'"]    [Text] The "Antonov" Aviation Scientific-Technical  Complex [ANTK] was established in 1946 by the outstanding  aircraft designer Oleg Antonov. Since that time more than 100  types and modifications of aircraft of different classes and  purposes have been built. Apparently there was no one in the  USSR and there is now no one in the CIS who has not flown in AN  aircraft at least once in his life. Transport aircraft such as  the "Ruslan" or "Mriya," passenger aircraft, specialized  aircraft for agriculture, aerial photography, and forest  firefighting, polar aircraft, and other AN's are being exported  to 42 countries of the world.    The disintegration of the Union may have hit the aerospace  industry of the once united country hardest of all. The  "Antonov" ANTK was afflicted with the same problems as other  enterprises of the branch that suddenly found themselves on  different sides of borders and customhouses. Difficulties with  component parts, nonpayments, low wages, cutbacks, the loss of  specialists, and spasmodic searches for new partners -- all this  is also happening at "Antonov." Nevertheless, the aviation  scientific-technical complex is continuing to develop new  aircraft and to modify models that were built earlier. The  following aircraft are in the stage of research, project  planning, or production: AN-218, AN-180, AN-140, AN-138, AN-70T,  AN-74T-200, AN-74TK-200, AN-72P (patrol aircraft), AN-32 (polar  aircraft), and other heavy, superheavy, and multipurpose models.    Is it possible for the aerospace complex divided between the  countries of the CIS to work for the good of the new states or  are Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the other  republics of the former USSR destined to become "aviation  boondocks"? "This must not be allowed, otherwise our competitors  will immediately replace us in the world and domestic markets,"  thinks Genrikh Ongirskiy, deputy general designer at the  "Antonov" ANTK.    [Kozlov] Genrikh Genrikhovich, you must agree that only a  superpower can afford to have and develop an aerospace industry.  At one time the USSR was such a superpower. Now there is no  USSR. What is the state of its aerospace industry?    [Ongirskiy] I think that despite all the political and  economic difficulties Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan -- the  largest aviation plant in the former Union is located there --  are successfully preserving the scientific-technical potential  of the recently united complex. Although, of course, young  specialists are leaving us.    [Kozlov] Are you trying to say that the complex remains  alive  because of the veterans who have nowhere to go?    [Ongirskiy] Everywhere in the world it is above all the  people who have worked for many years in the aviation and  aerospace industry who are most appreciated there. Their  knowledge and experience are considered to be national property.  When such a specialist in the United States, for example, leaves  a firm, he is obliged to leave his address and telephone number  so that at any moment they can find him and hire him or invite  him for consultation. Here, let us say in the CIS, it is  dedicated people who work in aviation. There are practically no  random people. I, for example, joined an air club at the age of  12 and took the traditional route: I built models, was the  champion of the Union in the sport of model airplane building,  did parachute jumping, and flew on a glider. I have nowhere to  go from aviation and will remain there until the end. And there  are many people like me. For this reason, a core work force has  remained at practically all aviation firms.    [Kozlov] The organizational will has disappeared, as has the  state that spared no budgetary funds for the development of  aviation firms.    [Ongirskiy] I cannot agree that this will no longer exists.  We just received an invitation to a meeting in Moscow, where the  problems in the aviation industry will be discussed. And such  meetings are held regularly. The Russian aircraft TU-334 has  been included in the program for Ukraine. Nor is Russia refusing  our aircraft. We have very close ties with Omsk, Novosibirsk,  Arsenyev, and Samara. The branch will not perish. The political  storms will die down. And world practice indicates that aviation  firms combine their efforts. Today, hardly anyone can accomplish  anything alone at an economic advantage for himself -- project  planning, construction, and testing of new aircraft. The world  has the American, European, and former Soviet aerospace  complexes. To destroy our complex would mean not only to lag  behind for decades but also to create insoluble economic  difficulties for Russia and for Ukraine.    [Kozlov] How would you characterize Ukraine's aviation  industry?    [Ongirskiy] Today it is 300,000 people and 30 enterprises of  different kinds. I am not talking about space but only about  aviation. The world's largest plant for the series production of  aircraft engines is located in Zaporozhye. It produces 5,000  aircraft engines a year! Naturally, some of the engines are sent  to Russia. High-quality materials come from Russia. How can one  destroy this?    [Kozlov] There is probably no need to ask about the economic  state of the "Antonov" firm. I understand that it is bad. So how  bad is it? Can you see light at the end of the tunnel?    [Ongirskiy] Most of the workers here are graduates of the  Kharkov Aviation Institute. Those from my class are also working  for Tupolev, Mikoyan, and Ilyushin. The economic situation is  about the same in all aviation firms. As Reagan said, the water  is up to our chin but we are still breathing.    [Kozlov] Probably some are not pleased about this. Yes,  there  are specialists who are dedicated to aviation but there are also  simply qualified workers and engineers who are doing their work  well. It is easy to lose them but to hire and train others....    [Ongirskiy] I know from my own friends what it is to shut  down a plant for two or three months and then to start it up  again. People pilfer everything, they break window shutters and  cut wires, and they carry off telephones and disassemble machine  tools. Later on it is very difficult to restore everything. And  the equipment is designed in such a way that the more it works  they better it works. It must not be stopped. Everything must  keep turning, be lubricated, and wear. The human system is very  complex and specific. People lose their skills quickly. I worked  as a lathe hand before being trained at the institute. You come  back from vacation and you have to regain your skills.  Engineering and production have a concept called school. It is  the continual transfer of experience and knowledge. The most  important task for us today is to preserve the school. Because  of the financial difficulties, we have to separate ourselves  from our pensioners, people with good health, clear minds, and a  strong spirit. They ought to be teaching the young people. By  the way, the so-called tutorship came to us from the West. They  leave pensioners in the firms and pay them money to come see  what is going on, give advice, explain things, and help. Today  young specialists do not have the opportunity to go the way that  the patriarchs of aviation went. They know how to use computers  and they know a lot about their speciality but they lack  experience. And experience is the most valuable thing in  aviation. That is what they tell us at Boeing and Lockheed. If  we lose the school, then entire generations of specialists will  "fall out" of aviation.    [Kozlov] Today the prestige of the former Soviet aviation  has  been substantially undermined. Accidents happen and aircraft  crash and people have begun to discriminate against our  technology. What is the explanation for this? Is it our general  collapse or have we already begun to fall hopelessly behind in  aviation?    [Ongirskiy] I would not agree with this. I regularly read  information about my specialty. Here is an example: 700 aircraft  of the Boeing Company have to be returned for reworking because  some defects have been discovered in the tightening of the bolts  fastening the engines. It turns out that they were tightened too  much on some aircraft and not enough on others. Or remember the  recent accident in the skies over Holland. No, our aircraft and  especially military aircraft are by no means the worst in the  world. It is no accident that there is so much interest in us at  all kinds of exhibitions, air parades, and air shows. As for the  accidents, they happen not just in the sky. Nuclear reactors  blow up, ships and trains collide, and oil pipelines burn. This  has to do with the general decline of discipline and the  spiritual malaise in the country. Technology requires constant  attention and servicing. For the time being, we are able to  maintain the level of safety and airworthiness at the necessary  level in aviation.    [Kozlov] Still, aircraft are crashing.    [Ongirskiy] Today some strange commercial structures are  being established that are buying some depreciated aircraft and  hiring pilots who have been dismissed from aviation and have no  right to fly. Dispatchers, technicians, engineers, and ground  flight support personnel are all living people who have to earn  a wage. Their labor is very stressful. If a person at work is  thinking about how to feed his family rather than about his  work, then naturally there will be breakdowns.    [Kozlov] Many think that the economic policy of the  Ukrainian  Government is changing in the direction of more realism, if we  can put it this way. Is there a mutual understanding between  your firm and the government?    [Ongirskiy] There is. I personally, for example, am worried  about the upcoming elections for the Supreme Soviet. If those  who come to power are people who think that Ukraine should be an  agrarian country and that it has no need for aircraft and space,  then this will be a disaster.    [Kozlov] What, in your view, must be done so that the  economic reforms in Ukraine will take place with fewer losses?    [Ongirskiy] It is hard to say. Sometimes we put it this way:  "It will be good just if they do not interfere with us." I do  not like people who have to destroy things: industry, economic  ties, and relationships between nations. People must create and  not destroy.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Pensions body suffers Dollars 71bn funds shortfall The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which guarantees the basic pension benefits of American workers, has a Dollars 71bn shortfall, a 34 per cent increase from last year. The agency yesterday said that 8m workers and pensioners are covered by the underfunded plans. Some 75 per cent of the shortfall is in plans sponsored by prospering businesses. However, about Dollars 18bn of underfunding - covering 1.2m people - is in plans sponsored by companies with sagging bond ratings. The underfunded plans are concentrated in a relatively small number of companies. More than half are large plans, primarily in the steel, vehicle, tyre and airline industries. However, legislation to reduce the gap by more than two-thirds was included in the financing provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact which won congressional approval last week. The new legislation requires companies with underfunded plans to accelerate their funding and calculate required contributions according to government-approved methods. It closes a loophole that has allowed some companies to minimise pension contributions and requires companies which have severely underfunded plans to set aside enough cash and marketable securities to pay for at least three years of benefits. Companies will be required to notify employees if pension plans are less than 90 per cent funded. The pension guarantee agency guarantees basic benefits of about 41m Americans. Its guarantee is limited to Dollars 2,556.82 a month, often less than the promised benefit. Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, headed a task force early in 1993 which examined the pension problem and proposed several solutions. 'We can now begin to reverse the trend that posed a risk to workers and retirees,' he said. 'A solid pension will be part of the deal for workers who have counted on and earned the American dream of a secure retirement.'</p>

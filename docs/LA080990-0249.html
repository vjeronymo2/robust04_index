			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARTIST'S CRITICS TOLD TO PRINT CORRECT VERSION;  </P> <P> PORNOGRAPHY: JUDGE ORDERS A RELIGIOUS GROUP TO DISTRIBUTE AN AMENDED PAMPHLET  IN NEA BATTLE.  </P> <P> A conservative religious group that cropped pictures of an artist's work to  suggest that it was sexually explicit has been ordered by a federal judge to  distribute a correction to the pamphlet.  </P> <P> The American Family Assn. of Tupelo, Miss., had reprinted fragments of images  by David A. Wojnarowicz to promote the organization's contention that the  National Endowment for the Arts supports pornography.  </P> <P> The ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William C. Conner came in a lawsuit  by Wojnarowicz. The judge said the pamphlet had probably harmed the artist's  professional and personal reputation.  </P> <P> Conner barred further publication of the pamphlet, "Your Tax Dollars Helped Pay  for These Works of Arts."  </P> <P> He also awarded $1 in damages to Wojnarowicz, who had sought up to $1 million.  He said Wojnarowicz had not proved financial damage because no galleries or  museums had canceled exhibits of his work.  </P> <P> Conner said the American Family Assn. must send a court-approved correction to  the 4,000 churches, members of Congress and other individuals who received the  pamphlet.  </P> <P> The association and its executive director, the Rev. Donald Wildmon, have for  years led campaigns against films, music, TV shows, magazines and art that they  deem obscene.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Panama City Telemetro Television Network  in Spanish at 0200 GMT on 10 March, in its 30-minute "Challenge  '94" program, broadcasts a live or recorded interview with  presidential candidate Professor Ruben Dario Carles, first vice  presidential candidate Guillermo Quijano, and second vice  presidential candidate Dr. Tomas Herrera of Change '94, which  comprises the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement  (Molirena), the Civic Renewal Party, and the National Renewal  Movement (Morena). The interview is conducted by Dorita de  Reyna at the Telemetro Television studios in Panama City; the  date is not given.    Reyna begins by asking Carles what changes are endorsed by  Change '94. In turn, Carles asks Quijano to answer, and Quijano  replies: "Change '94 is a presidential ticket of men who are  capable, dynamic, honest, and who have decided to give all of  their administrative ability to creating employment and  eradicating administrative corruption in Panama. This is what  Change '94 stands for."    Reyna then asks Carles why, if he was indeed a man of  influence in President Guillermo Endara's administration, he  failed to do more over the past four years to help achieve these  goals. Carles replies that he was merely the comptroller  general and, as such, he could only give his opinion, because he  had no true decisionmaking power. He says: "I was only the  comptroller. I was not a minister or a president. But now,  when you make me president, then I can be held accountable."    Reyna then asks Carles how he would rule without a majority  in the Legislative Assembly. Carles replies: "The draft bills  we intend to present will be so necessary and desirable that  they will be approved, and my administration will be so  exemplary that it will enjoy the cooperation of all legislators,  because everyone will feel compelled to participate in such a  good administration."    When Reyna notes that Carles is known for his unyielding  positions and poor negotiating ability, Quijano intercedes and  says he believes the new administration will create an  atmosphere of teamwork, adding that the vice presidents will  play an important role on the team.    Reyna asks Herrera what tasks appeal to him considering that  vice presidents do not have specific roles. Herrera replies:  "Allow me to say that the vice presidents will assist the  president," adding that the vice presidents "will do whatever  the president entrusts us to do."    Reyna asks Herrera how poverty can be reduced in a country  where 50 percent of the population is considered poor and which  still has an enormous foreign debt. Herrera replies: "For the  time being I am not concerned... [pauses] It is not that the  foreign debt does not concern me. It is true that this problem  will affect several generations. The foreign debt cannot be  repaid during one government term; this would be impossible. I  must say that to resolve the unemployment problem we need to  protect current job sources, both in the city and in the  countryside, mainly to avoid a migration from the countryside  into the cities."    Reyna asks about the ticket's plans to create jobs, to which  Quijano replies that there are several programs and not enough  time in the program to explain them. Nevertheless, he says one  of the programs involves housing, adding that this program  includes plans for the construction of 115,000 homes -- homes he  dubs "housing solutions" -- which will in turn create 25,000 new  jobs over a five-year period.    Quijano is interrupted by Reyna after he starts to explain  plans for a reforestation program. Reyna asks whether the  housing to be constructed by Change '94 will be for the poor,  and Quijano replies: "The housing will be only and exclusively  for the general population," and he adds that even the  unemployed can participate through the "New Life" program, which  makes "every family member jointly responsible for the debt."  He adds: "Even people who have no regular income can either  receive a home improvement loan or a small house to start a new  life with hope and optimism for the future. This is our  philosophical concept."    Herrera adds: "Of course, there are other programs, such as  incentives for private investment programs. Jobs can only be  created through private investment incentives."    Reyna then broaches the problem of law and order, and she  asks how Panama can be attractive to investors if the country  has so many security problems. Herrera replies: "You are  referring to a public service issue. Let me tell you that all  public services have to be improved. If public services do not  work -- and this includes electricity, water, security,  transportation, streets, and so on -- the country cannot be  attractive to investors. The idea is to make public  administration efficient, and when we speak of making it  efficient, we are also speaking of efficient public services  that will enable businesses to rest assured that they will have  dependable and inexpensive public services. All of this is part  of an environment that attracts private entrepreneurs. In  addition, we will have an honest government, and there will be  complete honesty in administering public funds. Those investors  who come to the country to invest will know that no one will  demand a bribe or a hidden commission, because there is a  presidential commitment to avoid such things."    Reyna quizzes Carles on alleged cases of looking the other  way when other people in the government have not been entirely  honest. Carles says that in all cases that come to his  attention, the people involved were dismissed and that many of  these cases are still pending in the Attorney General's Office.    Reyna then switches to the topic of U.S. bases and asks  Carles about his public stand on the appropriateness of  renegotiating the status of U.S. bases in Panama and whether it  would not be more profitable for Panama to properly use these  reverted areas. Carles replies: "Well, this is a matter of  priorities. We have already had a great number of properties  returned and to the present we have not used them. In a few  years, we will be receiving a great deal more. We cannot receive  them all, simultaneously, without using them. We need to  establish with some sort of priority what areas we should  dedicate to certain uses and what areas we can allow to continue  to be used as they are being used now while we have other  options. It is a question of prioritizing time."    Reyna then asks Quijano to explain how their government plan  deals with this question. Quijano replies: "Our priority is  jobs. Right now, we cannot let 14,000 or 15,000 families lose  their jobs with the closure of U.S. bases in Panama. We have  enough reverted areas to start modernizing the economy through a  maritime center in these reverted areas. The question of  modifying the U.S. bases lease can then be dealt with slowly but  surely by future administrations. Right now, however, we need to  protect the thousands of Panamanians who today earn their living  honestly in the bases in Panama."    Reyna switches the subject to privatization. She asks Carles  if privatization is part of the Change '94 plans and he replies  that not everything should be privatized. When she asks what  should, Carles replied: "We must privatize the railroad, and I  will tell you something else. Panama still does not have  cellular telephones. This is something that needs to be  privatized." Reyna interjects and asks whether this means  privatizing INTEL, National Institute of Telecommunications, or  the cellular telephone service. Carles replies: "The cellular  telephone service." Reyna reminds Carles that all along he has  favored privatizing INTEL. Carles replies: "There are other  INTEL services that could be privatized. We should not be afraid  to privatize; we must look for good areas that can be  privatized. Before I forget, I want to quickly tell you about  the debt. As Comptroller General, I never had anything to do  with the handling of the public debt. This was the  responsibility of others. Regarding the commercial bank debt, I  have never favored the Panamanian Government hastily beginning  negotiations with commercial banks. I have always said it. It is  very clear in the minutes I took, where I say that we need to  negotiate the best option among the various alternatives that do  not interfere with the work of the state and do not affect  public services, especially those of a social nature. We must  grow first and pay the debt after. Let it be very clear, there  are others who are in a hurry to pay the debt. I have said this  must go to the end of the line."    Herrera stresses the need to remember who created the debt  in  the first place and proceeds to quote figures of what it was in  1968, when the military coup took place, and of the situation on  20 December 1989, the date of the invasion and end of the  dictatorship.    Quijano stresses Molirena's support for Carles and denies a  suggestive question by Reyna that a certain amount of coercion  was needed before Molirena agreed to support Carles instead of  Guillermo Ford.    Reyna asks Carles whether he would be willing to govern by  consensus, including parties that may have opposed him. Carles  replies: "I have not made any pacts with anyone and I have not  assigned political opportunities to anyone. I am going to choose  the people who can best serve the country."</p>

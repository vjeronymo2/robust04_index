			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL ENDORSES TRAPS FOR CARS TO HOLD VAPORS  </P> <P> A House panel overrode opposition from auto makers Thursday and voted to  require that cars built in the future be fitted with special canisters to trap  smog-causing vapors released during refueling.  </P> <P> The vote was hailed by environmentalists as a significant victory in the  legislative battle, currently being fought in the House Energy and Commerce  health and environment subcommittee, to strengthen President Bush's proposed  clean air bill.  </P> <P> However, a much more momentous battle was taking place behind the scenes, in  closed-door negotiations where the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman  (D-Los Angeles), was fighting both the Administration and the auto industry in  an effort to impose stricter controls on the single biggest source of urban  smog -- emissions from motor vehicle tailpipes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Overriding Issue'  </P> <P> "Compared to what's going on behind the scenes, the fight on the committee  floor so far is just minor skirmishing," one legislative source said.  "Tailpipes is the one overriding issue, and both sides are digging their heels  in on it."  </P> <P> Waxman, defeated in an attempt Tuesday to get stricter emissions standards  incorporated into the Bush bill, has been negotiating with several other  committee members over a compromise. The compromise would extend the standards  planned for California by 1995 to the rest of the country.  </P> <P> However, legislative sources said that the talks remain deadlocked over  Waxman's insistence on a second round of emission cuts to further reduce the  national standards by the year 2000.  </P> <P> Waxman originally called for a reduction of hydrocarbon emissions -- a major  component of smog -- by 39% in 1993. Nitrogen oxides, another tailpipe  component of smog, would be cut 60%. In the year 2,000, both pollutants would  be cut a further 50%.  </P> <P> The co-sponsors of the Bush bill, Reps. John D. Dingell (D-Mich) and Norman F.  Lent (R-N.Y.), have fiercely criticized Waxman's reductions as technologically  unfeasible and prohibitively expensive, even if the technology to achieve them  is developed.  </P> <P> The compromise offered by Waxman is believed to relax the second round  reductions somewhat, but Lent told reporters that the two sides are still far  apart.  </P> <P> The canisters amendment, passed on a voice vote, would require auto makers to  put vapor-collecting devices on the gasoline tanks of all cars and light trucks  within four years of the clean air bill's passage.  </P> <P> Waxman said that the canisters, designed to trap vapors released into the air  when a car is being refueled, would lower the overall level of hydrocarbon  emissions by more than 3% at a cost of about $14 per vehicle.  </P></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Ford may renew investment in South Africa Ford Motor Company is considering reinvesting in South Africa, six years after it severed ties with its South African holdings, in a move which reflects international companies' increased confidence in the country's government, Bronwen Maddox reports from New York. Ford officials have been in talks with Anglo American Corporation and Anglo American Industrial Corporation, the industrial conglomerates, about taking a stake in Samcor, which assembles Ford, Mazda and Mitsubishi vehicles in South Africa. Ford, which created a South African subsidiary in 1933, merged those businesses with those of Anglo American and AMIC in 1984, forming Samcor. In 1988 Ford divested its holding in Samcor, mainly to the business's employees. General Motors said last night it had no plans to follow suit. In 1986 it sold its South African businesses to local management.</p>

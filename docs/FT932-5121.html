			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Global link-up down the line: BT's venture with MCI is a pricey but plausible strategy Most BT shareholders, perhaps even BT's campaign character, Inspector Morose, will be nonplussed by concepts such as 'global outsourcing' and 'global telecoms platforms'. They should start pursuing them, since BT is spending about Dollars 5bn of their funds applying the ideas to the task of making itself an international telecoms giant. The alliance announced this week between BT and MCI, the second-largest US carrier, represents a large injection of cash by the privatised UK company into the US in return for an assured entree to the American telecoms market. Against BT's Dollars 5bn, which will give it a 20 per cent stake in MCI and two-thirds of a joint venture company formed by the two carriers, MCI is putting up barely Dollars 400m - of which about Dollars 120m is to buy most of BT's North American assets. BT can afford Dollars 5bn with ease. The sum represents only four years of its uncommitted cash flow. But it remains a huge investment. To put it in perspective, it represents more than the total projected capital spending by Cable and Wireless, BT's main UK competitor through its Mercury subsidiary, on all projects - home and abroad - for the next three years. Nor did BT's investment come cheap. At Dollars 64 a share, it paid a 20 per cent premium for its stake in MCI. BT shareholders, who could have bought MCI shares in the market on their own account at about Dollars 12 less, might well ask how that premium is justified. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman - for whom the MCI deal is the culmination of a three-year campaign to break into the US - dismisses any suggestion that BT should be passing on its cash instead either to customers (in lower prices) or to shareholders (in higher dividends). On prices, he points to the tight, regulator-imposed price caps below which BT already operates; for shareholders, he emphasises the value which BT will add to MCI, and the longer-term gains that will accrue to them if BT succeeds in establishing itself as a global leader. As for BT's undistinguished record as a North American investor over the past decade, Mr Vallance emphasises MCI's impressive track record in prising market share in the US long-distance market - currently 18 per cent of it - from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, America's largest telecoms operator. BT's strategy is simple. Multinational companies want sophisticated telecoms and data services. And pursuing today's management philosophy of concentrating on core business and contracting out as much of the rest as possible, they will leap at the chance of 'outsourcing' their telecoms needs if a supplier with international credibility and state-of-the-art products presents itself. Since some 40 per cent of multi-nationals are based in the US, BT's credibility requires a strong US presence. Furthermore, BT will soon have to endure increased domestic competition, from cable TV companies in the local market, and from new entrants in the long-distance business, led by Energis and Ionica, new UK companies recently licensed to build national telecoms networks. As BT loses market share in the UK, it is determined to seek compensation abroad. Enter BT in alliance with MCI, outsourcer to tomorrow's multinationals. The idea has a powerful attraction for proponents of 'UK plc'. Many of BT's leading customers endorse the logic of the move. Mr David Harrington, director of the Telecommunications Managers Association, hails the MCI deal as 'yet another global stride for the national flag carrier, which will further strengthen its claim to offer international businesses a seamless service on a world scale'. The actions of other leading international telecoms operators further validates the notion of the 'global stride'. Last week, AT&amp;T launched Worldsource, a partnership with five Asia-Pacific carriers (to be extended to Europe next year) pursuing almost the same strategy as the BT/MCI joint venture. Deutsche Telekom and Telecom France have an outsourcing joint venture of their own, called Eunetcom, while a consortium of the Swiss, Dutch and Swedish state telecoms companies (Unisource) is also courting European transnationals. But fashion is not enough. BT has to answer three questions. Is the 'global outsourcing' market going to materialise? Is significant added value to be gained from the MCI alliance? And was a Dollars 5bn investment necessary to enable BT to exploit the market and add the value? 'The benefits of the aggressive pursuit of global outsourcing have yet to be proven,' says Mr Gregory Staple, a Washington consultant. There are grounds for such scepticism. Both AT&amp;T and BT claim to be targeting 'multinationals', of which AT&amp;T estimates there are between 2,000 and 3,000. Yet virtually all multinationals already have sophisticated telecoms operations, with extensive private networks and operational expertise. Shell, for instance, has a Netherlands-based subsidiary dedicated to managing its telecoms needs in more than 100 countries. More than anything, it is likely to be lower prices that will attract multinational custom; but BT has discounted the idea that its alliance might undercut the existing international cartel arrangements which keep prices high. Nonetheless, at its Worldsource launch AT&amp;T produced an impressive array of international companies, including Unisys, Honeywell and Motorola, professing their interest in outsourcing. And the market need not be restricted to multinationals. According to the United Nations division which studies them, there were 35,000 'transnational corporations' in 1990 with more than 150,000 affiliates between them. True, most of them are small and medium-sized companies, minute in comparison with Shell; equally, they possess far less telecoms expertise, and could find single-supplier packages attractive. Lower prices and 'one-stop shops' apart, it is new high-tech data transmission services that companies are likely to be seeking from the global outsourcers. To meet the demand, an obvious strategy for telecoms operators is to forge alliances with computing and managed data networks companies. AT&amp;T has done just that. In 1989 it bought Istel, the UK IT services company; two years ago it spent Dollars 7.4bn on NCR, the fifth largest US computing group. It looked as if BT was going down the same road in its talks with Electronic Data Systems, America's largest computing services company. The talks with EDS appear to have broken down last month. A few weeks later the deal with MCI was announced. While the MCI alliance gives BT improved access to the US market, it does far less than a partnership with EDS would have done in terms of broadening BT's range of services and potential to exploit emerging data communications technology. Indeed, MCI is itself anxious to develop its data transmission services, which account for only a small proportion of its current sales. Furthermore, if its aim was simply to gain access to the US market and develop joint marketing and research programmes with an innovative operator, BT did not need to expend Dollars 4.3bn on a stake in MCI on top of the Dollars 750m for the joint venture. BT evidently expects to have a large say in the uses to which MCI devotes its new pot of gold; but with only a minority stake, it will be in no position to impose its will. Given the speed at which the alliance appears to have been negotiated, it is not clear that BT is even sure what it wants the money spent on. That said, BT would not have approached MCI in the first place but for the US operator's remarkable success in building its business and branding new products. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman, talks eagerly of 'expanded efforts in the emerging (US) fields of multimedia and local competition'. If MCI can do to those what it has done to AT&amp;T in the long-distance voice market, BT's dowry will be well spent.</p>

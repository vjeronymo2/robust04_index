			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Proposal to help property recovery BANKERS have been asked to adopt an innovative approach to dealing with their problem property loans by selling the underlying assets to a jointly owned company, Vanessa Houlder writes. The suggestion, by Mr Ken Caesar, a partner of Richard Ellis Chartered Surveyors and Mr Colin Bird, a partner of Price Waterhouse, is designed to improve the prospects of a recovery in the property market by reducing the overhang of property for sale. They said the company, which would own Pounds 1bn to 2bn of property, would require the injection of several hundreds of millions of pounds of equity to gain approval from the Bank of England. The company could be sold or floated after several years. Several bankers dismissed the idea as unrealistic because of likely difficulties in raising outside equity and reaching agreement among themselves.</p>

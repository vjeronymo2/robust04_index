			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Nickel in Dollars 1,200 price surge The nickel market took over the pace-maker's role at the London Metal Exchange this week. As concern deepened about Russian supply disruption the metal's three months delivery price bounced by 19 per cent from Tuesday's low to reach a fresh 3 1/4 -year high of Dollars 8,970 a tonne. It closed last night at Dollars 8,952.50 a tonne, up Dollars 1,207 on the week. The seeds of this surge were sown early last month when an explosion hit the power plant supplying the Norilsk smelter in northern Siberia, the world's biggest nickel producer, which normally accounts for about 15 per cent of global production. Norilsk officials claim the plant will be able to meet contractual obligations despite the resulting output losses, which market estimates put anywhere between 30 and 50 per cent (42,000 to 70,000 tonnes). But western analysts are dubious. 'There seems to be too much smoke here for there to be no fire,' said GNI, the London trade house. 'Watch out for a force majeure.' The explosion has also focussed attention on more fundamental problems at Norilsk. Mr David Allen, vice president for public and government affairs at Inco of Canada, spoke this week of his misgivings about the Russian operation. A technical assistance protocol his company signed with Norilsk in 1993 had 'got absolutely nowhere', he said. The Canadian group had organised a teach-in in Toronto for Norilsk about privatisation to which it invited western bankers and consultants. 'Yet today (Norilsk executives) sometimes won't answer telephone calls or faxes from us,' said Mr Allen. Given this apparent lack of interest, he now doubted the Russian company's ability to maintain production at last year's level in the face of daunting financial and technical problems. Norilsk is desperately short of money and is one of the world's worst polluters. Among the other LME metals copper and aluminium registered substantial gains on the week, the former touching a fresh four-year high, while lead, zinc and tin finished above their mid-week lows. At the bullion market silver's continued weakness finally undermined gold's support band in the mid-Dollars 380s a troy ounce. As the white metal plunged below Dollars 5 an ounce to a 10-month low, gold subsided to Dollars 379.20, down Dollars 5.75 on the week. Silver's fall was seen as a salutary reminder of what can happen when investment funds, having driven prices up with a buying spree, decide to quit the market. The cash price steadied a little yesterday but still ended 25 cents down on the week at Dollars 4.92 1/2 an ounce, 78 cents below the high reached in late September. Soft commodities were also generally weak. The London Commodity Exchange's January coffee futures touched a five-month low of Dollars 2,755 a tonne yesterday before closing at Dollars 2,781, down Dollars 207 on the week. Cocoa's support gave way early in the week and prices plunged after a trade house was forced to unwind a substantial long position. After slipping to Pounds 920 a tonne on Wednesday the March delivery position steadied to Pounds 937, Pounds 50 down on balance. White sugar had been the LCE's strongest market but the bubble burst and the May price fell Dollars 18.50 from Monday's four-year high of Dollars 414.50 a tonne. A trader explained that the market had 'basically overcooked itself' in its response to concern about supply tightness and had to retreat when trade buying dried up.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium        -15,125 to 1,827,800 Aluminium alloy   +1,240 to    28,880 Copper              -450 to   318,275 Lead                -500 to   357,775 Nickel              -234 to   150,498 Zinc              -3,125 to 1,203,575 Tin                 +300 to    29,225  -------------------------------------</p>

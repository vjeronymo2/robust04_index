			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAFAT SEEKS U.N. FORCE TO AID ARABS IN W. BANK, GAZA  </P> <P> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the U.N. Security Council on Friday to  send an emergency force to protect Arabs in the Israeli-occupied territories  from a "war of extermination."  </P> <P> Opening an emergency council session, Arafat called for an end to Israel's  23-year-old occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a ban on Jewish  settlements in the territories and international sanctions against Israel.  </P> <P> The violence "has reached an extremely dangerous and explosive point," the  Palestine Liberation Organization chief said. "The situation now requires  urgent action in order to enforce reverence for international legitimacy."  </P> <P> But Israel dismissed any U.N. monitoring of the West Bank and Gaza following an  upsurge of violence triggered by an Israeli gunman who killed seven Palestinian  laborers last Sunday.  </P> <P> "It requires the consent of all parties, and we will not give that consent,"  Israel's delegate, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said shortly  before the council session began.  </P> <P> "What we are now facing is a further attempt to delegitimize Israel and Jewish  immigration to it," he told the council.  </P> <P> Arafat, speaking for nearly an hour, did not say what sort of civilian or  military force he proposed.  </P> <P> Arafat urged appointment of a permanent U.N. envoy to monitor the situation and  immediate preparations for an international Middle East peace conference.  </P> <P> Initial responses from other delegates were largely noncommittal. In Israel, a  top aide to caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Arafat's speech was  "full of lies and distortions."  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III reiterated in Washington the United  States' opposition to stationing a U.N. observer force in the territories but  said the "idea of the secretary general sending one of his top aides to take a  look at the situation and return is something quite different." Asked to  appraise Arafat's speech, Baker said he had not read it.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Canadian Punkers Not Obscene: A Canadian jury has found two records by the punk  rock group DayGlo Abortions not obscene. The jury ruled Thursday that the  albums, "Feed Us a Fetus" and "Here Today Guano Tomorrow" -- which are laced  with four-letter words and describe sex, satanism, bestiality, rape, murder and  suicide -- are not obscene as charged under Canada's criminal code. Band  members, with names such as Cretin, Couch Potato and Jesus Bonehead, contend  that the songs are parodies intended to shock. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

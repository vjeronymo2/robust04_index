			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Scots bank bows out of refinancing SENIOR executives of Mirror Group Newspapers have been told that the Bank of Scotland has decided not to go ahead with providing Pounds 30m towards a refinancing package. The Bank of Scotland has been bankers to the Glasgow-based Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail for nearly a century. It is understood that the Scottish Daily Record may now consider moving its account to another bank. The Bank of Scotland is one of a consortium of banks negotiating a medium-term financial package to provide MGN with greater stability while decisions over its ultimate ownership and future are taken. The package is believed to involve a facility of Pounds 250m for two years. It is particularly important for the Record because new colour presses are already in Glasgow but the company does not have the money to install them. MGN was told that the reason for the Bank of Scotland's decision was 'financial prudence'. The Bank of Scotland said last night: 'The bank has not withdrawn from the consortium, nor has it reduced the limits (of the Scottish Daily Record).' National Westminster, the senior consortium bank, has been reallocating the Pounds 30m among other member banks and it is believed that most of it has been placed. The refinancing of MGN is not thought to have been jeopardised as a result. The company is expected to go ahead with the publication of its accounts later this month. It will be followed soon after by a relisting of its shares.</p>

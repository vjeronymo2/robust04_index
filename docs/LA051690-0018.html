			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROPOUT RATE IMPROVES ITS GRADE;  </P> <P> * STATE PROGRAM TO KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL BOASTS NOT-TOO-SHABBY SUCCESS  </P> <P> There's a widely held notion that a person can become either a troublemaker or  a model citizen depending simply on how well a society plans and provides  opportunities. State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig offered evidence of  the practical wisdom of that idea the other day. He reported on commendable  results being achieved by California high schools that have organized, with the  help of a 4-year-old state program, to combat their dropout problems.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, a number of districts cut their dropout rates  considerably, with a not-too-shabby overall decrease from 31.8% in 1986 to  26.4% last year. El Monte High School, the place chosen by Honig to release the  report, cut its rate by using state funds to hire a dropout-prevention  counselor. But don't cheer too loudly until districts like Lynwood Unified,  where more than half the class of 1989 left early, improve.  </P> <P> In Orange County, the most dramatic improvement came in the Newport-Mesa  Unified School District, where the dropout rate fell from 19.1% in 1986 to 6.4%  in 1989. The figure is no accident. The district has been busy identifying  students at risk of dropping out, and it has worked closely with them. On the  other end, Garden Grove Unified School District has not fared so well and needs  to improve on its 16% increase in dropouts over the same period.  </P> <P> It is particularly noteworthy that the Los Angeles Unified School District and  the Santa Ana Unified School District in Orange County, both of which have  students from many cultures, also managed to make significant dents in their  dropout rates by getting parents involved. Again, even in a rapidly changing  society, the old wisdom is best: Education begins in the home.  </P> <P> These figures show steady progress, but also something more significant than a  graph could show. Each decrease in the percentage of dropouts represents young  lives turned at a crucial point.  </P> <P> What a positive difference it can make when society gets organized and provides  ways to take advantage of a well thought-out plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dropout Rate  </P> <P> Two school districts that made significant reductions in their dropout rate  from 1986-89.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.21IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Angeles Unified  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -18.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Ana Unified  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -45.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *State Department of Education  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW REBOUNDS FROM MILD SETBACK, ADVANCES 13.29  </P> <P> Stock prices rose today, rebounding from Tuesday's mild setback.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 13.29 points at 2,687.84, with  gainers outpacing losing issues 4-to-3.  </P> <P> Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 145.9 million shares.  </P> <P> Traders said investors sold stock index futures and bought the underlying  issues, helping the Dow industrials to gain after a mixed day of trading.  </P> <P> The market retreated Tuesday as interest rates came under new upward pressure  in the credit markets. Rates declined in today's activity, giving some  encouragement to stock traders.  </P> <P> Most analysts agree that stocks have benefited lately from hopes that the  economy could emerge from its recent period of weakness without having to  undergo a full-blown recession.  </P> <P> Brokers say that kind of optimism would be buttressed if interest rates do not  go much higher than their current levels.  </P> <P> Worries persist, however, that borrowing costs in this country would keep  increasing if rates climb further in such other prominent industrialized  nations as Japan and West Germany.  </P> <P> Government bond prices bobbed up today after being pounded down Tuesday as the  dollar declined and a retail sales report drew negative reactions.  </P> <P> Much of the buying was concentrated in the long end of the credit market and  short-term government bonds posted only minor gains. Interest rates, which fall  when prices rise, receded slightly.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond, which tumbled more than 1 point  Tuesday, regained 7/16 point, or nearly $2.50 per $1,000 in face amount. Its  yield fell to 8.66% from 8.71% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jay Goldinger of the investment firm Capital Insights in Beverly Hills, Calif.,  said business was active in the bond market mainly because traders were  realigning short positions previously established on expectations of further  price weakness.  </P> <P> Despite this morning's gains, he said a bearish attitude prevailed in the  market. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has made for volatile trading,  he said.  </P> <P> Part of the uncertainty was in anticipation of new economic statistics due  later this week. Reports on wholesale inflation and industrial production in  February are due on Friday.  </P> <P> News this morning that business inventories edged up 0.2% in January while  sales expanded 0.3% had no impact on bonds or interest rates.  </P> <P> Market analysts said the report was virtually ignored because it dealt with  January's economic conditions.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  government issues added 1/16 point to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose  5/32 point to 7/16 point, and long-term issues gained 7/16 point to 17/32  point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information  service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, was up 1.83 to 1,145.57.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills dipped to 8.20% as the discount edged 1  basis point lower to 7.95%. Yields on six-month bills declined to 8.28% as the  discount shed 3 basis points to 7.86%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.41%  as the discount went down 3 basis points to 7.81%.  </P></p>

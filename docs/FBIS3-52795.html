The committee met overnight Saturday under the chairmanship  of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat to listen to briefings by the  organisation's political department chief Faruq Qaddumi on the  Jordan negotiations and Ahmad Quray', the head of the delegation  holding economic talks with Israel in Paris.    The Jordan-Palestine Liberation Organisation accord, signed  Friday, followed the broad outlines of a draft economic deal  Amman had wanted signed.    Both sides have praised the agreement which calls for  setting  up Jordanian banks and using the Jordanian dinar in the occupied  territories as the main currency, cooperating in trade and  investing jointly in industry, agriculture, tourism, health and  other domains.    The executive committee endorsed the Jordan declaration,  member 'Ali Ishaq told AFP.    King Husayn had become increasingly irritated by 'Arafat's  handling of the peace process and warned the PLO that he was  giving it a final chance to agree on cooperation.    Stock market officials in Jordan said Sunday the accord had  triggered a 3.7 percent rise in Amman's stock market activity.    The volume of exchange transactions has also registered an  increase with an average of 11.3 million dinars (about 16  million dollars) per day, approaching the 1992 record of 16.5  million dollars daily. The size of exchange had been stable at  around 15 million dollars per day during 1993.    The PLO executive also reviewed the latest achievements in  talks held with Israel on economic cooperation, based on a  report by Quray', who is also known as Abu-Ala'.    The next round of economic talks will be held Monday and  Tuesday.    "We have not registered tangible progress," said a member of  the PLO executive who requested anonymity.    "Any progress in the economic talks remains dependent on the  evolution of the political negotiations process," Ishaq said.    The economic cooperation talks have snagged over the  question  of finance and money with the PLO insisting on issuing its own  currency and central bank as part of the future autonomy.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISOR HAHN SENT TO HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Veteran Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who has been weakened by a  series of ailments in the last two years, was admitted Monday to Daniel Freeman  Memorial Hospital for treatment of an upper respiratory infection.  </P> <P> Lynn Sakamoto, a spokeswoman for the 68-year-old Hahn -- the county's  longest-serving supervisor -- said the latest illness was initially thought to  be a cold. But when the supervisor "failed to respond satisfactorily to  out-patient treatment," doctors decided to admit him to the hospital. Sakamoto  described the move as a "precautionary measure."  </P> <P> Hospital spokeswoman Mary Schnack said the ailment was diagnosed as an upper  respiratory infection. Hahn, who will miss Tuesday's Board of Supervisors  meeting, is expected to be released in a "couple days."  </P> <P> He was listed in fair condition, Schnack said.  </P> <P> Hahn, who was first elected in 1952 and is serving an unprecedented 10th term,  received radiation treatment last year for cancer discovered in his prostate.  In 1987, he suffered a major stroke that left him partly paralyzed.  </P></p>

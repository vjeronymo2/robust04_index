			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shagray] </F>   [Text] Aharon Domb, a member of the Council of Jewish  Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza sent a personal letter  to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a few weeks ago warning him of  plans by "the extreme and fringe right-wing" to carry out "a  political assassination." Answering HA'ARETZ's question, Domb  said he had no information about a specific plan, but "recently  I have been hearing too much talk too often about despair and  political assassinations with regard to Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin, Minister Shulamit Aloni, or other ministers."    Domb emphasized that he had sent his letter to Rabin as a  private citizen, not as a council member or spokesman. Among  other things, Domb wrote the prime minister: "Such an  assassination, God forbid, would be very serious in all respects  and we must do our very best to prevent it. For our part, we  are making every possible effort, but I nevertheless see fit to  apprise you of it."    In his letter Domb analyzed the feelings of despair that  bring people to such thoughts. "As far as many Israelis are  concerned, the lack of solidarity on your part and on that of  most other Israeli cabinet ministers with the suffering of Jews  in Ashdod, 'Afula, Hadera, Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza  creates a horrible sense of alienation. Many of them have  translated this alienation into despair, and in some of them  this despair might degenerate into extreme acts of despair with  the potential to rock Israel's very foundations."    Yehi'el Leiter, director general of the council's foreign  desk, recently published an article abroad entitled "To Avert  the Worst." Leiter asks "Is a political assassination possible  in Israel today?" and his answer is no. "I wish my `no' could  be more categorical. However, we can no longer ignore the  possibility of a lunatic political assassination attempt by a  Jewish extremist," Leiter wrote.    "In the two months before the massacre in Hebron," Leiter  recalls, "the assessments indulged in by political commentators  were not about the likelihood of a massacre, but of the  resurgence of a Jewish underground. What happened in the field  totally differed from the predictions. Today, in the wake of  the Hebron events, those same commentators are anxious about a  second Hebron. However, this time, too, events may very well  differ from predictions. What is at stake now is so fateful  that a political assassination -- the most abominable and  cowardly form of political opposition -- has become a real  possibility, albeit appalling. A political assassination by a  Jewish extremist," Leiter warns in his article, "deserves to be  deplored not just on moral grounds. It will most probably spell  an end to the entire settlement endeavor.    "If anybody thought the attack at the Cave of the Patriarchs  would be so dramatic and radical as to bring about the  suspension of the talks with the PLO, he has in the meantime  found the exact opposite to be true: the settlers bore the  blame, while 'Arafat reaped the fruit. If a Jew tries to hurt a  cabinet minister, the government will have an easier time  holding all its political opponents collectively responsible,  and there is no doubt that it will do that.    "Such an event could also be used as an excuse to abolish  the  interim phase of the agreement, which is now being described by  some as impractical, and proceed immediately to implement the  final phase, or as the mayor of Hebron recently put it, `the  final solution.'" In his article Leiter proposes that the  government realize that the path it has adopted is leading to a  horrible and dangerous split in the population. Addressing  himself to the right wing, Leiter proposes to it to channel its  wrath and anxiety into a violent civil uprising.</p>

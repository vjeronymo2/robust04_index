			<p>BFN     [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, June 24 (CTK) -- Five Romany  political parties have agreed to join forces for the autumn  elections under the name Romany Civic Initiative (ROI), the  party leaders announced at a press conference today.    The ROI will also field joint candidates for the local  elections, which follow a few weeks after the general elections.    The ROI hopes to win five percent of the vote so that it can  enter parliament and defend the Romanies' interests. In  parliament the Romanies would seek to tighten laws against the  propagation of racist or fascist ideology, to lower unemployment  and promote education for Romanies. The parties in parliament  today have no interest in the Romanies' lot, the ROI says.    The Romanies in Slovakia have not acquired the official  status of a national minority, only that of an ethnic group,  Romanies leaders say. They estimate there are some half a  million living in Slovakia, 220,000 of whom have the right to  vote. The ROI is aiming for 180,000 votes, which would be  enough to get seats in parliament.    The umbrella group comprises the ROI Union, the Romany  Integration Party (SIR), the Romany Social Democratic Party  (SNSR) and the Romany Congress and will be supported by the  Romany Democratic Movement (DHR) and the Romany Party of  Democratic Union (SDUR).</p>

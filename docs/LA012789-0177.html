			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAPAN HOLDS '88 INFLATION TO 0.7%  </P> <P> Japan announced today that inflation for the year came to 0.7%, a figure  greeted with relief by economists who had worried that brisk economic growth  and a new sales tax might push up prices.  </P> <P> They said the figure, the third straight year of inflation of less than 1%,  points to low inflationary pressures for 1989 as well, with lower costs of  imports dampening domestic prices and keeping a lid on inflation.  </P> <P> Prices fell 0.3% in December from the previous month and rose 1% from a year  earlier, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said.  </P> <P> The month-on-month decline in December was caused mainly by a sharp fall in  prices of fresh vegetables and seaweeds, the government said.  </P> <P> Many economists expect Japan's consumer price increases to hold below 2% this  year, a level that presents no threat to the economy.  </P> <P> "If consumer prices were climbing 3% or 4%, we would have problems. But with  prices going up between only 1% to 2% this year, there is no need for worry,"  said chief economist Toshiaki Kakimoto at Sumitomo Bank.  </P> <P> Kakimoto sees consumer prices gaining 1.6% in 1989. Forecasts by other  economists range between 1.4% and 1.9%.  </P></p>

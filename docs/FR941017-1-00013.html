			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing regulation (10 CFR part 100, appendix A, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> V(a)(1)(iv)) states ``The maximum vibratory accelerations of the Safe Shutdown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Earthquake at each of the various foundation locations of the nuclear power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant structures at a given site shall be determined *&blank;*&blank;*''. The location of the seismic input motion control point as stated in the existing regulation has led to confrontations with many applicants that believe this stipulation is inconsistent with good engineering fundamentals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation would move the location of the seismic input  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motion control point from the foundation-level to the free-field at the free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground surface. The 1975 version of the Standard Review Plan placed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control motion in the free-field. The proposed regulation is also consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the resolution of Unresolved Safety Issue (USI) A&hyph;40, ``Seismic Design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criteria'' (August 1989), that resulted in the revision of Standard Review Plan Sections 2.5.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.2, and 3.7.3. However, the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that the horizontal component of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake Ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motion in the free-field at the foundation level of the structures must be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate response spectrum considering the site geotechnical properties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a peak ground acceleration of at least 0.1g.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Value of the Operating Basis Earthquake Ground Motion (OBE) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Required OBE Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing regulation (10 CFR, appendix A, section V(a)(2)) states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the maximum vibratory ground motion of the OBE is at least one half the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum vibratory ground motion of the Safe Shutdown Earthquake ground motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the existing regulation (10 CFR, appendix A, section VI(a)(2)) states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the engineering method used to insure that structures, systems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components are capable of withstanding the effects of the OBE shall involve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of either a suitable dynamic analysis or a suitable qualification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test. In some cases, for instance piping, these multi-facets of the OBE in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing regulation made it possible for the OBE to have more design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance than the SSE. A decoupling of the OBE and SSE has been suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in several documents. For instance, the NRC staff, SECY&hyph;79&hyph;300, suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that design for a single limiting event and inspection and evaluation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earthquakes in excess of some specified limit may be the most sound regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach. NUREG&hyph;1061, ``Report of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Piping Review Committee,'' Vol. 5, April 1985, (Table 10.1) ranked a decoupling of the OBE and SSE as third out of six high priority changes. In SECY&hyph;90&hyph;016, ``Evolutionary Light Water Reactor (LWR) Certification Issues and Their Relationship to Current Regulatory Requirements,'' the NRC staff states that it agrees that the OBE should not control the design of safety systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities equivalent to OBE&hyph;SSE decoupling are also being done in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign countries. For instance, in Germany their new design standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires only one design basis earthquake (equivalent to the SSE). They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require an inspection-level earthquake (for shutdown) of 0.4 SSE. This level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was set so that the vibratory ground motion should not induce stresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the allowable stress limits originally required for the OBE design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation would allow the value of the OBE to be set at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) one-third or less of the SSE, where OBE requirements are satisfied without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an explicit response or design analyses being performed, or (ii) a value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than one-third of the SSE, where analysis and design are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two issues the applicant should consider in selecting the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the OBE: first, plant shutdown is required if vibratory ground motion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding that of the OBE occurs (discussed below in Item 6, Required Plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shutdown), and second, the amount of analyses associated with the OBE. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant may determine that at one-third of the SSE level, the probability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the OBE vibratory ground motion is too high, and the cost associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with plant shutdown for inspections and testing of equipment and structures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to restarting the plant is unacceptable. Therefore, the applicant may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntarily select an OBE value at some higher fraction of the SSE to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant shutdowns. However, if an applicant selects an OBE value at a fraction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the SSE higher than one-third, a suitable analysis shall be performed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that the requirements associated with the OBE are satisfied. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design shall take into account soil-structure interaction effects and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected duration of the vibratory ground motion. The requirement associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the OBE is that all structures, systems, and components of the nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power plant necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety of the public shall remain functional and within applicable stress,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strain and deformation limits when subjected to the effects of the OBE in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination with normal operating loads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, it is determined that if an OBE of one-third of the SSE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used, the requirements of the OBE can be satisfied without the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing any explicit response analyses. In this case, the OBE serves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function of an inspection and shutdown earthquake. Some minimal design checks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the applicability of this position to seismic base isolation of buildings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are discussed below. There is high confidence that, at this ground-motion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level with other postulated concurrent loads, most critical structures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, and components will not exceed currently used design limits. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensured, in part, because PRA insights will be used to support a margins-type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of seismic events. A PRA-based seismic margins analysis will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider sequence-level High Confidence, Low Probability of Failures (HCLPFs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fragilities for all sequences leading to core damage or containment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures up to approximately one and two-thirds the ground motion acceleration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the design basis SSE (Reference: Item II.N, Site-Specific Probabilistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk Assessment and Analysis of External Events, memorandum from Samuel J.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chilk to James M. Taylor, Subject: SECY&hyph;93&hyph;087_Policy, Technical, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Licensing Issues Pertaining to Evolutionary and Advance Light-Water Reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ALWR) Designs, dated July 21, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are situations associated with current analyses where only OBE is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the design requirements, for example, the ultimate heat sink  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see Regulatory Guide 1.27, ``Ultimate Heat Sink for Nuclear Power Plants'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In these situations, a value expressed as a fraction of the SSE response would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used in the analyses. Section VIII of this proposed rule identifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing guides that would be revised technically to maintain the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design philosophy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In SECY&hyph;93&hyph;087, ``Policy, Technical, and Licensing Issues Pertaining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evolutionary and Advance Light-Water Reactor (ALWR) Designs,'' the NRC staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested Commission approval on 42 technical and policy issues pertaining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either evolutionary LWRs, passive LWRs, or both. The issue pertaining to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elimination of the OBE is designated I.M. The NRC staff identified actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for the design of structures, systems, and components when the OBE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design requirement is eliminated. The staff clarified that guidelines should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be maintained to ensure the functionality of components, equipment, and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supports. In addition, the staff clarified how certain design requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are to be considered for buildings and structures that are currently designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the OBE, but not the SSE. Also, the NRC staff has evaluated the effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety of eliminating the OBE from the design load combinations for selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structures, systems, and components and has developed proposed criteria for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis using only the SSE. Commission approval is documented in the Chilk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Taylor memorandum dated July 21, 1993, cited above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More than one earthquake response analysis for a seismic base isolated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear power plant design may be necessary to ensure adequate performance at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all earthquake levels. Decisions pertaining to the response analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with base isolated facilities will be handled on a case by case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Pakhomov] </F>   [Text] London, 1 Apr -- Great Britain announced today that  it is expelling a Russian diplomat. The diplomat has not been  named. A Foreign Office spokesman said this is in retaliation  for the expulsion from Moscow of a staff member of the British  Embassy in the Russian Federation [RF] accused of receiving  intelligence information from Russian citizens. "The Russians  asked us to recall a diplomat," a Foreign Office spokesman said.  "We regret that demand, which is at odds with the bilateral  relationship we are trying to build. In retaliation, we asked  the Russians to recall one of their diplomats from London.  Neither diplomat has been declared persona non grata. We hope  this matter is now at an end."    A Russian Federation embassy spokesman in London said he has  "no comment" on this question.</p>

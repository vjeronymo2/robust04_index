			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Iraq defiant but threat of strike recedes: Missiles seized from Kuwait IRAQ continued yesterday to deny it had retreated in the face of the United Nations ultimatum on its missile deployment, and Iraqi soldiers were reported to have made a raid into Kuwait to seize weapons, but the prospect of an early military strike by the US-led coalition appeared considerably reduced. According to the Kuwaiti News Agency, UN Iraqi-Kuwaiti Observation Mission spokesman Abdellatif Kabbaj said 200 Iraqi soldiers crossed into Kuwait at 7.10am local time and seized armaments in trenches, including four Silkworm surface-to-surface missiles. UN observers, who guard the trenches, tried unsuccessfully to prevent them returning to Iraq by blocking Iraqi lorries with their cars. The US had no immediate comment on the raid but said it was monitoring the border. Earlier, an official statement issued in Baghdad claimed it was 'incorrect' to conclude that 'Iraq gave in to threats from Bush's administration'. Simultaneously, Iraq continued to ban internal flights of UN aircraft. It denied permission yesterday for a UN aircraft to land, and inspectors of the Baghdad office of the UN Special Commission were stranded in Bahrain. On Saturday a White House statement said the US was satisfied that Iraq had 'backed down' in its latest conflict with the US and its allies. Yesterday US officials did not think the ban on UN aircraft carring weapons inspectors would necessarily escalate quickly into a confrontation equivalent to last week's, although the potential for this clearly existed. Some tentative encouragement was also drawn from the Iraqi statement, which hoped for better relations with the incoming government of President-elect Bill Clinton. It accused Mr George Bush of trying to 'embroil' Mr Clinton in his policies. But the US is not persuaded that Iraq has fully met the terms of last week's UN ultimatum. Its missiles and aircraft appear to have been withdrawn from bases close to the exclusion zone in the country's south, but there was no precise word of their whereabouts. The commander of the US naval flotilla now on patrol in the Gulf said Iraq could expect no more warnings if the no-fly zone was violated in future. Rear Admiral Phil Coady said that President Saddam Hussein 'has had the only warning he's going to be given'. US officials have long been critical of what is known as the Iraqi policy of 'cheat and retreat'. Close aerial reconnaissance of Iraqi defence deployments are likely to continue and there is no plan to order an early withdrawal from the Gulf of the US naval presence. Even if the immediate crisis in the south has been avoided, there is growing concern about Iraqi incursions into the exclusion zone in the Kurdish-dominated north.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Office of Public Service and </F> Science: "Forward With Foresight"]    [Text] Science Minister, William Waldegrave today threw  down the gauntlet to academia and industry to sign up to  "Technology Foresight" to improve the UK's competitiveness and  quality of life.    Speaking at the launch of the UK Technology Foresight  Programme, Mr Waldegrave said:    "The Technology Foresight Programme provides us all with an  opportunity to improve the way in which the UK's scientific and  technological strengths are harnessed to wealth creation and  improving the quality of life. The Programme can succeed only if  industry, academia and Government work together to create the  partnerships and networks which are essential for achieving  these goals. I can assure you that Government will play its  part. I look to industry and academia to do the same."    At the launch the 15 sectors to be covered by the foresight  process were announced. Panels of 15-20 people will be appointed  for each sector to take forward the foresight process.    Each panel will be led by a Chairman and Vice Chairman and  where possible an industrialist will be appointed to one  position and an academic to the other. Panel Chairmen are  already being appointed and five were announced today. These  were:    -- Dr David Grant, Director of Technology, GEC [General  Electric Company] plc will be Chairman of the Manufacturing,  Production and Business Processes Panel    -- Professor John Hillman FRSE, Director, Scottish Crop  Research Institute will be Chairman of the Agriculture, Natural  Resources and Environment Panel - Dr John Campbell, Chief  Technology Officer, Cookson Group plc will be Chairman of the  Materials Panel - Dr Alan Calder, General Manager R&amp;D, Zeneca  Specialities will be Chairman of the Chemicals Panel - Mr H  Nahapiet, John Mowlem plc will be Chairman of the Construction  Panel.    Mr Waldegrave stressed the importance of existing networks,  such as trade associations, which already conduct specialised  foresight activities and for the Technology Foresight Programme  to take advantage of these.    Consultation and partnership lies at the heart of the  foresight process, Mr Waldegrave said -    "Technology foresight is a programme which needs to be  driven  by the vision of our industrialists and our scientists - a  programme which they in turn need to own, since many if its key  benefits - closer working partnerships, better information about  future opportunities - will be for them to exploit.    "For its part, the Government is determined to do all it can  to involve all sectors involved in the foresight process. Not  only companies which already have close links with the science  base. We need to go wider and encourage other companies to  benefit from our strengths in science and technology."    The Technology Foresight Programme is due to report its  results in early 1995.  <H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>   1. The White Paper, "Realising our Potential: A Strategy for  Science, Engineering and Technology", announced the Government's  intention to launch a Technology Foresight Programme. This is a  means of building a consensus on those generic technologies  where new developments are likely to yield the greatest economic  and social benefits to the UK in the long term. The results will  better inform government and industry in making decisions about  funding research and development.    2. During spring 1994 the sectoral panels will carry out the  initial foresight work, drawing together existing expertise. A  preliminary report will then be produced setting out perceived  market and technological developments in their sectors over the  next 10-20 years.    3. The panels will then consult even wider before the  Technology Foresight Steering Group will draw together sectoral  views during the autumn. The Steering Group and panels will then  assess priorities within and across sectors, taking account of  the strengths and weaknesses in UK industry, science and  technology.

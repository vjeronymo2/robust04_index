			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial work conference of town- and  township-run collieries was held in Jinan on 4 June. In line  with the provincial methods for implementing the state policies  on supporting, transforming, consolidating, cooperatively  developing, and upgrading town- and township-run collieries, the  conference made a proposal for consolidating them.    It is reported that over the past years, our province has  rapidly developed the local collieries. So far, 13 cities and  prefectures and 35 counties, cities, and districts across the  province have 592 local collieries of various categories at  various levels, and these collieries have a capacity of turning  out 17.85 million tonnes. Thus, local collieries have held up  half of the province's coal industry. As an important component  of the province's local coal industry, town- and township-run  collieries turned out 10 million tonnes of coal last year,  accounting for one seventh of the province's demand for coal.    Facing town- and township-run collieries' problems cropping  up due to lax management, arbitrary mining and digging, tax  evasion, poor conditions for safety in production, low  disaster-combating capability, the occurrence of more accidents,  and the overstepping of the bounds for mining, Chen Jianguo  stressed: At a time of grasping the development of state-owned  key collieries and state-owned local collieries, the provincial  government has decided to comprehensively and thoroughly clear  up and consolidate town- and township-run and collective-run  enterprises so as to realistically solve their prominent  problems.</p>

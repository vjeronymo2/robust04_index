			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices still in retreat BASE METAL prices were in retreat on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, continuing on the downward path started last week. Three-month copper led the way, breaking below Dollars 2,150 a tonne to close at a 3 1/2 -month low. Zinc and aluminium followed suit, falling to 15-month and three-month lows respectively, while nickel retreated back below Dollars 6,000 a tonne. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said Chinese buying had kept three-month copper above Dollars 2,400 a tonne in January, while last month floods in Arizona and strikes in Mexico and at Papua New Guinea's huge Ok Tedi mine had kept the pot boiling above Dollars 2,200. But any supporting factors had now evaporated, leaving the market with a pessimistic demand outlook for the next 16 months. GNI, the London futures broker, said copper appeared to be on the brink of a major price collapse. Prospects for a pick-up in the US economy had been offset by news that European car production could fall by 1.5m units this year, and that Japanese car production was 16.5 per cent down in January. Weak fundamentals, sluggish physical demand, rising stocks and negative chart formations paint a bleak picture for base metal prices, analysts suggest. While some production cuts have been announced for zinc and nickel, they have been too little too late. Cuts in copper production are unlikely as most producers are still making profits.</p>

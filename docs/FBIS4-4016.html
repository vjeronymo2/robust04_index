			<p>BFN     [Text] Almaty, April 27 (CNS) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's  trip to four Central Asian countries represented a new stage in  which China established intensive and extensive relations with  the four countries, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Dai  Bingguo said today. He added that the visit had succeeded in  its purpose of boosting understanding and confidence as well as  cooperation and good neighbourliness between China and the four  countries based on mutual interest.    Mr. Dai noted that during the visit Mr. Li exchanged views  with leaders of the four countries of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,  Kyrgyztan and Kazakhstan on bilateral relations and on  international as well as regional matters of mutual concern. He  also said that China and these countries shared common ground in  political and economic sectors. First, China and these  countries were very eager to develop bilateral relations and the  leaders of China and these countries would continue to boost  exchange and contacts.    Second, China and these Central Asian countries confirmed  that they should choose their own political system, ideology and  road to be followed based on their national situation. Other  countries were not entitled to interfere with the internal  affairs of a particular country. They also agreed on equality  enjoyed by each country irrespective of how big or small, rich  or poor and strong or weak they are. A just and reasonable  international political and economic order has to be established.    Third, the five countries were all anxious to maintain  stability and peace in the Central Asian region.    Fourth, they all opposed nationalist splittism and other  activities disadvantageous to regional stability.    Fifth, China and these countries expressed their hope to  strengthen mutual consultation and cooperation in international  affairs.    Sixth, they all strongly hoped to expand and intensify  cooperation based on mutual benefits in the economic field for  better results.    Finally, China and the four Central Asian countries agreed  that the Euro-Asian continental bridge had to be fully used  while at the same time measures had to be explored for the  setting up of a modern "Silk Road".    Mr. Dai said he was convinced that China and the four  countries had promising prospects on political relations as well  as on economic and trade cooperation.</p>

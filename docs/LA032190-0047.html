			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: DON'T BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, BOBBY, GIVE US YOUR OPINION  </P> <P> Indiana basketball Coach Bob Knight is always obliging with an opinion, and  here are a few he expressed in an interview in the Louisville Courier-Journal:  </P> <P>  -- On Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls: "He's head and shoulders above  anyone else who ever played the game."  </P> <P>  -- On Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps: "He's a good friend of mine, and I'm his  only friend."  </P> <P>  -- On TV analyst Dick Vitale: "He's got a heart like an elephant and a mouth  to match."  </P> <P>  -- On TV analyst Al McGuire: "He was an outstanding coach because he had a way  of getting people to do things. But he knows nothing about basketball."  </P> <P> Ouch: Announcer Barry Tompkins was quoted in the Atlanta Journal as saying of  Nevada Las Vegas: "They play like thugs. They have a lot of guys you wouldn't  want to bring home unless everything is bolted down."  </P> <P> Trivia time: With Bo Kimble succeeding Hank Gathers as the NCAA scoring  champion, Loyola Marymount becomes the second school to have two different  winners in successive seasons. Which was the first?  </P> <P> Longest inning: The subject was old-timers' games, and former pitching star Jim  Bunning told the St. Petersburg Times: "The first time I played, I got two  quick outs in the inning and couldn't get the third one. There were 11 straight  people up. Nine runs and I still didn't get them out. They finally had to come  and get me.  </P> <P> "Somebody asked our catcher, Joe Garagiola, how hard I was throwing. He said,  'I don't know, I haven't caught one yet.' "  </P> <P> 20 years ago today: On March 21, 1970, Curtis Rowe scored 18 points, and Sidney  Wicks and Steve Patterson had 17 each, with Wicks getting 18 rebounds, as UCLA  defeated Jacksonville, 80-69, in the NCAA basketball championship game.  </P> <P> Boo-som buddies: When the Detroit Pistons last visited Atlanta, Jerry  Glanville, new coach of the Falcons, went to the game with the hope of meeting  Detroit center Bill Laimbeer.  </P> <P> Glanville: "I wanted to meet him, because he's the only guy I know who gets  booed more than me."  </P> <P> Conditional surrender: Chicago Cub Manager Don Zimmer on spring training:  "Pitchers will tell you that first day, 'I'm ready to go.' Then you throw them  for 10 minutes, run them around the field a few times, and half of them will be  on their knees, throwing up."  </P> <P> Grave question: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "If promoters  Don King and Bob Arum disappeared from the fight scene, would anybody even  bother dragging the river?"  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Furman. Frank Selvy won it in 1953-54, Darrell Floyd in 1954-55.  Actually, Selvy and Floyd each won two titles, giving Furman four in a row.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Paul Westhead, Loyola Marymount basketball coach, on keeping Bo  Kimble in the game after he picked up his fourth foul with 25 minutes left  against New Mexico State: "That's my style. Besides, Bo's a very good talker.  If he'd gotten his fifth, he would have talked his way back into the game."  HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok Only Ready To Give Purple </F> Coalition One Chance"]    [Text] The "purple" coalition is only going to be given one  chance by PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok. If negotiations on a  government comprised of the PvdA, the VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy] and the D66 [Democrats 66] fail, Kok has  little inclination to return to the negotiating table with the  same parties.    "In light of the urgent matters requiring a solution in our  country, it is irresponsible to play games. We must make every  effort to reach agreement," Kok warned yesterday.    He confirmed that "the distance between the PvdA and the VVD  is traditionally, historically, and politically wide."  Nevertheless, he finds it wrong to deliberately cause current  negotiations on a possible "purple" coalition to fail, in the  hope that there will be a firmer basis of support if talks with  the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] also came to nothing.    "We must not reproach ourselves for having stood by and let  the chance of a compromise escape us at the decisive moment,"  Kok stated. He sees differences in the negotiations which are  becoming smaller "in their component parts" rather than  unbridgeable gulfs. "But there are indeed some notable  differences."    VVD leader Bolkestein believes that "results are certainly  possible" although they are dealing with "very complex matters."  He states that the process has not yet encountered any "rough  weather" as D66 leader Van Mierlo had forecast.    "The crucial phase the talks have now entered is still going  to continue for a while yet," Kok believes. Discussions are at  present concentrating exclusively on social and economic  affairs, such as employment, spending cuts, social security, and  tax cuts.    The purchasing power of the lower income groups is a crucial  point for the PvdA. "If we cannot arrive at a balanced  distribution of incomes, the negotiations will soon be over,"  one PvdA member said. The PvdA is wondering whether any  agreement is possible on this with Bolkestein. Van Mierlo says  that "he has detected a VVD readiness to prevent too wide a  difference in incomes."    Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo report that the atmosphere  at  the talks is excellent. The politicians, who have been  appointed by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the various  coalitions, believe that it will take a few more days before  stock can be taken of the situation. The impression after the  first talks is that if agreement is reached on the social and  economic questions, the other problems will be much easier to  solve.    While the negotiations concentrate on possible cutbacks over  the next four years, the Lubbers-Kok government still has to  make up for a financial shortfall of at least 1 million  guilders. This was caused by the costs of taking in  asylum-seekers proving higher than estimated while income from  natural gas remained below forecasts.    The spring statement sent by Finance Minister Kok to his  colleagues contains no new spending cuts, but Kok is asking the  other Ministries to adopt a "restrained spending policy." Money  which they save in this way must be used to compensate for the  deficits.</p>

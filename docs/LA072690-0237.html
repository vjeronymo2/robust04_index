			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SINGER SETTLES FISH FARM LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who, accepted a $272,000 settlement today in  his lawsuit against a nearby farm that he blamed for the deaths of up to  500,000 fish at his own trout farm.  </P> <P> Daltrey and his company, Beju Bop Ltd., had sued owners of The Home Farm where  a leak of liquid fertilizer in August, 1986, entered a river and caused damage  at Daltry's Iwerne Springs Fish Farm in Dorset in southwest England.  </P> <P> Daltrey, 45, originally had sought damages of $905,000. The Home Farm had  admitted liability but disputed the amount of damages.  </P> <P> During a two-day hearing before the settlement was reached, Daltrey gave  detailed testimony showing a surprisingly extensive knowledge of fish farming.  He said he had been interested in trout farming since he built his own fishery  in 1979.  </P></p>

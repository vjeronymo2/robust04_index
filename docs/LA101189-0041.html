			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALSE FRONT PAGE WRAPPED AROUND TIMES  </P> <P> About 2,500 copies of Tuesday's Times were wrapped with a fake front page  criticizing U.S. involvement in El Salvador and the newspaper's coverage of  events there.  </P> <P> The crudely fashioned pages appeared in newspaper racks from Santa Monica to  South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A spokesman claiming to represent an unnamed group responsible for the bogus  front pages told United Press International that The Times was targeted because  its El Salvador coverage "is biased."  </P> <P> "We did this so the general population of L.A. can really know what is going on  down there," the spokesman said. "This will happen again and again until  coverage becomes less biased and more full."  </P> <P> Times Editor Shelby Coffey III deplored the action. "We feel the perpetrators'  view of our coverage is erroneous," Coffey said. "They are perfectly free to  have their opinions, but they are wrong in vandalizing our news racks and  misappropriating our name to express those opinions."  </P> <P> The mock front page featured a masthead that read "Los Angels Times" and a  Times-style typeface. It contained stories about the civilian death toll in El  Salvador and the amount of U.S. tax money spent there. There was also a false  apology from The Times for its news coverage.  </P> <P> The flip side of the page contained a denunciation of Salvadoran right-wing  leader Roberto D'Aubuisson and an ad for an upcoming demonstration against U.S.  intervention in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Salvadoran peace activists have also placed phony front pages on newspapers in  Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Phoenix, Baltimore, Tucson and Washington.  </P> <P> Al Brewer, The Times' circulation street sales manager, said most of the phony  pages were placed in vending machines in the Westside, although they were also  found in North Hollywood, Studio City, Los Feliz and in South-Central and  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Dozens of readers reported sighting the phony pages. Some recognized the prank  copies immediately. "It looks exactly like your front page, only darker," said  Margaret Charnoff of Los Feliz, who bought her copy on Hillhurst Avenue. George  Charouhas of Studio City said he was also momentarily fooled. "It took me a few  seconds to realize that The Times looks funny," Charouhas said.  </P> <P> Other readers were confused by the fake page. "What is this, a joke or  something?" asked one woman who lives in Santa Monica. And a caller who  purchased his copy of The Times in Westwood advised: "I think you should know  that there's a Third World-oriented hate parody in your paper today."  </P> <P> Spokeswomen for two of the city's major Salvadoran relief organizations said  they were unaware of the prank.  </P> <P> Ruth Grabowski of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador,  one of the sponsors of Saturday's Salvadoran rally, said she had not seen the  phony page. Mary Brent Wurley, an official with the Interfaith Task Force on  Central America, expressed surprise over the bogus page, then applauded the  stunt.  </P> <P> "That's fabulous," Wurley said. "We don't know anything about it, but we're  very impressed with it. That's so exciting."  </P></p>

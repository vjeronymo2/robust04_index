			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Syltone Pre-tax profits at Syltone, the Bradford-based transport engineering group, were little changed at Pounds 1.23m in the first half to September 30, against a previous Pounds 1.22m. Mr Tony Clegg, chairman, said the company was 'firmly back on course' following the setback in the second half of last year which reduced total profits to Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 2.87m). Earnings per share were 4.24p (4.19p) basic and 4.15p (4.13p) fully diluted. The interim dividend is raised from an adjusted 1.575p to 1.625p. Sales expanded 9 per cent from Pounds 17.3m to Pounds 18.9m. Trading profit came to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.3m) but interest took Pounds 118,000 (Pounds 78,000). Mr Clegg said the best performers in the group had been Drum Engineering in the UK and Drum Industries in the US. Trading in continental Europe, although difficult, was better than expected, he said, and there were clear signs of an upturn in the US.</p>

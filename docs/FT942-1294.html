			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Chinese traders detained over LME losses' Three traders in Shanghai have been detained by the Chinese government in connection with their alleged role in operations that led to losses last year on the London Metal Exchange copper contract, according to Metal Bulletin Fast Track, reports Reuter. Two of the traders worked for the metal trading department at the state-owned China International Trust and Investment Corporation and one was an employee of the Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Bureau. The traders are alleged to be responsible for large losses when the Chinese were unable to meet margin payments as copper prices rose.</p>

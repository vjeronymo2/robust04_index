Ambassador Guo Jiading, leader of the Chinese team,  Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, said that they would also  work hard for the long-term stability and development in the  area.    Guo made these remarks in his Spring Festival message  delivered here today.    He said, in 1994 the two sides of the Joint Liaison Group  would continue discussions on the three major questions in the  transitional period, namely localization of public servants and  law as well as officialization of Chinese language.    Moreover, talks would also be held between the two sides on  the retirement pay for public servants, Macao's joining in  international organizations and many other issues in the  transitional period.    Guo said that 1994 would be a busy year for the Joint  Liaison  Group. However, he said he was convinced that all matters would  be handled properly and timely so long as the two sides firmly  adhere to the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration and cooperate  with each other on the bases of mutual respect, mutual  understanding and sincerity.</p>

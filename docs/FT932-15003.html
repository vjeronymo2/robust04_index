			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow consolidated by good company results Wall Street US share prices firmed slightly in moderate trading yesterday, as more companies reported their first quarter earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.61 at 3,455.64. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.56 at 448.66, while the Amex composite ended up 0.01 at 420.52 and the Nasdaq composite 0.11 higher at 673.94. Trading volume on the NYSE was relatively light at 257m shares, and rises outnumbered declines by 1,022 to 881. In the absence of fresh economic data, and with Treasury prices mostly flat, equity investors looked to quarterly corporate earnings for a lead. Although the reporting season has only just got under way, the early indications are that first quarter profits will be in line with, or slightly better than, analysts' forecasts, with a few notable exceptions. A good set of first quarter reports is vital to ensure that stock market sentiment remains positive. Recent economic figures, if anything, have indicated that the pace of the recovery may be slowing down. This may be good news on the inflation front, but it suggests that corporate earnings, which have been steadily improving over the past year, might tail off later in 1993. Companies manufacturing well-known consumer products ran into selling after Procter&amp;Gamble announced late on Tuesday that it planned to slash prices on its most popular brand of disposable diapers. Coming on the heels of Philip Morris' recent decision to cut prices on its famous Marlboro cigarette brand, the Procter&amp;Gamble move revived fears that competition for consumer loyalty could hurt once seemingly price-insensitive brand-name products. Procter&amp;Gamble shares fell more than Dollars 1 at the opening, before recovering to end Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars 48 1/4 . Kimberly-Clark, which is Procter&amp;Gamble's main competitor in the disposable diaper market, dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 . Other consumer stocks were mixed, with Colgate-Palmolive ending unchanged at Dollars 62 1/8 , Gillette down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 56, and RJR Nabisco Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 5 3/4 . Several large cyclical stocks fared well. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 113 3/8 , International Paper added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 63 1/8 , Allied Signal firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 67 3/4 and General Electric rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 94 1/4 . Wal-Mart dropped another Dollars 2 to Dollars 27 1/4 in volume of 10.3m shares after analysts were disappointed by the retailer's projections of future sales growth at a meeting in New York. Marriott firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 26 after reporting a sharp rise in net income to Dollars 49m, while Hilton fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 after reporting essentially flat first quarter profits. Canada TORONTO prices closed slightly higher in heavy trading helped by a strong showing among gold stocks. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index rose 5.01 points, or 0.14 per cent, to close at 3,629.85. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 361 to 311. Newbridge Networks jumped 1 5/8 to CDollars 77 5/8 as the company said it received a contract to supply intelligent digital networking equipment for New York Telephone's new NYNEX Enterprise Services network. Brascan said a group of banks led by Chemical Bank has asked a British court to rule whether its recent secondary offering of shares of John Labatt violated the terms of the USDollars 500m of debentures held by the banks.</p>

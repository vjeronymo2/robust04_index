			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Japanese score a victory for consumers' rights: But there are still doubts about the impact of a planned new product liability law The legal victory this week of a small construction company over Matsushita, the electronics giant, in a unprecedented product liability case has raised hopes in Japan that consumers have finally won their day. The Osaka district court ruled Matsushita was responsible for a fire that started in a Matsushita-made television set at the construction company's office. But in Japan, where corporate interests generally prevail over the rights of individuals, any celebration of consumer victory is tempered with caution. 'We welcome the ruling but are worried it could send the wrong message to consumers that the law will help them more than will actually be the case,' says Ms Yoko Tomiyama, head of the Consumers' Union. The same goes for a new product liability bill being drawn up by the government and expected to be enacted in 1995. The legislation, which follows nearly two decades of debate, is to give consumer legal protection. But it has been undermined by pressure by industry and the previous government. The draft bill to be presented to the Diet this month has been criticised as weak and full of loopholes. Critics say it could be worse than present legislation. Currently, consumers have to negotiate directly with a manufacturer or launch negligence actions. But Mr Hideki Sugiura, a lawyer specialising in product liability cases, says that in Japan, courts gives people little room for doubt in proving they were hurt by a product defect. 'The Matsushita case was an exception among exceptions.' Under Japanese law it has been difficult for consumers to win product liability cases because they have to prove not only that the defective product caused damage, but also that the manufacturer produced the defective product intentionally or accidentally. There have been only 127 product liability cases between 1949 and 1991, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The draft bill is based on a report of the prime minister's Social Policy Council, which largely reflects the views of ministries, industry and academics. It has drawn criticism from consumer groups and lawyers. Critics say that, as it stands, it favours industry over consumers. It would let manufacturers plead innocence on the grounds that danger could not be predicted in the light of technical standards at the time. This provision was included to answer concerns that strict liability rules would hamper manufacturers' drive to develop new products. At the same time, while access to crucial corporate information would still be severely restricted, the draft bill requires the party seeking damages to pinpoint where exactly the defect is located. The bill further exempts a number of products, such as buildings and certain vaccines from liability. Critics also charge that the rule holding manufacturers liable for only 10 years after a product is put on the market, restricts consumers' ability to win cases, particularly where drugs are concerned. Mr Sugiura believes that the worst of the proposals is the requirement that the term 'defect' be strictly defined. This, he argues, helps manufacturers to prepare for the possibility of liability. 'If that is included, it would be worse than not having a PL law at all,' he warns. Critics also say the proposals fall short of legislation protecting consumers in the US. 'At first we were worried that the Japanese law would be as diluted as that in parts of the European Union, but now we are worried that it will be worse,' says Ms Tomiyama of the Consumers' Union. If the proposed bill goes through as it stands, it will be firm testimony to the strength of industry's voice in the government. But Mr Sugiura is still hopeful. The governing coalition has set up a product liability project team which has mainly lawyers as its members. This group is trying to get the Social Policy Council's proposals reviewed, particularly on the definition of defects, and will have a significant influence over the final form of the bill. 'That is something different from the previous government and offers hope for the bill,' he says.</p>

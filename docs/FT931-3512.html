			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / People: Founder Jones shares out top job Sharelink, Europe's largest execution-only stockbroker, has recruited Richard Fielding (right), former chairman of insurance brokers CE Heath, as non-executive chairman of the holding company. Founder David Jones, who had combined the roles of chief executive and chairman, explains that since last May's management buy-out the company had said it intended to seek a non-executive chairman. 'It has just taken a long time to get around to it; we have all been very busy.' Sharelink has grown rapidly during its six year existence; Jones claims it now sees up to 10 per cent of all stock market transactions in the UK, with a market share of 15-20 per cent of the country's private client business. He is already confident of being able to exceed 'significantly' this year's budgeted profit of Pounds 2.5m. Fielding, 59, retired as chairman of CE Heath last July. Having risen to the position of managing director at the insurance broker in the early 1970s, he left to form his own company, Fielding Insurance Holdings. The latter was merged with Heath in 1986. Fielding became group chief executive and chairman the following year. Approached for the Sharelink opening by headhunters, Fielding says he had never been headhunted before and that he 'enjoyed the novelty'. Jones, meanwhile, reckons his new chairman combines the 'right personal qualities and style' in addition to having the experience of building a business from scratch into a large organisation. 'And insurance is not a million miles from stockbroking - lots of paper, to begin with,' adds Jones.</p>

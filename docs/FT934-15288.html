			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Ruling on Lloyd's paves way for Names to sue agents LLOYD'S underwriting agents could face actions claiming more than Pounds 2bn in damages for alleged negligence following a judgment in the High Court yesterday. Mr Justice Saville ruled that agents had a legal duty to exercise reasonable care and skill when acting on behalf of Names, the individuals whose assets support the London insurance market. The ruling, largely expected at Lloyd's, means the way is now clear for a number of actions by Names seeking to recover hundreds of million of pounds in losses. The judgment also puts pressure on Lloyd's to deliver an out of court settlement. The ruling was welcomed by leaders of the Names. 'This is an enormously important victory,' said Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action group, the biggest group of loss-making Names. It was the 'last major hurdle' for Gooda Names before their case comes to court next April, he added. 'It does not decide the outcome of the war but goes a long way to determine its strategic direction,' said Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association which represents 2,000 Names who are claiming damages of Pounds 600m from agents. The Names had argued that their agents were under a legal duty to exercise reasonable care and skill and perform to the standard of reasonably competent and efficient professional underwriters. The agents disputed this, saying the contracts between agents and Names excluded such a legal duty. Giving judgment in the Commercial Court, Mr Justice Saville said that it 'literally' went without saying that agents had to act with reasonable care and skill. The wide authority given to agents to act on behalf of Names, the potentially unlimited liability faced by Names and the remuneration received by agents pointed 'irresistibly' to the conclusion that the agents have such a legal duty of care, the judge said. He found that members' agents, who handle the affairs of Names, were liable for the conduct of managing agents, who administer syndicates in the insurance market. In addition, he found that managing agents, who administer syndicates, owed a duty of care to Names in tort law even if they did not have an agency contract with the Name. The agents are considering appealing against yesterday's ruling. Lloyd's faces race against time to settle out of court, Page 9</p>

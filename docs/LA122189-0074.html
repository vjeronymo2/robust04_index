			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IS WHERE OFFICE OF FUTURE IS;  </P> <P> JOBS: VENTURA COUNTY EMPLOYEES MAY BE SOON 'TELECOMMUTING,' WORKING FROM HOME  AND COMMUNICATING VIA PHONE, FAX AND COMPUTER.  </P> <P> William Moore of Simi Valley recently cut his 45-mile commute into downtown Los  Angeles to less than 45 feet.  </P> <P> Instead of scrambling into his car and onto the freeway, two days a week Moore  strolls down the hallway to his part-time work space. There, he says he burns  quickly though his work stack during uninterrupted mornings. Without the hubbub  of office activity, he has the quiet he needs to think, a necessity in his job  with the Citizen's Economy and Efficiency Commission.  </P> <P> "You have to discipline yourself," said Moore. "But once that's accomplished,  it's great. I'm more productive. I have more time to spend with my family. And  I feel better without that hassle of commuting."  </P> <P> Moore and 150 others like him who work for Los Angeles County are  telecommuters. Since the beginning of a still-growing program that started in  September, they do their work from home part of the week. They serve as a model  for Ventura County, which hopes to have a telecommuting plan for some of its  5,000 employees by next spring.  </P> <P> The telecommuters represent what officials and futurists say will be an  integral part of the solution to clogged freeways and brown skies in the 1990s.  </P> <P> "It is part of the wave of the future," said John Campbell, president of the  Los Angeles branch of the World Future Society and a telecommuting consultant.  "On the very short term, in five to 10 years, this will be very widespread.  Almost every major employer in the country is looking at this now."  </P> <P> The benefits to employees and their supervisors alike are significant. Surveys  from large private companies and a two-year pilot program among California  state employees show that workers want the program to succeed, so they produce  more, claim less sick time, and generally put out more energy. They report  feeling less stress from fewer commutes; and they feel more important because  they have their supervisors' trust.  </P> <P> Their part-time absence from the office allows other employees to share work  space, so more work is done in less room. The surveys also show that with  minimal expense, the employer provides a benefit that helps in both recruiting  new employees and retaining them, something the low-paying public sector  desperately needs when competing with private industry for personnel.  </P> <P> Telecommuting also eases traffic troubles and reduces air pollution by removing  cars from the road. That helps employers meet the requirements of Ventura  County's Rule 210 and Los Angeles County's Regulation XV, which require  employers to provide workers with incentives for reducing the number of times  they drive alone to work.  </P> <P> "You can't solve this problem of traffic and air pollution unless you get  people to move in non-traditional ways," said Ventura County Supervisor James  Dougherty. "Roads are like jails; as soon as you build them, they're full."  </P> <P> Dougherty and County Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg appointed a  committee this month to plan the move. Among the county departments that would  be candidates for telecommuting are data processing, planning, budgeting and  the Air Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> "You don't get less, but more productivity," Wittenberg said. "The taxpayers  will benefit and so will employees."  </P> <P> Specialists in the field say telecommuters typically have jobs that involve  analysis, research and development, reports or other kinds of writing,  budgeting, typing, architectural drawing or drafting, and computer functions  such as programming or graphics. Some who can't take advantage of these  programs work in the service industry, on assembly lines and in health care.  </P> <P> Telecommuters are not top management or low-level workers who require a lot of  supervision. And in Los Angeles County, supervisors don't want to include  parents of unsupervised preschool children -- too much of a distraction.  </P> <P> Not all telecommuters stay away from the office two or three days a week. Some,  like Greg Stewart, a systems analyst for GTE at its Thousand Oaks office,  commute from West Los Angeles most weekdays. His telecommuting comes into play  in the middle of the night, when he fields emergency calls from the company's  Sacramento data center.  </P> <P> "I worked for the company before telecommuting was widespread," said Stewart,  one of GTE's 400 employees who telecommute statewide. "In those days, we had a  Marina del Rey center, so I would get up and go in there. Now I've cut out the  hassle of leaving the house."  </P> <P> Employers have little to lose and much to gain, said Carol Nolan, sales support  manager of Pacific Bell's Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> "Employees think of it as a benefit even though it doesn't cost the company  anything," said Nolan, whose company has 1,500 people telecommuting statewide.  "This is one of those things you can't stop."  </P> <P> Nolan exaggerates slightly when she says there is no cost. Employers must  invest in training if they want a successful program, cautions Jack Nilles, the  rocket scientist turned consultant who has coordinated programs for Pacific  Bell, the state of California, and the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Employees need tips on how to manage their time, and supervisors must learn to  manage people who are out of sight. Employees must be evaluated not by where  they work, but what they do, he said.  </P> <P> "The telecommuters may know what they're doing, but the poor manager is sitting  there thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm going to get canned because all my employees  are at the beach.' "  </P> <P> Nilles points to the events following the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake.  With no training, preparation or screening to determine which people were best  suited for telecommuting, hundreds of Bay Area residents began working at home  full time. Many later reported feeling isolated and complained of too many  distractions, and supervisors were unsure about how to handle an invisible work  force, Nilles said.  </P> <P> In addition to training costs, employers may have to pay installation costs for  telephones or computers in employees' homes, as well as long-distance phone  bills, Nilles said.  </P> <P> Nilles believes those dollars are well spent.  </P> <P> "For every dollar an employer puts into training and telephone bills, you'll  make back $6 or $7 in increased productivity, employee retention, decreased  sick-leave time, less room for office space, etc.," Nilles said. "The most  expensive part up-front is the training, and we see employers getting their  money back in one to two years, and in some cases, in three months."  </P> <P> In Ventura County, officials are pleased by those prospects, but still view  telecommuting as an experiment.  </P> <P> "The answer is not in the technology, but in the political will to do it," said  supervisor Dougherty. "We're big enough to have an impact, but small enough to  back out if we have to."  </P></p>

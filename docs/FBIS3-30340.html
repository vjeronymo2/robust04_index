			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miodrag Vukovic from Podgorica] </F>   [Text] Ivan Milutinovic Square in Podgorica was too small  to hold all those who wanted to welcome Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. After talks  with Svetozar Marovic, secretary general of the Democratic Party  of Socialists, and meetings with the Montenegrin opposition  parties -- only the pro-Montenegrin bloc did not attend --  Zhirinovskiy held a rally in the capital of the republic. The  fervent atmosphere during the meeting did not result in trouble.  After being addressed by the Russian leader, the crowd of over  50,000 people dispersed peacefully and enthusiastically.    This enthusiasm was caused by Zhirinovskiy, who greeted them  with the words that a great Serb had come to his brother Serbs.  With the victory of his party, Zhirinovskiy said, the Russian  people had determined a new course in policy, particularly  toward the events in the former Yugoslavia. No one must strike  against Serbia, as that would be a strike against Russia. The  world wants to divide the Balkans into many little statelets, so  that the West can catholicize half the peninsula, and islamize  the other half, Zhirinovskiy said.    They are trying to destroy our Orthodox religion, and your  only fault, Zhirinovskiy said, is that you are on the border  with the West, and therefore the attacks on you are all the  fiercer. The Russian Army, some 300,000 troops, is still in  Germany, but if need be it will be moved to the Balkans so as to  protect its brother Serbs. As for the sanctions, Zhirinovskiy  said, they can keep them in force. Russia has all you need, and  will buy everything you can offer. As for defense, if there is  an attack, you should not give it so much as a thought,  Zhirinovskiy said, and added that Russia had not only  state-of-the-art weapons, but also a secret sonar weapon -- as  it is called -- which it will use for its own defense and for  the defense of her Orthodox brothers on the territory of the  present Yugoslavia.    Russian might has to be displayed to the world, so as to  force it to leave the Slavs to live in peace. Russia will make  it clear that Serbia should not be taken lightly.</p>

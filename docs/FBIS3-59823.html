			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Gilat] </F>   [Text] On learning of the killing of 'Imad 'Aqel, the  commander of an 'Az a-din al-Qasem cell, the first thing the  Fatah leadership in Gaza did was to declare three days of  mourning and call a strike throughout the strip. During those  three days of mourning, dozens of youths, regardless of  political affiliation, would clash with troops. Both Fatah and  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] had an interest in assuring that  those confrontations did not get out of control. The ceremonies  held would offer speeches in his memory, his courage would be  extolled and many tears, some of them, at least, crocodile  tears, would be shed at the funeral home in the Jibalya refugee  camp.    If 'Aqel's name had not been erased from the IDF's wanted  list, if he had remained in resistance and refused to submit  himself to the local leadership, he would have been put at the  top of Fatah's wanted list on 14 December. In calling for  mourning in his memory, Fatah is attempting to show that a local  hero is everyone's hero.    But there are lists. The lists of wanted Fatah hawks are  being crossed out these days. Their names have been erased by  the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Whoever appears on the list  goes to the offices of the Palestinian delegation in the Rimal  quarter, receives the honor due him, leaves his weapons and is  accompanied by a young local leader to a final meeting, so it is  hoped, with General Security Service [GSS] personnel. Some Fatah  wanted men still resist. It is not that they will not turn  themselves in, they say, but only after the 13th of the month,  and only to Fatah.    Fatah is already preparing, very energetically, to take  control of the area. What is not clear is whether Fatah/Gaza and  Fatah/Tunis see this exactly eye to eye. The interface with  Israel, if it can be put that way, has been made in a number of  ways: Fatah/Tunis-Israel; Fatah/Gaza-Israel;  Fatah/Tunis-Fatah/Gaza; Fatah/Gaza-Hamas/Gaza. These connections  sometimes have become entangled. That is what happened during a  visit to Gaza early this week by 'Abdallah al-Faz'a, who is set  to become the local inspector-general of police.    His visit was coordinated through Fatah/Tunis with the civil  administration. Senior commanders escorted him and showed him  the facilities and road axes that will be under his control. The  youths who control the offices in the Rimal quarter were not  permitted to accompany him. They did not hide their rage at the  arrangement. "He goes around the area like a prisoner of the  IDF," they said, but meant someone else: 'Arafat, who sent him,  thinks that we are his captives.    For the moment, it seems that Palestinian security forces,  like everything in the IDF, will be divided into three: a police  force, which will deal with civil matters (property crimes,  traffic, neighbors' quarrels). It will not lack for work.  A-Faz'a will be in charge of it.    A larger force, which will be composed mostly of men from  the  Palestine Liberation Army, under the command of Yusuf Naser,  will be responsible for security--the autonomy area borders,  guarding the roads and general security, including  responsibility for seeing that men like 'Imad 'Aqel do not  continue their activities against Jews in the strip. If they try  to attack Jews in Tel Aviv, that will be Israel's  responsibility. It looks as though the physical base of this  force will be the installation that the IDF division stationed  in the center of Gaza used as its headquarters.    There will also be an intelligence service, a "GSS" as it is  called by young Gazans, many of whom have encountered the  original up close. To the general security force will be  attached a unit for protecting people. Twenty-two of them  returned this week from official training in Egypt.    In most Third World countries, official bodyguards also  serve  as a status symbol. Among other things, they are living proof  that you are a leader. When he served as a minister, Avner Shaqi  demanded a bodyguard. At the time, some said that Shaqi wanted  to feel important. It will be a little different in Gaza. The  bodyguards assigned to Dr. Zecharaya al-'Ara, for example, do,  indeed, mark him as a leader, but as a leader of a particular  type, someone not in favor with everyone.    Who will be the commander of the GSS? That question draws an  enigmatic laugh at the delegation's headquarters in Gaza. "It  will be someone, don't worry, and the Palestinian GSS will  definitely work long hours. Everything here will be GSS," one  key activist tells me.    Aharon Domb and his colleagues on the Yesha council claimed  this week that the GSS will work against them. Through  information that they provided the media, they attempted to  portray the GSS as a political tool, but they painted it as a  bungling organization, installing easily discovered listening  devices and trying to recruit Gabi Butbul, chairman of the  Qarney Shomron council. The Palestinian GSS, it seems, will not  use bugs. It will tell people to spill the beans.    Will you also work against Hamas? I ask my man in Gaza.    "That's not the problem," he says. "We know perfectly well  who's who in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. If someone  hides and refuses to obey, we'll found him in a few hours. The  street can expose him."    Do you know, for example, who murdered the lawyer  Abu-Sha'aban As'ad Siftawi?    "Whoever knows knows," says my contact. "It's true that the  killer is still free at large, but after we take control,  whoever needs to decide will decide what to do with him."    Hamas members well know that the period approaching will not  be easy for them. The optimists among them are afraid that  they'll sit behind bars in the coastal prison, which will soon  be turned over to the Palestinians. The pessimists fear a more  vicious script. A PLO man, Tufiq Abu-Husa, tries to put me at  ease. "Hamas is against the agreement but not against Fatah."    It is known that Fatah and Hamas have stable understandings  in Gaza that, until now, since the signing of the agreement on  principles, have been strictly observed. Now, when the PLO must  take responsibility for the security of Jews as well, but the  goal of Hamas is precisely to undermine that security, a  confrontation is likely to be created. It can be expected that  Hamas men will keep their heads down. They are wily and  sophisticated, they want a share of the administration, and more  than a few of them will look forward calmly and confidently to  reaping the fruits of the internal rivalry foreseen within Fatah  itself.    "The only way we'll be able to work peacefully in all of  Palestine," says Abu-Husa, "is through the route of democracy  and the rule of law. We learned democracy in the Israeli prison.  We were all there, we all understood that without democratic  decisions among ourselves and without obedience to those  decisions, we wouldn't achieve anything. I'm sure that everyone  knows that."    It still is not clear how the law will be seen or who will  issue orders. It is clear, however, that "whoever breaks the law  will be judged by the law," as Abu-Husa says. One month ago, he  tells me, the Shati and Jibalya camps, through democratic  elections, selected local representatives for the Fatah  leadership. "'Arafat might be able to tell me to leave my office  in the delegation," one of the activists tells me, fearing that  might actually happen, "but that won't do him any good. Instead  of going to my office, people will just come to see me at home."    The offices are packed with people just now. People with  problems. One has a relative who has been arrested, another has  a property dispute with a neighbor, a third wants to turn  himself in. Most of the problems are solved efficiently. When  the Fatah youths speak about the need for democracy, one can  interpret is as a veiled threat to Hamas. It can also be  interpreted as something else--a broad hint for 'Arafat, not  exactly someone people see as a pillar of democracy.    Rehav'am Ze'evi said in the Knesset this week that if he is  stopped by an armed Palestinian policeman, he will shoot to  kill. Ze'evi and a faction of the settlers apparently still do  not grasp what is going to happen on the ground. Before they are  stopped by a Palestinian policeman, they will be stopped by an  Israeli officer or soldier.    Residents of Gush-Qatif will be permitted to travel only on  certain roads. The IDF will prevent them from entering Gaza city  and will occupy the same control points at the entrances to the  strip that it mans now. A substantial border fence will mark the  boundary. The IDF will patrol the bypass route to Gush-Qatif.  Some of the military outposts on that road will remain in place,  some will be dismantled and some will handed over to the  Palestinians. So far, the residents of Gush-Qatif have opposed  the installation of an IDF base on the settlement. They have  contended that it would impinge on their quality of life. They  seemed to be softening last week. Even now, although they have  not noticed it, they live behind a fence.    At the civil administration offices on 'Omer al-Mukhtar  Street, the entire civic system will be managed in a sort of  government compound. It will be staffed at the professional  level by the same Palestinians who provide most of the services  today. It is possible that the bosses will come from Tunis to  get a secretary and an official car.    Contacts are now under way between local representatives and  the civil administration concerning computers. The IDF will take  with it all the hardware, which was bought with tax revenues  collected from residents of the strip, who also financed the  administration's operations. The current discussion is over  software. A complete work-up of the strip's residents lies  within the administration's computer, including economic data,  tax collection accounts and property holdings. There is also  information of a security nature, which is the source of the  discussion. If the administration doesn't give us the data, say  delegation officials, no great loss. Our own information is just  as good.    Most branches of the administration will cross over to the  Israeli side of the Erez checkpoint. Instead of  "administration," it will be called the "coordination team." A  need will exist for coordination between the local and Israeli  authorities. The level of coordination on civil matters is  already high; the hope is that it will remain so. It must be  assumed that the two sides also have an interest in fostering  coordination in secret services. The Palestinians were very  angry when they found out that Israel had planted agents and  bugs in the PLO's offices in Tunis. It is doubtful whether they  would refuse to share information.    The Palestinians learned more than democracy in Israeli  prisons; some of them also acquired the fundamentals of their  professional training. 'Abd al-Salam Abu-'Asab and Sa'ud  Abu-Ramadan slept in beds side by side in the tents of the  Antzar 2 camp in Gaza. Both were "Shabiba" activists. In prison,  they were ordered by the leadership to prepare a daily newspaper  roundup for the prisoners. Their comrades would comb garbage  dumps, scavenging Israeli newspapers thrown away by the  soldiers, which the pair then translated and edited.    Today, on the outside, they are very busy professionals. One  works for THE WASHINGTON POST, the other for a European  television network. One works for MA'ARIV, the other for YEDI'OT  AHARONOT. They have a competition. One is known for his scoops,  the other for his skilled writing and analysis. You can see them  together at most events.    The pair received instructions this week to go to Jordan for  six weeks advanced study in television in preparation for the  start of operations of the autonomy broadcast network to be run  by Radwan Abu-'Ayish. The pair jointly refused the behest. The  timing is inconvenient for them. Between 7 and 14 December, they  are swamped with requests from foreign networks for assistance,  translation, escorting and even for booking local hotel  accommodations for the television crews.    "There's going to be a lot of work in December," says  Abu-Ramadan. As a journalist, he cannot allow himself to listen  to lectures in Aman while the story of his life is taking place  at home: the start of the IDF's withdrawal and the beginning of  autonomy. There is also a practical aspect--the foreign networks  will pay him and his colleagues hundreds of dollars a day. What  they will do during the week of December 7 to 14 cannot be  compared to what they have earned over the entire past half year.    Campaigns, the biography of Hafiz al-Asad, came  out in Hebrew this week. It was written by Patrick Seale, the  official biographer of the Syrian ruler. The military  publication has an interesting timing. Shortly after the  outbreak of the intifadah, a Hebrew translation was done of  Alistair Horan's book on the Algerian war of liberation. This  highly relevant book has since been distributed to all generals  on the general staff. Is this a sign that someone high up  believes that al-Asad's time has come?    Indeed, although Rabin is stepping on the brakes, his  formula, "withdrawal in proportion to peace," is also acceptable  to the Syrians. More than a small portion of his talks in  Washington was devoted to this subject. Mubarak sent a message  early this week, and Warren Christopher, who will arrive here  next Friday, will try to come up with a creative idea to budge  the negotiations out of the rut they are stuck in. It is for  precisely that reason that he has already spent a week lowering  expectations, but unofficial meetings recently held between  Israelis and Syrians in Europe indicate that there is something  to talk about. The current catchphrase is "Israeli recognition  of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan."    Does this mean that al-Asad is now ready to let settlements  stay on the heights? Al-Asad will not say. Al-Asad first wants  to hear that Rabin is ready, but from the Americans, not from  Rabin himself. The idea of leaving Israeli settlements under  Syrian sovereignty gets a bitter laugh at the settlement council  on the Golan. What is the purpose of getting the Jews of Syrian  out of Damascus when we're going to add 13,000 people to the  community?    "I'm sure that if Rabin weren't prime minister, he would be  running our lobby," says Yehuda Wolmann, chairman of the  regional council and a Rabin man in the Labor Party. Someone in  the prime minister's office has told the Golan settlers that  Peres' foreign ministry will not handle the Syrian deal. That  will reassure some people. Wolmann is calmed by work ("You  really can't say that I'm calm," he says. "I'm still not  sleeping well at night because of the political climate"), by  the fact that development plans and investments on the Golan  have not been disrupted.    In fact, a new mall, Lev Qatzrin, recently opened in  Qatzrin,  new roads have been built all across the Golan Heights, 1,700  housing units are nearing completion, a new holiday village has  just been finished in Neveh-Ativ, 46 new cow barns have been  erected and there are also plans for construction of a tourist  resort, a volcanic park in the hill country. The plans call for  vista points, hiking trails, camping cabins and a visitors  center.    The problem is that unlike other ministers, Minister of  Tourism 'Uzi Bar'am, apparently for reasons not unrelated to his  political outlook, is somewhat reluctant to pour in money.  "Eventually, we'll take this from him," Wolmann vows. He is also  sure, and relatively calm as a result, that there will be no  arrangement over the Golan without elections or a national  referendum, in which it is clear that most of the nation would  vote against withdrawal. He is also certain that the Labor Party  will not abandon the banner of security and settlement.</p>

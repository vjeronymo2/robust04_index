			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> JAZZ FANS SING THE BLUES OVER KKGO SWITCH  </P> <P> About a dozen die-hard jazz fans and musicians have launched a campaign to  fight KKGO-FM's plans to move its jazz programming to an AM station and replace  it with classical music.  </P> <P> "We feel that for 30 years KKGO has been the sole provider of the full spectrum  of jazz on FM radio, and L.A. has become the second-largest jazz community, so  it's crucial to keep KKGO playing jazz on FM," said Ellen S. Cohn, the  organizer of the protest and vice president of Chase Music Group, a jazz and  blues record label. "We're not against classical music. We just don't want to  see jazz relegated to an AM ghetto."  </P> <P> Cohn and other KKGO-FM (92.3) fans met Thursday night at Le Cafe, a Sherman  Oaks restaurant and jazz club, to discuss ways to stop the station from  switching formats. KKGO had played only jazz until last month, when it added  classical music to its playlist from 5-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. daily. KKGO general  manager and president Saul Levine said that he hoped to fill the void left when  all-classical KFAC-FM changed its format to urban rock on Sept. 21.  </P> <P> "This isn't a war between the jazzies and the classical people," Cohn said. "I  think what (Levine) is trying to do is admirable: He's trying to preserve two  art forms in L.A. . . . It's just that we got here first."  </P> <P> In January, KKGO-FM will become all classical, and the jazz that had been  played on the station will then be heard on an AM station now under  construction, which Levine also owns. The call letters for the AM station are  tentatively set as KKJZ (K-JAZZ, 540).  </P> <P> The jazz fans maintain that the sound quality will be inferior on AM.  </P> <P> "We feel the actual broadcast signal is not as good as on FM," Cohn said.  "That's the basic objection. The quality of the broadcast is not going to be  good as what FM offers."  </P> <P> The protesters said they plan to circulate petitions at jazz clubs around  Southern California in an attempt to pressure advertisers. They also will  conduct a mail campaign urging the station to retain the jazz format on FM.  </P> <P> "Jazz has always been scrappy anyway, we just thought we'd be scrappy," Cohn  said.  </P> <P> But when contacted by telehone Friday, Levine remained firm in his decision.  </P> <P> "I fully sympathize with their feelings and that's why we're putting it on the  AM," Levine said. "We will still be an outlet for these artists and this is our  plan."  </P> <P> Levine added that if enough listeners fought his switching jazz to the AM  station, the "economic realities" might force him to turn it into it a rock  station.  </P> <P> Levine said that KKGO's low ratings forced the move. The latest Arbitron  survey, released earlier this week, showed that only 1% of the audience  listened to KKGO during any given quarter-hour period.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS TEMPLE AFTER OPPONENTS REACH  COMPROMISE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council panel approved plans Tuesday for a temple and school  in Woodland Hills after Councilwoman Joy Picus helped reach a compromise to end  a feud between the congregation and residents worried about traffic.  </P> <P> The compromise appears to end the three-year dispute over the plans of Temple  Shir Chadash to build a 450-seat temple, a 750-seat social hall and a religious  school for 300 children in the 19900 block of Topham Street, on 17.5 acres the  temple leases from Pierce College.  </P> <P> After the agreement was disclosed, the council's Planning and Land Use  Management Committee voted 2 to 0 to approve the project, which next goes to  the full council.  </P> <P> Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization Vice President Sy Spalter said his group  got "most of everything we had wanted" under the compromise, worked out during  the past week by Picus.  </P> <P> Homeowners have said they fear the temple's plans for its Pierce College  property, which include a proposal to build 23 homes on the site, would dump  more traffic on nearby residential streets.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Spalter said, his group got pledges from Picus to keep  nearby Calvert Street one way; to review the possibility of making three  adjacent residential streets cul-de-sacs; and to get the city to study  neighborhood traffic problems.  </P> <P> The agreement, however, permits the temple to have a membership of 600 "family  units," 100 more than originally permitted by city zoning officials.  </P></p>

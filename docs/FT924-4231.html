			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Bank customer complaints show marked increase A FURTHER SHARP RISE in the number of complaints against banks by personal customers was reported yesterday by Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman. Complaints in the year to September rose by 60 per cent to 10,109. Mr Shurman said the increase - the fifth consecutive yearly rise from the 1,682 made in the first year of the ombudsman scheme - reflected customer difficulties in the recession and greater consumer consciousness. The number of complaints accepted by Mr Shurman for full investigation under his terms of reference rose 28 per cent to 956. Of the 772 investigations he completed, some 36 per cent resulted in bank compensation. The ombudsman scheme - in which 36 banks, including all high street clearing banks, take part - is limited to personal customers. The ombudsman deals only with claims of up to Pounds 100,000, and most awards were between Pounds 100 and Pounds 10,000. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should order a public inquiry into banks to examine 'excessive' service charges and interest rates and the 'inadequate information' available to customers. The Consumers' Association said the rise in complaints was 'almost certainly the tip of the iceberg'. Mr John Beishon, association director, said consumers were 'fed up to the back teeth with the banks' incompetence'. Mr Shurman said many customers had 'unreasonable expectations' of the service they had a right to expect, but banks sometimes adopted an overly legal approach to complaints instead of seeking fair solutions. 'Banks need to communicate better. One difficulty is the disappearance of the old-style bank manager who everybody knows. Most customers do not know their manager, or have never met him, and that can cause problems,' he said. Of the new complaints received, the largest proportion (19.2 per cent) concerned charges and interest payments, followed by those about lending policy (14.2 per cent) and automatic teller machines (8.7 per cent). Complaints about ATMs formed a far higher proportion (36.2 per cent) of the complaints which fell within the ombudsman's remit and could not be settled without a full investigation. This was because customers felt they should not be liable for fraudulent withdrawals from ATM. Under the code of banking practice introduced this year, liability for a series of withdrawals is limited to Pounds 50. 'There has been a lot of talk about ghost withdrawals, but we have not found any evidence. What we have found is a great deal of fraud, often by someone known to the complainant - a friend, family member or workmate,' Mr Shurman said. He said the code of banking practice, adopted by the banks in March, had improved relations with customers but might need to be amended. One area in which this could be done was limiting cases in which the husband or wife of a small business owner makes a personal guarantee for a sum of money only to be held liable for a greater amount later. Mr Shurman said the code might be amended to ensure that banks always stipulated the maximum amount for which a spouse might be held liable. This would prevent cases where, even following a divorce, a partner must reimburse a bank. NatWest denies 'usury', Page 8</p>

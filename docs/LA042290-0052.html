			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENGINE OF ANIMATION  </P> <P> As a CalArts alumnus (1980), I found David Wharton's April 15 article included  a typical omission -- that of the names and contributions of former  character-animation students. He's not alone; it's an omission made by almost  all of the arts community.  </P> <P> Where were the names of Tim Burton, John Musker, John Lassiter, Ron Clemmons  and others?  </P> <P> For the past 30 years, animation has been treated as a bastard child, not  really considered art and not really considered film. I would contend it has  had a greater influence on world culture than many of the other arts.  </P> <P> Look at advances in computer graphics. Look at shopping malls and theme  restaurants patterned after the Disneyland model, and now the more serious  works of Michael Graves, Arata Isozaki and Frank Gehry.  </P> <P> Look at fashion. Then take a good look at the turn toward the broad and the  cartoony in live-action films, following a string of animated hits. Now look at  prime-time television. And guess what's selling at Sotheby's!  </P> <P> Behind the reinvigorated animation industry is the CalArts character animation  school.  </P> <P> BRIAN P. McENTEE  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

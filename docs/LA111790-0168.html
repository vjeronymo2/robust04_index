			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> SALLY WHITE DAY HONORS CIVIC LEADER  </P> <P> It was Sally White Day in Orange County on Friday, honoring the longtime  Anaheim resident who was in the news most recently for successfully fighting  the city to keep the 70-year-old trees lining a historic downtown area.  </P> <P> The honors started last month when White, 77, who works in real estate,  received the annual community service award from the California Assn. of  Realtors from among 23 nominees statewide.  </P> <P> The city of Anaheim then issued a proclamation in her honor, and the Board of  Supervisors followed suit last week.  </P> <P> "That was the big shocker," White said of the supervisors' action. "When I was  asked to come in, I figured I'd get a proclamation. I didn't expect this day in  my honor."  </P> <P> In addition to the tree controversy, White has served on the city parks  commission, was a founding member of Anaheim Beautiful and helped develop the  Brookhurst Community Center.  </P> <P> In her years as a real estate agent, she played a role in helping the city  build Julianna Street Park and the Senior Citzens Park Plaza.  </P> <P> White and her husband, Joe, have lived in Anaheim for 39 years.

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Thomson CSF result reflects fall in demand THOMSON CSF, Europe's largest defence electronics group, yesterday provided the latest evidence of the slowdown in military equipment demand, with a 17.4 per cent decline in net profits for 1990. Net profits fell to FFr2.17bn (Dollars 383m) last year, from FFr2.63bn in 1989, the second consecutive year of earnings decline, but fractionally better than the group had earlier forecast. Turnover rose 9.8 per cent, slightly more than expected, to FFr37.02bn from FFr33.69bn over the same period. Thomson CSF, 60 per cent owned by the French government, attributed the profits decline to an increase in restructuring charges, to FFr1.1bn from FFr716m in 1989, plus a reduction in contributions from minority holdings, to FFr717m, down from FFr1.27bn, over the same period. Thomson-CSF is making heavy reductions in its workforce to slim capacity in line with demand. However, last year's net profits margin came out at 6 per cent as forecast, which Mr Alain Gomez, group chairman, said is among the best in the defence electronics industry. Thomson CSF is one of the two main divisions of the fully state owned Thomson group, along with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which in February announced a FFr2.7bn net loss, after a FFr1.8bn restructuring charge.</p>

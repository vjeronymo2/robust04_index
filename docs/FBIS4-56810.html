			<p>BFN     [Text] In his 10th report to the UN secretary general,  Diego Garcia-Sagan, director of the Human Rights Division of  Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] noted "a slight  improvement" in the human rights situation, compared to the  critical problems noted in recent months. Nevertheless,  Garcia-Sayan revealed that arbitrary executions and threats of  arbitrary execution still represent the largest number of  reports received by Onusal.    Between November 1993 and February 1994, the Human Rights  Division received 35 reports of arbitrary executions and 12  threats of arbitrary execution. Onusal does not rule out  political motives in some of these cases.    Regarding the death of Francisco Garcia Veliz, leader of the  FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the report  says that investigations have not progressed enough and that  they apparently have reached "a stalemate" as a result of  limited sources of information. Velis' autopsy revealed that he  was a drug addict, so no one knows who would benefit from the  crime.    Garcia-Sayan said Onusal's Human Rights Division is  continuing its investigation and does not rule out any  hypothesis, "even though a political motive seems most probable."    Likewise, he says that "the police's inability to capture  the  culprits and the Judicial Branch's inability to prosecute them  still represent the basic reason for the high percentage of  rights violations, particularly with the status of impunity,  which is still very critical."    Garcia-Sayan said the various organized groups of criminals  who operate in the country comprise former Armed Forces members  and former FMLN fighters. Referring to the violent actions  carried out by these groups, he said that they possibly involve  crimes resulting from "a settling of accounts" with "private"  political components and that this could be a result of the war.    The number of death threat reports received by Onusal rose  to  77, which is the highest registered level in 1993 and 1994.  Some of the cases were a result of the electoral process. The  report adds that the Judicial Branch and the National Police are  still the institutions most frequently mentioned by Onusal as  responsible for human rights violations in the country. Other  reports received during that period involve mistreatment and the  state's legal duty to investigate and prosecute.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> VOTE ON SALES TAX OPPOSED  </P> <P> In a rare moment of unity Tuesday night, the City Council voted 5 to 0 against  putting the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's proposal for a  half-cent sales tax increase on the ballot. But city councils in El Monte,  Hermosa Beach and Compton approved similar resolutions Tuesday.  </P> <P> Under the commission's proposal, 30% of the tax money would be distributed to  cities so they can improve local streets and roads. The remainder would be used  for freeway and highway projects such as car-pool lanes and tow service patrols  and to buy land for commuter rail lines.  </P> <P> In order to place the measure on the ballot, the commission needs backing from  44 of the county's 86 cities. It now has support from 20 cities.  </P> <P> Monterey Park is one of four cities that have refused to back placement of the  sales-tax issue on the ballot. Last month, Temple City rejected a similar  proposal. But San Gabriel Valley communities such as Covina, West Covina and  Duarte have supported the ballot plan.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's meeting, Councilman Chris Houseman questioned the plan's emphasis  on freeway and road projects.  </P> <P> "All of this is going to create more lanes for more cars to get stuck in," he  said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Judy Chu said she is reluctant to support the plan partly because  the city and other Southland communities are not adequately represented on the  county Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's enough to have just two representatives for all the cities  outside of Long Beach and Los Angeles," Chu said.  </P> <P> Despite the setback in Monterey Park, commission spokeswoman Brynn Kernaghan  said she is optimistic the county will be able to round up enough support by  the end of next month to get the measure on the ballot.  </P></p>

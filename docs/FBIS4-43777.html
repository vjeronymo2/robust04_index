			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Bonn Hesitates With Aid to </F> Rwanda"]    [Excerpt] Bonn/Paris -- In case of a French intervention  in the African civil war country of Rwanda, the Federal  Government will not provide logistical aid or become otherwise  involved for the time being. Despite very early information by  the French about the forthcoming intervention and despite a  request for support, Bonn has refused.    However, the Chancellor's Office, the Foreign Ministry, and  the Defense Ministry in Bonn intend to permit humanitarian  relief flights by the Air Force as soon as the Kigali airport is  secured and is firmly held by the French. This would involve  the supply of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs. Any participation  in a military action must, however, be renounced until the  Federal Constitutional Court has ruled on the Bundeswehr's  missions abroad. Such a ruling is expected this July. Among  the political leadership of the Defense Ministry, it is said:  "The ruling of the Constitutional Court has absolute priority  for us."    France had asked Germany, Italy, and Belgium to participate  in the planned intervention. French Government officials had  pointed to the strategic partnership between the two countries.  However, both Bonn and Rome refused to participate. Italy's  Defense Minister Cesare Previti said yesterday that Italy is not  willing to send troops. [passage omitted]</p>

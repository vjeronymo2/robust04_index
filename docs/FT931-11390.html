			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Bush anti-union orders overturned PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has rescinded two Bush administration directives which the trade union movement considered unfair. The first prohibited companies which entered into project agreements with unions from competing for federal contracts. It was issued by President George Bush just before last November's election in return for the backing of the trade association representing non-union building companies. The second, issued earlier last year, required the posting of notices on all federal projects advising workers of their rights not to pay union dues according to the terms of a 1988 Supreme Court ruling. Mr Clinton's actions are reminiscent of those taken on the first Friday of his presidency when he lifted several Bush and Reagan orders limiting access to abortion. Mr Clinton said he had acted 'to restore a needed balance in America's workplace' and to reduce 'unnecessary federal government intrusion'. He said that project agreements with unions allowed more reliable cost estimates and promoted safety in the workplace.</p>

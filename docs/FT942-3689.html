			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Poll ends coalition's honeymoon - Irish Republic The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition in Ireland emerged from the European Parliament elections with its representation at Strasbourg intact. Fianna Fail, the centre-right party of prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds, secured seven of the 15 Irish seats, one better than in 1989, while Labour managed to retain its Dublin seat but only after a nail-biting series of counts on the vote transfers which almost saw the seat lost to Fine Gael, the main opposition party. The nationwide drop in vote share for both coalition parties - but particularly for Labour - has signalled that the 18-month honeymoon with the electorate is over. Fianna Fail's vote has fallen from 39 per cent in the 1992 general elections to 35 per cent, while Labour's vote has plunged over the same period to 11 per cent, albeit from an all-time high in 1992 of 19.5 per cent. The emergence of the Green party, which won two seats, has highlighted the government's inaction on key environmental issues. These include the recent commissioning of the UK's Thorp nuclear reprocessing facility on the opposite side of the Irish Sea, plans to push ahead with a peat-fired power station in the Irish midlands, and procrastination over the building of a new light rail system in Dublin to ease traffic congestion. The Greens have a weak organisation nationally, however, and still have some way to go before they pose a serious threat in national politics. The collapse of Fianna Fail's vote in Dublin, from 33 per cent in 1992 to 21 per cent now, appears to stem in part from an unpopular residential property tax introduced in the last budget. Canvassers said this was a common complaint of householders during the campaign. It must raise questions over the coalition's resolve to press ahead with its plans to reform the tax system. This and other tensions within the coalition are likely to be aggravated in the months ahead, as Labour absorbs the lessons of this election and tries to regain the popularity it achieved as an assertive opposition party before entering the coalition. The danger is that any fault-lines that appear within the coalition are likely to be quickly exploited by Fine Gael, which has been buoyed by its relative success in stabilising its vote at 24 per cent nationally, after successive poll humiliations. The other main opposition party, the Progressive Democrats (PDs), polled only 6.5 per cent and last night lost its only seat in Munster to an independent, Mr Pat Cox. In the local elections, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has won more council seats nationally than the PDs.  --------------------------------------------- Population: 3.6m Seats: 15  --------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 37%; 1989, 68.3%)  --------------------------------------------- Party*      Parliament     % vote      Seats               group      '94    '89  '94   '89  --------------------------------------------- FF             EDA             31.5    7     6 FG             EPP             21.6    4     4 Greens      Greens                -    2     - Labour         PES              9.5    1     1 PD             LDR             12.0    0     1 DL              NA              7.5    0     1 Ind.

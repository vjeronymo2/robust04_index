			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER, SHEVARDNADZE TO MEET IN HOUSTON  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze agreed Wednesday to meet Dec. 10-11 in Baker's hometown of Houston  to prepare the ground for a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting early next year.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze said it is possible that he and Baker will be able to settle all  remaining differences on a treaty reducing U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals  during their Houston talks, clearing the way for President Bush and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to meet in Moscow to sign the pact.  </P> <P> "I don't know whether it will be in January or possibly a little later,"  Shevardnadze said of the Moscow summit.  </P> <P> Baker and Shevardnadze set the date during a two-hour meeting at the  headquarters of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. The men were in New  York in advance of today's Security Council meeting taking up a measure that  would authorize the use of force to drive Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait.  </P></p>

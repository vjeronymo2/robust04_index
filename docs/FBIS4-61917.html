			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS -- Director of the Russian  Military and Analytical Centre, Aleksandr Konovalov, believes  that joint Russo-U.S. exercises on the Totsk test-site near the  city of Orenburg will help bring the people of the two countries  closer together. In an interview with ITAR-TASS Konovalov said  that any "statements against conducting the maneuvers are  prompted, primarily, by situational and political considerations  and do not meet Russia's national interests."    According to the military analyst, statements alleging that  the U.S. intends to "find out" Russia's secrets during the  exercises are groundless as well. He rejected speculations  alleging that Americans are interested in obtaining documents  about an air nuclear explosion above the test-site made by the  former Soviet Union in the 1950s. According to Konovalov, the  results of an investigation into after-effects of the explosion  were made public and are no longer secret. Besides, a group of  scientists had recently worked on the test-site and the results  of their work were published and contain no secrets for the  world public.    Konovolov believes that the exercises of peace-keeping  forces  are of principal importance since Russian troops will inevitably  have to carry out joint peace-keeping operations, while until  now Russian soldiers and officers had not received sufficient  experience. There is nothing wrong if a battalion, a regiment  or a division take a training course using methods worked out by  the best experts and experienced officers from Russia and the  United States, Konovalov said.    Such training exercises will help many Russian servicemen  from a peace-keeping contingent to survive, he said. "The  military will be offered a wonderful chance to communicate, to  know each other better and it will be the best way of bringing  the people of the two countries closer together, making war go  back into the past," Konovalov said.</p>

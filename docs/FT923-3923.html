			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Curbs on party funding proposed in France FRANCE'S Socialist government, mired in scandals over party finances, yesterday proposed a ban on all business donations to political parties in a drive to fight corruption, Reuter reports from Paris. The draft bill, to be considered by parliament next month, is part of a crackdown on graft pledged by Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy when he took office in April. While allowing individuals to donate up to FFr30,000 (Dollars 6,270) to political parties, the bill bans funding by companies and reinforces control over public tenders to combat influence peddling. 'Only a ban on company funding can guarantee honesty in politics,' said government spokesman Martin Malvy.</p>

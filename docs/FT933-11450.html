			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Abbey Life rises 7% - Advance to Pounds 152.5m despite slight reduction in new business LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life insurance group, yesterday announced a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 152.5m for the six months ended June 30, despite slightly lower new business activity in its two key subsidiaries. Earnings per share came to 14.3p (13.9p), while the interim dividend was again 6.3p. Profits in the Lloyds Abbey Life insurance division rose slightly to Pounds 69m, although new life and pensions business, on an annualised basis, fell by nearly 2 per cent to Pounds 106m. The modest decline in sales coincides with a drop in sales agents at Lloyds Abbey Life. This follows new regulatory requirements on the training and competency of staff. From 3,500 sales agents at its peak, the number could fall to 2,500 by the end of this year. Sales of unit trusts however, more than trebled to Pounds 371.5m. Profits within the Black Horse Financial Services division, based in branches of Lloyds Bank, the company's 60 per cent shareholder, rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 60m, despite lower life and pensions sales. Much of the rise reflects the recognition in the current period of profits earned on older business under the embedded value method of calculating life insurance company profits. Also within the past few weeks, the company has temporarily suspended its pensions transfers business at its Black Horse division while the Securities and Investments Board, the regulatory body which oversees its activities, completes a review of pensions policies sold through banks. Pensions transfers, which represent less than 15 per cent of pensions policies sold at Black Horse, are policies sold to those transferring out of occupational schemes and regulators have become concerned that they are being sold to people who would be better off remaining where they are. Almost all banks which sell personal pensions have at least temporarily suspended their pensions transfers business. Meanwhile, sales of unit trusts at Black Horse, more than trebled to Pounds 332m. Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, said unit trust sales reflected 'people who were dissatisfied with the rates they were earning on deposit accounts.' Nearly half of the unit trust sales at Black Horse are from Lloyds Bank customers who have switched their own accounts into unit trusts. However, he said that unit trust sales had experienced a 'bulge' in the middle of the period and have slowed down slightly recently although they were still 'quite strong'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 21 (XINHUA) -- The 29th meeting of  the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) opened here today  after a half-year suspension.    Prior to the meeting, both sides expressed the hope that  they  can make some progress through the meeting.    Guo Fengmin, senior representative of the Chinese side, said  the JLG should speed up its work, however that requires efforts  from both sides.    "There are only three years left between now and 1997 and  there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss."    He revealed the Chinese side would bring some subjects for  the discussion of JLG at this meeting. The objective is to  ensure a smooth transition in Hong Kong.    British senior representative H. L. Davies said, "we can use  the next three days to advance things as fast as we can."    He also said, "when we met in London, the weather was not  very good. I am glad to say today's weather is sunshiny. The  forecast for the next three days is even better so I am  confident we will make progress."    The Chinese senior representative said in reply, "let's join  our efforts." The previous JLG meeting was held in London  between December 7 and 9 last year. It was reported that the  current meeting will focus such subjects as military land issue,  localization of laws and passport issue.</p>

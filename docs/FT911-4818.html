			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: United Technologies' first quarter hit by recession THE impact of the US recession on the airline, building and automotive industries has severely hurt first-quarter earnings at United Technologies, the diversified engineering group, which yesterday turned in results that were significantly worse than expected. Although the company had warned that earnings in the first half of 1991 would decline, the first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 40.2m, or 25 cents a share, were sharply below the 75 cents a share anticipated by most analysts. 'I had expected a bad quarter and reduced my estimates to 50 cents a share,' said one analyst, 'but these figures were terrible.' In the first three months of 1990, UTC had net earnings of Dollars 134.5m, or Dollars 1.01 a share. Revenues were flat at Dollars 4.8bn in both years. Mr Robert Daniell, chairman and chief executive, said harsh economic conditions had a severe impact on first-quarter performance. 'Airline travel, building construction and automobile production; all are down sharply. This is the first time all three of these core commercial markets simultaneously have been at the bottom of their industrial cycles. 'We are not running our businesses on the assumption that the recession is nearing an end,' he added. Operating income in UTC's power segment plunged to Dollars 113m from Dollars 249m a year ago. At UTC's Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, which recently said it would cut between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs by the end of June, revenues from its lucrative spare parts business dropped 25 per cent in the first quarter. The company blamed the decline on sharply reduced airline travel and poor financial results at the airlines.</p>

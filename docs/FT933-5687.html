			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / University rejections increase by 10% REJECTIONS OF candidates by universities have increased by 10 per cent this year compared with the same point last year, the universities' admissions system said yesterday. The figures confirmed predictions that admissions would be much tighter this year following better A-level results than expected and a cut in government funds for arts courses. The increase in rejections from 120,000 to 132,000, and the improved A-levels, suggested that candidates had been rejected in spite of attaining grades which would have earned them a place last year. Suggestions that the admissions procedure would be chaotic appear to have been exaggerated, however. The 'old' universities (excluding those which were polytechnics or colleges of higher education until last year), have already accepted slightly more students than last year, according to the Universities Central Council on Admissions (Ucca). It expects that about 137,000 places will eventually be awarded. Last year just less than 130,000 students were given places. Slightly more applicants have been accepted through clearing this year than at the same point last year (1,155 compared to 1,073). Few places are available on popular single-honours arts courses, for which funds have been cut, but universities are having difficulties in filling science courses, though funding is unchanged. Clearing started later for the former polytechnics, but many report a much harder year than last year because they were obliged to accept students whose arts A-levels would normally have been good enough to gain a place at one of the 'old' universities. Mr David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, said problems with clearing had been exaggerated by the press, and older universities in particular had 'gone to huge lengths' to take more students.</p>

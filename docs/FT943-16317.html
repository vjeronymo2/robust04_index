			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Light flickers at the end of the autobahn: David Waller reports on guarded optimism in the German carmaking industry Last year was an unrelenting chronicle of bad news for the German car sector  -a story of plunging order books, big losses and massive job cuts. 'The worst year in a decade,' mused Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, General Motors' German subsidiary, last week. Now, halfway through the current year, Germany's car industry executives are beginning to feel that the worst is behind them. If the mood is not exactly one of unqualified optimism, there are signs that the largest vehicle market in Europe is staging a steady recovery. Here are some recent developments: German car production increased by 15 per cent in May, to 353,400 vehicles and for the first five months of a year in total, car production rose by 2 per cent to 1.69m, reversing the downwards trend of the previous four months. Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, said last week it would make a profit of at least DM100m (Pounds 40.3m) in the current year after incurring losses in both 1992 and 1993. Also last week, Adam Opel said it expected a 'dramatic improvement' in 1994  -but hinted that it was unlikely to move back into the black after losing more than DM500m at the operating level in 1993. Mercedes-Benz, the Daimler-Benz vehicle subsidiary, said recently that sales of its new cars within Germany rose 41.5 per cent in the first five months of the year, while in May the increase was more than 50 per cent. At Volkswagen, sales of the VW marque were up 0.7 per cent in the five months and by 11.5 per cent in May alone. Last week Audi, VW's up-market subsidiary, reported that sales to export markets rose 14 per cent in the first six months. BMW, the company which has proved itself most resilient to the downturn, held unit sales steady at around last year's levels. German manufacturers have enjoyed a sudden revival in overseas sales, particularly in the important US market where VW's sales, for example, more than doubled to nearly 22,000 cars in the first five months. Porsche, the sports car manufacturer, said on Friday that its sales in the US would increase by 35 per cent this year. This combination of factors has led General Motors to revise upwards its 1994 forecast for the German market as a whole: GM now expects sales to be roughly the same as last year when they dropped to 3.19m, a steep decline from the 3.93m cars sold in 1992. The original forecast was for a further decline, to 3m units. However, the modest improvement in the outlook does not signal the all-clear for the German car industry, for two reasons. First, the increase in unit sales in Germany may not translate into a surge in profitability. Mercedes, for example, owes the increase in its sales to the new C-Class model, which is selling at five times the sales last year of the 190 model which it replaced. The new cars are being sold at what analysts estimate to be an average price of DM44,500 per car, lower than the DM50,000 which Mercedes hoped to achieve when developing the model. The second cloud on the horizon is costs: Mr Stephen Reitman, analyst at UBS in London, says German car companies still lag their international competitors. 'In terms of productivity measures, such as the number of vehicles produced per year per man and the cost per vehicle, the German companies trail behind.' This is in spite of the aggressive cost-cutting implemented by German manufacturers: Daimler-Benz said it reduced its costs by DM5bn last year, with most of its rationalisation measures falling at Mercedes, where the plan was to cut 42,500 jobs between 1992 and 1995. Volkswagen cut its domestic workforce by nearly 9 per cent last year and aims to save DM3bn this year by introducing a four-day working week. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former GM director who defected to VW last year, is thought to have squeezed cost reductions of DM5bn to DM6bn by putting pressure on suppliers. But 'even VW has only half grasped the nettle', says one analyst, alluding to the four-day week programme. 'There is unlikely to be an explosion in production so VW will end up facing the same overmanning problems as before,' the analyst said. The only answer to the competitive pressure will be 'more of the same' - further job cuts, further pressure on costs, a further shift of production out of Germany. This is likely to prove difficult for German companies, especially in the early stages of a recovery when employees are likely to prove reluctant to make sacrifices that were bearable in a recession. If the outlook for car manufacturers is fraught with challenge, for their suppliers there are 'sweat and tears' ahead, according to Mr Rainer Thieme, deputy president of the the VDA motor industry association which represents suppliers to the big car manufacturers. He said last month that despite the painful adjustments necessary in the wake of the manufacturers' cost-cutting measures, suppliers had only completed half the rationalisation necessary to guarantee survival over the medium-term. Job cuts in the sector will not stop at the 50,000 jobs lost since 1990-91, and many suppliers will be rationalised out of existence.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- West European new car registration January-May 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Volume      Volume change from                           units       previous year (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany                 1,455,000           -0.6 Italy                     887,000           -4.3 United Kingdom            822,000           13.3 France                    803,000           16.0 Spain                     359,000           17.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Industry Estimates  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

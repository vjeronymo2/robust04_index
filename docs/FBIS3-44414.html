Major General Zhang Zhu, political commissar of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional People's Armed Police Corps, spoke. He  said: Today, I am being honored with the title of major  general. This is the result of the care shown toward me by  higher party organizations and leaders at all levels, of their  efforts to educate and train me, and of the full support and  assistance of officers and men of armed police troops across the  region. It is the greatest encouragement and inspiration both  for me and for the People's Armed Police Corps. I am determined  to live up to the high expectations of the party and people by  uniting and leading armed police officers and men throughout the  region, under the leadership of the autonomous regional party  committee, government, and People's Armed Police Corps, in  seriously studying and implementing the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Fifth  Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Autonomous Regional  Party Committee; by fully implementing the party's line,  principles and policies; and by further building up and leading  my troops so that they will truly become faithful defenders of  the party and people, serve as daggers with which to cope with  riots and contingencies, and make new contributions to opposing  splittism, defending the motherland's unity, strengthening  national unity, and safeguarding Tibet's economic construction.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESERVIST HELD IN ALLEGED INSURANCE SCAM  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrested an Army Reserve sergeant who allegedly tried to  collect more than $100,000 for a phony life insurance claim, officials said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Harold Dwayne Peterson, 59, of Laguna Beach is accused of forging the seal used  by the Orange County coroner's office and the county recorder's office on death  certificates in an effort to collect $100,000 from Minnesota Mutual Life  Insurance Co. in St. Paul, Sheriff's Department Lt. Robert Rivas said.  </P> <P> Peterson, a full-time reservist based in Santa Ana, was arrested Wednesday  about 11 a.m. at the Airporter Inn Hotel on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine by  undercover sheriff's officers, who set up a meeting with him to deliver a bogus  check from the Minnesota company, Rivas said.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Rivas said, Peterson collected $119,037 in insurance from  American Founders Life Insurance Co. in Texas.  </P> <P> Peterson was arrested on suspicion of attempted grand theft and forgery and  taken to Orange County Jail, Rivas said.  </P> <P> Rivas said Peterson took out a life insurance policy in April, 1982, on a  friend who had died 14 months earlier. He allegedly stole or forged the county  seal required on death certificates and gave a phony death certificate to the  Minnesota company, claiming that the friend died Dec. 27, 1988. Peterson used  phony stamps that were facsimiles of the recorder's office seal and the  sheriff-coroner's seal, Rivas said. The stamps might have been made in Hong  Kong, which Peterson visited during his Army travels, Rivas said.  </P> <P> When sheriff's officials searched Peterson's home, they found phony printing  stamps, several other death certificates and evidence that he used the same  kind of certificate for the Texas and Minnesota claims.  </P> <P> Officials raised Peterson's bail from $50,000 to $500,000 when they learned  about money put out by the Texas company.  </P> <P> "It is unknown if any other companies have lost money because of forgeries by  Peterson," Rivas said.  </P></p>

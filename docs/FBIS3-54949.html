			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1100 GMT on 4 January broadcasts a report from the  "Vesti" newscast by correspondent T. Orlova over video of  printing and typesetting operations, on the newspaper printing  workers' reaction to the government resolution of 25 November  1993, which forced up costs for printing and publishing  services. Many publications will soon have to close altogether.  Journalists and editors appealed to Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin on 30 December to take urgent measures; and staff  of Moscow publications and regional printing organizations have  set up a strike committee, which demanded subsidies for  publications that have already been subscribed to, and the means  to participate in privatization. Unless something is done, the  week parliament opens -- 10-17 January -- publication of  newspapers will be suspended.    Over video of a news conference, Orlova goes on: "One should  evidently forget about freedom and independence of the press,  too. For the moment, only those publications and television and  radio programs that are either financed by the government or  belong to commercial organizations are able to survive. In a  word, he who pays the piper plays the tune. Valeriy Kucher,  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editor in chief gave further evidence of this  at a news conference today, citing information he said he had  learned from authoritative government sources. A decree is  being drawn up to close this newspaper and to set up on its  basis a government organ named DERZHAVA (THE STATE). The reason  for this is that just before the New Year, the editorial staff  took its cue from the new Russian Constitution and announced  that it was leaving the government's tutelage."</p>

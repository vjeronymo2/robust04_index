			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Wielding the knife with politicians at his elbow: Paul Betts and John Ridding talk to the head of the French carrier about his plans to reawaken the sleeping giant and return it to profit by 1995 I am not a magician,' sighs Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, as he contemplates the balancing act he will have to perform to implement his new recovery plan for the loss-making French national flag carrier. His target is to return it to profit by 1995. The task has been made all the more difficult by the conflicting demands of his government shareholder, anxious to see the airline in the black before privatisation - but without provoking any serious industrial or political backlash at a time of growing unemployment in France. Even if Mr Attali succeeds, he has no guarantee that he will keep his job. Appointed by the former socialist government four years ago, his position has looked precarious since the centre-right returned to power in March. Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister, said last week that the government would judge Mr Attali on the results of his recovery plan. But he would not commit himself further on the future of the Air France chairman. Although under increasing pressure from the government, Mr Attali - twin brother of Mr Jacques Attali, former head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - said he continued to have good relations with his state shareholder. The government was closely consulted over the new recovery programme. Faced with record losses of FFr3.8bn (Pounds 430m) in the first half of this year, a much deeper than expected domestic recession and continuing discounting and over- capacity in the world airline market, Mr Attali said the airline had no alternative but to accelerate the pace of restructuring and reduce its costs. His third and most radical recovery plan in as many years will involve an additional 4,000 job cuts on top of the 4,600 already shed; a further FFr8bn reduction in new aircraft investment; more cuts in the airline's route network - bringing the total number closed since 1989 to more than 160; the sale of some non-core businesses, such as the Meridien hotels chain, and the contracting out of several other activities. Overall, the airline is aiming to cut FFr5.1bn from its annual costs by 1995, including FFr 3.4bn next year. The most sensitive aspect of the plan is the job cuts. Faced with an unemployment rate of 11.7 per cent and rising, the government has ordered public sector companies to minimise job losses. Cost-saving plans will be rejected if they do not make full use of measures  -such as part-time working and early retirement - to be included in a jobs package to be debated in parliament next month. The government has imposed tough restrictions on compulsory redundancies in state sector enterprises as part of its efforts to contain unemployment. Mr Attali claimed this would not have a significant impact on the airline's latest cost-cutting drive. 'We managed to make only 36 compulsory lay-offs in our previous job-cutting programme, involving 4,600 people, and we again expect to meet the bulk of our new target without resorting to involuntary redundancies.' The rewards of the programme are potentially substantial. 'Over a four-year period we will have reduced by 27 per cent our unit costs in real terms. We've already cut them by 13 per cent, so we are half way there,' he said. High costs have long been the Achilles' heel of Air France. 'The airline was probably less prepared than others for the prolonged recession and that is why we have to step up our restructuring and cost-cutting efforts,' he acknowledged. But he claimed that during the last three years wide-ranging changes had already been made to the company's structure and operations. The first fundamental move by Mr Attali was to absorb UTA, the independent French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the domestic airline. Together with alliances with Sabena of Belgium, CSA of Czechoslovakia, Continental Airlines of the US, Air Canada and Aeromexico, this has given Air France a global network as comprehensive as those of British Airways or Lufthansa. The second was to refocus the airline around its Paris hub of Charles de Gaulle airport, cutting unprofitable and peripheral services to concentrate on profitable strategic routes. 'You should not under-estimate what we have been doing. We are modernising the company, getting to grips with costs and changing mentalities,' he said. 'Until four years ago, Air France had never made a single job cut in its entire history.' But he said the airline simply could not undertake sudden, violent Anglo Saxon-style restructuring programmes. 'We are in France and we have our political and social constraints which we must take into consideration.' The airline's problems have been exacerbated by what Mr Attali calls 'three big shocks coming all at the same time'. The first has been the recession in France. 'It's been severe and we rely on the domestic market for about 45 per cent of our sales,' he said. The second has been the onslaught of US airlines into the French market. 'We've had eight US carriers dumping prices into our market, while BA has been protected from this because of the restrictive bilateral aviation agreement between the UK and the US. I call that kind of bilateral the equivalent of state aid.' The third problem has been the general overcapacity in the market and Mr Attali does not expect any improvement before 1995 or 1996. That has left him with little choice but to launch his toughest recovery programme. In what has clearly been a particularly fraught period for the airline, Mr Attali has taken some consolation from a recent report on European airlines by Lehman Brothers suggesting that there was 'great potential' for Air France to become one of Europe's most successful airlines  -but only if it seriously reduced its cost base. 'The sleeping giant, as some people have described us, is stirring,' Mr Attali said.</p>

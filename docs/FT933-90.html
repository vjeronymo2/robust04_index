			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: New Zealand Rail NEW Zealand Rail, which the government has sold for NZDollars 328m (USDollars 181m) to a consortium led by Wisconsin Central Transportation of the US, reports a 14 per cent increase in operating profit to NZDollars 45.5m for the year ended June, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Sir Allan Wright, chairman, said that the company was trading 'substantially ahead of budget' in its first three months of this year. This a period in which the group traditionally loses money, he said. NZ Rail said that it had made a net profit of NZDollars 16.9m after one-off restructuring expenses, which included redundancy-related costs of NZDollars 21m. Revenue totalled NZDollars 488m, against NZDollars 495m.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Investors reduce stakes in Argentine carmakers THE controlling shareholders of Argentina's two listed carmakers have said they plan to continue reducing their stakes through block sales in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. The announcements follow steadily growing overseas demand for shares in Ciadea, the locally-controlled company that makes cars under licence from Renault of France, and for Sevel, which holds the Peugeot and Fiat licences. Mr Mauricio Macri, Sevel's president, said the company's controlling investors plan to reduce their holdings to 60 per cent from 84 per cent. Fiat of Italy holds 14 per cent of Sevel and the Macri family owns 70 per cent. The remaining 16 per cent is in the market. The Macri family sold 2.25 per cent of Sevel in a block trade at the end of January for Dollars 19.9m. This follows Dollars 33.5m in block sales in December. The buyers were not identified, but are believed to be international investors or investment funds. Mr Manuel Antelo, Ciadea's president and principal shareholder, said the Luxembourg-based Cofal company that controls Ciadea plans to continue selling stock in block trades to cut its holding to 51 per cent from 58.8 per cent . When Cofal took over the company from Renault in 1992, 28 per cent of its shares were in the Buenos Aires market and the remaining 72 per cent held by Cofal, owned by Renault, Mr Antelo and others. Cofal has sold Dollars 144.6m of Ciadea equity through Buenos Aires stock exchange up to the end of December. Most was sold to London-based brokers Smith New Court and Baring Securities.</p>

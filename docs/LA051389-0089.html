			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYWEATHER, CHAVEZ SQUARE OFF IN TITLE FIGHT  </P> <P> It has been a busy week for promoter Don King. So busy, the poor man hasn't had  time to comb his hair.  </P> <P> For one thing, he is helping to resurrect big-time boxing locally with  tonight's Roger Mayweather-Julio Cesar Chavez World Boxing Council  super-lightweight title fight at the Forum.  </P> <P> King is campaigning for a future match between his fighter, Julian Jackson, and  International Boxing Federation middleweight champion Michael Nunn.  </P> <P> And he's still found the time to work behind the scenes to finalize a deal for  the next title defense of heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> Nobody said this business was easy.  </P> <P> Zeroing in on the fact that Mayweather (34-5, 23 knockouts) has defeated eight  consecutive Mexican fighters, King proudly announced the other day that  Mayweather has come "to kill a Mexican."  </P> <P> Pause. Smile.  </P> <P> "In the ring, that is."  </P> <P> That's reassuring.  </P> <P> Moving quickly to quash any thoughts that he might be a bigot, King has bragged  that "Mexican fighters love me because I promote more of their fights than  anybody else. I am going to make Julio Cesar Chavez the highest-paid Mexican  fighter ever."  </P> <P> Explaining Mayweather's motivation, King said, "Roger was knocked out by a  Mexican, and since then, he has been trying to vindicate himself."  </P> <P> The man who delivered that knockout blow was none other than Chavez, who has  become a hero to Latinos. Owner of a 62-0 record with 50 knockouts, Chavez is  the latest to inherit the description once reserved for Sugar Ray Robinson --  greatest fighter, pound for pound, in the world.  </P> <P> In Chavez's case, as in Robinson's, it might be more than hyperbole. At 26, the  native of Sonora, Mexico, has already won both the WBC super-featherweight and  lightweight titles as well as the World Boxing Assn. lightweight crown.  </P> <P> One of Chavez's super-featherweight title defenses came in Las Vegas,  Mayweather's hometown, in 1985 when Mayweather went down and out in the second  round.  </P> <P> Mayweather, however, picked himself up and went on to win 14 of his next 15  fights, losing only to Pernell Whitaker by decision in a 12-round WBC  Continental Americas lightweight title fight in 1987.  </P> <P> Mayweather subsequently beat Rene Arredondo on a sixth-round knockout in Los  Angeles to win the WBC super-lightweight title in November 1987, and  successfully defended it three times last year.  </P> <P> He decisioned both Harold Brazier and Vinnie Pazienza in Las Vegas and beat  Rodolfo Gonzalez in a 12th-round knockout at Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In this bout, each boxer is coming off a title fight -- Mayweather from his  victory over Pazienza last November, and Chavez from his victory over Jose Luis  Ramirez that gave him the WBC lightweight championship last October.  </P> <P> In Mayweather-Chavez II, each fighter will be 10 pounds heavier. In their first  meeting, they fought at 130.  </P> <P> "I had to lose 13 pounds at the end the last time I met Chavez, including two  the day of the fight," the 28-year-old Mayweather said. "That kills any  fighter. But people don't want to hear that. The fact is I lost. I just feel at  this weight, it's going to be altogether different."  </P> <P> Speaking through an interpreter, Chavez indicated he also has had weight  problems.  </P> <P> "Three months ago," he said, "I weighed 148. But I am ready. I think he  (Mayweather) will be a little bit stronger at the additional weight. He has a  good right hand."  </P> <P> If that right hand does sufficient damage, it could be a breakthrough fight for  Mayweather. But he doesn't see it that way.  </P> <P> "You cannot say this fight will determine how great Roger Mayweather is," he  said. "Every fight determines that. If this is a big fight, how about the other  38?  </P> <P> "People argue about who is the best running back, Jim Brown or Walter Payton.  Who is the best basketball player, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Wilt Chamberlain. The  important thing is, they are all in the history books."  </P> <P> Chavez already seems assured of his place in his native country, where his fans  waited in a line of cars more than a mile long just to greet him at the airport  after he beat Edwin Rosario in 1987 to win the WBA lightweight title.  </P> <P> Forum officials expect a crowd of at least 13,000 tonight and predict that the  building's all-time attendance record for a boxing match -- 18,796 for Ruben  Olivares-Rafael Herrera in 1972 -- could be broken.  </P> <P> Each fighter will earn $750,000 plus 37.5% of the live gate after expenses.  </P> <P> The first undercard fight is scheduled for 6:30 p.m., with the main event, to  be televised by HBO, expected to start approximately an hour later.  </P></p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / US newsprint shortage worsens A severe newsprint shortage and steep price increases have led some North American publishers to cut their paper consumption. The shortages, most acute on the West Coast, have been exacerbated by a strike at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three mills in British Columbia which began last week. Fletcher normally produces about 3,000 tonnes of newsprint a day. Publishers' inventories are typically low at this time of year. Strong demand, especially in the southern US, and exports to Europe, south-east Asia and Mexico have also tightened supplies.</p>

Looking at the good trend in economic and trade exchanges  between Shanghai and Taiwan, as well as visits by personnel from  the two places, the director of the Taiwan Affairs Office was  certainly very happy. According to statistics, in 1993 the  development of economic and trade relations between Shanghai and  Taiwan compared very well with the overall situation of economic  development in Shanghai. A total of 805 Taiwan-funded  enterprises gained approval for establishment over the whole  year, and this means that two Taiwan-funded enterprises  established themselves in the municipality every day. A total  of $1.5 billion in Taiwanese funds was attracted to the  municipality in 1993; there were 249 exchange programs, 54 more  than in 1992; and in the area of personnel exchange, 1,304  Shanghai personnel went to Taiwan.    Zhang Zhiqun said that in the new year, the first thing to  do  is to continue to strengthen work in attracting Taiwan-funded  enterprises so that more Taiwan-funded enterprises will settle  down in Shanghai. Particular attention must be paid to the  investment intentions of large consortia on the island. He said  that Taiwan investment in Shanghai exhibits four features:  Investment projects develop in the capital-intensive and  technology-intensive direction; the investment scale has  expanded, and there are over 50 large projects each of which  involves $5 million; Taiwan businessmen are eager to lease land,  among the 200 parcels of leased land in Shanghai, Taiwan  businessmen have won over 40; the investment domain has expanded  to tertiary industry, and among the 1,000 or so Taiwan firms  which have won approval for establishment, over one-fourth have  invested in tertiary industry.    Zhang Zhiqun also said that full play must be given to  Shanghai's overall advantage, to actively promoting various  exchanges between the two places, to enabling Shanghai's  departments in charge of science, technology, education,  culture, sports, and medicine to have more extensive contacts  and links with Taiwan's professional sectors; and that overall  work in receiving personnel from the two sides of the strait  must be done well in order to enable Taiwan compatriots in  Shanghai to move and see more.    He also disclosed that, in light of the new situation in  which the number of Taiwan-funded enterprises is increasing,  Shanghai plans to establish an Association of Taiwan-Funded  Enterprises this year. The association will organize experts,  scholars, and public servants from economic and trade  departments and government organs to brief Taiwan businessmen on  the relevant policies and regulations on a regular basis to  enable them to further understand Shanghai's investment  direction and environment. The association will also organize  many activities to enable Taiwan businessmen to have a more  colorful and richer life in Shanghai; it will also foster ties  between Taiwan businessmen and the government, and solve  difficulties for Taiwan businessmen when they set up enterprises  and make investments.    Zhang Zhiqun finally said that, judged from last year's  situation, the exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan played a  role in promoting economic development in Shanghai. Among the  foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai, Taiwan-funded  enterprises now rank second in terms of number of projects, and  based on last year's success, exchanges and interactions between  the two places will develop faster and better.</p>

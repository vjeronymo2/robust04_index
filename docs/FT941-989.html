			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / French airline sets deadline for its unions Air France's 14 trade unions have until Thursday to agree to a restructuring plan aimed at curbing losses at the French state-owned airline, the company said yesterday. The statement followed protracted negotiations at the weekend between the unions and Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France. Mr Blanc has insisted on staff support for his recovery plan, which is a condition of a capital injection of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) from the French government. He has said he will appeal directly to the company's 40,000 employees if any of the unions refuse to agree to the restructuring. The communist-led CGT walked out of the negotiations, which started on Saturday morning and lasted until 5am yesterday. A spokesman for the union said it opposed elements of the plan, including an increase in working hours from 38 to 39 hours per week for ground staff and the implementation of 5,000 job cuts. The CGT said it was seeking further negotiations and would consult its members to decide a final position before a meeting with other union groups on Thursday. The airline's other unions declined to comment yesterday on the progress of negotiations. But Force Ouvriere, the largest union at Air France, has previously indicated support for the rescue plan. Union opposition and a series of violent strikes forced the withdrawal of a previous recovery plan last October and the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, then chairman. The episode represented a serious blow to the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, which was forced into a damaging climbdown. In addition to voluntary job cuts, Mr Blanc's plan includes a three-year wage freeze and a reduction in the airline's fleet from 166 aircraft to 149 over the next five years. Air France says that the measures are vital to stem losses estimated at FFr7.5bn last year and to win European Union approval for the capital increase from the French state.</p>

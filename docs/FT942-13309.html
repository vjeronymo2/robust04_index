			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Tractor plant ready to break new ground: Negotiations to sell Massey Ferguson Employees at the Massey Ferguson plant in Coventry were facing the prospect of working for new owners yesterday after its US parent company, Varity, confirmed it was in 'the latter stage of negotiations' to sell the tractor maker to Atlanta-based Agco. The short statement from the two US companies gave no further details, but a purchase by Agco for about Dollars 330m (Pounds 226m) could be announced in the next few days. There was a cloak of silence at the Coventry plant yesterday. Perkins, the Peterborough-based diesel engine supplier to the tractor plant and a sister company of Massey Ferguson in Varity, also remained silent. The first indications were that any change in ownership would have little immediate effect. 'If there is a closure - not that we're expecting it - it's not got the same kind of knock-on importance that Rover and Jaguar would have,' said Mr David Morris, Peugeot dean of Coventry Business School. His research suggests that the Massey Ferguson plant in Coventry has about 240 components suppliers. 'The supply chain is international. Relatively little is bought from the west Midlands and what is bought tends to be the more basic components.' Although the tentacles of Massey Ferguson do not stretch out through the Midlands like those of Rover, the BMW-owned carmaker which buys extensively in the UK, the Banner Lane plant is part of Midlands automotive lore. It used to be the works of the old Standard Motor Company. Tractors have been produced there since 1946 - first by Harry Ferguson, then by Massey Ferguson after he was bought out by Massey-Harris, and latterly under the control of Varity. In the past, Massey Ferguson has claimed that the Banner Lane plant was the largest tractor factory in the western world. The payroll has declined as Massey Ferguson has modernised and slimmed, but 1,700 people are still employed there, which makes it the 10th-largest employer in Coventry and the sixth-largest manufacturing employer. More than 80 per cent of the Coventry output, worth around Pounds 250m, is exported, making Massey Ferguson, with its plant at Beauvais in France, the world's largest tractor exporter. On the UK market, where it is the second-largest supplier, Massey Ferguson competes with first, Ford, and then Case and Deere. The possible sale of Massey comes as UK tractor sales have reached their highest levels since 1989. Massey said in November that, after four years of adjusting to declining demand, production levels at Coventry had been raised to meet a 45 per cent increase in sales. At the end of last year, against the general industrial trend, Massey was hiring staff on fixed contracts to cope with the increase in demand. Production of fully built-up tractors was 17,000 in 1993 compared with 14,000 in 1992. If a sale goes through, Agco will take over a business which, since 1988 when a fresh management team under Mr Aaron Jones was installed, has been remodelled and turned back into profit despite problems in the tractor market. Varity said last month that the higher UK sales were the main reason for an improvement in Massey's 1993 European market share. Overall, Massey had operating income of Dollars 8m in the year ended January 31, down from Dollars 10m a year earlier, on virtually unchanged sales of Dollars 898m.</p>

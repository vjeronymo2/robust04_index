			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The 'policy is dead' theory arrives Not long ago, I heard a Labour economist peer outflanking the most extreme free market advocates by declaring that national economic policy was dead. His argument was that, in a world of completely free capital movements, governments and central banks were not able to make independent decisions on the virtues of alternative macroeconomic policies. There are two ways of looking at such a world. One is to cry: 'Woe, woe, woe. Governments are at the mercy of the financial markets and all possibility of rational policy is dead unless we have world government, and perhaps not even then.' But there is an alternative, more optimistic, response. It is based on the view that attempts to promote output and employment by artificially low interest rates, budget deficits or other manipulations will not achieve their objectives but threaten inflation of the kind which was at its worst in the 1970s and which cannot be corrected without a painful recession. The financial markets, on this view, cut short the whole malignant process by making it impossible for national authorities to inflate in the first place. This can be illustrated by events in the last year and a half. As the chart shows, the whole UK yield curve fell in the course of 1993, not only because of cuts in official short-term interest rates but because of much-reduced expectations about inflation in the longer term. Since then, however, greater pessimism - or realism - has returned. There have been similar developments in other centres; and there is now a steep upwardyield curve, which is itself making for dearer money throughout the world. On any interpretation, the market has behaved in such a way as to make more inflationary policies difficult to follow, whatever the urge to do so. The check works through several channels. Obviously, a fall of many billions in the value of bonds itself reduces the propensity to spend because wealth is reduced. This effect is reinforced if equity values fall together with bonds as they have. But the correction does not rely on these wealth effects alone (the 1987 Wall Street crash, for example, did not prevent inflationary overheating in several countries in subsequent years). It also works by inhibiting monetary policy. A monetary authority that tried to cut short-term interest rates now would be arguing with the market in a big way. A British chancellor would find it hard to cut base rates in the face of the present yield curve. Even if he succeeded for a while, it would not have any worthwhile stimulative effect. For it would be apparent to any borrower - or pointed out to him - that the likelihood was that short-term loans would be renewed at higher and higher rates over the coming months and years. There are several questions about this apparently beneficent circle. One would like to know whether it would be as efficient in the face of deflationary fears of the kind which were rife only a year ago. Clearly, bond rates would fall; but would they fall enough, and would financial markets tolerate a large fiscal stimulus if interest rates could not fall sufficiently to stop a slump? There are other questions, even in the more conventional context of containing inflation. Just as the markets are constraining central banks the latter are also affecting the markets. An important influence on market behaviour is the belief that the Bundesbank and the Fed will in the end tighten policy in the face of an inflationary threat; and markets are simply betting on when this will occur. At present, only the Fed and the Bundesbank seem able to lead markets in this way; and other central banks have discretion only about the pace at which they follow. There are also more technical questions about how far any central bank can really determine even short-term interest rates. At present, the Bank of England's influence depends almost entirely on the overnight rates at which it lends to the money market. Reforms are being studied which might shift the focus of official policy to one-month interest rates. This would have the advantage of separating deliberate monetary action from day-to-day moves to help the banks and discount houses balance their books. Such reforms would help to clarify policy. But they would not resolve the question of the central banks' ability to argue with markets if they thought that the latter were badly misguided. The present mood is not to force the question to the test.</p>

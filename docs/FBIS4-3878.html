			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Zhou Dehui (0719 1795 1920): "PRC, </F> Russia To Finalize Agreement Next Month on Disarmament Within  100 Km of the Border"]    [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr (LIEN HO PAO)--Russia and mainland  China are vigorously exchanging views on the issue of border  disarmament. According to the tentative idea, both sides will  reduce the number of their troops and weapons within 100 km all  along the Sino-Russian border. Antiaircraft missiles and naval  vessels are not included in the disarmament list, however.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov said that, if mainland  China and Russia reach an agreement, then it will be the first  disarmament accord in the Asian region, which will symbolize  another peak of friendship between the two countries.    Panov and the Russian General Staff Department addressed the  issue of the demarcation of the Sino-Russian border and the  level of armament there. If mainland China reaches a  disarmament agreement with Russia in the north, it will redeploy  its armed forces, which will, in turn, affect its southward  development and the security of the Taiwan Strait.    Panov pointed out: The Sino-Russian border is 4,300 km long,  of which 3,700 km is delimited by rivers. Because the rivers  frequently change course, territorial disputes have arisen. For  example, each the two countries is still sticking to its own  views on the ownership of three small islands in Heilongjiang  and cannot reach a final conclusion. The Russian Government has  proposed a "joint development" program and wishes to use  economic means to solve the political problem. Beijing has  shown interest in the proposal and both sides will discuss it  further.    In discussing the issue of border troops, Panov said:  Mainland China and Russia are vigorously discussing border  disarmament. If we reach an agreement, it will be a historic  precedent.    The Russian General Staff Department said: When Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin visits Beijing in late May, it is hoped  that the two countries will hold the 12th round of the  disarmament conference and will reach a final agreement of  disarmament so as to present it to Chernomyrdin as a gift for  his visit to mainland China.</p>

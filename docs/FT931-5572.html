			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister warns on drug charges HEALTH MINISTER Dr Brian Mawhinney said last night that he would have no hesitation in increasing prescription charges again - even after the 13 per cent increase announced this week to Pounds 4.25. He told the BBC1's Question Time that the government - like Labour before it  -believed that those who could make a contribution to the cost of their drugs should do so. Dr Mawhinney said there was no commitment by any government or political party never to increase or decrease anything by more than the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday rejected a call from the cross-party Commons health committee for the government to support an EC ban on tobacco advertising.</p>

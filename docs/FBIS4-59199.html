			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today  conferred with Mr. Ahmad Quray', the PLO's Economic Department  chief. The meeting at the Prime Ministry was attended by Dr.  Jawad al-'Anani, state minister for cabinet affairs and  information minister. The sides discussed economic relations  between Jordan and Palestine and looked into ways to develop  them further.    Meanwhile, the Jordanian-Palestinian economic committee met  at the Prime Ministry today, with Jawad al-'Anani and Ahmad  Quray' leading their respective sides. The talks addressed  economic issues, specifically trade, banking, monetary matters,  and customs.    Mr. Quray' told reporters the committee also had an in-depth  look at economic issues. The committee is to meet for further  discussions tomorrow:    [Begin recording] [Quray'] Our discussions addressed the  nitty-gritty of Palestinian-Jordanian economic relations and the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. We agreed that the  Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement is key to our ties. We  will have another session tomorrow.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will the Jordanian-Palestinian  agreement undergo any changes to suit the PLO-Israeli economic  accord?    [Quray'] Whatever changes are made will enhance the  agreement.    [Correspondent] Meaning there are changes?    [Quray'] Whatever changes are made will be to enhance and  flesh out the agreement. The core of the agreement will remain  intact.    [Correspondent] Do you think a new agreement or new  protocols may be worked out between Jordan and the PLO?    [Quray'] Certain committees may be revitalized. The  existing agreement is the basis.    [Correspondent] What remains to be discussed further between  you and Jordan?    [Quray'] Banking, money, trade, customs -- these are the  talking points that must be thrashed out in a manner that should  advance and upgrade the distinguished and brotherly ties between  Jordan and Palestine.    [Correspondent] Do you think the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement limits the scope for your economic cooperation with  Jordan?    [Quray'] On the contrary, I think this agreement has helped  put the Jordanian-Palestinian accord into practice. True, the  agreement does not satisfy our demands in full, but the door  remains open for us to press for our rights, which we will  regain gradually. The talks focused on the nature of the  Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. It is now clear and spelled  out in the agreement. [end recording]</p>

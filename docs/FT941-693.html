			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Dee Dee Bridgewater - Jazz Such has been the brilliant effect on jazz singing of the three divas - Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday - that all other voices have been pushed into the penumbra of popular consciousness. Of course there are other stars in the galaxy: Dinah Washington delivered much and promised more; Anita O'Day, Abbey Lincoln and Betty Carter have all done it their way; and Nina Simone has been nobody and everybody's fool. But none has lit popular music culture like the constellation of Vaughan-Fitzgerald-Holiday. By and large, the repertoire of these three female vocalists alone has served us up to the present time. The ranks have not been replenished and the art of 'jazz' singing has been frozen in the 1950s style. There are newcomers, notably Cassandra Wilson and Rachelle Ferrall, who have been peeping round the corner for a while - both individual stylists, trying a new way. Then there is Dee Dee Bridgewater, who finished her long-awaited tour of the UK at the Manchester Royal Exchange on Sunday. A glamorous and animated figure, Bridgewater portrays herself as a keeper of the tradition. Indeed, a new contract with Verve and a new long-player (called, you guessed it, Keeping Tradition) provide vigorous readings in front of a trio of evergreen tunes such as Fascinating Rhythm and What is This Thing Called Love? She has arrived at this point after a varied and glittering apprenticeship. In the 1970s she sang with the Thad Jones - Mel Lewis Orchestra and later succeeded Abbey Lincoln in the Max Roach quintet. She went on to record fusion and pop music and in the mid-1970s took to the stage, winning hearts and prizes in The Wiz, Sophisticated Ladies and, famously, as Billie Holiday in the show Lady Day. Now she is settled in Paris, fronting a regular and snappy trio and, as she said in her preamble, keeping a vocal tradition alive. She's well equipped for the job. In bassist Hein van de Geyn she has a meticulously tidy arranger, and with the addition of Thierry Eliez (piano) and Dede Ceccarelli (drums), a trio that sparks around her. She is beautiful and her contact with the audience is sassy and seductive. The voice, if a little mannered in phrasing, has delicious flexibility and ranges from gravelly scat to coquettish balladry without effort. The insidious problem for this listener is a nagging comparison with her mentors. Bridgewater doesn't have the ever-pressing swing of Fitzgerald, the emotional contact of Holiday, nor the deep-suffering blues of Washington. She is musical and she reads the lyrics of standards such as I Fall in Love Too Easily with clarity and some conviction. But where is Dee Dee? It might be a commercially heretical suggestion, but why not dispense with tradition and apply that fine voice to more personal material?</p>

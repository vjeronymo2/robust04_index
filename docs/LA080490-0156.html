			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONTROLLING INSECTS NEEDN'T AMOUNT TO CHEMICAL WARFARE  </P> <P> Each year about 20,000 people in this country are rushed to hospitals for  pesticide poisoning.  </P> <P> According to Better Homes and Gardens magazine, pesticides have been linked to  cancer, birth defects, respiratory ailments, neurological problems, liver and  kidney damage and reproductive disorders. These chemicals bulldoze their way up  the food chain, killing wildlife and polluting lakes, rivers and drinking  water.  </P> <P> People share the planet with insects, many of which are harmful. But keeping  these critters at bay need not require chemical warfare. Here is a safer, less  toxic approach to home pest control.  </P> <P> The safest way to control bugs is preventive maintenance. The key is to think  like a bug.  </P> <P> Walk around the house and look for places where ants, roaches or rodents can  enter. Caulk window and door trim. Keep composting piles, trash cans, firewood  and other potential food and nesting sites away from the home. Keep debris out  of gutters. Trim branches or bushes insects can use as a bridge to the house.  Eliminate standing water under, inside or near the house.  </P> <P> Maintaining a healthy, vigorous lawn and garden will also discourage pests.  Plants suffering from stress attract bugs. Use pest-resistant plants that are  well suited for the climate. A mixture of two or more grass types is often  heartier than a single mono-culture. Avoid thatch buildup, and use slow-release  organic fertilizers that don't shock the lawn. Regularly check and maintain the  lawn's pH.  </P> <P> When some intervention is required, take the least toxic route. Organic, as  opposed to commercial, pesticides are generally safer to use and less harmful  to the environment. Although some natural pest controls like nicotine sulfate  can be as toxic as chemical pesticides, most organic pesticides break down  quickly in sunlight, or within 24 hours.  </P> <P> Organic controls use biological, botanical and mechanical methods.  </P> <P> For a guidebook on pest control alternatives the "1990 Insect Pest Management  for Home, Yard, and Garden" is available from the University of Illinois  College of Agriculture, Cooperative Extension Publications Office, 69C Mumford  Hall, 1301 West Gregory Drive, Urbana, Ill. 61801. Cost is $1.  </P> <P> Two useful fact sheets, one on lawn care and one on gardening tips, can be  ordered for $2 each from the National Coalition Against the Misuse of  Pesticides, 530 7th St. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: URBAN CUBAN  </P> <P> For a while I went every Sunday afternoon to El Colmao, a thriving big-city  Cuban restaurant set among the bodegas and Spanish-language record stores of  Pico-Union, and I listened to the cumbias that blared from the big jukebox, and  I got pleasantly drunk on half-liters of cold red wine. El Colmao seems to be  to Los Angeles Cubans what Ratner's on New York's Lower East Side is to Long  Island Jews: a good old place in the old neighborhood frequented mostly by  suburban people who want to feel ethnic once in a while.  </P> <P> My girlfriend at the time, Cuban-born, had an interesting sense of humor: she  coerced me to order meals for the two of us in sputtering menu Spanish, which  she mocked to the waitress. She once taught me to ask for the check by saying  "El check-O, por favor," which busted up the owner and amused everybody in the  dining room but me. She'd comment loudly on the tight skirts of the women who  came into the restaurant, in a way that implied she was responding to something  I'd said. (I was young and inexperienced enough to be a good sport.) After we  broke up, she got to keep my WWII officer's cape and I got the Sundays at El  Colmao.  </P> <P> Each time I went to the restaurant I ordered the same things, and after a  while, the waitresses would just recite my regular order back to me and save me  the embarrassment of mispronouncing aguacate once again. It was a huge, greasy,  splendid lunch.  </P> <P> There was always an avocado salad to start -- cool, ripe chunks garnished with  thin slices of raw onion, which I dressed with splashes of vinegar and torrents  of good Spanish olive oil; then a heaping plateful of thin, pounded circles of  unripe plantains, fried crisp as potato chips and dusted with salt. Sometimes I  ordered an 80 cup of delicious caldo Gallego, a thick, Galician-style  white-bean soup spiked with shredded collard greens and smoky chunks of ham and  sausage, that made even the dry, puffy Cuban rolls taste good.  </P> <P> And then the food would come: Pla-Doh-textured boiled yuca, the color of a  legal pad, sauced with oil, lemon and a truly astounding quantity of garlic; a  big plateful of moros y cristianos (Moors and Christians), which is a tasty  miscegenation of black beans and rice fried with garlic and gobbets of fat  pork; piles of fried fresh ham, pierna de puerco, crisp and brown on the  outside and meltingly tender within, topped with an immoderate portion of  caramelized onions, all washed down with cold red wine served in those flared  jugs pizzerias use for Almaden, poured into chilled glasses that still had bits  of crushed ice clinging to their rims. (The wine was pretty bad, but anything  subtler would have been lost in the avalanche of garlic.) For dessert there was  good flan and torpor and cups of strong Cuban espresso to wake us up a little.  The check rarely exceeded $20 for two; it seems to average about $25 now.  </P> <P> Even thinking about that meal makes me want to reach for a breath mint and take  a nap.  </P> <P> Since then, though I've cut back to about one El Colmao meal a month, and I  still order the same thing every time -- I've tried to vary it a couple of  times, but the only time a waitress believed me was when I ended up with a  plateful of dryish turkey-roll asada -- I've managed to try most of the things  I'd only seen sail by before.  </P> <P> Various fried steaks and chops are garlicky and fine, if a little dry sometimes  (the pierna asada can sometimes be dry, too). The arroz con pollo is about the  best thing: a big, fragrant bowl of rice, stained Easter-chick yellow with  achiote, studded with pimientos and the meat of at least a quarter-chicken, and  of a pure chicken flavor. Chicken is also available sauteed with garlic and  tomatoes (you can also get a big hunk of halibut done that way too), or sauteed  and glazed with an intense sauce of sherry and fried onions. There's a good  version of the shredded-beef stew called ropa vieja, and a delicious smoked  pork chop served only at weekday lunch. There's real, fizzy Asturian cider  served in flat Champagne bowls.  </P> <P> And as it turns out, you can order in English.  </P> <P> "I was wondering when you'd figure that out," the waitress said.  </P> <P>  El Colmao, 2328 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 386-6131. Open Wed.-Sat and  Mon., 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Sun., noon to 9:30 p.m. Cash only. Lot parking.  Beer and wine. Lunch or dinner for two, food only, $9-$28.  </P> <P> </P></p>

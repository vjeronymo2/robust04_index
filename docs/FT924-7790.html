			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / All change for Clinton - slowly: George Graham explains the three-month transitional administration period JUST 10 days after Governor Bill Clinton's victory in the US presidential election, journalists are waiting impatiently for something to happen and Democrats are waiting just as impatiently for their job applications to be answered. They will have to wait a while longer. Not until January 20 will President George Bush move out of the White House and Mr Clinton take his oath of office as the US's 42nd president. The US's drawn-out transition is the object of some puzzlement to many foreign observers, who are used to new governments moving in within days or even hours of victory. Some wonder if it is really necessary to wait almost three months after the election before handing over power, now that it no longer takes so long for delegates to the electoral college to make their way by mule from the further quarters of Kentucky and Tennessee. But US political scientists argue that it still serves a useful purpose because of the length and intensity of the presidential campaign, the absence of a shadow government ready to assume office, and the extent of the turnover in US government officials that follows the election of a new president. Candidates have often spent over a year on the campaign trail making promises and proposals of all kinds; once elected, they have to work out which of these have priority, and who can best implement them. A transition team can determine the ultimate success of an administration by its creation of a government which knows what it wants to do and which can work together to accomplish it. 'It is a hangover from the 18th century, but it has also turned out to be reasonably functional,' comments Professor Bert Rockman of the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Stephen Wayne of Georgetown University argues that a long transition period has become more necessary since the 1960s because of an increased politicisation of the bureaucracy: the civil servants who provide the institutional memory of government have been pushed further down the decision-making tree. In addition, he says, the appointment process now takes longer because of more rigorous background checks and financial disclosure requirements for potential appointees. Overall, a total of 9,100 jobs in the federal government are listed in a volume known as the Plum Book as non-competitive, or political, appointments. Many of these, however, are filled by career civil servants; many more are part-time positions or require specialised, non-political skills such as medicine or engraving. In practice, only some 3,000 jobs are really open for political appointees - still a huge number in comparison with most other countries - and Prof Rockman cautions that only 600 to 800 are important policy-making positions. Meanwhile, 75 journalists lie in wait in Little Rock, the Arkansas state capital, begging for something to write about. That mostly means detailed accounts of Mr Clinton's jogging routes or of the intrusion of Secret Service agents into his daughter's school. It also means intense focus on the appointment of the transition team - many of whose members will in fact have only a brief spurt of flame, and have little importance in the actual Clinton administration. Probing analysis is brought to bear on Mr Clinton's every utterance, as though his one-liners today provide more insight into his administration's policies than the detailed position papers he issued during the campaign. Indeed, Mr Clinton had to devote a considerable portion of his first news conference on Thursday to explaining that he had not, 10 days after his election and two months before his inauguration, yet seen fit to perform any U-turns on policy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of the resignation letter sent by Interior Secretary </F> Jorge Carpizo McGregor to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari;  place and date not given; from the "Evening News Panorama"  newscast -- read by announcer]    [Text] Mr. Carlos Salinas de Gortari, constitutional  president of the United Mexican States. Distinguished President:    I expressed a number of concepts and ideas at the Federal  Electoral Institute's regular meeting on 18 June, and I confirm  them today. The people have a true saying that goes: He who gets  angry, loses. I am more than angry; I am indignant and  disappointed with my current position where I have done all I  can possibly do. I have found people, however, from many  sectors who, in the country's current situation, are only  fighting for their own interests or those of their sector  without caring for Mexico. On several occasions, I have urged  society and the interior to base our actions exclusively on the  truth. The response has been more lies, slander, and hypocrisy.    I promised to be impartial in my relations with all the  political parties when I assumed this position. I am beginning  not to be impartial with one of them because I am not and cannot  ever agree with the actions of several sectors in that party.    One should recognize when it is time to leave. Due to my  convictions and dignity, the time has come for me to do so. I  no longer feel useful to the country in the political positions  I accepted with the sole desire to serve Mexico. I am not a  party man. I am really not a man of power. Thus, I will never  again accept another political position.    For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully request you  accept my resignation from the post of interior secretary with  which you honored me. I also want to thank you for your support  and your trust in my work at the positions you assigned to me.  I want to leave evidence that you never requested anything  illegal from me while I occupied those positions. I also want  to express my gratitude to my immediate assistants for their  invaluable support during the past five years.    My norm, during the years I occupied political positions,  was  to strictly implement the law and to propose changes that would  improve the law; my method was to have dialogue with reason. I  fervently hope Mexican society and interior will reaffirm their  adherence to the law and to truth. Mexico may be going through  difficult moments, but, as in other occasions in its history, it  will move ahead and will come out stronger. I take this  opportunity to reiterate my respect.    [signed] Jorge Carpizo McGregor, interior secretary.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS, SCHOTTENHEIMER TO TALK AGAIN  </P> <P> Steve Ortmayer and former Cleveland Coach Marty Schottenheimer will meet again  to discuss the vacant Charger head coaching job.  </P> <P> That was the word Tuesday from the Charger front office. Ortmayer, the team's  director of football operations, was en route to Palo Alto to scout the  East-West Shrine game and was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> It also has been confirmed that Ortmayer has asked the Minnesota Vikings for  permission to talk to their defensive coordinator, Floyd Peters. Peters has  never held an NFL head coaching job.  </P> <P> Team officials said Ortmayer and Schottenheimer met over the weekend in what is  believed to be the first outside interview since Charger owner Alex Spanos  fired Coach Al Saunders Dec. 19. Ortmayer already has talked to current Charger  assistants Ron Lynn, Jerry Rhome and Wayne Sevier about the job.  </P> <P> The word from the Chargers is that Ortmayer still wants to interview George  Seifert, San Francisco's defensive coordinator, which means the Chargers  probably won't have a new head coach for at least 2 weeks.  </P> <P> Seifert is preparing for the Jan. 22 Super Bowl. Ortmayer has said he won't  talk to him until the 49ers' season is over.  </P> <P> Schottenheimer resigned as the Browns' coach after the team lost the Dec. 24  AFC wild card game to Houston. He and Cleveland owner Art Modell couldn't reach  an agreement on staff changes proposed by Modell.  </P></p>

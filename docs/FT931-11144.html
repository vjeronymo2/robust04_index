			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Hopes of rescue in Eindhoven THE DAF crisis dominated the headlines of daily newspapers in the Netherlands yesterday with both the banks and the government assigning blame to each other for the failed restructuring. Behind the scenes, however, strenuous efforts were under way to salvage the situation and a mood of cautious optimism prevailed in Eindhoven, a city badly hit in recent years by lay-offs and restructuring, about the possibility of resurrecting Daf's core truckmaking operations. Workers arrived yesterday morning to their jobs as usual but production was quickly slowed by a shortage of supplies. 'No suppliers are willing to deliver without a direct payment,' said Mr Crit Pingen of the FNV union. 'You need to bring bags of money to the factory gate, then you can have what you want. At this moment, there's nothing coming in or going out of Daf.' Meanwhile Daf's 1,400 workers at the company's plant in Westerlo, Flanders, Belgium, were pinning their hopes on possible plans to save the group's heavy and medium truck operations. The Westerlo plant manufactures axles and cabs for the heavier Daf vehicles. A further 100 staff are employed by the commercial office at Aartselaere in Flanders, the northern Flemish-speaking part of Belgium. A decision to rescue the business would provide some safeguards for Daf's employees in Belgium. But even before Tuesday's announcement that the group had filed for court protection from creditors, Westerlo was laying off staff temporarily because of the general slowdown in business. Mr Achiel De Backer, Daf's personnel manager at Westerlo, said that production had not been stopped, but he added: 'It may be that we have to take that decision in the following days, because we could be short of components.' 'It's the financial people who are deciding about our future at the moment,' he added.</p>

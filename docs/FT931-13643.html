			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Christmas sales growth for Burton Burton Group, the fashion retailer, said yesterday it had a broadly encouraging Christmas, with sales growth of 14 per cent, although margins were lower. Sir John Hoskyns, chairman, told the annual meeting that trading for the three months to the end of November 1992 was erratic, but sales were up 14 per cent on the previous year, reflecting the group's increased competitiveness. Gross margins, however, fell by 2 1/2 percentage points after Burton cut its mark-up. Sales increases before Christmas were below plan but in promotional periods like the January sales turnover was above plan.</p>

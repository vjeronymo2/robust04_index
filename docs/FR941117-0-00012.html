			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementing These Regulations in the Ninth Circuit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some recipients in the Ninth Circuit may lose SSI benefits as a result of the rescission of AR 90&hyph;1(9). To lessen the effect of the rescission on those recipients, we will apply these regulations to them only prospectively upon routine redetermination of eligibility. While we realize that, due to variances in the dates of redetermination, some of these individuals will benefit more from this treatment than others, none of these individuals will lose any more SSI benefits than if these regulations were applicable to them on publication, rather than on redetermination, and most will lose less. Moreover, since the publication date will not be used as the effective date of these regulations for these individuals, our implementation will avoid the negative consequences of overpayment determinations. This method of implementation was not contained in the NPRM. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AR 90&hyph;1(9) was published subsequent to the publication of the NPRM, and accordingly, the NPRM did not contemplate the effect of the AR's rescission upon some recipients to whom the AR applied. In order to fully apprise the affected claimants of the impact of these new rules, we decided that the publication of our plan for implementing the regulations prospectively at redetermination for those to whom AR 90&hyph;1(9) had been applied should be part of the final rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both the interim final rule and the NPRM which were published on May 18, 1990, provided for a 60-day comment period. We received one comment in response to the NPRM and it was relevant to both the interim final rule and the NPRM. This comment was from an assistant director for a State agency that serves individuals with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. The comment generally supported the regulations, but recommended further changes. We have summarized and responded to the comment below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter believes the proposed regulations may be inequitable to those dependents who neither receive nor materially benefit from their portion of the augmented veterans benefit. The commenter cited case experience of dependents living apart from the veteran who did not receive any benefit from their dependent's portion of the augmented veterans benefit. He proposes that the regulations also provide that the dependent's portion will not be counted as the dependent's income when it can be documented that such portion has not been made available to the dependent or that the dependent has not received in-kind income equal in value to the dependent's portion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree it may not be appropriate to count the dependent's portion of the augmented veterans benefit payment as income to the dependent in those cases where the dependent lives apart from the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse and does not receive the benefit of his or her portion. If all or part of the dependent's portion is not available for the benefit of the dependent, but is counted as the dependent's unearned income for SSI purposes, he or she may experience hardship and the inability to meet daily needs. Such a result could be viewed as inconsistent with the purpose of the SSI program which is to provide for the beneficiary's current needs when his or her income and resources are below specified amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, where the dependent lives with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse and the dependent's augmented portion of the veterans benefit is included in the veteran's or the veteran's surviving spouse's check, we believe that it is reasonable to assume that the dependent benefits from his or her portion in this living arrangement by the dependent having and using, for example, heat, electricity, food, and space. Not only is it likely that the dependent would be advantaged in some way from living with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse, but it would be administratively onerous to monitor the exact percentage of food, electricity, and heat used by the dependent and the designated beneficiary of the veterans benefit in order to document to what extent the augmented portion is used on the support and maintenance of the dependent. In those cases in which the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse provides cash or in-kind support to a dependent who does not reside with him or her, we will count such support under other SSI income rules appropriate to the nature of the support. We believe that this interpretation is consistent with the statutory requirements of the SSI program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada on offer The offer of a large line of stock depressed leisure and television group Granada. The stock retreated 5 3/4 to 492p, with most of the day's volume of 1.5m shares said to have been done in one hit as a big US holder relinquished part of its holding. The stock has been under a cloud since last week's stake reduction by Mercury Asset Management, the single largest stakeholder, with 15.8 per cent. The two building sectors, construction and building materials, were heavily bought, with sector analysts pointing to hopes of cuts in German interest rates, and strong buying after the poor showing of both sectors during the last quarter. 'It seems sector rotation principles are having a run,' the analyst said. He added that the sectors performed well in the first quarter of the year but abysmally in the second. 'Buying of the stocks can be increasingly supported by the earnings recovery story but the general feeling is that the buying has come from fund managers with a one quarter time horizon.' In the housebuilders/construction stocks, Wilson Bowden rose 14 to 412p. The best performances in building materials came from RMC, 29 higher at 863p, Blue Circle, 13 better at 304p, and Meyer International, 20 up at 404p. Wolseley put on 32 at 772p. Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle ended the day 2 lower at 501p in spite of annual profits which were up 21 per cent and in line with analysts' forecasts. Reuters was strong as the market responded to US buying late on Friday. Dealers said the gain in the US had prompted bear closing in London, a situation where dealers who have gone short of stock buy the shares back. The shares rose 18 to 448p. ICI shares, up 3 at 793p, failed to react significantly to news that the company was considering the flotation of its European Vinyls Corporation subsidiary. Negative comment over one of its products saw SmithKline Beecham 'A' decline 4 to 404p. However, analysts dismissed the claim that sales of Tagamet, SmithKline's ulcer drug, had collapsed in the US since its patent expired in May. Final turnover of 26m shares was believed to have reflected several big tax-related 'bed-and-breakfast' trades which were transacted at 375p a share shortly before the close of dealing. Wellcome was similarly affected, with 6.8m dealt at 560p a share - well below the market price. Clothes retailer Laura Ashley fell 5 to 68p on the news that it had lost its finance director to Burton. Ashley's loss was not Burton's gain and the latter was flat at 57 1/2 p. A rise in profits for furnishing group MFI saw the shares gain 3 to 142p. However, some analysts said the pre-tax improvement to Pounds 34.4m from Pounds 30.7m previously was flattered by various factors. Speculation of an impending rights issue saw shares in Hartstone, the socks and stockings company, slip 3 1/2 to 34p. Courtaulds grew 6 to 485p ahead of a visit by analysts to Germany next week to inspect one of the company's joint operations with Hoechst. Shanks &amp; McEwan added 4 at 88p following a newspaper article suggesting that the troubled waste disposal group was a likely takeover target from international freight management company Ocean, 3 lighter at 278p. British Aerospace advanced 10 to 464p, boosted by positive remarks from Charterhouse Tilney. Rolls-Royce rose 6 to 181p, with Lehman Brothers reported to have shown a keen interest in the stock. News from engineering group GKN that its defence division had signed an agreement of more than Dollars 225m with Kuwait on the sale of armoured vehicles helped the shares gain 9 at 566p. Talk of a profits downgrading for Vickers checked an early advance in the shares and they finished 3 up at 174p. Other statistics, Page 33</p>

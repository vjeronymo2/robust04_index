			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 21 (YONHAP) -- Ambassador for Nuclear  Affairs Kim Sam-hun on Friday left for Washington to discuss the  North Korean nuclear impasse.    During his stay in Washington for four to five days, Kim is  scheduled to meet with U.S. Government officials including  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci to evaluate the  present state of the North Korean nuclear issue.    They will focus on joint Korea-U.S countermeasures in view  of  the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    South Korea and the United States will reportedly agree on  opening a third round of talks between Washington and Pyongyang  next month if Pyongyang accepts the IAEA's proposal to stop  refueling the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and if the spent  fuel rods that have already been removed are stored in good  shape.    In addition, Seoul and Washington will determine their  position on subjects to be discussed at the Washington-Pyongyang  meeting.</p>

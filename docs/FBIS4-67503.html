			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anton Trofimov under the heading ``Experience'': </F> ``Payment for Fear: The Problem of How To Transport Radioactive  Materials Exists Both in Russia and in the West'']    [Text] The issue of how to safely transport uranium and  other radioactive substances is a timely one and, contrary to  popular opinion, not just for Russia, though for fairness' sake  it should be noted that the problem is more acute here. This was  the subject of discussion at a seminar entitled ``Transportation  of Uranium,'' sponsored by European Union experts and the  Uranerz Consortium. The seminar was held at the Voronovo Resort  near Moscow and was the second in a series, with the first held  at the same site in later June and early July of last year.    Western experts, concerned with the state of affairs in  Russia, are attempting to demonstrate how they are solving the  problems involved in ensuring safe transportation of ionizing  sources, to understand what Russian specialists can do in that  direction right now and, eventually, to find a way to integrate  our country's safety system (which remains to definitively take  shape) with the Western system.    The corresponding agencies in the West, both national and  international, pay particular attention to the development of  monitoring measures to prevent incidents during transport and to  mitigate their effects. Among those measures are development of  design standards both for the means of transportation and the  transportation routes. Standards have also been developed for  special transport containers which, as is well known, can cause  the greatest unpleasantness if they are not built according to  the necessary standards. In the West these ``packages'' undergo  appropriate testing. For example, drop tests, compression, depth  testing, resistance to physical damage, heat resistance and  water resistance. Our country's containers currently undergo the  same tests, but as of the fourth quarter of this year Russia  will have new regulations specifying container standards.  Furthermore, Russian experts are of the opinion that current  standards should be stricter than those approved by the  International Atomic Energy Agency in 1985.    However, these issues are more specific than general. The  latter type of issue includes things like the creation of a  unified system to ensure safe transportation of radioactive  materials in Russia and development of procedures to be used in  the event of the worst-case scenario: a transportation accident.  Even though fortunately thus far neither Russia nor any other  place in the world has experienced a single serious incident,  the danger is always there. Toward this end Western specialists  have drawn up accident plans regulating actions by all  organizations at every stage of clean-up efforts. Now Russian  specialists have had an opportunity to familiarize themselves  with those plans, and one would hope that Russia will soon have  such an essential unified ``accident system'' as well. The first  step in that direction was taken in Moscow when efforts by  almost 30 various agencies working on this issue were combined  under the Ministry for Emergency Situations [Ministerstvo po  chrezvychaynym situatsiyam (MChS)].    Also participating in discussion of all these issues,  together with Russian participants (of which there were 26, plus  specialists from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia and Uzbekistan)  were specialists from the companies that comprise the Uranerz  Consortium. They had only one complaint: the seminar was not  attended by any specialists from the MChS, the Russian Ministry  of Atomic Energy's Main Administration for Emergency Situations  or similar agencies. However, according to the sponsors a  special seminar for that type of structure will be held in the  near future.</p>

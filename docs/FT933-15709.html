			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Greycoat deal Property shares showed good gains in the wake of the deal agreed by Greycoat with its main shareholder, Postel, to secure its future. 'It is another sign that the financiers see a healthy future for the sector,' said one property analyst. However, speculative investors in Greycoat, who had piled in to the 9 1/2 per cent preference shares on Monday ahead of the well-publicised negotiations with Postel and pushed the price up 17 1/4 to 51 3/4 p, saw most of their gains evaporate. The stock ended 12 3/4 down at 39p, after 34p. The ordinary shares lost 2 at 17p. Meanwhile, BZW took the opportunity to raise its forecast for average capital value movements for 1993/94. However, in spite of pent-up investment demand for 'quality' properties estimated at Pounds 7bn, the broker believes that property shares will soon enter a period of consolidation. Among the majors yesterday, MEPC moved ahead 8 to 402p, Hammerson 'A' 9 to 290p, Land Securities 9 to 585p and British Land 7 to 328p.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS, AGENT DIFFER ON WHAT'S OWED TO BILLY JOE  </P> <P> He still hasn't thrown a pass in a professional football game -- "live bullets"  is the way Charger Coach Dan Henning puts it. But rookie quarterback Billy Joe  Tolliver continues to dominate the early focus of the 1989 Chargers.  </P> <P> Tolliver was the third player selected by the Chargers (51st overall) in last  spring's college draft. And like 20 other Chargers, he was still unsigned  Thursday, two days before the rookies and free agents were scheduled to begin  summer training camp at UC San Diego. The veterans are supposed to report July  28.  </P> <P> The list of other unsigned players includes running back Gary Anderson, who led  the Chargers in rushing last year, and rookie defensive end Burt Grossman, the  eighth player chosen in the first round.  </P> <P> But it was Tolliver whom Henning wanted to talk about Thursday. And it was the  Chargers' alleged lack of recognition of Tolliver's dollar value that Vic Vines  wanted to talk about later the same day.  </P> <P> Vines, Tolliver's Texas-based agent, said he might travel to San Diego over the  weekend to meet with Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football  operations. But Vines has rejected the Chargers' initial contract offer. And,  he said, "the Chargers have to make major, major movement" if they expect to  sign his client.  </P> <P> Henning said the Chargers have offered Tolliver a contract that would increase  at a later date if the rest of the players picked in the second round sign for  more money. "I think Billy Joe would make an  </P> <P> error if he doesn't come in here on time," Henning said.  </P> <P> As of Thursday, only a handful of 1989 second-round choices had signed. And  only three first-round picks -- Troy Aikman in Dallas, Andre Rison in  Indianapolis and Tom Ricketts in Pittsburgh -- had signed.  </P> <P> Vines said the Chargers' initial offer was a four-year package that included  roster and reporting bonuses. Ortmayer raised the offer Thursday with incentive  clauses that could make the contract more lucrative.  </P> <P> "But there are still some wrinkles that need to be ironed out by Sunday," said  Vines' business  </P> <P> partner, Joe Courrege. "And they are some tough wrinkles."  </P> <P> Vines said he was philosophically opposed to the idea of a temporary contract  that would hinge on other signings. "If I do that," he said, "I've got to put  my trust in all the other agents of second-round players and what they are able  to get for their clients. I've got to agree to a deal that's out of my hands."  </P> <P> The fuss over Tolliver stems from the Chargers' inability to generate an  acceptable passing offense in 1988. They finished 26th out of 28 NFL teams in  passing and 26th in total offense. Mark Malone, their starter at the end of the  season, wound up last in AFC passing for the second consecutive year.  </P> <P> When the Chargers drafted Tolliver, both Ortmayer and Henning were ecstatic.  They talked about how Tolliver represented a significant "upgrade" at the  quarterback position. Vines' job is to make sure they don't forget all those  nice things they said.  </P> <P> "I was real surprised Billy Joe wasn't the third player picked in the first  round," Vines said.  </P> <P> Spoken like a true agent. But Vines knows he has the Chargers between a rock  and a hard place in this negotiation. Ortmayer has one year left on his  contract and can't be sure when Charger owner Alex Spanos will begin wooing  Bobby Beathard, the former Washington Redskins general manager, to replace him.  </P> <P> Henning, a former quarterback, knows the disproportionate importance of that  position. He also knows the importance of winning right away, particularly  under an owner like Spanos, who is desperate for the team to improve upon last  season's 6-10 record.  </P> <P> And even though Henning won't say so in as many words, he is convinced Tolliver  has more ability and potential than Malone, Mark Vlasic and David Archer, the  team's other three quarterbacks.  </P> <P> So he appealed to the media Thursday to get the word out to Tolliver about the  importance of reporting on time. Courrege, who clashed with Henning in 1984  over the signings of Falcons Scott Case and Rick Bryan, said the ploy won't  work.  </P> <P> "Billy Joe is strong," Courrege said. "And he's adamant about the fact that he  will make more money than that center from Rice."  </P> <P> "That center from Rice" is rookie Courtney Hall, the Chargers first pick in the  second round (37th overall). Hall also is unsigned. "I think Courtney Hall will  be signed and ready to go (by Sunday)," Henning said. "I don't know what will  happen with Grossman."  </P> <P> Added Henning: "I think (Tolliver's) agent is making a superior mistake if he  doesn't work things out . . . if you take the history of that position . . .  rookies coming in who have an opportunity to take off and get some excellent  work in the early part of camp."  </P> <P> Responded Courrege: "Henning's been knocked around this league, and for him to  make a statement like that is ridiculous."  </P> <P> Courrege also used the word "stupid" to describe statements attributed to  Ortmayer indicating that Hall will get more money than Tolliver.  </P> <P> The vitriol didn't stop there. "The Chargers do not have a quarterback who has  proven he can win," Vines said. "They've got a guy (Malone) who was last in the  conference. They've got a guy (Vlasic) who has a rehabilitated knee. And  they've got a guy (Archer) who is a journeyman."  </P> <P> Said Henning: "I don't give a damn about the agent. The agent will never line  up and never take a snap. That guy's not going to play for us."  </P> <P> Ortmayer and Henning said the Chargers might be forced to look for another  quarterback if Tolliver doesn't sign and Vlasic's knee doesn't stand up to  two-a-day practices. Coincidentally, one of the quarterbacks that interests  them is Cowboy Steve Pelluer.  </P> <P> Pelluer's agent? Joe Courrege.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Joe Courrege says the seven teams interested in Steve Pelluer are: the  Chargers, Detroit, Green Bay, Kansas City, Atlanta, Miami and Cincinnati. . . .  Billy Joe Tolliver is one of nine unsigned Charger rookies. The number of  signed rookies is zero, although the Chargers agreed to terms with  seventh-rounder Marion Butts, a running back from Florida State, late Thursday.  Most of those drafted after the fourth round are expected to be signed by  Sunday. The 12 unsigned veterans are kicker Vince Abbott, running back Gary  Anderson, linebacker Keith Browner, running back Lionel James, defensive back  Leonard Coleman, wide receiver Jamie Holland, defensive end Tyrone Keys,  quarterback Mark Malone, defensive lineman Les Miller, defensive lineman Joe  Phillips, linebacker Gary Plummer and running back Tim Spencer. Several from  that group, most notably Malone, are close to signing. . . . The Chargers will  scrimmage the Rams a week from Sunday at 2 p.m. at UC San Diego. This will be  mostly rookies and free agents. Charger veterans don't report until a week from  Saturday. . . . What price fame? Sharon and Charles Tolliver, the parents of  Billy Joe, have an unlisted phone number in their hometown of Boyd, Tex. Boyd's  population is listed at 889. . . . Coach Dan Henning said there will be a  curfew at training camp, 11 p.m. Meetings will often last until 10 p.m. . . .  Look for defensive end Leslie O'Neal to play at linebacker in 1989. "It's  possible that he'll be an up-and-down guy," Henning said, " . . . but in truth,  he's a linebacker."  </P></p>

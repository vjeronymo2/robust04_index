			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Italian tax plan aimed at cutting unemployment The Italian government headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi is expected to approve a package of tax measures at the end of this week. Tax exemption of reinvested profits and fiscal incentives to encourage new car purchases, along the lines adopted in France, are among measures being considered stimulate the economy. During the campaign for the elections at the end of March, Mr Berlusconi promised to tackle the problem of unemployment and create a million new jobs. This week's tax package will reinforce decrees issued last Friday that seek to boost employment. Italy's construction industry, badly affected by the recession and the effects of the tangentopoli (kickback city) corruption scandal, may be helped by a decree that suspends the Merloni Law until the end of this year. The Merloni Law, which came into force at the beginning of March, establishes a new and transparent framework for awarding and overseeing public works contracts. The new government believes the law has put a brake on public works, and intends to introduce modifications. Meanwhile, it hopes the law's suspension will have a rapid impact on activity and employment in the construction sector, with around L60,000bn (Pounds 25bn) of contracts being given the go-ahead. A second decree eases regulations covering the hiring of staff. Only businesses with payrolls of less than three had been allowed to hire directly, all others being required to obtain staff through state employment exchanges. Now businesses with up to 15 workers may hire directly, though this relaxation does not apply to farming. Mr Berlusconi's government has said it wants to reduce rigidity in the labour market and thereby encourage the creation of new jobs. It is expected follow Friday's decree by introducing measures covering part-time and fixed term contracts. Unemployment is particularly high among young Italians, and Mr Berlusconi's government seeks to reduce it by stimulating the establishment of businesses by young people. A decree allocates L500bn for incentives, L100bn this year and L200bn in each of the next two years. The incentives will be available in depressed areas throughout the country. The body managing this programme will be transformed into a joint stock corporation whose scope will be the provision of services to small and medium enterprises. It will have share capital of L10bn, held by the Treasury, and take stakes of up to 10 per cent in the equity of businesses. The package announced on Friday includes a decree to release funds to businesses in southern Italy that have been waiting for payment of regional development grants already approved. Although about L2,000bn will be released to about 2,700 businesses, a further 13,500 businesses will still be waiting for payment. The Bank of Italy on Friday relaxed reserve requirements, reducing the marginal rate of obligatory reserve from 17.5 to 15 per cent from mid-July.</p>

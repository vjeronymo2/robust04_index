			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS ACTIVISTS LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR GAY RIGHTS REPEAL  </P> <P> A coalition of religious activists launched a campaign Friday to repeal the  city's new gay-rights ordinance as the San Diego City Council formally enacted  the measure that bars landlords, employers and private businesses from  discriminating against homosexuals.  </P> <P> The newly created San Diego Citizens for Equal Rights has 30 days from Monday's  routine second City Council vote on the Human Dignity Ordinance to gather  28,293 signatures of registered voters calling for a citywide referendum on the  statute.  </P> <P> The organization's leaders promised to gather thousands of those signatures  with the help of a growing coalition of San Diego churches and said they are  seeking the support of Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher. Organizations  opposed to abortions also will participate in the coalition.  </P> <P> "If we can't get 40,000 (signatures), I'm sure we can get about half of it  through our volunteer base" in area churches, said political consultant Barry  Jantz, chairman of the organization.  </P> <P> The rest of the signatures might have to be gathered with the help of paid  petition circulators.  </P> <P> The group is seeking 40,000 signatures to ensure that it collects enough valid  signatures to qualify for the ballot.  </P> <P> The Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values  Coalition, said ministers in 30 to 40 participating churches will use their  pulpits to preach against the ordinance and predicts a 10-point victory if his  organization succeeds in getting the referendum on the ballot.  </P> <P> The organization will attempt to raise about $40,000 to qualify the measure for  the ballot, he said.  </P> <P> Sheldon said the ordinance's supporters want "to totally remove the  heterosexual ethic from center stage and make homosexuality a viable lifestyle  option.  </P> <P> "We don't want it acceptable. We don't want it as a viable life alternative,"  Sheldon added.  </P> <P> Supporters of the ordinance said after the first vote on the ordinance two  weeks ago that they, too, have already begun raising money and building an  organization to campaign against repeal of the ordinance.  </P> <P> Monday's vote adds San Diego to a list of California cities including Los  Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley, Santa Barbara and Oakland that have approved  laws barring various forms of discrimination against gays and lesbians.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which will take effect in 30 days if the petition drive is  unsuccessful, outlaws discrimination against homosexuals in employment, housing  and real-estate transactions, education, business establishments and the  provision of city facilities and services. Violators would face civil penalties  from lawsuits brought by victims of bias.  </P> <P> If the drive succeeds, the council can rescind the law, call a special election  or place it on the November general election ballot.  </P></p>

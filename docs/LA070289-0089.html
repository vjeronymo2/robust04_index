Paula Sims, 29, was charged with obstructing justice and  concealing a homicidal death, in the case two months ago of daughter Heather  Lee. Sims and her husband, Robert, reported the 6-week-old girl abducted on  April 29 from their home in Alton. The child's body was found in a trash can  across the Mississippi River on May 3. In 1986, the couple's firstborn  daughter, 13-day-old Loralei, was also reported missing under similar  circumstances.  </P></p>

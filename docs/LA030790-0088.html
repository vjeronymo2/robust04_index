			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOME COURT PROVES NO ADVANTAGE FOR HART IN LOPSIDED LOSS  </P> <P> The girls' basketball team from Mt. Carmel High in San Diego journeyed more  than 2 1/2 hours Tuesday to play Hart, which had not lost a home game in more  than two years.  </P> <P> So what happened? Mt. Carmel ran the Indians right out of their own gym -- and  the state playoff tournament -- with a 65-42 victory in a Southern California  Division I regional.  </P> <P> So much for home-court advantage.  </P> <P> "It's a little stunning," said Hart Coach Dave Munroe, whose team won the  Southern Section 5-A Division championship Friday with a 49-45 victory over  Buena. "We're better than what we played tonight. We were flat."  </P> <P> Flattened is more accurate. This one got ugly fast and stayed that way.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel (23-5), the San Diego Section Division I champion, led 19-9 after  one quarter, 40-13 by halftime and 55-24 midway through the third quarter.  </P> <P> From there it was all substitutions and dribbling.  </P> <P> "We've never had a 40-point half all year long," Mt Carmel Coach Peggy Brose  said. "Maybe we should take a 2 1/2-hour bus trip before every game."  </P> <P> The Sundevils kept Hart (25-5) bottled up, especially in containing 6-foot-3  senior center Sara Wilson, who scored just nine points.  </P> <P> Wilson, last season's Times Valley Player of the Year, did not score until she  sank a free throw midway through the third quarter and did not make a field  goal until the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Sophomore point guard Anjanette Dionne, the other half of Hart's one-two punch,  poured in a game-high 19 points -- including three three-point baskets -- but  she also was largely neutralized.  </P> <P> Hart's highlight of the evening came with 2 minutes 47 seconds to play when  Dionne, after fouling out, received a standing ovation for her season-long  efforts.  </P> <P> "We didn't have the intensity tonight," said Dionne, who averaged 23 points a  game this season. "I'm glad to see that everyone stayed until the end instead  of leaving."  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel moved the ball swiftly, mostly to 5-8 junior forward Vicki de Jesus,  who scored a team-high 17 points. Kris Grazzini, a 6-2 sophomore center, added  16 points.  </P> <P> Guards Tara Schwerin (13) and Rachel Velasco (12) also scored in double  figures.  </P> <P> "We're just a team that has no superstars but just plays well," Brose said.  "Our shots were falling."  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel made 27 of 53 (51%) from the field while Hart was 18 of 55 (32%).  </P> <P> "We dug a hole," Munroe said simply. "But we played 30 games this year, we're  allowed to make a mistake."  </P></p>

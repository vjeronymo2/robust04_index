			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Cross-border united front on Ulster restored London and Dublin yesterday sought to restore a united front for their joint Northern Ireland peace initiative after remarks at the weekend by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, raised fears of a rift. Senior ministers from both countries, including Mr Spring, joined forces to emphasise that there could be no negotiations with Sinn Fein without a permanent end to IRA violence. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, edged towards accepting Mr Spring's weekend message that a temporary IRA ceasefire would be 'a step in the right direction'. Sir Patrick acknowledged that a temporary ceasefire would be 'better than violence'. Their efforts came as the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, emerged from a stormy meeting with Mr John Major to declare that June's European elections in Ulster would in effect be a referendum on the Downing Street declaration. Mr Paisley said he intended to meet the prime minister again after the DUP had secured 'a firm mandate from the people'. The DUP leader - whose party is boycotting the political talks process  - traditionally secures the biggest vote in the province's European elections. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said Mr Major 'took Mr Paisley to task' for misinterpreting the joint declaration on a number of occasions, and areas of common ground were 'fairly few and far between' in the course of a 'very frank' 30-minute meeting. Downing Street officials said Mr Major told Mr Paisley and his DUP colleagues that he had a UK-wide mandate for the task of stopping the day-to-day horror in Northern Ireland. In Dublin, Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, emphasised after talks that there would be no negotiations with Sinn Fein unless there was 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence' by the IRA. But Mr Spring reiterated that Dublin would seek to build on any temporary IRA ceasefire. Mr Hurd used a speech in Dublin to the Institute of European Affairs to argue that the relationship between Britain and Ireland had been transformed and was 'no longer transfixed by difficulties rooted in the past'.</p>

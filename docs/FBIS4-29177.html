			<p>BFN     [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue, which has grown  increasingly tense following North Korea's announcement of its  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  has caused a subtle ripple in the confused political situation  in Japan. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party]; Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister  and foreign minister; and Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, former chairman of  the Policy Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], who are all proponents of a  "conservative-conservative coalition," are pushing for a  realignment of established political parties on the basis of a  policy consensus. They are citing the North Korean nuclear  issue as one important policy that needs a consensus. With the  current Diet session set to close on 29 June, the North Korean  nuclear issue may become not only an important diplomatic task  for Japan, but one factor in unsettling the political situation.    As far as the North Korean nuclear issue is concerned, the  government's position is: "There is no option for Japan but to  sincerely carry out what the United Nations decides" (said a  senior Foreign Ministry official). Some government officials  are voicing concern over Japan's overreaction to North Korea's  withdrawal from the IAEA, saying: "What is important is that  our nation must refrain from making a big fuss. North Korea  would be pleased to find its simple announcements or comments  trigging a big fuss in Japan" (said a government source).    The North Korean nuclear crisis was a hot issue in the  Hosokawa government, the handling of which the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] bitterly disputed with Shinseito and  Komeito. The SDPJ may become a hurdle for proponents of the  "conservative- conservative coalition" who intend to seek a  coalition by "putting aside past grudges."    While the United Nations is certain to begin a full-fledged  debate on sanctions against North Korea, China is still taking a  wary position. The prevailing view is that serious domestic  debates will be held in "the far future" on how Japan should  actually deal with sanctions (said a Foreign Ministry source).  In the closing days of the current Diet session, the political  situation is expected to be strained over a no-confidence motion  against the Hata cabinet, and the handling of a bill on the  demarcation for a new single-seat constituency system and a new  proportional representation system; no drastic developments are  expected to occur before the current Diet session closes.    North Korea has made it clear it wants to negotiate only  with  the United States. Japanese Government officials are concerned  that the "North Korean nuclear issue could become a factor in  destabilizing the political situation in Japan" because the  issue is bound to strain things (said a senior Foreign Ministry  official).</p>

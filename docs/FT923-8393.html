			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Currency slide adds to Australian woes AUSTRALIA'S fragile economy was yesterday shaken by the fall of the Australian dollar to a three-year low. It fell to 73.1 US cents in the Australian market, despite intervention from the Reserve Bank. While the slide was triggered by gloomy retail trade figures announced by the government statistics bureau, markets have also been made nervous by rumours of a budget deficit of Dollars A16bn (Pounds 6bn) in 1992-93, and of another cut in interest rates. The government is committed to allocating more funds for job-creating programmes in the 1992-93 budget. This is in addition to a Dollars A2.3bn spending programme announced in February which has so far failed to alleviate unemployment, which stood at 11 per cent in July. The Dollars A2.3bn programme, allocated over two years, helped push last year's budget deficit to around ADollars 9.4bn. The government is now banking on favourable growth figures being released tomorrow and is confident that growth of 2 per cent was achieved in 1991-92. This would mean a budget deficit of ADollars 13bn-ADollars 14bn. The government is hoping for a big revenue-raising boost, in the shape of the planned sale of Qantas, Australia's international flight carrier. Mr Ralph Willis, minister for finance, yesterday said the government was to press ahead with the airline sale to raise over ADollars 1bn during the year.</p>

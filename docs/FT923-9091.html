			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Food secrets MRS VIRGINIA Bottomley, the health secretary, deserves some credit for publishing this week the commercial interests of her department's outside advisers on food and health policy. But the decision is scarcely the advance of open government she claims. At most, it is a modest, belated - and apparently grudging - recognition of what should be basic principles of public accountability. The government has a clear responsibility to safeguard the public interest by setting nutritional guidelines and educating the country to accept them. But if they are to command confidence, their formulation needs to be transparent and their impartiality beyond doubt. As a minimum, advisers must be seen to be free of any possible conflict of interest. The department's disclosure that many advisers have financial links, either personal or through research funding, with food and pharmaceuticals companies is not evidence of impropriety. But by refusing to publish the information until now, the department has fuelled suspicions that it had something to hide. Even now, these have not been wholly dispelled by the decision to slip the information out late on a holiday season afternoon and the failure to publish details of the advisers' occupations and places of work. The most charitable explanation for such secrecy is an anachronistic belief that Whitehall knows best. If Mrs Bottomley is to demonstrate a genuine commitment to open government, she needs to go further. At the least, she should require disclosure of the sums received personally by advisers from industry and the precise services rendered. It is impossible at present to be sure whether an adviser is paid a few hundred pounds a year for the occasional odd job, or is on a lucrative retainer for work at the heart of a company's competitive strategy. Better still, departmental advisers should waive any personal payments from companies with a vested interest in their policy recommendations, and such companies' employees should be made advisers only if they possess unique skills. Finally, the department should disclose when, and on what topics, advisers are required to stand down from discussions to avoid conflicts of interest.</p>

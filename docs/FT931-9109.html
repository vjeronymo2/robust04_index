			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Retiring assets By proposing to take a portion of British Rail and British Coal pension fund assets into the national coffers ahead of privatisation, the government risks looking greedy. It is right that existing pension arrangements cannot simply be transferred to the private sector. Allocating BR's existing 200,000 pensioners to the proposed rail franchise operators would be neither simple nor fair. But it may also be creating an opportunity to use some sleight of hand in dealing with the public sector borrowing requirement. Both pension funds are expected to show a surplus at the next actuarial valuation. Since the government would guarantee index-linked benefits under its proposal - a better promise than available from the private sector - it may be tempted to claim a portion of the surplus. Given the public subsidies which supported BR over the years, it may have a case. But identifying the extent of a pension fund surplus is not a cut-and-dried affair. At the least, the government would do to wait until the Goode Committee has clarified the question of ownership. Were it to act sooner the government would be setting a bad example for other companies to follow. Even without the surplus, the government might be tempted to go in for some slick book-keeping. From the rail and coal schemes alone, perhaps Pounds 13bn in pension fund assets might fall under government control. Any asset sales would count as funding towards the PSBR. That would allow some subtle smoothing of the borrowing requirement. But it would transfer the bill to future governments committed to pay index-linked benefits. That is not what fiscal rectitude is all about.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / BAA receives Pounds 4.75m bid for Prestwick A Pounds 4.75m bid has been made for Prestwick airport in Ayrshire. If it is accepted it will be the first time that BAA, the UK airports operator, will have agreed to the sale of one of its international airports. The bid has been made by AAP, a company controlled by Mr Peter Kay, a Scottish-based businessman. AAP said it began talking to BAA a year ago and was making the bid now because 'the passage of time is to the detriment of Prestwick airport'. It said BAA had offered to lease the airport to AAP in July 1991 and an outright sale was discussed in August. AAP's bid surprised a rival consortium, the Ayrshire Community Airports Project (Acap), which is chaired by Mr George Younger, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and Conservative MP for Ayr. Mr Bill Miller, an Ayrshire businessman involved in Acap, said that the company was talking to BAA and British Aerospace, which has a manufacturing plant and flying school at the airport. 'Things are at a very sensitive stage,' he said. BAA made clear last spring that it would consider bids for Prestwick. In March 1990, the government removed Prestwick's monopoly on transatlantic flights from Scotland, and airlines immediately transferred operations to Glasgow. Prestwick's turnover in the year to March 1991, fell to Pounds 4.8m from Pounds 9.3m the previous year. No regular passenger flights are using the airport this winter, although charter flights operated there last summer. BAe's commercial aircraft division makes Jetstream aircraft at Prestwick. The company said last month that it was also engaged in talks with BAA about buying the airport. It said the existence of the runway at Prestwick was vital to BAe. BAA gave assurances in 1990 that, if there was a change of owner at Prestwick, it would ensure that any purchaser kept the runway open. BAA said that it had failed to reach agreement with AAP last August because AAP could not meet guarantees. A record 10.8m passengers used Manchester airport last year in spite of the recession and the effects of the Gulf war. International traffic fell 2 per cent to 3m passengers and the recession caused a fall of 10 per cent in domestic passengers to 2m. Chartered business offset those falls with a 6 per cent rise to 5.8m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, led  by Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council,  visited the area of Rama and Uskoplje today. Zdenko Vranjes  reports:    [Vranjes] The need to strengthen the institution of the  law-governed state and to suppress crime and smuggling in  Herceg-Bosna was the focus of attention of the talks between the  political leaders of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and  civilian and military authorities of the Rama and Uskoplje  municipalities and the priests of Rama monastery. It was  emphasized that the passage of humanitarian and other convoys  should be made more orderly. All convoys for Bosnia pass  through Rama and Uskoplje. Their chaotic passage causes even  greater and more dangerous disorder, robberies, and attacks by  rebel groups, it was said at the talks.    The implementation of the Washington agreement was discussed  at the session of the Croatian Democratic Union municipal  committee and the command of the Ante Starcevic Brigade from  Uskoplje. More work needs to be done on the border delineation  between the cantons, it was stressed.    Zubak reiterated that the Croatian people have truly  accepted  the Washington agreement as a step toward peace. He described  Alija Izetbegovic's letter [to Tudjman] yesterday as an attempt  to shift to the Croatian people the blame for the lack of  readiness to implement the Washington agreement.    Zubak said the Croatian representatives will not allow the  Croatian people to be deceived. They will not allow certain  circles among the Muslim people to establish a unitary  Bosnia-Herzegovina by bypassing the essence of the Washington  agreement. Such attempts can be detected in the demands by  Muslim representatives for both the president of the federation  and the prime minister to be Muslims. We will not accept this,  for such demands have no basis in the constitution of the new  federation, Zubak said.</p>

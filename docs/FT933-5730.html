			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Fighting talk by German car chief GERMAN industry is in danger of toppling into a domestic battle with 'everyone against everyone else' as it struggles to master its current costs crisis, according to Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of Mercedes-Benz. Such a clash would be part of the penalty to be paid for managements' tendency in the past to place too much emphasis on harmony and not enough on competitiveness, he told journalists. He appealed for a 'constructive conflict' in which participants would find a path between the extremes of the traditionally cosy industrial relationships and damaging in-fighting. Speaking as head of the central pillar of Germany's biggest industrial concern, Mr Werner clearly marked out Daimler-Benz's position in a rapidly-intensifying national debate on the country's economic and social future. The Bonn cabinet is expected today to approve a government paper on possible cures for the rigidity of the nation's industrial and social structures, and what is called its 'growing unwillingness to accept innovation and change'. While the economy as a whole is burdened with the immense costs of unification, Germany's export-oriented industry is struggling to adapt to increased global competition. The motor industry, labouring under a 30 per cent costs disadvantage against the Japanese, is under unprecedented pressure. Mr Werner implicitly rejected the rough-and-ready attempts by some companies, notably Volkswagen, to force concessions out of suppliers. He also refused to accept the continuation of the 'inhibiting social comfort consensus', in which the avoidance of friction between labour and management, and even between companies, was considered paramount. But he made plain his belief that the core strengths of the German way of doing business could be restored to the national advantage. 'It is our job to reactivate German management culture: a symbiosis of creativity and efficiency,' he said. Mercedes itself aimed to improve productivity by 15 per cent next year, partly by shedding 14,000 jobs. 'Productivity in stagnating markets must be paid for with jobs,' Mr Werner said. Hinting at future workforce reductions, he said that in order to remain competitive, German manufacturers would have to improve productivity by 40 per cent in the next few years.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sara Lee and Quaker Oats cheer markets TWO large US consumer product groups, Sara Lee and Quaker Oats, have reported sharply-improved profits for the final three months of 1991. Profits rose by 13.6 per cent at Sara Lee, the large Chicago-based consumer products company, during the second quarter of its 1991-92 financial year, to Dollars 189.4m after tax. Earnings per share increased by a roughly similar amount, up 13.2 per cent to 77 cents, while net sales for the quarter were Dollars 36bn, 6.8 per cent higher. First-half net profits show a more dramatic advance, up by two-thirds to Dollars 452.8m, but this partly reflects a net pre-tax unusual gain of Dollars 221.7m - comprising profit from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business offset by some restructuring costs. The gain was taken in the July-September quarter. At Quaker Oats, the food and pet foods group also based in Chicago, second-quarter after-tax profits totalled Dollars 44.7m, against only Dollars 2.1m. Comparisons are muddied because of a Dollars 30m provision for discontinued operations last year, but pre-tax profit from continuing businesses still rose from Dollars 57.5m to Dollars 78.3m. The company was helped by strong volume growth, at home and abroad, and lower commodity costs. First-half profits stand at Dollars 87.1m after tax. At close of trade shares in Sara Lee fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 1/2 , and those of Quaker Oats, were down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 69.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Phillips &amp; Drew name dropped THE NAME Phillips &amp; Drew, once one of the strongest brand names in the UK stockbroking business, has been dropped by UBS, the London-based investment banking arm of Union Bank of Switzerland which took over the broker at the time of Big Bang in 1986, Richard Waters writes. Mr Rudi Mueller, head of UBS in London, called the move a 'logical extension' of the integration of P&amp;D with the former UBS Securities business. The name will live on for a short while in Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, one of the leading pension fund managers in the UK, although here too it is expected to be dropped after a period.</p>

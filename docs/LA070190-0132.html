			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS SAY GORBACHEV REFORMS WILL CONTINUE;  </P> <P> PERESTROIKA: EVEN IF HE LOSES POWER, CHANGE IS IN THE WORKS, THEY BELIEVE. FOR  THE U.S., HE OFFERS STABILITY.  </P> <P> As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev prepares for the crucial Communist  Party congress this week, most American experts in and out of government have  concluded that his reforms will probably continue -- possibly at a headier pace  -- if Gorbachev himself loses power.  </P> <P> "He is father of the revolution," a senior Administration official said, "but  the children of his revolution have moved beyond him. Other leaders might push  things along faster, like democratization, market economy, withdrawal from  foreign commitments."  </P> <P> But to the United States, this official said, Gorbachev offers something that  none of his adversaries can match: That something is stability, and for now the  Bush Administration values stability more than accelerated reform.  </P> <P> "The faster the change, the greater risk of instability" in the Soviet Union,  this official said. The explosive caldron of change could bubble over, he said,  with enormous and possibly disastrous consequences for Europe.  </P> <P> Many outside analysts agree with this view.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev is less indispensable to reform than he was a year ago," said the  RAND Corp.'s Arnold L. Horelick, a former senior CIA analyst of Soviet affairs.  "Indeed, he may have become part of the problem. But he is also indispensable  to reasonable stability in the short term. So the dilemma is whether it's  riskier to accept stasis with Gorbachev or accept the risk of doing without  him."  </P> <P> "We are on the eve of momentous events," said Walter Laquer, a Soviet scholar  at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Gorbachev is fighting  for survival."  </P> <P> How he will attempt to meet this challenge -- move left or right, quit as  general secretary of the party but remain as Soviet president, retire  altogether -- is anyone's guess. So are the consequences if he retires  voluntarily or is forced out by his opponents.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union, for so many years the most predictable country, is now the  least predictable country," observed Laquer, author of a new book, "Soviet  Union 2000: Reform or Revolution."  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has decided to continue working with Gorbachev at least  until it can complete arms reduction talks and German unification accords. It  has formulated its policies so as not to jeopardize Gorbachev's political  standing at home.  </P> <P> "We're not betting that he succeeds or even that he'll be around in five  years," a senior State Department official said, "only that he's the most  efficacious way to get there (into the mid-1990s) without violence.  </P> <P> "We want the democratic movement in Eastern Europe to continue, we want the  Soviet forces out of Germany, and we want German unification, we want START and  CFE," he added, referring to treaties under negotiation to reduce both nuclear  and conventional military forces. "These goals could be endangered if he fell."  </P> <P> Most European states, particularly Germany and France, are even more frightened  of the possible effects of Gorbachev's departure than is the United States. To  help Gorbachev, they are pushing for a multibillion-dollar economic aid program  for the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's fall, they believe, would be catastrophic for  the West.  </P> <P> Some American scholars are equally concerned. Without Gorbachev, said Columbia  University's Marshall Shulman, his reforms would be "put on hold" and "disorder  and even chaos" could follow. "He's still the linchpin holding that polarized  situation together," said Shulman, a professor emeritus of international  relations.  </P> <P> Not so, argued Allen Lynch, a colleague of Shulman, in the current issue of  Foreign Affairs magazine. Gorbachev was the "right man at the right time" to  create the breakthrough in East-West relations, he wrote. But fears that his  domestic failures will force a reversal of Soviet foreign policy and even  Gorbachev's downfall are misplaced.  </P> <P> "The disappearance or marginalization of Gorbachev would have a detectable  impact on Western international interests," Lynch acknowledged. But "it is now  unlikely," he wrote, "that a change in Soviet leadership -- or a change in the  pace, scope and character of reform -- would have a corresponding impact on  East-West relations and the most vital geopolitical interests of the United  States."  </P> <P> The Soviets need a benign international environment to pursue their domestic  reforms, Lynch said. Conservatives in the Soviet Union accept this fact. Also,  Lynch maintained, Soviet leaders recognize that foreign aggressiveness, such as  the invasion of Afghanistan, causes a backlash in the West that far outweighs  whatever benefits are to be gained.  </P> <P> These factors mean that Gorbachev's foreign policies would continue without  Gorbachev, Lynch predicted. "The sooner the West relinquishes its fascination  with Gorbachev, the sooner it can assume responsibilities of a sober, long-term  analysis of the foundations of its relationship with the U.S.S.R. and their  consequences for peace," he said.  </P> <P> U.S. policy toward Gorbachev reflects President Bush's generally cautious  approach around the world, particularly in relations toward China. There, after  last year's massacre of protesters in Beijing, the Administration refused to  distance itself from the regime as far as U.S. and Chinese liberals urged.  </P> <P> More radical reformers are challenging Gorbachev. But as in China, U.S.  officials do not believe these Soviets are yet capable of running the country.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- At least 17 nongas export  commodities slotted for export to six out of 20 countries  recorded a decline. This has prevented any acceleration in the  export of nongas commodities. In this regard, the government and  the private sector should embark on anticipatory measures to  curb Indonesia's current decline in nongas exports.    This was stated by Rudy Lengkong, the head of the National  Export Development Board, BPEN, during a hearing of the  Parliamentary Commission VII [Roman seven] headed by Lukman R.  Boer on 22 June.    Agricultural products and manufactured goods are among the  17  export items in decline.    According to Rudy Lengkong, an impromptu analysis conducted  by the Department of Industry indicated that the decline in the  nongas export commodities was due to weaker demand for such  commodities.    In general, Indonesia was not the only country suffering  such  a decline. For example, the Netherlands also noted an 18.44  percent decline in its exports. Italy's export volume also  dropped 24.15 percent in global markets, while France's exports  noted a 15.43 percent downswing. These countries are in fact  Indonesia's major export venues in West Europe.    Apart from this, the emergence of new competitors for  Indonesia in international markets has also contributed to the  country's decline in its exports. China and Vietnam are  currently making efforts to find markets for their products,  particularly manufactured goods which are relatively similar to  those offered by Indonesia. Meanwhile, Indonesia's traditional  competitors -- Thailand, Malaysia and some others -- are also  strong contenders.    The decline in prices was also one of the factors for the  drop in Indonesia's nongas exports. Rudy Lengkong said: "The  weaker demand in several markets due to recession, which was  followed by a deluge of export commodities, caused the decline  in prices for several nongas commodities -- including textiles,  textiles products, and rubber."    Another factor which has also contributed to the continuing  decline of Indonesia's exports of nongas commodities is the  Indonesian entrepreneurs' inability in setting up foreign trade  networks in regions with market potential, which could guarantee  a continuous and secure market access. Strangely, China and  India are the only countries which have foreign trade networks  at an international level. [Passage omitted]</p>

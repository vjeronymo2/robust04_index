Before the trial the lawyer of the unemployed defendant made  a statement claiming the murder was a tragic accident.    The trial taking place at the Supreme Court is attended by  the vice-consul of the American embassy.    Woodruff was killed last summer on a highway near Tbilisi.  Investigators arrived at the conclusion an attempt was made to  stop the diplomat's car for the purpose of robbery. As the car  driven by the chief of Shevardnadze's security did not stop,  fire was opened at it.    According to many sources, Woodruff was a CIA officer. The  chief of the organization James Woolsey came to Tbilisi to  escort the dead body back home.</p>

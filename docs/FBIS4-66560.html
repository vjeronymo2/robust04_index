The company the government is dealing  with has not responded to a letter requesting it to transfer the  F-16 airplanes immediately to Pakistan as per the agreement.  Pakistan has already paid the huge amount of $680 million to  this company, and this company has demanded payment of another  $150 million before March 1994. Pakistan, however, has taken the  correct stand that the airplanes should be sent to Pakistan as  per the agreement before the next installment is paid. The  delivery of F-16 planes to Pakistan was stopped under the  Pressler amendment using Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program as  an excuse. It is unfortunate that the agreement to purchase  F-16s was made in 1989 and the Pressler amendment was passed in  1990. On principle, an agreement made before the Pressler  amendment should not be affected by it. However, as the result  of the U.S. government's unfair and unprincipled stand, economic  and military aid to Pakistan was suspended using the nuclear  program as leverage to put pressure on Pakistan. This issue  could not be resolved despite several high-level talks. The  question arises, how long can Pakistan tolerate the situation  where it has paid for, but cannot get the airplanes? At the same  time, we are being asked to pay the other installments for the  planes. The Pakistani government should raise this issue at all  political and diplomatic levels with the U.S. government. It  should also take legal action in U.S. courts so that either the  money paid in advance is returned or the F-16 planes are  supplied to Pakistan.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Pakistan fall blamed on a number of factors Pakistani share prices had recovered some of the week's losses as the Karachi stock exchange closed for the week on Thursday, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. But the temporary recovery did little to strengthen investors' confidence after a week of spectacular falls. The KSE-100 index gained 38 points to 2,227, still significantly less than last Sunday's opening index of 2400.50. Many analysts saw the falls as having been triggered by the law and order situation in Karachi where recent politically motivated killings and public demonstrations, have created fresh uncertainty. Moreover, Pakistan's annual budget, due next month, is expected to include a widening of the general sales tax to more than 100 new items. In addition, a leading company on the market, Dewan Salman Fibres, has suffered a setback after a recent Euroconvertible issue. At one point, the bond was trading at 10 per cent below its face value. That has dampened hopes for other companies considering similar plans. Finally, many brokers argued that falls in share values at other Asian markets had an effect. 'The overseas investors' buying momentum has really slowed. There's a total lack of fresh buying coming in,' said Mr Mudassar Malik, a director at BMA Capital Management. However Mr Nasir Bukhari, chief executive of Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, said: 'There had been a fabulous run-up which was due for correction.' Other brokers share Mr Bukhari's assessment of the index, which had almost doubled in the past 6 to 7 months.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Rank to sell 22 hotels to reduce debt THE RANK Organisation has put 22 of its UK hotels up for sale, including the Royal Garden and Royal Lancaster hotels in London. The company, whose interests include cinemas, film distribution, bingo and Butlin's holiday camps, said that it had received several approaches but it did not expect to find one buyer for all the hotels. Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said the sale of all the hotels would take several years. He expected to sell one or two hotels before the end of the financial year in October, with a few more being sold the following year. City estimates of the total value of the hotels - five in London and 17 in the provinces - range from Pounds 300m to Pounds 350m. Rank will retain more than 30 other hotels which are linked to operations such as Butlin's and the Shearings coach holiday business. Mr Gifford said the sale would help the group reduce net debt from 64 per cent of shareholders' funds at the end of the last financial year to 50 per cent. Rank's shares rose 13p on the announcement, closing at 739p. The view in the City was that the relatively expensive hotels did not fit in well with Rank's other businesses, which tend to cater to the mass market. Mr Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson said the hotel business was one in which Rank was 'a mile wide and an inch deep. They're not a major player in hotels and they're unlikely to become one. They will be able to concentrate on those businesses in which they're committed to growing.' He said the sale of the provincial hotels was likely to prove difficult. Other groups, including Forte, have provincial hotels for sale. The number of establishments on the market has been swollen by hotels that have gone into receivership. Interest in the London hotels - the Athenaeum, the Glou-cester, the Royal Garden, the Royal Lancaster and the White House - is expected to come from outside the UK. Hotel analysts said any number of US, European or Asian companies might be interested in increasing their presence in London. Mr Slattery said: 'Every international hotel group has got a map somewhere in its office with a flag stuck into London.' Lex, Page 20</p>

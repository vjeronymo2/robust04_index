			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Survey reveals S Australia's 'staggering' mineral wealth MINING COMPANIES are expected to spend ADollars 25m (Pounds 11m) exploring the state of South Australia in the next 12 months following the revelation that, according to Mr Ross Fardon, director-general at the department of mines and energy, some of the most abundant mineral resources are to be found there under shallow cover. He says the state has the potential to rank alongside Western Australia, Chile and South Africa in the mining industry. This follows a ADollars 16m geological survey - one of the most comprehensive ever seen in the western world - carried out by the state government. The survey was needed because two-thirds of South Australia is covered by soil and sands which hide the mineral-bearing bedrock. However, advanced aeromagnetic surveys are able to penetrate this cover. 'The results are staggering,' says Mr Fardon. 'We've discovered bedrock terrains under shallow cover, which are equivalent to those containing the giant mineral deposits at Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Olympic Dam, all world-class deposits.' About 500,000 square kilometres, an area the size of Spain, are being mapped and tied in with other high-quality data and the details are being made available at very little cost to exploration companies. Mr Fardon is at present on a three-week tour of Europe and South Africa to spread the word. 'We would welcome foreign expertise and money.' So far about 30 per cent of the survey data has been released and applications for exploration licences have trebled in the first eight months of this year. The early data also sparked a diamond rush after aeromagnetic and radiometric pictures revealed about 60 geological 'bubbles' which closely resemble diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes. 'We could be sitting on diamond resources comparable to the world's biggest diamond mine at Argyle in Western Australia,' says Mr Fardon enthusiastically. About 10 companies have started a diamond search and are expected to spend about ADollars 2m this year. They include De Beers' local subsidiary Stockdale, CRA, Ashton Mining, and Poseidon. The department of mines believes that the region could contain deposits of gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, nickel, chromium and tin in addition to diamonds. The main focus of interest is the Gawler Craton, a huge geological block that stretches over the Eyre Peninsula and north beyond Coober Pedy. Mr Fardon says: 'Foreign companies are welcome in their own right but we would prefer them to joint venture with an Australian company. And to acquire tenements they must have a registered company in Australia'.</p>

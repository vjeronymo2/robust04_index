			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / As they say in Europe: Italian comic opera and Russian world-weariness - How others view their budget problems EVERY YEAR in Sicily there is an event which outsiders find, to say the least, unattractive. Tuna fish are driven ashore through a complex system of nets and then bludgeoned to death. It is la mattanza, and now the word has been recycled by the Italian press to describe the present, rather attractive, settling of accounts with a corrupt political class. In Russia the mattanza is quite different. There a single figure, widely seen as a symbol of righteousness, is slowly bludgeoned to death by the remnants of a corrupt political class. Pravda represents the Remnant Party and has its own point of view, arguing 'the conflict had flared up between the president and society' (my italics). Moscow watchers spend little time on Pravda nowadays, far less than when it was boring. Today it combines anti-Yeltsinism with 19th century xenophobic pan-Slavism and Bolshevik nostalgia, and, as a result, offers stimulating and exciting insights. It recently argued that the Americans were plotting to keep Russia out of international arms markets: 'They will start promising us 'tips' such as the notorious Dollars 24bn, (the western aid package agreed last year) and on this pretext will press the foreign ministry to block impending Russian weapons sales where western corporations have key interests.' Pravda also says that the west is trying to split Russia, so it fabricates lies about 'a reforming president against a conservative-communist congress.' Next the west will back the imposition of a state of emergency by Boris Yeltsin. But to return to the original theme - is it the parallels or differences between Russia and Italy that are the more striking? In both, people believe that their country is on the point of breaking up. In both there is, not surprisingly, a widespread conviction that the native way of doing things is far from ideal. On the other hand the Italians take their present difficulties to their hearts, they glory in the parade of public figures through the prisons and courts and revel in the revelations, as it were. No Italian would blame foreigners for what has gone wrong. Some Russians, on the other hand, do blame others but seem to take the crisis in their stride: the papers write as if hyper-inflation, the collapse of the state, the break-up of the nation, the impossibility of achieving good government, were the norm. To the Italians, 1993 is opera, grand or comic. To the Russians, it is a bore. But both at least make headlines in the newspapers of the rest of the continent which in turn react passionately. Thus the Catholic Daily in Poland, which would normally object to Russians of the Yeltsin type, sees him as a Christ-figure: 'The west contributed to the shower of stones that poured on the Russian president's head.' The Germans sneer heavily at the Italians. But every country in Europe, not just Italy and Russia, is in trouble, yet these two interest newspapers across the continent which are otherwise more than usually insular. One of those troubled lands, Britain, suffered its annual budget this week and so there was the usual outpouring of words in the local media that no event short of civil war could occasion on the domestic news pages of other lands. The French were struck by two items, one reflected the widening psychological gulf between Britain and the rest, the other the shrinking physical gulf. They pointed out that when the time comes to implement the third stage of European Monetary Union, the British budget deficit will still amount to 6 per cent of gross domestic output - double the Maastricht Treaty target. This insight was not picked up in Britain because there the Treaty is taken seriously only in parliament, which is a way of saying it is not taken seriously. Norman Lamont's plan to cut journey times from Dover and Heathrow to central London was the other issue for the French. Their reaction was reassuring - the proposed high-speed rail links were seen as a means of getting to the British capital more quickly. Recent French comment has stressed the desirability of travelling rapidly in the opposite direction. Less interesting, but far more important, than Lamont's budget was the conclusion of the German Solidarity Pact at the weekend - or Bonnspeak for higher taxes in the west to pay off the Ossies. This was an event of Europe-wide significance which therefore occupied little space in the British media. But what is striking about all recent budgets, proposed budgets, Solidarity Pacts and whatever is the view that higher taxation provides a solution to current problems. Except in Russia and Italy. In both these countries the forces of common sense and rationality demand spending cuts. Why is it that the sanity of the 1980s is thought relevant only in those countries which have gone mad?

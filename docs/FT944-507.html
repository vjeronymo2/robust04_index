			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Traffic study not defective Sir, I write as an author of the report by the standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment (Sactra) on induced traffic, as a consultant who assisted the department of transport with the development of its motorway tolling policy, and as a member of the consultancy team researching congestion charging in London. Your editorial on December 21, 'Sanity on the roads', was admirable in many respects, but contained some misunderstandings. First, not all road schemes will induce significant amounts of extra traffic. Our report defined the circumstances where induced traffic is most likely to occur: essentially, where congestion is high, where traffic demand is sensitive to changes in travel costs, and where the proposed scheme would result in a large reduction in travel costs. Individual schemes in rural areas may not induce much extra traffic. It is, therefore, incorrect to say that all road schemes should induce extra traffic. Some do, some do not. Second, the committee was asked by the government to advise on induced traffic, and this it has done. It is surely unfair to claim the report is defective because it does not fit the debate you wish to stimulate. Third, however laudable your argument may be that motorists should pay a true economic cost for their use of the road system, this is not the philosophy underlying the government's motorway tolling policy. This policy is designed to raise funds for the direct use of the department of transport for promoting further road improvements. The intention is to pitch the tolls at levels which will keep the traffic diversions away from the motorways onto less safe, more congested and more environmentally sensitive local roads to acceptably low levels. Notwithstanding this, I applaud your effort to stimulate an intelligent debate about transport policy.

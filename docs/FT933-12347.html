			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: French bid to scare speculators The Bank of France took the initiative in the defence of the franc yesterday when it raised the French 24 hour lending rate and joined the Bundesbank in verbal and monetary support of the French currency, writes Stephanie Flanders. The French authorities announced the 2.25 per cent rate hike early in the day, raising the official overnight rate to 10 per cent from the previous level of 7.75 per cent. This was followed by a day of frequent and open purchases of the franc by both the French and German central banks. By the end of trading, a concerted official effort to keep the franc from falling below Ffr3.418 against the D-Mark appeared to have worked. In London, the French currency closed at Ffr3.416, a little stronger than Thursday's close of Ffr3.419, but still little more than a centime above its ERM floor of Ffr3.4305. On balance, few in the market thought that there would be a realignment of the ERM over the weekend, despite rumours of emergency EC monetary committee sessions which were quickly denied. For many, the fact that the Bank of France did not feel able to raise any other official rates showed that the underlying cause of the crisis, too high real interest rates, remained. 'The market's mood is still very negative towards the ERM,' said Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London. 'The interest rate hikes that we've seen this week from a number of countries are generally judged to be counter productive and unsustainable against a background of deteriorating economic conditions.' Other recently embattled ERM currencies saw a similar easing of pressure. The Spanish peseta closed at Pta79.63, a little up on Thursday's Pta79.84, and the Portuguese escudo similarly held its own, closing at Esc99.85 against the D-Mark compared with the previous day's Esc100.25. Less fortunate was the Danish krone, which lurched down towards its ERM floor once again, closing at around Dkr3.8942 against the German currency compared with a previous finish of Dkr3.8805. By the end of the week's trading, the Danish currency had once again taken the French franc's place at the bottom of the ERM currency grid, just above its floor rate against the D-Mark of Dkr3.9016. Meanwhile the yen strengthened, partly as a result of the European tensions. The Japanese currency rose sharply across the board for much of the day, but later retreated. It closed at Y159.75 against the pound, up from the previous Y161.00, and nearly half a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at Y62.11.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: They died with their football boots on - War and Peace (Playing fields and battlefields) / Simon Kuper says football is politics by other means The great Dutch manager Rinus Michels once said that football was war. After El Salvador and Honduras met in three controversial matches in 1969, the tanks rolled in. But more often, countries play football as an alternative to war. It seems that many people all over the world see life as a permanent battle for status between 200-odd nations. But football is by far the most direct way of ranking. Recently, I spent a year travelling the world to write a book* about football and politics. In Argentina, I spoke to an army general named Enciso, who recalled the night that Argentina won the World Cup in 1978: 'All the country was on the streets. Radicals embraced with Peronists, Catholics with Protestants and with Jews, and all had only one flag: the flag of Argentina]' I asked if he could compare this to the Falklands War, when the crowds filled the streets of Buenos Aires again. 'Exactly]' said Enciso. 'It was exactly the same]' So much so that the World Cup song, 'Vamos Argentina. Vamos a Ganar' (Go on Argentina, Go and Win) was cranked out again during the war. When Maradona's 'hand-of-God' goal put the English out of the 1986 World Cup, most Argentines felt the victory pretty much cancelled out defeat in war. Things may change when Croatia first play Yugoslavia, but the biggest grudge match in Europe remains the Netherlands against Germany. When the Dutch beat the Germans in Hamburg in 1988, 9m Dutchmen, or 60 per cent of the population, took to the streets to celebrate. Although it was a Tuesday night, it was the biggest public gathering since the liberation. A former resistance fighter went on TV to say: 'It feels as though we've won the war at last', and the Dutch poet Jules Deelder wrote of Marco van Basten's winning goal: 'Those who fell rose cheering from their graves.' On that night the decades seemed to fall away. The Germans still wore eagles on their chests; the Dutch players were the resistance, and the Germans the Wehrmacht. These comparisons are absurd, but they occurred to most Dutchmen. Vrij Nederland, a magazine that began as an underground news-sheet during the German occupation, interviewed the Dutch full-back Berry van Aerle: 'In the match against Germany, you pulled the injured Voller's hair.' (The Dutch have a particular dislike for the German striker Rudi Voller.) 'Did I pull his hair? I can't remember that. I patted him on the head. I didn't pull his hair.' 'No?' 'No. I patted him on the head and he got angry. I don't know why either. He reacted quite strangely; he suddenly jumped up to chase after me, but when Ronald stopped him he fell again and started rolling about. I thought that was strange behaviour.' Both the journalist and Van Aerle knew what really happened, but a resistance fighter never discusses his heroics. He hints at them, using irony. As well as Wehrmacht against resistance, Hamburg was also a reversal of the invasion: an orange-clad Dutch army numbering tens of thousands drove its cars into Germany and defeated the inhabitants. (In the era of regular England-Scotland games, the Scots would conquer London for the day.) People in the Netherlands sang: 'In 1940 they came. In 1988 we came, Holadiay, Holadio.' The Ukrainians remember a similar game during the German occupation. Outside the Dynamo Stadium in Kiev, there is a statue that depicts four men, all 10ft tall, who stand arm in arm gazing into the distance. They are wearing shorts so you know that they are a monument to a football match. The Germans arranged a match against Dynamo Kiev. The spectators were all German soldiers with machine-guns, and when the Ukrainians took the lead the soldiers began to fire at their legs. Though several players went down, Dynamo hung on to win. After the final whistle the whole team was executed. It was, in short, Escape to Victory with an unhappy end. A famous Soviet film was made of the match, and the actor who played the goalkeeper looked so much the part that a club offered him a contract. Sadly, the story is a myth concocted after the war by the local Communist Party. No doubt some kind of game did take place, for one survivor still lives in Kiev, but sensibly he remains silent. The Germans really began to get over the war in 1954. That year, West Germany was re-admitted to the World Cup, and won it. Friederich Christian Delius, a pastor's son and author of the autobiographical novel, The Sunday I won the World Cup, says: 'The time of defeat was past; from now on victory was the aim.' Many of the players had fought in the war or been taken prisoner. as Delius writes: 'Never again would a German team be so representative of the nation.' As the journalist Brian Glanville has noted, the former England manager Bobby Robson was obsessed with the world wars. But this did not give him an overriding desire to beat the Germans (even though England fans like to sing, 'Two world wars and one world cup, doo-dah, doo-dah]' at German supporters). Rather, the first and second world wars shaped the way Robson picked his players. He told Pete Davies, author of All Played Out, about his captain Bryan Robson: 'You could put him in any trench and know he'd be the first over the top . . . he wouldn't think, well, Christ, if I put my head up there it might get shot off. He'd say: 'C'mon, over the top.'' Robson may have had in mind the first world war officers who would start a 'push' by kicking a football out of the trench and chasing after it. Robson is typical of British managers. People talking about football tend to draw their metaphors from one of two fields: art or war. Brazilian football has 'the rhythm of samba', and the British have 'fighting spirit'. British managers almost always compare football to war, and the players they favour are like soldiers: fearless, hardworking men who never question their superiors. As Robson said, when he was reluctant to play the prodigy Paul Gascoigne: 'You have to be utterly reliable.' Soldiers are reliable, artists are not. I realised just how much war can seem like football when I met another, more senior, Argentine general, whom I shall call Sanchez. We were sitting in the building of the Supreme Council of the Argentine Armed Forces, the highest military organ in Argentina, and the setting was comic-book South America. The building is shrouded by palm trees, guarded by soldiers with machine-guns and moustaches. Sanchez is a tall, thin man with a military moustache (no surprises there) who looks like Enoch Powell. He had primed himself for our meeting: he was carrying two files, one containing his incidental writings on football, and the other his book on football tactics. Written in 1951, it had never been published, and what he had in the file was the original, yellowed, typed manuscript. He was nervous: he had walked around with his ideas in these dusty files for 40 years, and here was someone who wanted to know. It was why he had overcome his instinctive fear of the media to speak to me. 'If my team is concentrated on this small piece of paper,' Sanchez gesticulated, 'and the opposition is spread out over that big file, then I will have superior numbers in the crucial areas. You must have a force that is compact, organised, and moving forward.' I suggested that his ideas on football rang somewhat military. 'No, it's not military,' he snapped, before adding: 'The principles of war can be applied to anything.' I suspected that he had done things the other way around: that he had applied his footballing theories to military strategy, rather than vice versa. It was chilling to listen to: old men all over the world expound half-baked coaching manual wisdoms, but here was one who might use them on the battlefield. Football against the Enemy, by Simon Kuper, Orion, Pounds 9.99, is the 1994 William Hill sports book of the year.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Fears grow of sharp rise in refugee numbers MRS SADAKO OGATA, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is due to meet warring national leaders in Sarajevo today as continuing clashes heighten fears the Bosnian refugee crisis could escalate further. Some 1m people have been uprooted from their homes in four months of fighting between Serb and Bosnian forces. Ms Judith Kumin, the Belgrade representative of the UNHCR, said: 'The number of refugees from Bosnia is increasing dramatically every day. We are very concerned that it will continue. People who are now trapped in siege towns will leave the minute they have to chance to seek safety. 'If Moslems continue to be forced from Serb-controlled territories, and Serbs from regions controlled by Moslems, then the number of refugees will be practically without limit.' Serbs forces, which control more than half of Bosnian territory, are driving out Moslems from eastern Bosnia in a policy of 'ethnic cleansing'. Fighting eased yesterday in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital besieged by Serb forces. UN officials said that by mid-afternoon 15 relief flights had arrived in the capital. They hope to fly in some 200 tonnes per day to feed some 380,000 people trapped with little food and medicines. Serb militias opposed to Bosnian independence yesterday fought against mainly Croat and Moslem Bosnian forces around Brcko and Derventa, northern Bosnia, according to Croatian radio. Belgrade radio said Serb forces had clashed with Croat forces in Kupres, Hercegovina, where the Croats have launched an offensive. More than 7,500 people have been killed in Bosnia since it was widely recognised as independent from Yugoslavia in April. Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for UN peacekeepers, yesterday said 93 prisoners were exchanged between Serb and Bosnian forces in the first UN-sponsored exchange.</p>

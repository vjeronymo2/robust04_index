Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Policy Andrzej  Baczkowski, present at the meeting, expressed his hope at a  press conference in Gdansk that the establishment of the  commission would be possible in January. He also declared that  by January 7 the government would take stands on all agreements  concluded with Solidarity.    Baczkowski also said that the draft privatization law  included in the enterprise pact is in the last stage of  interministerial consultations. He added that the government  would seek a consensus with trade unions about concrete  legislative solutions and not the trade unions' opinion on the  final version of the draft. Matters of argument could be  presented to the Sejm along with the draft law, he said.    Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski termed the draft  budget law as "conflict-prone" while not taking into account  "dynamic methods of compensating for rises in costs of living"  in view of planned rises in energy prices and rents. According  to him, the rules of the so called social safety net should be  clearly defined before the adoption of the budget law.</p>

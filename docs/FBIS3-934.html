This follows reports that the election candidate list of  General Constand Viljoen's newly-founded Freedom Front would be  submitted on Wednesday. Several CP MP's names are expected to  be on the list, widely seen as precipitating a split in CP ranks.    Dr Hartzenberg said in terms of the party's constitution,  any  CP member who became a member of another political party and  making himself available as candidate in the elections  automatically excluded himself from CP membership.    This conduct would be in conflict with a unanimous decision  by the CP executive that the polls would be boycotted, he said.    Termination of membership would automatically result in  these  members losing access to CP facilities and assets, he added.</p>

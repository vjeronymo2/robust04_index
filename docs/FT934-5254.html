			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (31): One is now a better person PERSONAL IMPACT: THE ART OF GOOD COMMUNICATION by Michael Shea Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.99 196 pages The bookshops of the world, claims Michael Shea, former press secretary to the Queen, overflow with personal improvement texts of highly questionable quality. Quite so. Shea's own addition to some already groaning shelves is a disappointing effort in which the blindingly obvious has been dressed up in dubious jargon designed to grace it with some authority. His work is hailed by the publishers as a manual bursting with hints intended to improve the reader's personal impact in a 'media democracy' where all-important impressions are formed and fixed in 15 seconds. So never slouch, don't fiddle, don't ramble, avoid sweaty palms and don't get too close if you've got halitosis. Shea begins profoundly, by suggesting that the most successful people in corporate and public life are those who know best how to communicate. He then conjures up three characters who he subjects to a series of career challenges, ranging from job interviews to public speaking and media interviews. John Hustle is brash, pushy and glib with 'a carpet salesman's answer to everything' while Alan Grey is quiet, a little scruffy and a bit of a non-entity. David Wright is the clever-clogs of the bunch, smiling agreeably, well-groomed and oozing confidence. He is presented as 'the man most likely to' but is likely to be about as popular around the office as a time-and-motion study expert. Here is a book stuffed full of paralanguage, eyelock, language acquisition devices and inter-personal communication techniques. Cut away the technospeak and what do you get? If you are addressing an audience and people look puzzled, you have to say more; if they are upright and alert, you can rest assured you have their attention. If you want to get the low-down on someone in order to work out how best to interact with them, then study their handbags, suits, necklines and beards (hopefully not all found on the same person). Anyone who is still trawling up the infamous pre-election television debate between sweaty, shady Richard Nixon and John F Kennedy Shea, the president-to-be with 'the tingle-tongue taste' smile, in order to demonstrate the dangers of television, must be in dire trouble. The author calls in aid everyone from Demosthenes to Talleyrand and, in a more contemporary - though no more relevant - vein, the likes of Michael Jackson, Maddona and Mrs Thatcher to drive home his messages. He ends with 'form reports' on public figures like Labour leader John Smith ('flat and boring' paralanguage), John Harvey-Jones ('very colourful ties') and Jeremy Paxman ('supercilious, arrogant, almost facetious'). Very perceptive. Shea says his is not a 'how to' book but more a reference chart which may be useful in developing your overall impact. He claims the skills set out can make the difference between success and a life of missed opportunities. The overriding impression left, however, is that anyone who requires such fundamental advice can't really believe they have a hope in hell of aspiring to be stand-in chauffeur, never mind chief executive.</p>

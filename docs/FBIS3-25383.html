A  statement released to ZNBC [Zambia National Broadcasting  Corporation] today by the government says the WEEKLY POST  illegally obtained and published a memorandum from the president  to Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Remmy Mushota without  authorization. The memo was published with intent to mislead  the nation.    According to the statement, the first part of the memo was  the president's comment on General Miyanda's performance in a  television program. The second part was referring to an unnamed  individual in the media who was making it difficult for the  government to disseminate information.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Renison in deal to explore for titanium in Ukraine Renison Goldfields, the Australian mining company in which Britain's Hanson group holds a 40 per cent stake, has signed an exclusive agreement covering exploration for titanium mineral deposits in Ukraine. The agreement has been signed with Ukraine Joint Stock Company 'MFS', which, in turn, has been authorised by the Ukrainian State Committee on Geology (Goskom), to represent its interests in the development of deposits in the area. Certain tailing deposits, associated with existing Ukrainian heavy mineral production operations, are also covered by the agreement. According to Renison, these 'appear to contain commercial quantities and grades of ilmenite'. RGC, which started to look at the potential for developing Ukrainian mineral sands last June, said there were 'a number of prospects, previously explored by Goskom, which show the potential for large-scale commercial development'. A drilling programme is scheduled to start in the December quarter. News of the Ukrainian agreement came as Renison told shareholders at its annual meeting that most of the company's operations had continued to trade profitably in the current financial year - the exception being Renison Tin, which had a production shortfall. Renison moved into the black in the second half of 1993-94 after two years of losses.</p>

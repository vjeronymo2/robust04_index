			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Observer: On target After a week of stylish farewells to the town that first welcomed him as a junior international banking officer back in 1955, Sir William Purves left Hong Kong last night bound for London, from where, in accordance with the wishes of the Bank of England, he will now run HSBC Holdings. His last public act was at a luncheon at the Foreign Correspondents' Club. All other ceremonies had proceeded smoothly, but the normally unflappable Purves began to look a little queasy as club president Philip Bowring kicked off his introduction by mentioning the 1982 Carrian property scandal. Recalling a confidential memorandum of a meeting between Sir John Bembridge, Hong Kong's gruff and tough financial secretary of the day, and a Malaysian government investigator, Bowring told how Bembridge had roundly libelled many of the colony's great and good implicated in the scandal. Purves's name had, of course, come up, Bowring related to a hushed audience. 'Honest' had been Bembridge's summary appraisal. Sir William's integrity has long been a legend in a town notorious for sharp practice. At a farewell for him and Lady Becky earlier in the week, Gordon Wu, managing director of construction group Hopewell Holdings, who has known him for more than 20 years, spoke of a great loss to Hong Kong. 'He's as straight as an arrow,' Wu added. Nervous staff at the London headquarters, who have heard also of his irascibility, are presumably even now burnishing their shields.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DICKERSON MAY RETIRE AFTER 1990 SEASON  </P> <P> The Colts' Eric Dickerson, slowed by a hamstring injury the last three weeks  and held to only 35 yards in a 14-3 loss at Denver on Sunday, says he is  considering retirement from football when his contract expires after the 1990  season.  </P> <P> Dickerson, 29, who earlier this season became only the seventh player in NFL  history to rush for 10,000 or more career yards, made the comment Monday night  on the Arsenio Hall television talk show.  </P> <P> "I've been thinking about it awhile," Dickerson told Hall. "After this season,  I have one year left. I'll play that for sure. But even if they offered me a  new contract, I don't think I'd sign it right now."  </P> <P> Dickerson, who moved to Indianapolis in a trade with the Rams early in the 1987  season, has carried the ball 115 times for 481 yards and three touchdowns this  year. Last year, with 1,659 yards, he was the NFL rushing leader for the fourth  time in his six-year career.  </P> <P> He has 10,396 career yards.  </P></p>

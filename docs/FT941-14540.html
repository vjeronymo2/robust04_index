			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Minister confident on drugs battle Fears that the first year of the single market would provide opportunities for drugs smuggling have been disproved, Sir John Cope, paymaster-general, said yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes. Sir John, the minister responsible for customs, said: 'after this first year it is clear that our anti-smuggling controls, together with intelligence-based strategies, have maintained effectiveness in the fight against drugs.' Cannabis seizures rose 19 per cent in 1992-93 to a record 53 tons, with a street value of pounds 176m. Synthetic drug seizures rose 215 per cent to 1,097kg with a street value of pounds 133m. seizures of heroin increased by 25 per cent to 562kg (pounds 98m). The number of people arrested in the uk as a result of international drug operations rose 29 per cent to 3,302 and resulted in 69 smuggling gangs being smashed. But cocaine seizures fell 33 per cent from the record 2,250kg in 1992 to 748kg.</p>

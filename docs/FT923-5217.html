			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mondadori lifts parent company profits MONDADORI, the Italian publishing group controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest concern, confirmed its continuing recovery by raising parent company profits before tax and extraordinary items to L22bn (Dollars 20.4m) in the first half of this year, against a loss of L13.7bn in the same period last year, writes Haig Simonian. Results at subsidiary companies, which had lost L9.2bn in the first half of 1991, also improved sharply, with pre-tax earnings rising to L19bn in the first six months of this year. Consolidated sales for the group, which was subject to a battle for control between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Carlo De Benedetti, rose by 16.9 per cent to L837bn. Net debt at Mondadori fell to L59.8bn from L96.6bn. Fininvest controls almost 90 per cent of the group.</p>

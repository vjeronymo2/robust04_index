Tihomir Vinkovic  reports for Croatian Radio:    [Vinkovic] Upon arrival at Zagreb aiport Ambassador Albright  told journalists there were three reasons for her visit to  Croatia: First is the stand of the American Administration that  there is no justification of aggression, war crimes, and  thwarting dispatch of humanitarian aid. The American  Administration supports the sovereignty and the territorial  integrity of the Republic of Croatia. Currently occupied  Croatian territories have to be returned in a peaceful way and  through a political solution, ambassador Albright said. The  U.S. Government will support efforts for the restoration of  peace and dispatch of humanitarian aid, particularly in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In the course of her visit to Croatia Ambassador Albright is  to meet President Tudjman, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate  Granic, representatives of the UN Protection Forces, UN High  Commissioner for Refugees, and other humanitarian organizations.</p>

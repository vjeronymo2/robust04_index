			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Ireland makes SFr150m private placement THE Republic of Ireland's continuing foreign currency borrowing programme provided the highlight of yesterday's international bonds activity. Ireland made what should be its last appearance of the year in the Swiss franc market with a SFr150m eight-year private placement through Swiss Bank Corp, which says the 6 1/2 per cent coupon is broadly in line with the republic's two other recent transactions in that market. These were for a total of SFr250m over 10 years. While Ireland's foreign currency reserves are thought to have survived the recent currency dramas in better shape than those of many of its European neighbours, the republic has also recently issued two 10-year bonds, raising a total of DM500m over 10 years. Two minor capped and collared deals dominated what US dollar activity there was. Lehman Brothers announced a Dollars 100m 10-year floating rate note for Credit Local de France, to take advantage of what it described as the demand for discounted FRNs from top quality credits. The interest rate will be set at 25 basis points below six-month Libor, with a collar of 5 per cent and cap of 8 1/4 per cent. Credit Suisse First Boston reopened a cap and collar 10-year FRN for Banque Nationale de Paris, issuing a further Dollars 75m tranche. It was priced at 99.75, compared with par for the original Dollars 150m in late September. The spate of issues by Mexican borrowers continues with a Dollars 150m five-year bond issue from Consorcio Grupo Dina, Mexico's largest truck manufacturer. Salomon Brothers will price the issue today at a spread of 450-475 basis points over comparable US Treasury bonds and target the issue at high yield accounts in Europe and the Far East. While there is some criticism of this sector centring on the recent volume of supply, bankers involved are arguing that institutional demand is growing to reflect the broader Mexican corporate supply. The growth in supply means that spreads are widening and that the buyers can afford to be more discriminating, they say.</p>

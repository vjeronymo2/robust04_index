			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / CBI chief slams training policy THE UK's record on training is 'one of the worst in the developed world', Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said yesterday. Mr Davies said this was not because of a lack of funding, but because neither the government nor industry made the best use of training resources. Delivering the first in a series of lectures organised by the London School of Economics and the Social Market Foundation, an independent think-tank, he called for Britain's training system to become more market-oriented. The CBI favours linking the funding of all post-16 training and education to individual trainees. It believes doing so would create a more flexible system, foster personal responsibility and force training providers to be more accountable to their customers, so enhancing quality and choice. Mr Davies also said British companies should be more ready to reward the results of vocational training. Pay differentials between skilled and unskilled labour were smaller in the UK than in Germany or France. Mr Davies said: 'Employers themselves are giving mixed and confusing signals about the qualifications they value.' He said research in England and Wales showed that males with vocational qualifications equivalent to National Vocational Qualifications at level 2 could be expected to earn significantly less than their counterparts with GCSEs.</p>

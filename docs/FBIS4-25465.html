			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 7 June (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According  to an authoritative person, to bring the economy in line with  the international economy, China will allow the entry of foreign  capital into service and trade sectors, including banking,  insurance, accounting and auditing, medical care and insurance,  advertising, petroleum-related services, property development,  and transport.    Moreover, it also will allow investment of foreign capital,  in the form of Sino-foreign joint ventures, in the following  nine services, including technological measurement and analysis  services and related scientific and technological consultancy;  equipment maintenance and support services related to  agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries; computer  system design; and repair services for office facilities and  equipment. Meanwhile, it will also allow foreign capital to  invest in the construction, transformation, and operation of  hotels and restaurants in the form of Sino-foreign joint  ventures.    In commercial retail trade, China has agreed that Beijing,  Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, Qingdao, and the five  special economic zones may each trial-launch one or two  Sino-foreign joint-venture or cooperative commercial retail  enterprises. In foreign trade, China has decided to allow  foreign businessmen to engage in entrepot trade in the bonded  zone of Shanghai's New Pudong district and to become agents for  the import and export business of foreign-invested enterprises  in the zone, and it has also decided to conduct experiments in  developing joint-venture projects in scientific publishing and  economic information publishing. China will also allow foreign  capital to set up representative offices for legal services in  China and to set up taxation service representative offices in  the country's economically developed regions. This move will be  conducive to China's resumption of GATT membership and entry to  the World Trade Organization.</p>

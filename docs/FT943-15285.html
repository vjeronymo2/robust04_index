			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Solchaga takes up his pen Spain's former economy 'supremo' Carlos Solchaga, 50, who quit as parliamentary spokesman for the ruling socialist party two months ago, is determined to keep his name in the news, writes Tom Burns. He has been hired by Expansion, Spain's leading business newspaper, as chairman of its advisory editorial board and pens his first column in today's issue. Industry minister between 1982 and 1985 and then promoted to economy and finance minister, a post he held until he left the cabinet last year, Solchaga played a pivotal part in many of Spain's key domestic decisions in the past decade. He gave the green light to partial privatisations and took the peseta into the EMS. He was unpopular with the trade unions for social spending cut-backs, with business for maintaining high interest rates and with the international markets - which forced three peseta devaluations during his last year as minister. However, in May, Solchaga received the unkindest cut when the former governor of the Bank of Spain, Mariano Rubio, whom he had appointed, admitted tax evasion. Solchaga (below) did the honourable thing and resigned from active politics. By taking up the offer made to him by Expansion, a newspaper in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, has a shareholding, he becomes the most prominent Spanish politician so far to switch trenches and become a journalist.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWRENCE'S BIG GAME, BIG CHOICE HAVEN'T MADE FOR BIG PRESSURE  </P> <P> Not long from now, Teddy Lawrence will step into a world where the players are  a little faster, a little stronger, a little bigger and a little better.  </P> <P> And everybody will expect a lot.  </P> <P> Lawrence is the quarterback of the Morse football team, the team many think is  the best in San Diego County history.  </P> <P> Morse is a team of good players, but Teddy Lawrence is something altogether  different.  </P> <P> When he runs, spectators smile, even shake their heads. He has been a starter  for three seasons, two at quarterback and one at defensive back. His teammates  sometimes watch him from the sidelines, chuckle, slap each other on the  shoulder pads and say: "Look at Teddy."  </P> <P> His coach, John Shacklett, worries when Lawrence stands in punt formation. That  isn't because he doubts Lawrence's ability to kick the ball. It is because  Lawrence is such a crafty runner that sometimes he decides to scrap the punt  and take off up the field. That makes a coach's heart jump, even though  Lawrence hardly ever gets caught.  </P> <P> Saturday night Lawrence will play the final high school game of his career when  the Tigers (13-0) take on Orange Glen (9-4) in the 3-A championship at San  Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Really, Lawrence and his teammates have less to gain  than they do to lose. Few expect Orange Glen to win.  </P> <P> After the big game, there will be the college recruiters, the ones Shacklett  diligently kept away from Lawrence until the season is over. These are the men  who will use every ounce of persuasion they possess to put Lawrence in their  school's uniform. They will play a part in taking the kid out of Teddy Lawrence  and helping him graduate to adulthood.  </P> <P> Lawrence has pared his choices down to six: UCLA, USC, Stanford, Washington,  Michigan State and Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Stanford looks pretty good to him. Up to now, the Stanford coaches are the only  ones he has met. Besides, Stanford is closer to home than Washington, Michigan  State and Notre Dame, and it's not in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mom, Kathy,  doesn't like Los Angeles. It scares her, although she says it probably wouldn't  scare Teddy.  </P> <P> With the big decision ahead, and the big game Saturday, Lawrence should be  feeling some extra weight on his shoulders.  </P> <P> But that's what is odd. He is a high school senior, and he is worried about the  same things that all other high school seniors are worried about. Football, in  high school, college, or otherwise, is the least of his concerns. He knows how  to play football.  </P> <P> It is the rest of growing up that makes him uncertain -- leaving his friends,  leaving Morse, leaving San Diego and leaving his mom.  </P> <P> "I've never been on my own, really," he said. "I don't know what to expect. I'm  excited, but I'm also scared."  </P> <P> Football should help. It doesn't bother him that the class of competition will  be so much higher.  </P> <P> "If anything, I feel more secure going out because I'll have guys on the team  that I can be around that can help me out," he said. "If I was just going in as  a regular student, I would be on my own and have to go out and basically do  everything on my own."  </P> <P> Lawrence isn't easily rattled by anything that happens on the football field.  If there was ever a time for that to happen, it would have been last weekend,  when Morse trailed Chula Vista, 28-13, at halftime in the 3-A semifinal.  Suddenly, the season looked as if it might be a week shorter than planned.  </P> <P> Sitting in the locker room, waiting to return to the field, Lawrence had to  tell teammate after teammate that he was OK. Players kept approaching and  urging him to settle down. That puzzled him.  </P> <P> "I wasn't really worried," he said. "Everybody else was worried about me. They  thought I was going to break down in the second half. They didn't think I was  going to come through. Everybody was just coming over telling me to settle  down, but I don't know why. I didn't feel any pressure or anything. I didn't  feel like I couldn't come back in the second half and do better."  </P> <P> He hadn't done well in the first half, not by Teddy Lawrence standards. He made  two errant pitches on option plays and had one pass intercepted. Maybe that's  why everybody was worried. It isn't often that he makes mistakes.  </P> <P> Anyway, things were back to normal in the second half. Morse came back, tied  the game, 28-28, and then Lawrence ran 44 yards for the winning touchdown.  </P> <P> Lawrence says he never gets nervous in difficult situations. A put-on? No, says  Shacklett. As someone once said about Joe Montana, Lawrence is as cool as the  other side of the pillow. The publicity doesn't appear to faze him.  </P> <P> "I really don't think he does get that affected by it," Shacklett said. "I  think, to be honest, Teddy prefers to keep a low profile. He's very quiet,  especially with people he's not familiar with."  </P> <P> Maybe that's why he's uncomfortable when his mom brags about him. One time, she  was buying him a pair of cleats and the salesman asked him what team he plays  for.  </P> <P> "Morse," he said.  </P> <P> Then Kathy spoke up.  </P> <P> "This is Teddy Lawrence," she said, the way a proud mom will say those things.  </P> <P> Teddy cringed, the way a son does when he is embarrassed by his mother.  </P> <P> "I was like, 'Oh, don't be doin' this,' " he said. "I hate when she does that.  She's not humble like me."  </P> <P> Other times, it's hard to be humble. Shacklett has him run the scout team in  practice so he doesn't disrupt things. He can be a real clown.  </P> <P> Yet he can also be serious, such as when he plans for his future in college  football. Lawrence, 5-feet-9, 175, has decided he will switch from quarterback  to either defensive back or wide receiver. He wants to play a position that  will help him get a crack at the NFL, and he doesn't think quarterback will do  that.  </P> <P> If you think he's shy, put yourself in the place of a college recruiter and try  telling him you want him to come to your school to play quarterback. He'll tell  you to forget it. That's what he did to Notre Dame.  </P> <P> "He can be stubborn," Shacklett said. "He is a very strong-willed person and he  has a very strong self image. He knows what he wants to do."  </P> <P> So when someone from Notre Dame called and said something like, "How about  playing quarterback for us?" he gave his answer immediately.  </P> <P> "He said, 'No,' " Shacklett said. "Right then. Boom. He'll tell Notre Dame  that. He'll tell the Pope that. He'll tell anybody."  </P> <P> That is his tough side. The other side is the one his mom sees, the one who  comes home from practice, goes straight to the refrigerator and says: "Hey mom,  we ain't got nothin' to eat."  </P> <P> He is still a high school kid.  </P> <P> He will be for one more game.  </P></p>

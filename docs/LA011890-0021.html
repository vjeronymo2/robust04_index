			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: 'ALTERNATIVE' AGRICULTURE IS GAINING MOMENTUM IN THE  MARKETPLACE  </P> <P> When word got out last year that use of daminozide (trade name Alar) might  threaten the safety of apples, consumers were shaken. If apples -- our  unofficial national fruit, and famous for healthy eating -- couldn't be  trusted, what was going on down on the farm? In our desire to produce larger  and more abundant crops, were we putting ourselves and our environment at risk?  </P> <P> Long before Alar, a movement was already at work. For years, momentum has been  gathering for "alternative agriculture." This concept recognizes the need to  find new ways to grow food economically and safely, and without further damage  to the environment. Its strength rests on the assumption that although  conflicts do exist, farmers, environmentalists and consumers might all find  some common ground.  </P> <P> The movement began by questioning the underpinnings of traditional agriculture.  Take nitrates, widely used as fertilizer. For some time it had been known that  using excess amounts to maximize crop production was causing a buildup in  ground water, the reservoir that lies within and beneath the soil.  </P> <P> It also has been shown that levels of pesticides in ground water are rising.  Most pesticides currently in use are herbicides, which are sprayed onto the  ground. Previously it had been thought that they were simply absorbed on the  surface of soil particles, where they would eventually be broken down. But they  too seeped through to the ground water. Not only were levels higher than  expected, but the contamination had spread far from where the pesticides were  applied.  </P> <P> What makes this worrisome is that, except for oceans, ground water is the final  sink. Once chemicals are dissolved or suspended in it, they are there to stay  -- unless they are taken out when water is used. No one can measure the risk to  consumers, but evidence shows that we'd be better off with fewer pesticides and  nitrates.  </P> <P> In rural America, ground water is drinking water. Thus, farmers who live in  affected areas responded quite naturally with concern about the safety of the  water supply used by their families. The sharp drop in the price of crops, and  increased cost of chemicals, provided still more reason for farmers to look for  alternative methods, if they prove cheaper.  </P> <P> Farmers are in a key position to affect agricultural practices. But they are by  no means the only group concerned about potential dangers. The limitations of  chemical pesticides are now understood. Insects quickly develop resistance,  rendering a particular pesticide ineffective. And government regulations make  it expensive to develop and register new ones. If a pesticide might be useless  after a period of, say, five years, and it costs a lot to come up with a new  one, the outlook for manufacturers is bleak. There is incentive to diversify.  Those factors combine with support from environmental groups to press for  finding safer methods of raising our food.  </P> <P> These alternatives will emerge from a blend of modern advances and traditional  techniques. One objective is to identify natural methods of controlling  agricultural pests, making use of pesticides less necessary. Part of this  solution lies in breeding disease-resistant strains of crops.  </P> <P> In most of nature, plants grow without pesticides and fertilizers, so one  approach will be to search older varieties of commercial plants and their wild  relatives for desirable qualities that can be bred into commercial species  while maintaining satisfactory yields. This plan relies on traditional breeding  methods. But the objectives are broadened to include disease resistance and  reduced need for fertilizer, as well as yield.  </P> <P> A second goal is to provide a favorable habitat for natural organisms that can  control pests. A third is to capitalize on natural sources of fertilizers. Crop  residues ranging from tomato plants to corn husks can be plowed back into the  soil to enrich it. Livestock manure can be treated and used safely. And  leguminous plants harboring nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their roots can be used  to furnish the nitrogen that crops need.  </P> <P> None of this is a job for amateurs. Researchers at the nation's land-grant  universities, sites of much agricultural research, are hard at work. Also, more  and more, grass roots groups and other private organizations are exploring  economically viable alternatives.  </P> <P> On the farm itself, important changes are expected. In the past, government  programs to assist farmers have encouraged greater specialization in crop  production. That, in turn, led to more use of pesticides. It is thought that  these programs will now be rewritten with an eye toward developing alternative  farming methods. It's true that, to date, concern about problems with  traditional agriculture has outstripped progress in finding suitable  alternatives.  </P> <P> But now, however quietly, the revolution has begun. And there is every reason  to believe it will flourish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taking More Vitamins Is Not the Answer for Warming Up Cold Feet  </P> <P> Question: My hands and feet suffer in cold weather. I just can't keep them warm  enough, even with good boots and mittens. A friend said she'd read that B  complex vitamins could help. I know you tend to oppose large doses of vitamins,  but do you think that in my case they could provide some relief?  </P> <P> Answer: Sorry, but there is no evidence to support this. We can only guess at  the basis for such a claim. Cold temperatures are a form of environmental  stress, and the widely available "stress formula" vitamins are usually mixtures  of large doses of Vitamin C and members of the B complex vitamins. There is  likewise no data to support the use of these supplements in coping with stress,  either mental or physical, but perhaps they are somehow entwined with the rumor  that B vitamins will protect you from the cold.  </P> <P> A second explanation for the claim relates to the immediate physiologic effect  of one form of niacin, called nicotinic acid. When taken in large amounts,  nicotinic acid causes dilation of blood vessels and temporary flushing. This  brief effect wouldn't do you much good on a trek on a cold winter's day.  Besides, while niacin is now used in big doses in the treatment of elevated  serum cholesterol, it has the potential for harmful side effects, and should be  used only under a doctor's supervision.  </P> <P> Q: My 14-year-old son is considerably shorter than all his friends. I try not  to show it, but I'm concerned. I think he eats well, but I wonder if there are  dietary steps we could take to help him grow.  </P> <P> A: No, and any claims to the contrary are irresponsible. It is true that some  children go through their growth spurts much later than others. If he's among  that group, time will solve the problem. Remember, too, that genetics is a  powerful predictor of height, so it's important to take into account both your  own and your husband's stature. Short parents are less likely to have tall  offspring. But if you are worried that your son's growth is not proceeding at a  normal rate, and have not already done so, schedule an appointment with his  physician to rule out any health problem that could delay growth.  </P> <P> At no time is it more important to ensure that the diet provides enough  calories and sufficient amounts of essential nutrients than when children are  still growing. That can be achieved by consuming ample amounts of dairy  products, meat, fish, poultry and eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole  grain or lightly processed breads and cereals. In addition, a single  multivitamin and mineral containing 100 percent of the RDA for each nutrient  can provide some nutritional insurance. Supplements sold as growth promoters  are a waste of your hard-earned cash.  </P> <P> Q: Are prenatal fluoride supplements helpful to the unborn infant's teeth?  </P> <P> A: No. Although there is no evidence that they are harmful, there is no data to  show that they are of benefit, either. To begin with, any benefit that did  occur would affect only the deciduous or "baby teeth." It is generally believed  that it is a good idea to start fluoride supplements for the infant shortly  after birth. But there is no evidence that caries prevention is extended by the  use of prenatal fluoride supplements.  </P> <P> Q: Does a bulging lid on a can mean that the food inside is spoiled?  </P> <P> A: Not necessarily. But all the same, we urge you not to use the contents.  </P> <P> There are three reasons why a lid might bulge. It could occur in response to a  dent in the can. Or, it could be caused by a chemical reaction between the food  and the container, resulting in the release of hydrogen gas. Pressure from the  expansion of the gas makes the lid swell. Then there's the other possibility:  The bulging lid may be a sign that botulism spores are multiplying and  producing a potentially deadly toxin.  </P> <P> Since it's impossible to diagnose the cause of the bulge with certainty in your  kitchen, the only reasonable alternatives are either to return the container  and its contents to the store where you bought it, or to discard it in such a  way that pets and other animals cannot consume the contents. We should point  out that the risk of botulism food poisoning from commercially canned foods is  minute.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: ARTESIA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL SPLITS ON HOW TO FILL STACH'S UNEXPIRED TERM  </P> <P> During a special meeting Tuesday, the Artesia City Council failed to resolve  how it will replace former Councilman Rod Stach.  </P> <P> Councilmen Jim Van Horn and Ronald Oliver favored appointing a successor, while  Mayor Robert Jamison and Councilwoman Mary Alyce Soares preferred holding an  election.  </P> <P> Both Van Horn and Oliver submitted the names of possible appointees: former  Mayor Dennis Fellows; Planning Commission member Douglas Padelford; Bob  Thornton, an unsuccessful council candidate in the April election; and Glenn  Hutchinson, a retired sheriff's deputy. The council voted on each nomination  but deadlocked.  </P> <P> The issue will be discussed again at the council's regular meeting Sept. 10.  </P> <P> Stach resigned recently to accept a job promotion in Salt Lake City. His  elected term runs through April, 1992.  </P></p>

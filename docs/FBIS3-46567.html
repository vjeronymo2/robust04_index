The great leader President Kim Il-song said:    "Smashing every form of challenge and obstructive manoeuvres  of the imperialists and reactionaries and defending our  socialism and adding lustre to it are an honourable task which  is raised before our party and people today."    Owing to the imperialists' political and military pressure  and economic blockade to isolate and stifle the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, the bastion of socialism, an acute  situation has been prevailed in Korea this year.    The resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint nuclear war  exercises by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet  clique created a touch-and-go danger which may lead to a war  anytime on the Korean peninsula.    At that moment, Comrade Kim Chong-il, Supreme Commander of  the Korean People's Army, issued an order to the whole country,  the entire people and all the army to enter a semi-war state  from March 9 and aroused all the people and people's army in the  noble struggle for defending Korean-style socialism centred on  the popular masses.    When the imperialists and some officials of the secretariat  of the International Atomic Energy Agency under their baton  unjustly tried to force a "special inspection" on the DPRK under  the pretext of its fictitious "nuclear arms development," he saw  to it that the DPRK declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty to safeguard the dignity of the Republic  and the security of its people with honor.    Comrade Kim Chong-il who turns adversity into favorable  circumstances and brings about only victory with superb strategy  and penetration was elected chairman of the national defence  commission of the DPRK at the fifth session of the ninth Supreme  People's Assembly by the unanimous will of the Korean people and  the People's Army soldiers.    This year, singlehearted unity of the Korean people around  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been cemented  remarkably.    A military parade and a one million-strong mass  demonstration  were held and an evening performance "we won victory" took place  in the capital city of Pyongyang on July 27, the 40th  anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the  fatherland liberation war, in the presence of the two brilliant  commanders, President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il.    They were a grand national festival that powerfully  demonstrated the might of the single hearted unity of the Korean  people who had overcome rigorous trials and the advantages and  vitality of Korean-style socialism.    Voices of faith in the invincible socialism of Korean style  as well as the immortal song of praise "no motherland without  you" rang out of the eighth congress of the League of Socialist  Working Youth of Korea, the national conference of war veterans,  the meeting of commanding officers and political commissars of  the Korean People's Army, the national meeting of frontrankers  in beautiful communist traits and other meetings and functions  held this year.    All the voters cast their ballots for the candidates of  deputies to the provincial (municipal) people's assemblies at  the elections held on November 21, demonstrating again their  deep trust in the people's power and the invincible might of the  Korean people united in one mind around the party and the leader.    Significant achievements have been registered in socialist  economic construction, too.    It was noted at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth  Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held on December 8 that  the national industrial output increased 50 percent in the  period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993) under the grim  situation which rapidly changed owing to the worldwide political  fluctuation.    The workers of the coal, power and metal industries, in  hearty response to the New Year address of the great leader  which defined those industries as the main points of socialist  economic construction, have won big successes by increasing the  production capacity and updating the production processes.    Many light industrial factories have been built in different  parts of the country and the existing ones modernized, with the  result that a new turn has been effected in the production of  consumer goods.    Bumper harvests of rice, maize, potatoes and fruits were  reported from highlands in the northern part of the country, not  to speak of Yonbaek, Chaeryong, Yoldusamcholli and other plains  in the west coastal areas.    30,000 flats were built in Pyongyang and many dwelling  houses  in Hamhung, Wonsan, Sinuiju, Chongjin and other local cities and  in farm villages and coal and ore miners' settlements.    This year, the tomb of Tangun in Kangdong County was  unearthed to prove that Tangun was a real historical person and  the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation with Pyongyang as its  cradle and with a 5,000 years long history. This is another  signal event that added shine to the history of the Korean  nation.</p>

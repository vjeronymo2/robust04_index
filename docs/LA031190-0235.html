			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KELSEY BREAKS THE "LAW"  </P> <P> For me, "L.A. Law" is indisputably the high point of the viewing week.  </P> <P> It rivals anything on PBS, which I usually watch. However, two recent programs  focused on Ann Kelsey. She is a very jealous, hateful and spiteful person. I  know that such people do exist; in fact, I had such a "boss lady" myself once.  Some of the other workers referred to her as a "witch on wheels." I realize  that the series always tries to get in some conflict by showing all kinds of  people. However, it is just too painful to watch this greedy and spiteful  character.  </P> <P> Bernadette McCrumb, Lynwood  </P></p>

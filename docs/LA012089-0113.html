			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HUNTER COMES THROUGH FOR CALGARY IN 7-2 WIN  </P> <P> The Calgary Flames expected big things from Mark Hunter when they acquired him  in a preseason trade, but the veteran wing had not lived up to expectations --  until Thursday night.  </P> <P> Hunter broke a season-long slump with 4 goals at Boston, powering the Flames  over the Bruins, 7-2, for their 30th win of the season.  </P> <P> "I think it's been 15 games without a goal," said Hunter, who was a 32-goal  scorer with the St. Louis Blues last season. He had scored just 7 in 36 games  this season with Calgary.  </P> <P> "It was one of those nights when the puck was bouncing for me, and they kept  going in."  </P> <P> The Bruins completed a string of 4 games without suspended coach Terry O'Reilly  and went 1-2-1 in that span.  </P> <P> Hartford 6, Montreal 4 -- Rookie Jody Hull's power-play goal midway through the  third period capped a 4-goal flurry in a 5:43 span as the Whalers overcame a  4-goal deficit to defeat the Canadiens at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> The win marked the first time in their 10-year National Hockey League history  that the Whalers had won a game after trailing by 4 goals.  </P> <P> Hartford, which ended a 3-game losing streak, beat Montreal for the first time  in 6 games this season.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 5, St. Louis 0 -- Bob Froese recorded his first shutout in 3  seasons as the Rangers beat the Blues at St. Louis to take undisputed  possession of first place in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> One of the Rangers' goals was scored by Tony Granato, who has 9 goals and 5  assists in his last 5 games.  </P> <P> Froese, who led the NHL with 5 shutouts in 1985-86 while with the Philadelphia  Flyers but hadn't posted any since, recorded his 13th career shutout.  </P> <P> Quebec 5, New Jersey 4 -- Ken McRae scored his first 2 goals of the season, and  the Nordiques got 3 goals in the second period to beat the slumping Devils at  East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> The victory was the Nordiques' second in 3 nights over the Devils, losers of 4  of their last 5 games.  </P> <P> McRae, who was called up Jan. 16 from Halifax of the American Hockey League,  took a pass from Marc Fortier and flipped the puck over Devil goaltender Bob  Sauve's glove at 13:38 of the second period to break a 2-2 tie.  </P> <P> Toronto 3, Minnesota 3 -- Daniel Marois scored with 1:20 remaining in  regulation as the Maple Leafs tied the North Stars at Toronto.  </P></p>

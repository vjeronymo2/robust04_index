			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Leading Japanese politician resigns over funding scandal THE Japanese government was yesterday shaken by the sudden resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru as vice-chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party over a political funding scandal. Mr Kanemaru, 77, widely regarded as the most powerful politician in Japan, admitted that his political secretary had accepted a Y500m (Pounds 2m) payment from the former chief executive of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery company at the heart of a Y500bn fraudulent loan scandal, before the 1989 upper house election. 'I first refused the money,' Mr Kanemaru told a brief televised news conference. 'But I accepted it in the end as a contribution to my colleagues at the time of the general elections (in 1990). I must assume responsibility for my conduct.' In a statement, Mr Kanemaru acknowledged that the money was not reported to the home affairs ministry, which would have made it a legitimate political contribution. Mr Kanemaru holds enormous power within the ruling party, and as chairman of the party's largest faction was a supporter of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. The implications for the stability of Mr Miyazawa's government were last night unclear. Mr Kanemaru also submitted his resignation as chairman of the faction, although the resignation was not immediately accepted. Mr Takayoshi Miyagawa, president of the Center for Political Public Relations, said: 'The LDP without Kanemaru is like a company without a president. It has no strength. For Miyazawa, it will be difficult to manage politics.' Analysts said Mr Kanemaru had resigned in an attempt to limit possible political fallout from the scandal, which otherwise would have leaked out and caused enormous embarrassment to the ruling party. Mr Kanemaru is expected to be questioned shortly by the prosecutor's office concerning possible violation of the political funds control law. There is also a strong possibility that the scandal will spread to other politicians. The prosecutors have been told by Sagawa Kyubin executives that Y2bn in contributions were made to 10 ruling party politicians. Nikkei soars, Page 3</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shamsul Akmar] </F>   [Excerpt] Kota Baru, Fri. -- The PAS [Pan Malaysia Islamic  Party]-led Kelantan Government will award a contract for its  water supply project to a British company despite the Federal  Government's decision not to give new contracts to British  firms. Menteri Besar [Chief Minister] Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat  said today the State Exco [executive council] met last week and  decided to hire Thames Water for the project.    The ban on the award of government contracts for British  firms was imposed on February 25 following unsubstantiated  reports by the British media of alleged corruption on the part  of Malaysian political leaders in deals involving British firms.  The Cabinet had made it clear that the ban included all Federal  and State Government contracts.    All State Governments, except for the Pas-led Kelantan State  Government and the then PBS [Sabah United Party] Sabah State  Government, had supported the move. The decision also received  overwhelming support from various quarters in Malaysia,  including politicians, trade unions, non-governmental  organisations and individuals. Kelantan is the only State to go  against the Federal Government's decision.    Nik Aziz said the project would be a joint venture between  Thames Water and Yayasan Kelantan Darulnaim (Yakin). It would  be carried out on a privatised basis and would be for the supply  of water to the State's water treatment plants.    "We hope the project will overcome the acute water shortage  we anticipate in a few years. In fact, we are already facing  the problem and we have to do something fast to rectify the  situation," Nik Aziz said. He neither, however, elaborated on  why the State Government had decided to engage a British firm  nor disclosed the terms and conditions of the deal. [passage  omitted]</p>

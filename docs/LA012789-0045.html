			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FIRM TO REMOVE DEAD TREES  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has awarded a $50,000 contract to remove  584 dead eucalyptus trees and clear dead branches from 284 other trees, all on  city-owned parkland.  </P> <P> The areas slated for the work make up about 10% of the public parkland and  include the infested areas that are most visible to the public.  </P> <P> The work, which will begin in about two weeks, is the city's first major effort  to combat the Australian eucalyptus long-horned borer beetle, which is killing  eucalyptus trees in many areas of Southern California.  </P> <P> The inch-long beetle, which deposits its eggs under the bark of eucalyptus  trees, was brought to the area in wood shipped from Australia in 1984. It has  since proliferated from San Diego to Ventura counties.  </P> <P> As part of the contract, Travers Tree Service, a Lomita firm, must bury the  tainted wood in a landfill.  </P></p>

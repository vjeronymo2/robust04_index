			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts show resilience to inflation data UK GILTS surprised many with their resilience in the face of a higher-than-expected September RPI figure. Longer-dated bonds dipped after the release but recovered to end only slightly lower. The long gilt contract slipped by  1/4 to close at 114 5/32 . 'I expected a bigger sell-off after these numbers,' said one senior trader. Gilts were supported by heavy futures buying when the contract dipped below 114, he said. However, he warned that the market is vulnerable to further setbacks in coming days. Offsetting the inflation numbers and boosting the short end were weak manufacturing output data, which fuelled hopes for a rate cut and spurred domestic buying of maturities up to five years. However, many retail investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of today's economic releases, which include September jobs data, August average earnings and manufacturing unit labour costs. GERMAN government bonds wiped out early gains in late trading and the December bund future closed at 99.98, down 0.04 points from Tuesday and off its 100.15 intra-day high. The unchanged 6.70 per cent rate on the Bundesbank's 14-day securities repurchase agreements disappointed some traders, who had hoped it would edge slightly lower. Bund futures were further pressured by late profit-taking and by banks hedging their positions in the new government bunds. The government issued DM4.11bn of 6 per cent bunds at 100.71 and above. 'People were so bullish they bid for the paper at the top of the market, but they couldn't place it so they had to hedge,' said one London trader. The bonds ended at 100.63 bid, yielding 5.91 per cent. FRENCH bonds outperformed bunds, with the notional bond future hitting a record high at 124.44 and closing at 124.32, up 0.14 points. Boosting bonds but undermining the currency was talk that the Bank of France may cut its repo rate at today's open-market operation. BELGIAN bonds also ended the day higher, in spite of the Belgian franc's weakness, which prompted intervention by the central bank. The yield premium of Belgian bonds over bunds narrowed to 131 basis points, from 134 on Tuesday. US Treasuries eased in light turnover traders and investors focused on the upcoming inflation numbers. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 104 15/32 , yielding 5.924 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 3.808 per cent. Rising gold prices had contributed to Tuesday's late declines, but yesterday morning there was no evidence of further gains in precious metals, so longer-dated securities opened modestly higher. The market's attention was diverted by Congressional hearings into proposals that the Federal Reserve's independence be curtailed and its 12 regional presidents appointed by the President. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told a hearing that the proposals would undermine the bank's ability to fight inflation.</p>

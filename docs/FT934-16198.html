			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rise at SocGen bucks trend SOCIETE Generale, one of France's largest banks, yesterday lightened the gloom over the French banking sector by announcing a 9.2 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.16bn (Dollars 380.6m) in the first half of 1993, from FFr1.98bn in the same period of last year. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said the group should also produce 'good results' for the full financial year. 'It's hard to imagine that 1993's result will be less than that of 1992,' he added. Societe Generale produced net profits of FFr3.55bn on net banking income of FFr36.45bn in 1992. The French banking industry has been under pressure because of the sluggish state of the credit market and the impact of recession. Several leading banks have recently announced disappointing first-half results. Paribas, the investment banking group, last week reported static interim profits, while Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank, last month reported a dramatic FFr1.05bn loss. Societe Generale managed to overcome the pressures on industry due to strong performances from its international interests and trading activities. Mr Vienot said the bank had benefited from the development of its interest-rate and foreign-exchange instruments. Net banking income increased by 9.5 per cent to FFr20.22bn in the first six months of 1993 from FFr18.46bn at the same stage in 1992. However, costs rose 4.5 per cent to FFr13.53bn from FFr12.95bn due to increased investment. Gross operating profits rose 21.3 per cent to FFr6.69bn from FFr5.52bn. The bank made a loss of FFr106m on financial transactions, against a FFr789m gain in the first half of last year when it received FFr525m from the sale of shares in Perrier mineral water. However, the group raised interim provisions by 3.2 per cent to FFr3.53bn from FFr3.42bn, due mainly to writedowns on its exposure to LDC debt and to sour commercial loans in France.</p>

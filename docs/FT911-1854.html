			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Polly Peck associate fends off winding-up petition SOUTH Audley Management, the private investment vehicle owned by family trusts of Mr Asil Nadir, chairman of Polly Peck International, yesterday defeated a petition for its compulsory winding-up. The petition had been brought by Mr Christopher Morris, one of the administrators of Polly Peck International, over a debt of Pounds 14,111 owed to the fresh fruit to electronics group. Mr Morris's petition followed earlier attempts by the South Audley directors themselves to put the group into voluntary liquidation, with their own choice of liquidator. Mr Morris's petition, had it been successful, would have put the company into the hands of the official receiver.</p>

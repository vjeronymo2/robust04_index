			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY ON THE ISSUES  </P> <P> Re "Sheldon and Art" (Letters, Aug. 12): Anthony Ramirez and Bobby Youngblood  need to reread the First Amendment.  </P> <P> When Christians organize protests, boycotts and political campaigns, we are  exercising our right to freedom of speech. We may not succeed in our attempts  to promote our beliefs, but we have the right to try, as do women's rights  groups, minority groups, unions, and any other groups you can think of.  </P> <P> Public debate of ideas is a grand tradition handed down from our founding  fathers and should be encouraged, not beaten down with labels such as fascist  and narrow-minded.  </P> <P> CHERI FOSTER  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

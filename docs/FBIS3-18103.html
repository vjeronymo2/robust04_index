International pressures were essential in reaching  a peace agreement in 1993. Are they clear enough today?  Several Rwandan sources said that Belgian Foreign Minister  Claes did not mince words [during his visit] in Kigali. The UN  envoy did so too. However, in the name of nonintervention --  probably --, those diplomats do not clearly point at the most  serious responsibilities involved in the crisis.    It must be said that the manipulations of the lists of  deputies and ministers from two parties (the four other are  ready) which block the establishment of the institutions are not  justified: Within the Liberal Party, the splitting only took  place after the prefectorial congress meetings elected their  deputies. The votes were checked by a notary public and the  elected officials cannot be contested. Within the Republican  Democratic Movement, the polls can only be contested for two  deputies from two prefectures where double party congress  meetings were held; the nine regular officials should be  elected. For the two others, as for the ministers, a political  compromise will probably be necessary -- but no one can afford  to wait until then to establish the institutions.    The Patriotic Front maintained self-control and did not  resume warfare after the murderous attacks of Tuesday [22  February]. The Rwandan population showed maturity and did not  engage in the inter-ethnic killings that some people might  expect: There were assasinations in Kigali but no general  movement of violence from the population. The MRND [National  Republican Movement for Democracy and Development], the  presidential party, rightly stresses the responsibility of the  (opposition) prime minister who no longer convenes any meeting  of his ministers, thus making chaos even worse.    The international community will have to clearly lend its  support to those Rwandan leaders who bring their fair share to  the peace agreement and bring them to the foreground.  Otherwise, today's insidious war will become tomorrow's blaze.</p>

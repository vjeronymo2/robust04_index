			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HOSPITAL RELEASES PIRATES' REDUS  </P> <P> Pirates first baseman Gary Redus was released from a Pittsburgh hospital this  morning after being struck in the face by a fastball thrown by Dodgers reliever  Tim Crews.  </P> <P> Redus crumpled to the ground after being struck just below the left eye by a  Crews pitch clocked at 90 m.p.h. in the seventh inning of the Pirates' 7-4  victory Monday night. (Earlier story in Sports, Part III.)  </P> <P> He was carried off the field on a stretcher and was taken to Allegheny General  Hospital for X-rays after his left eye nearly swelled shut. After being  examined by team physician Dr. Jack Failla, Redus was released, according to  hospital spokeswoman Mary Barnyak.  </P> <P> Redus apparently did not suffer any broken bones, but his status was uncertain  for the Pirates' seven-game road trip that begins tonight in New York, Failla  said.  </P> <P> Redus, batting .280 with three homers and 18 RBIs in 65 games, was 1-for-2 with  an RBI single Monday.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Facts show fat cats are fatter: Lucy Kellaway uncovers backing for allegations of directors' greed THIS YEAR'S season of company reports is revealing a picture which backs up the claim that company directors are greedy. The assertion was made by Mr Roger Young, head of the Institute of Management, who was commenting on a report by the institute which shows directors' pay is rising at more than twice the rate of inflation. Large companies such as British Gas and ICI have announced pay freezes in the boardroom, but other companies giving out fat increases to directors are causing raised eyebrows. British Aerospace, Hillsdown Holdings, SmithKline Beecham, BAT and English China Clays have all hit the headlines recently over rises in executive pay. The onus is now on them to prove they deserve such big payments. In general the evidence suggests this is not always the case. This year companies are starting to provide more information in their annual reports about what they pay their top people - a move prompted by the Cadbury Committee's report on corporate governance. Most of the big companies have included in their 1992 report a new section on corporate governance, declaring compliance with the Cadbury code which comes into force in June. Companies are providing details of their audit and remuneration committees and are giving breakdowns detailing the salary and bonus elements of the pay of directors, the chairman and the highest-paid director. Some companies are giving information on how the pay is arrived at. For many this marks a big departure. A survey by Monks Partnership, the pay consultancy, showed that only 16 per cent of FT-SE 100 companies fully complied with the code in their 1991 accounts. Many companies have made significant changes already. Lloyds Bank, for example, which complied with none of the guidelines last year, now meets all of them. However, even where company reports fully meet the code shareholders might benefit from some further explanation of directors' pay. Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, saw his pay rise 20 per cent last year to Pounds 1.5m, while profits before tax rose just 11 per cent. The company's report shows that the bulk of his rise was in bonus. His basic salary and perks rose 12.5 per cent. The company said he deserved the rise as it had performed well. The Institute of Management survey shows the level of pay increases varies sharply from one sector to another, yet those differences are not balanced by similar differences in profitability. In chemicals and allied industries directors received pay rises of 15.3 per cent last year, while the earnings of the chemicals sector as a whole fell 11 per cent. Directors of food, drink and tobacco groups received less than 3 per cent more last year, yet their companies performed relatively well. In particular, food retailers increased earnings by about 11 per cent. Mr Young points out that sector figures mask large differences in the pay of individual companies. For instance, the big increase in top pay of energy companies may be largely a reflection of a catch-up in the pay of electricity utilities following privatisation. Even within each sector the position is different. In the energy industry some companies are showing restraint - such as British Gas after public anger the previous year when Mr Robert Evans, chief executive, received an over-generous rise - while other smaller companies are not doing so. Shareholders in Premier Consolidated Oilfields are becoming restive at the 50 per cent increase in total directors' pay last year and are planning to put embarrassing questions at the group's AGM next week. Companies themselves give a wide variety of reasons for pay rises to directors. BAT justifies the 50 per cent-odd increase in pay of Sir Patrick Sheehey, its chairman, in terms of that company's leap in productivity.  -----------------------------------------------------              HOW DIRECTORS' PAY HAS RISEN  ----------------------------------------------------- Chemicals &amp; allied Industries                    15.3 Distribution                                     11.6 Electricity, gas &amp; other energy                  10.9 Mechanical engineering &amp; production              10.6 Construction                                      7.9 All directors                                     6.5 Paper, printing &amp; publishing                      6.0 Textiles, leather, clothing &amp; footwear            5.6 Banking, finance &amp; insurance                      4.9 Metal manufacture &amp; other metal goods             4.0 High-tech                                         2.9 Electrical engineering                            2.8 Food, drink &amp; tobacco                             2.8  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Institute of Management  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

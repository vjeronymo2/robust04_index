			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Ambassador  to the U.N. Dragomir Djokic on Thursday warned U.N. Security  Council President Colin Keating that a tolerant stand of the  U.N. towards Bosnian Moslems leads to an esclation of the civil  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the world organization should  be directly engaged in finding a peaceful solution to that the  crisis in that former Yugoslav republic.    It is important to do everything possible for the Moslems to  stop attacking and that the peace process is restored, Djokic  said.    Djokic was received by Keating at his own request, since he  wanted to inform the Security Council president about  Yugoslavia's stands regarding the latest developments in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Djokic said that the Security Council should not have  reacted  so mildly to the Moslem attacks around Gorazde and elsewhere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and protested because it was tolerated that  Moslem use U.N. Protected Areas to launch attacks on Serb  positions, which was confirmed also by senior U.N. officials,  including U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali himself.    The Security Council, in the interest of its credibility,  should take a strong stand towards all sides, and not constantly  accuse one side and condone actions by another, Djokic said.    Keating said that the Security Council was aware of the  behavior but that the Serb response to the Moslem of the Moslem  side hvvut that the Serb [words indistinct]. Provocations have  been too strong [passage indistinct] Djokic said.    The Security Council authorized the bombing of Bosnian Serb  positions around Gorazde by NATO planes on Sunday and Monday,  although Keating himself said earlier that the fighting around  that Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina had been  provoked by the Moslems.    Gorazde, one of six U.N. Protected Areas in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, should have been demilitarized last spring,  but the latest Moslem offensive was launched from this town.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: BNP in plan to shed Banque Nagelmackers Banque Nationale de Paris, one of France's leading banks and privatised last year, is selling Banque Nagelmackers 1747, Belgium's oldest bank. The bank, in which BNP became the majority shareholder four years ago, is to be sold to P and V Assurances of Belgium. The sale will also apply to a related concern, Nagelmackers &amp; Company. BNP stressed that the sale conditions would guarantee the bank's development and the service to its clients, and that Nagelmackers would continue to market BNP products. BNP bought the majority of the shares in Banque Nagelmackers in 1990, with the remaining stake held by the Nagelmackers family. This August it acquired nearly all the remaining shares when Financiere Lecocq, a co-shareholder with which it made the original takeover, exercised its option to sell. BNP earlier this year denied suggestions it was planning to sell Banque Nagelmackers.</p>

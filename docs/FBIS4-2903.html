			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The defense ministers  of 11 members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  adopted documents to establish a CIS collective security  committee during an extraordinary meeting here today.    Except Moldova, military leaders of all CIS members  including  Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine  attended the meeting.    Moldova, whose parliament allowed the country to join the  CIS  last week, has repeatedly stressed that it only accedes to the  CIS' economic agreements instead of military ones in view of its  independence.    The meeting also approved a draft declaration on security  coordination among the CIS member states and their stance toward  the "partnership for peace" plan of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO).    The declaration pointed out that the signatories should not  use force against one another and that the treaty on collective  security has laid the foundation for the establishment of a  Euro-Asian defensive alliance.    It also said that its signatories regard the "partnership  for  peace" plan as a practical choice which is aimed at enhancing an  all-European cooperation mechanism based on the conference of  security and cooperation in Europe without enlarging NATO.    The "partnership for peace" plan will allow former  Soviet-led  Warsaw Pact members to take part in peacekeeping, military  exercises and other NATO activities without becoming NATO  members.</p>

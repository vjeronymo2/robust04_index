			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Good advance as confidence returns RENEWED demand for UK equities reversed the traditional pattern yesterday by spreading from the second line stocks and boosting the FT-SE listed blue chips. Disappointing November statistics on domestic retail sales and Public Sector Borrowing Requirement failed to restrain investors' optimism and London responded favourably to the latest data on the US economy. Trading volume increased briskly and a scattering of bid stories, albeit featuring many old favourities, underscored the note of optimism. Two trading programmes were identified, spread across the full range of the market. Activity in stock index futures ahead of Friday's expiry deadline again buttressed the underlying equity market, although there was less arbitraging between futures and equities than in the previous session. After drifting lower at first to touch 2,713.1, the Footsie turned higher, attracting some genuine buying interest rather than the merely futures-related demand seen earlier this week. The market climbed steadily throughout the session, closing just below the day's best to record a final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,732.8, a net gain of 14.9. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained very positive, ending with a further advance of 18.4 on the day. Volume in second line stocks well outpaced that of the Footsie-listed issues and the day's total of Seaq-reported business rose to 676.3m shares from the 551.6m of the previous day. Retail business on Tuesday was worth Pounds 1.15bn, regaining the higher levels briefly lost on Monday. Equity strategists at County NatWest drew attention to the substantial recovery in share trading which, they claim, has brought the most active year since 1987, the annus horribilis of the stock market. County comments that average daily turnover of more than Pounds 1bn this year compares with Pounds 912m in 1991. The news that UK retail sales dipped by 0.1 per cent last month was slightly disappointing for the stores sector, where a rise of about the same proportions had been expected. But the reaction in share prices was calm, with most of the store leaders closing a shade higher. Analysts are focusing on the prospects for the Christmas selling season. With the bad news from IBM offset by better reports yesterday on US housing starts and industrial production, London continued to look for an early improvement in the economy across the Atlantic. UK investors were unabashed by a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, which was a shade off in London trading hours. In spite of the upturn in equities, traders remained cautious ahead of the year-end, for which many securities analysts are still predicting a Footsie close of 2,700. Yesterday's buyers appeared to be focusing on stocks which have been under downward pressure recently. Some drinks shares staged a recovery from the upset prompted last week by downgradings on Guinness. Banking issues found support. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, predicted a good rally in UK equities next month, when it believes that attention may return to the cyclical sectors, such as building materials, chemicals, metals, packaging and paper. January rallies, said Goldman, often reflect window-dressing by fund managers, or just investor psychology.</p>

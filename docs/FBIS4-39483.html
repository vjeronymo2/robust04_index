			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 7 Jun -- Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy, Ukraine's  ambassador to the Russian Federation, met with the director of  the Russian Foreign Ministry cooperation department and handed  him two notes from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, drawing  attention to the report by the head of the Russian delegation at  the CSCE standing committee's plenary sitting in Vienna where  the question of the situation in the Republic of Crimea was  addressed. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, in particular, pointed  out that the report referred to the existence of the sovereign  Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry qualifies this as nothing other than a statement  contradicting the Russian Federation's official position on the  issue of respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and  existing borders of Ukraine and regards it as interfering in  Ukraine's internal affairs. This was a statement made by Yuriy  Serheyev, head of the information directorate at Ukraine's  Foreign Ministry at a briefing.    In connection with the Ambartsumov's deliberations published  by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, the Ukrainian Embassy in Russia issued  another note pointing out that, according to the embassy's data,  Mr. Ambartsumov has been appointed as an extraordinary and  plenipotentiary ambassador of Russia. The following question  arises: Do Ambartsumov's statements that the USSR's acts on the  integration of Crimean Oblast in Ukraine are unlawful, that the  Russian Federation Supreme Council's notorious decision on the  status of the city of Sevastopol is incorrect and that the  borders between our states are not final, correspond to the  Russian Federation's official stance?</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Campaign for women claims growing support OPPORTUNITY 2000, the business-led campaign to improve the position of women at work, now involves 20 per cent of the workforce, according to Business in the Community, the voluntary organisation for business initiatives, which is running it . The campaign was launched six months ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister. An initial 62 organisations, most of them household names, signed up at the launch last October. Original members of the campaign included British Airways, the BBC, NatWest Bank and J. Sainsbury. Business in the Community said yesterday that since the launch the recruitment of a second wave of companies had brought total membership to 110, covering 5m employees - 20 per cent of the workforce. The total includes 20 government departments. Each organisation that signs up to the campaign pledges to draw up goals to monitor and improve the position of its female employees. Measures include the introduction of flexible working patterns, policies on sexual harassment and women-only training. Some companies have decided to set numerical targets for the employment and promotion of women. Other organisations have rejected such a move because of fears of possible discrimination against male employees. A Financial Times survey published last month found the idea of numerical targets gaining ground among companies. Lady Howe, who chaired the Opportunity 2000 launch committee, said: 'What started as a drip in terms of changing attitudes towards women at work will swell to a stream.' She said it was expected that an increasing number of women would be appointed to company boards in the next few months. MSF, the general technical union, said yesterday that it welcomed the Opportunity 2000 initiative but was sceptical about the benefits to the majority of working women 'unless it was accompanied by direct assistance from employers'. The very people who most needed a career break - junior staff and single parents  - could not afford to take unpaid leave, the union said. Similarly, flexible working patterns were undoubtedly of benefit but might be of little use if childcare arrangements were non-existent or unaffordable.</p>

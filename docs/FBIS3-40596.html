Its Soviet-made MIG planes are involved in so many accidents  that the Indian pilots call them flying coffins. In contrast,  the standards and safety of Pakistan's Air Force have long been  regarded as one of the world's most efficient. During the last  few years, the number of accidents in the Pakistan Air Force has  also increased (The latest accident occurred a few days ago,  when a Chinese-made airplane fell in a canal). When the series  of accidents in our Air Force increased, I decided to do some  reading as a part of my research and also discussed the issue  with some experts. Why are accidents in the Pakistani Air Force  increasing? This is an entirely separate issue, and suffice to  say that during my investigation, I had the opportunity to read  a voluminous book written on the Pakistani Air Force. It is  about 600-700 pages long and contains the history of our Air  Force. There were many photographs and other details in the  book, and I was pleasantly surprised that Christian officers and  Christian young men in other ranks have sacrificed their lives  with a smile on their faces while serving in the Pakistan Air  Force. Seeing the greatness and depth of their emotions, I felt  my emotions were not as strong as theirs.    If my information is correct, I can fearlessly say that the  people and the government have not done much for the Pakistani  Christians who have done a lot for the Air Force. These  Christians have been treated a little better than untouchables  in Islamic society. They have demonstrated an admirable love for  our nation. I wish we had paid attention to their love and,  learning from our own religion, had done something to alleviate  the problems faced by the mistreated Christian society. Now, if  that had happened, a major part of these Christians would be  leading better lives. There is no doubt that we have forgotten  the teachings of our religious prophets.    Because of our neglect of the Christian population, the  United States, Western intelligence agencies, and foreign  Christian missions had the opportunity to work with the  Christians here. Because of our 45 years of complacency, some  vested interests have risen among the Christians. We do not have  a dearth of such elements among Pakistani Muslims, who wait for  signs from abroad.    At a time when the United States and other Western powers  are  jointly trying to ensure that none of the Islamic countries  gives up its Western style of living and presents a challenge to  them, we should think about the issue of our treatment of the  minorities here. The minorities should also consider that they  do not become instrumental in efforts to weaken Pakistan's  Islamic character.    Basically there are three minorities in Pakistan. There are  the Christians, which I have already mentioned. There are  Hindus, who have some influence in Sindh. There are also the  Qadianis, who are so much opposed to the majority religion of  our country that it is impossible to expect any constructive  relationship with them.    The reader may recall that the minorities have opposed the  efforts to include religion on identity cards in the campaign to  displace the Nawaz Sharif government. Some of these minorities  have become very active. Let us ignore this debate over whether  inclusion of religion on identity cards is appropriate or not.  There were two major reasons for the minorities' efforts to  oppose it: First, to keep the Pakistani government on a secular  footing as much as possible; second, to weaken a government that  tried to give itself the Islamic color. At present, some  religious parties have held demonstrations in support of the  inclusion of religion on identity cards. The diplomats from the  United States and some other Western powers supported the stand  of the minorities openly. Thus, the opposing groups that were  formed included the United States of America, Western powers,  the PPP [Pakistan People's Party], and minorities, all on one  side, and some political parties on the other.    In which direction are our minorities headed? The latest  indicator was the day when the leader of the House was elected.  Two Senate members of minority groups refused to take the oath  of allegiance according to Islamic ceremonies. The present  federal government of Pakistan is riding on the shoulders of  these minorities, who consider Pakistani ideology to be  interfering in their religion.    The latest aspect of this retrogression is that, at a time  when the minority members refused to take the oath of allegiance  according to Islamic rites, the members of Pakistan's Islamic  Front were leaving the House. They failed when they had to do  something. May God bless Maulana Fazal-ul Rehman that he  countered the argument offered by the minority members and  finally convinced them.    I do not want to draw some "dangerous" conclusions from this  analysis. If regression is not stopped, then dangerous results  will emerge automatically. All I want to do is identify this  scenario. Not only minorities, but also a major political party  in Pakistan, are supporting a two-nation theory, and those who  should defend it have disappeared. There should have been  someone whose voice we could hear, so that it could give us some  courage.</p>

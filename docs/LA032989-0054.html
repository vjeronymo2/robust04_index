			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE WRESTS AMERICA'S CUP FROM SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> In an unprecedented ruling, a judge Tuesday said that Dennis Conner and the San  Diego Yacht Club, in winning the America's Cup sailing race last year, violated  the spirit of fair competition called for in the rules. The judge stripped the  San Diego club of the trophy and awarded it to New Zealand.  </P> <P> New York Supreme Court Judge Carmen Ciparick decided that by racing a two-hull  catamaran against a mono-hull craft in September, San Diego had created a  "gross mismatch" contrary to the intention of the author of the 19th-Century  Deed of Gift governing the race.  </P> <P> The decision by the New York court, which has jurisdiction over interpretation  of cup rules, was a shocking blow to the sailing community and to the city of  San Diego, which was expecting a $1-billion bonanza in hosting the next race in  1991. After the ruling, New Zealand officials announced plans to the hold the  race there.  </P> <P> Officials of the San Diego Yacht Club and the America's Cup Organizing  Committee criticized the judge for what one of them called a legal "flip flop."  The lawyer representing the yacht club said bluntly: "We've been had."  </P> <P> A final decision on a possible appeal probably will not be made until today at  the earliest. The officials said they had to analyze the 14-page ruling, and  that they would be guided by "what is best for the America's Cup."  </P> <P> Almost from the moment skipper Dennis Conner won the cup in races off the coast  of Fremantle, Australia, in February, 1987, the cup has been under siege. First  there was a controversy over where the next regatta would be held -- San Diego  or Hawaii -- in what amounted to a bidding war, and then merchant banker  Michael Fay of New Zealand issued an unusual one-on-one challenge. This sent  the contest, once determined by sailors at sea, into the hands of lawyers in  the courtroom.  </P> <P> Fay's challenge, which called for him to race off the coast of San Diego in a  $10-million 123-foot mono-hull, was upheld by the New York court in November,  1987, touching off a decision by the San Diego Yacht Club and the Sail America  Foundation to "dispose" of Fay's maverick challenge as quickly and efficiently  as possible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Catamaran Chosen  </P> <P> Conner and the yacht club selected a 60-foot catamaran, a boat clearly superior  in speed to Fay's mono-hull. No catamaran had ever raced for the cup, and the  San Diegans defended their unusual choice -- which was criticized by many in  the yachting world for being unsportsmanlike -- as legal under the cup's rules  embodied in the 1887 Deed of Gift.  </P> <P> Last September off Pt. Loma, the two vessels raced in a best-of-three match  series. The result was a blowout for Conner, who won the first two races by  wide margins. The loss sent Fay back to court.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Judge Ciparick sharply criticized the San Diego club for selecting  a catamaran, and said the club fell short of its responsibility as a trustee of  the cup. Acknowledging that forfeiture is an extreme remedy, the judge said she  had no choice but to turn over the cup to Fay and his Mercury Bay Boating Club  Inc.  </P> <P> "San Diego was well aware of the risk it ran when it chose to follow the  unprecedented course of defending in a catamaran," the judge said. "Barely  paying lip service to the significance of the competition, its clear goal was  to retain the cup at all costs . . . (and) thus violated the spirit of the Deed  (of Gift)."  </P> <P> The judge said, "The holder of the America's Cup is bound to a higher  obligation than the victor of the Stanley Cup or the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fairness Called the Issue  </P> <P> The foundation of cup racing since its inception in 1851, the judge wrote, is  fair competition, and the use of a catamaran strayed from that concept. "It is  clear that a catamaran may not defend in America's Cup competition against a  mono-hull," she declared.  </P> <P> The announcement of Ciparick's decision and set off celebrations in Aukland,  which calls itself "the city of sails." Joggers stopped their early morning  exercise to discuss the news, and a fireboat motored into Auckland Harbor to  spray its hoses.  </P> <P> Fay was awakened by a phone call from an aide, who told him of the decision.  Then Fay went for his own morning jog, receiving congratulations from his  countrymen along the way.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this report were Times Staff Writers Leonard Bernstein,  Chris Kraul and Greg Johnson.  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: The American dream distorted - Theatre Out there is a man's world where a man has to do what a man has to do. The last surviving wilderness. A desert place where you walk tall and lean and only the strong survive. Eleven years after its premiere at the National Theatre, Glengarry Glen Ross returns to London; and in Sam Mendes' production at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden it emerges more clearly than ever as a sad, half remembered distortion of a great American ideal: a dream, if not the dream, of independence and toughness, individual self-fulfilment in a territory bristling with dangers. Can it be that what the Western genre once epitomised for the American male has been sublimated into ruthless commercial competition, and something as ignoble as worthless real estate selling? Yes, according to David Mamet in his most successful play. That may be pitching it high, but the play's language gives off the sweaty-leather crackle of machismo illuminating a set of values where the ultimate terms of abuse are 'fairy', 'woman' and 'f--ing child'. For all its rhapsodically streamlined profanity, Glengarry is a wistful work, whose tawdry characters yearn for vast horizons to explore and sunsets to ride into once manhood has been tested and proved. Instead of the purple sage these men act out their destinies against the Chinese restaurants and cocktail bars of Chicago. Johan Engels's design uses the old warehouse's brick wall to suggest the entrapping city as the real estate salesmen thrust, parry, miss, strike home, and occasionally communicate at the restaurant-table of the opening scene, slowly revolving, as if a film camera was circling them with scientific detachment. The American dream of the masculine and the individual has shrunk to the desperate rivalry among land dealers, not far removed from con-men as they sell worthless land to the old and gullible, vying for the bonus, the car, the vacation; or, even more desperately, to hold on to the job. This production strikes me as funnier and less intense than the original. Perhaps the language has less of a bulldozer impact, perhaps we have become more cynical about the ethics of market forces; either way the plot of paranoid conspiracy is less shocking than it was. The cast is British, accomplished and slightly lightweight which adds to the play's emergence as a comedy, albeit a comedy set in the jungle. James Bolam, more Irish than American, as the salesman going over the hill to find a precipice on the other side, changes brilliantly from cock-a-hoop champ to aghast failure, his face sagging blankly in defeat. John Benfield's thicky is a little too dumb to have survived so long in this jungle; but Ron Cook's smooth-talking conner, spivvy and plausible, is a convincing golden boy of the soft sell. Only his lack of stature detracts from his fits of rage. At the Donmar Warehouse until August 27. Tel 071-867 1150.</p>

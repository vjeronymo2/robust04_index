			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / The Property Market: A mountain of debt - How will banks be repaid? A look at a revealing report It took more than three years to clear the pile of debt and unlet properties after the property crash of 1973-74. Mopping up the damage from the current property slump will take longer. The predicament facing lenders to the industry may not be as acute as it was in the 1970s, when it triggered a crisis in the secondary banking sector. But it is more severe in several respects. The scale of the property debt mountain, the deepness of the downturn and the impact of economic policies suggest that recovery will be more drawn out than that following the 1973-74 crash. The dilemma facing property lenders stems from the heady days between 1985 and early 1991 when loans to the property industry grew at twice the rate as for the market as a whole. Banks assumed that when their loans matured, investors would provide the funds to repay the loans. That assumption has proved mistaken. Banks are being forced to refinance and roll over loans on a previously unimaginable scale. A report on property finance by Debenham Tewson Research* - based on interviews with 20 banks which account for more than half the outstanding property debt in the UK market - found that up to 75 per cent of some banks' loans have failed to be repaid on maturity. The report says that investors have been reluctant to bail out the banks. 'The large influx of debt into commercial property over the last five years has so radically affected the market structure that, rather than converging, the debt and equity sectors are polarising . . . Current institutional preferences are focused on markets unaffected by recent bank lending, thus leaving bankers in relative isolation to resolve their problems.' If loans are paid back at their current rate - in the year to May, loans to the UK property sector fell by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 38.6bn - it will take more than six years to reduce the burden to a comfortable level - about Pounds 25bn or 8 per cent of the banks' industrial and commercial loan book. At first sight, the investors' reluctance to come to the rescue of the banks is surprising at a time when property is widely considered to be cheap, both on a historical basis and relative to gilts. The explanation partially lies with the investors' avoidance of the type of property held by banks. They know that the banks control a large level of supply, which could be dumped onto the market if their patience runs out. 'At present there is a stand-off between the banks which control a large level of supply and are seeking to preserve values, and investors who are discounting prices because they perceive that the potential supply is so large,' says Debenham Tewson. In addition, much of the property on which banks have made loans is unlet, thus detering investors. Debenham Tewson estimates that Pounds 17bn-Pounds 18bn of the outstanding debt was for speculative development loans. The banks' tendency to crowd into the same areas of the market (central London offices) means that many of their buildings are chasing the same limited supply of tenants. Investors' are unlikely to repeat their performance of the mid-1970s when the UK pension funds and life companies bought property enthusiastically. Take-up has, however, increased, with a growth in institutional net purchases from a little less than Pounds 600m in 1990 to Pounds 2bn in 1991. But this trend may not continue in the face of static institutional cash flow, competition from gilts and a decline in institutional commitment to property. Overseas investors will be an increasingly important source of funds. Their investment of more than Pounds 1.5bn during 1991 was barely half the totals for 1989 and 1990, but it was from a wider variety of sources and promises to be more sustained. The UK corporate sector is another potentially important source of funds. However this is likely to be limited by the overgeared state of most companies. The bulk of the Pounds 1.3bn raised on the stock exchange during 1991 by property companies was devoted to repairing damaged balance sheets. Banks are unlikely to prove a useful source of liquidity. Banks are 'negative' about requests to refinance existing debt held with another bank, says Debenham. 'To many bankers this was a sign of a borrower whose problems had got out of control and in search of a lifeline.' The Debenham report states that banks are expecting a sizeable contraction of their property loan book, fuelled by problem loans and tightening capital adequacy requirements. Three-quarters of lenders surveyed have reduced their potential funds. About a third, overwhelmingly overseas banks, are closing their property loan book. European banks, chiefly German, are widely seen as active lenders. One aspect of the property lending problems that contrasts with that of the 1970s is the relatively small number of receiverships. This is because in the 1970s the debt was mostly held by secondary banks; this time round lending is focused on larger and more stable banks, which are unwilling to put lenders into receivership because of the potential loss of asset value. That said, it is still not certain that syndicates of banks that made large collective loans will hold together. Some of the larger banks interviewed by Debenham feared that as patience reached its limits, syndicates would cave in. If the consensus view of banks is correct, there will be a slow upturn. On this view, it seems likely that the resolution of their problems will be quicker than many analysts currently predict. As the economy improves, the supply of desirable property will increase. Banks are also likely to find innovative solutions to their lending problems, such as debt-for-equity swaps. But it seems highly improbable that the problem could be resolved as rapidly as in the 1970s. High real interest rates are widening the shortfall between revenue and borrowing costs, increasing the real cost of the debt burden. During the recovery from the 1970s crash , it was possible to borrow for as little as 13-14 per cent below inflation. This time round, interest rates are 7 per cent above inflation, one of the highest levels since the 1945. Money into Property by Debenham Tewson Research.

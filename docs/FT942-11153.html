			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid rebounds after Gonzalez performance Bourses recovered some ground in the afternoon, with political uncertainties offering a variety of effects, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID got another pound of flesh as Mr Carlos Solchaga, effectively the Spanish Socialist party's chief whip, added his resignation to those of two other goverment ministers; but it enjoyed an unflappable performance from the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, who refused to resign and pointed to support from the Catalan nationists. The currency, bond and equity markets went up in tandem. Mr Salvador Martinez, of the international sales desk at Asesores Bursatiles in Madrid, observed that equitities, down 6 per cent since the latest bout of political scandals began, would probably have risen if Mr Gonzalez had resigned, or called new elections. As it was, the market got an interim conclusion and, after hitting a low of 307.57, the general index responded with a rise of 4.68, or 1.5 per cent to 316.25. AMSTERDAM was easier, although a sharp fall in Philips, on profit-taking following strong results earlier in the week, was set against a good gain in Royal Dutch. The AEX index slipped 1.01 to 410.73. The market remained slightly uneasy following this week's general election. This resulted in a loss of power for the Christian Democrat/Labour party coalition, and necessitated the search for what is expected to be a three-way combine. NatWest Markets said that anew administration could be formed from the Labour party, the Christian Democrats and D66, a left-of-centre grouping, under the premiership of Mr Wim Kok, of Labour. This solution would be satisfactory for the Dutch financial markets, NatWest added, since there was likely to be a continuation of 'the reasonably tough monetary and fiscal stance of the previous Lubbers government, with no threat to the strong guilder.' Philips fell Fl 3.10 to Fl 53.50, while its Polygram subsidiary added Fl 1.90 to Fl 75.80. James Capel yesterday downgraded Polygram to hold, and said that it preferred Philips on the basis that, in the short-term, cyclical stocks were likely to outperform the market. Royal Dutch improved Fl 2.70 to Fl 200.70 helped by a gain in crude oil prices. PARIS took comfort from another slight easing by the Bank of France in the intervention rate - the third in as many weeks - and the CAC-40 index gained 21.05 or 1 per cent to 2,162.62. Turnover remained weak, estimated at below FFr3bn. One of the day's features was Rhone-Poulenc, off FFr3.20 at FFr151.80, but up from a session low of FFr148.20, following a sharp fall in first quarter profits. The chemical group's results were in line with most analysts' expectations. LVMH featured among the day's risers, the shares advancing FFr22 to FFr941, after it reported a 28 per cent increase in first quarter turnover. FRANKFURT fell on the session, the Dax index losing 13.18 at 2,235.84 under pressure from falling bond prices and worries about the weakness of the US dollar. However, the afternoon sawa bounce in the bund future, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, and the Ibis-indicated Dax went along, reaching a post-bourse close of 2,249.78. Turnover eased from DM8bn to DM7.8bn. Lufthansa resumed trading after a day's suspension to announce a rights issue and the privatisation of the government's stake in the airline; the share's outperformance over the past year, however, was reversed on profit-taking for a drop of DM13.80, or 6.3 per cent to DM206, and only slightly retrieved with a rise to DM208.40 after hours. ZURICH focused on falls in shares influenced by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank as Swiss equities continued their general downtrend. The SMI blue chip index fell to a new closing low of 2,680.8, down 24.8 but up from an intraday low of 2,667.3. Roche certificates, an Ebner target this year and an oasis of relative strength until recently, fell another SFr85 to SFr2,6265. Meanwhile, the BZ quoted investment offshoots, BK vision and PharmaVision, fell by SFr150 to SFr4,900, and by SFr60 to SFr1,375 respectively. There was talk that the BZ group's ability to continue buying its favoured stocks might be compromised by the recent ebb in enthusiasm for international equity investment. MILAN fell back as the market remained beset by uncertainty regarding the formation of the new administration. The Comit index lost 9.15 or 1 per cent to 774.04. Fiat went against the trend, adding L150 to L6,790 on an increase in car sales during April. Fondiaria recaptured Wednesday's losses, up L935 to L16,505. STOCKHOLM was encouraged both by a cut in interest rates and good first quarter results from Electrolux, whose B shares rose SKr6 to SKr429. The Affarsvarlden general index closed 10.2 higher at 1,523.9. ISTANBUL extended its technical rebound, rising another 5.1 per cent for a three-day gain of 12 per cent after a fall of 37 per cent since mid-April. The composite index ended 769.7 higher at 15,900.68. WARSAW saw a similar bounce, the Wig index rising 369.1, or 3.3 per cent to 11,389.4 after a fall of more than 20 per cent last week.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 16 January, during the  scheduled "Sunday" news feature program, carries a 3-minute  report on the Russian Cosmonauts recently returned to earth.    The report opens with a shot of Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr  Serebrov and Vasiliy Tsebliyev being picked up in a snow-covered  field, still in their space suits, and pans to a tent in the  fields, and finally to doctors checking the cosmonauts.    Correspondent Sergey Slichenko reports that news about  problems with spacecraft docking came one-and-half hours before  the landing of the crew. The landing was not without problems  either: the crew was found about 100 kilometers off the target  area.    A tent was erected in the middle of the snow-covered fields  where the two men landed, and it is in this tent that they spoke  to the correspondent while the doctors checked their physical  condition.    Cosmonaut Serebrov, looking pale and exhausted, comments on  the significance of Inca launching sites, while Cosmonaut  Tsebliyev says that during the 197 days of the mission he and  Serebrov did not have a single quarrel.    The correspondent then describes the technical problem the  two cosmonauts encountered during their mission. He says that  "the cosmonauts' last task was to photograph the docking point,  where the Americans will have to dock their shuttle. The  spacecraft left the space station, started circling it, and at  that moment Tsebliyev and Serebrov felt a thump, and it seemed  to them that they had bumped into the station.    "However, the crew of the Mir station did not feel anything  and according to their reports everything was fine there.  Experts at the space center are now analyzing the information  to determine whether there had been an accident and whether the  space station had been moved.    "However, this incident may turn out to be very useful. The  Russian spacecraft is considerably lighter than the American  shuttle and if the American shuttle were to bump into the space  station, this could have serious consequences. Now Russian  scientists have an opportunity to study such an eventuality,  even though they'll have to do so with a real situation, rather  than a theoretical one."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Power Assurance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter notes that power assurance requirements, as given in &sect;&sect;27.45(f) and 29.45(f), will be affected by these amendments and recommends the issuance of guidance material. The FAA recognizes the importance of the power assurance requirement for approval and use of these new OEI power ratings, and appropriate guidance material will be developed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Limiting Height-Speed Envelope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asks whether the 30-second power is the ``greatest power for which certification is requested'' as currently contained in &sect;&sect;27.79(b)(2) and 29.79(b)(1). For these amendments, 30-second power is the greatest power for which certification could be accomplished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Airworthiness Limitations Section <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter addressed the need for changes to Appendix A33.4, Airworthiness Limitations Section. Since this comment addresses part 33, it will be handled in the rulemaking effort underway addressing that part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides more detailed estimates of the economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs to the private sector, consumers, and Federal, State and local governments, as well as anticipated benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a ``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly defined exigencies, to determine if the rules constitute ``significant regulatory action.'' ``Significant regulatory action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. ``Significant regulatory action'' is submitted to centralized regulatory review by OIRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not ``a significant regulatory action.'' However, a cost-benefit analysis, including evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule has been prepared. This analysis also contains the regulatory flexibility determination required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and a Trade Impact Assessment. If more detailed economic information is desired, the reader may refer to the full evaluation contained in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of the new optional rating structure will provide significant benefits to operators of Category A helicopters. Category A helicopters are multiengine, can withstand any single engine becoming inoperative, and can continue safe flight or landing within a demonstrated field size. In addition to increased payloads, the amendments will enable rotorcraft operators to operate from significantly smaller heliports with the same degree of safety because of the decrease in the minimum required rejected takeoff distance for Category A operations. The rejected takeoff distance is the distance from the start of the takeoff to the stopping point after landing. The current regulation puts operators using shorter fields at a disadvantage because of the inability to satisfy Category A operational requirements. This increased operational flexibility should enable them to fly Category A operations and possibly use more efficient and profitable route structures (where larger fields are not available). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule establishes OEI ratings for periods of shorter duration than previously allowed and will provide an additional optional capability to manufacturers. The testing costs associated with obtaining these ratings should be viewed as the price of an additional capability and will be evaluated by the individual rotorcraft manufacturers based on market potential. The principal operational benefit of these new optional ratings is the ability to carry higher payloads from existing fields or to takeoff from smaller fields with current payloads. The AIA estimates that the use of the new rating structure for a given Category A mission could result in an increase in productivity of 48 percent for a 37,000-pound design gross weight (DGW) helicopter, and up to 125 percent for a 7,500-pound DGW helicopter if operators who fly only Category A missions choose to take full advantage of the increase in payload that will be permitted. The AIA further notes that the public will also benefit from these changes because the availability of viable, short-field performance should encourage the development of downtown heliports, thereby enhancing convenience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a manufacturer considering a new design, the issue of whether to design a helicopter to accommodate engines capable of satisfying the new OEI rating scheme (use of the new ratings will affect helicopter performance standards as well as the structural and drive system requirements) will be influenced by the following factors: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The availability of appropriately sized engines (larger helicopters designed for Category A use will be able to use a smaller engine). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The OEI capability of competitive products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The operator mission requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The cost (for increased testing and increased engine performance) of obtaining the new OEI capability compared to the benefit derived from the increase in payload or flexibility of route structures afforded by this capability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The availability of the new OEI capability could provide substantial benefits to rotorcraft manufacturers and operators. However, such benefits are difficult to quantify because the number of products certificated to this standard cannot be estimated. In addition, the specific increase in dispatch payload cannot be estimated because it will depend on the specific rotorcraft design in relation to the engines that will be available. These optional ratings should enhance the ability of operators who are limited by current regulations to Category B operations, because of the small size fields they use to fly more Category A operations, which should improve their profitability. The extent of these benefits cannot be predicted since they will depend, to a large degree, on the mix of Category A and B operations that are chosen. The FAA has not been able to quantify these potential benefits either on a per-unit or industry-wide scale due to the changes in rotorcraft design and performance that these optional ratings could promote and the large number of highly variable factors that would influence the magnitude of the overall benefits. The FAA concludes that the optional OEI ratings will not have a negative impact on manufacturers or operators. Since these ratings are optional, manufacturers will provide this capability only if the additional costs can be recovered in the market place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA maintains that, after an engine failure under the revised regulations for limited-use ratings, safety will be at least equivalent to operational safety under the previous regulations. This condition is supported by the fact that these 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings are ``limited use/mandatory inspection ratings.'' Following one mission cycle of rating use, specific requirements for inspection will have to be met to verify continued airworthiness of the engine. Under current regulations, there is no requirement for an inspection following an OEI power application. Any rotorcraft parts found to be unsuitable for further use must be replaced after application of these ratings. As a result of new test and analysis requirements, a high level of safety will be maintained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

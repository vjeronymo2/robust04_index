			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM pulls Dow lower on broker downgrade Wall Street A SHARP decline in the IBM share price caused stocks to decline across the board in light trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.18 at 3,365.14. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.17 to 422.19, while the American SE composite shed 1.92 to 389.90 and the Nasdaq composite lost 4.45 to 576.87. Turnover on the New York SE totalled 172m shares and falls outpaced advances by 1,023 to 717. Most analysts were unperturbed by yesterday's decline, arguing that it was natural for the market to undergo a short period of consolidation and profit-taking following last week's strong advances. They also said the fact that share prices have only given back a few points suggested that the market is resilient, and may have room for further gains over the next week or so. The day's only economic news was the release of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on economic conditions, which had little effect on the stock market. The report found that economic activity remained 'uneven', but it noted some improvement in retail sales and manufacturing. IBM was the feature of the day after broking house Smith Barney downgraded its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold' and reduced its estimate for earnings in 1992 from Dollars 6.85 a share to Dollars 5.80; it also reduced its forecast for 1993. An explanation for the downgrade was not forthcoming, although it may have been linked to comments from an IBM executive, who said revenues from mainframe computers and related operating systems will be flat to lower in the second half of this year. IBM finished Dollars 2 3/4 down at Dollars 91 5/8 after turnover of 2.6m shares. News that the recovery in the auto industry had stalled in late July hurt car shares; figures released on Tuesday showed flat sales of domestic cars at the end of the month. Ford Motor retreated Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 and General Motors slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 , while Chrysler eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 21 7/8 , all in active trading. Clorox dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 after the company announced that it was taking a Dollars 32m pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter for write-downs and a Dollars 36m total charge for the full year to cover the cost of accounting adjustments. Global Natural Resources firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 7/8 after the company said that a new export tax exemption granted by the Russian Federation will have a positive effect on its venture in Tatarstan. On the Nasdaq market, leading issues led a retreat. The most notable declines were Microsoft, down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 72, Amgen, Dollars 1 cheaper at Dollars 66 1/4 , Apple Computer, Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 44 3/4 , and Borland International, Dollars 2 1/8 weaker at Dollars 42 1/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks kept pace with a lacklustre Wall Street to close moderately lower after thin volume. Cuts in prime rates by Canada's leading banks to 6.50 per cent from 6.75 per cent had little effect on the market. Bank shares ended broadly lower. The TSE 300 index was finally 19.8 off at 3,406.2 and declines led rises by 310 to 197 after turnover of 22.5m shares. Mitel, which jumped to the top of the actives list on Tuesday and climbed to a 52-week high, lost 18 cents to CDollars 2.38 after disappointing the market with a first-quarter loss of 10 cents versus a deficit of 8 cents in the year-ago period.</p>

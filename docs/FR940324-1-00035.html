			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is concerned with granting, or with the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granting, precertification exemptions when the ICI has failed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete the certification process and obtain certificates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity for other prototype vehicles previously entered under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this exemption. EPA is also concerned about the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of some ICIs, that the ICIs successfully modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending precertification vehicles, and that the ICIs continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with all requirements of the Imports regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, EPA is proposing limits to precertification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing an automatic limit of no more than three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precertification exemptions to an ICI at any one time except upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a case-by-case determination that the ICI has demonstrated an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to meet the EPA technical and time requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional prototype vehicle as well as for all other vehicles it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has already imported. Absent such approval, the ICI will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted another precertification exemption until a certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the existing prototype vehicle(s) is obtained or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle(s) unable to be brought into conformity with Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission requirements has been exported. Secondly, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of outstanding precertification exemptions, EPA also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not grant another precertification exemption if the ICI is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in noncompliance with the Imports regulations for any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle already imported until the noncompliance situation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolved. When determining whether to grant approval of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional exemptions, EPA will consider such factors as an ICI's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously demonstrated success in obtaining certificates of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity in a timely manner, accurate and efficient compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all certification procedures, extent of progress on other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outstanding precertification exemptions, and whether the ICI is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will likely be in compliance with all requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Imports regulations for other vehicles it has already imported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also proposing the following clarifications to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precertification process to eliminate confusion associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final admission of prototype vehicles. The prototype vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the first vehicle imported and tested under the certificate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conformity for the purposes of testing every third (or fifth)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle under 40 CFR 85.1505. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current regulations, an ICI must obtain a certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of conformity within 180 days of the date of entry of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototype vehicle. If not, then either the total amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bond is forfeited or the vehicle is exported. EPA recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are limited instances when it is not possible to obtain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate of conformity within 180 days. Therefore, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing that an extension of the 180 day requirement may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> granted by the Administrator. The length of the extension will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined by EPA on a case-by-case basis considering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of each ICI. The ICI must request such an extension prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the expiration of the 180 days. EPA expects to grant such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests only under unique circumstances. For example, EPA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expect to grant an extension to an ICI who has completed all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications for the vehicle and certification testing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pending, but circumstances beyond the ICI's control have led to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to obtain the certificate of conformity within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required 180 days. EPA specifically will not grant an extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for situations such as (but not limited to) when an ICI allows a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant amount of time to elapse in which significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress was not made on the vehicle, or when an ICI fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit in a timely manner the application for certification (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable parts, thereof) to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ICI must comply with all requirements of Subpart P once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certification process is complete, including the submittal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final admission forms as stated in 40 CFR 85.1505, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping requirements and labeling requirements of 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85.1706 and any other requirements of 40 CFR 85.1501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Arts: Goldoni at full tilt - Theatre Michael Bogdanov's production transfers from The Swan at Stratford with his most frustrating hallmark intact; a keen and often audacious grasp of the big picture coupled with a tendency to let individual details slip sloppily by and undermine his overall vision. Two hundred years ago Carlo Goldoni's The Venetian Twins was the first commedia dell'arte play successfully to be staged with the actors neither wearing masks nor improvising freely among the basic scenario, but following a set script. For the most part Bogdanov goes full tilt for the commedia flavour, modulated for modern sensibilities after the example of Dario Fo. Actors do not just soliloquise at, but banter and interact with the audience - culminating in a sequence in which a supposedly hapless punter in the front row is accidentally stabbed during a duel, cueing a stage invasion by police, ambulancemen and even a couple of curious actors from the show in the Pit. Audience contact is aided by Bogdanov and designer Kendra Ullart's solution to recreating the intimacy of the smaller Swan space: they simply sit a couple of dozen punters on the Barbican stage, some at pavement tables of a Veronese bar. David Troughton is both the linchpin of these diverse frolics and the primary source of the energy which sustains the play's central premise through almost three hours; he plays the Twins Zanetto and Tonino, sundered years back and both coincidentally arriving in Verona to wed their respective beloveds. The ensuing confusion, both romantic and financial (as one twin walks off with the other's riches and so forth) is straight out of Plautus via The Comedy of Errors. But Troughton, as both the Venetian roue Tonino and the Bergmot bumpkin Zanetto, puts his back into the quick changes, slapstick and ad libbed topical asides - perhaps too much so: on the press night, one caught a distinct whiff of the rehearsed fluff, with Troughton deliberately tripping over lines for the sake of another giggle. Such excess is forgivable because he carries the show virtually single handed. This is where Bogdanov's big idea becomes unstuck. Actors simply do not accommodate each other's rhythms and energy levels in the way that would elevate the production from simply nodding acknowledgment at commedia to actually doing it. The women in particular (Sarah Woodward and Jenny Quayle as the wives-to-be and Sian Radinger as a supposedly feisty maidservant), make no attempt to grab a slice of the action for themselves, but are content to be pulled along by the action - lazy acting at the best of times, and verging on the disastrous in such a play as this. Only James Hayes, as a deadpan Irish manservant, carves a niche of his own to rival Troughton's towering exuberance. Modish contemporary sensibilities also ruin the ending. We all realise that the death of one of the twins is merely a device to prevent the lead actor from having to bi-locate himself during the denouement; yet, if the resolution contains elements of potential shadow, current tastes dictate that the darkness control be turned up to 12 if at all possible. Bogdanov, alas, does not shirk this impulse. Consequently, as the artificial gloom gathers at the close, the audience is left vainly trying to feel guilty about its earlier guffaws, before growing just plain bewildered at an allegedly grotesque, but simply gratuitous masked epilogue. David Troughton's effervescent twin performances are indubitably worth a look: it would have been nice if more of the production had backed him up. At the Barbican Theatre, (RSC) 071 638 8891.</p>

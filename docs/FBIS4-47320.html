O. Petrosyants, I. A. Kharitonov, Moscow </F> State Institute of Electronics and Mathematics (Technical  University); UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] A modified model of a MIS transistor is  developed which, in contrast to standard models, provides a  continuous description of the volt-ampere characteristic,  providing a more accurate model of analog circuits operating in  pre-threshold mode. The slope and displacement of model  pre-threshold characteristics is determined by induced charges  which reflect physical processes in the irradiated structure. A  new method of determining threshold voltages and current from  measured volt-ampere characteristics is proposed. Compared to  the method which determines threshold voltage at a constant  current, this method more accurately describes the volt-ampere  characteristic of irradiated transistors in weak inversion mode.  The standard model of a bipolar transistor is supplemented with  recombination components of the base current that arise in  various areas of the structure. Each recombination component is  unambiguously physically linked with the electrophysical  parameters of the semiconductor structure, the geometric  dimensions, and the radiation dose. Consequently, the new model  can rather easily evaluate various design variants of transistor  structures from the point of view of radiation resistance.  Software has been developed to determine model parameters and  radiation coefficients for this model. Figures 8; references 24:  4 Russian, 20 Western.</p>

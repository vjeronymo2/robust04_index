			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Recovery? It's enough to make Bush burn - Wall Street GEORGE Bush is probably still gagging on his turkey and trimmings. While the rest of the country celebrated Thanksgiving this week, the outgoing president must have felt there was precious little for which to give thanks on Thursday, the most popular holiday in the American calendar. Less than a month after his election defeat, the economic recovery that Bush trumpeted repeatedly throughout his campaign - the economic recovery that no one else believed existed - looks to be picking up a nice head of steam, and the stock market is sitting up and taking notice. We have been through this before, most recently in the spring and early summer of 1991 when economic activity gathered pace in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf war, only to drop back into a swamp of stagnation a few months later. Two new factors, however, make the recent bullish economic data convincing. First, there is plenty of it: enough, at least, to suggest a sustainable trend is developing. Second, many of the numbers date back to a period before November, so a good deal of the improvements in business activity cannot be put down to a giddy post-election euphoria of the kind that created a false economic dawn in the UK. Equity investors certainly seem convinced that something genuine is afoot this time. Blue chips have done well in the past 10 days. The Dow Jones index is up more than 100 points in the past week and a half; by mid-morning yesterday, it looked as if it might break the 3,300 mark for the first time since mid-September. It is the broader market, however, that has really caught fire. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is trading at an all-time high of just over 430, while the Nasdaq composite index is also in virgin territory. Yesterday morning, it was at 649.95 and rising to a new record. These gains have not been achieved in a thin market, either. Turnover has been unusually strong of late. In only eight of the past 29 sessions has the volume of shares traded dropped below 200m and turnover has been in the 240m-250m range on several occasions, even topping 285m on one day. Investor demand for equities is picking up because market conditions must look particularly appealing at the moment. The economy is growing at a solid pace, interest rates remain low, and inflation still appears subdued. There is also a plentiful supply of new cash - low interest rates mean that individuals are continuing to move out of poor-yielding short-term assets and into equities - and the IPO (initial public offerings) market has once again burst into life to mop up some of that new money. It is the economic numbers, though, that have generated the most enthusiasm. On Tuesday, the news came out that durable goods orders had risen by 3.9 per cent in October, a much bigger increase than analysts had anticipated. Although the goods orders are notoriously volatile, and the latest data was affected by unsustainably high transport and defence orders, there were promising signs of life in electronic and electrical equipment and unfilled non-defence orders. On the same day, the Conference Board announced that its index of consumer confidence had soared nearly 11 points to 65.5 in November, reinforcing the growing perception that consumers are beginning to feel appreciably more positive about their earning and spending prospects. With the all-important Christmas shopping season already beginning, this is especially good news for the retail sector. The biggest statistic of the week was the newly-revised third quarter gross domestic product figure. When the original estimate of a 2.7 per cent increase in GDP was reported just before the election, many Wall Street sages voiced doubts about the veracity of the data, arguing that the numbers had been massaged to cast a more positive political light on economic conditions. In the event, the doubting analysts were right that the figures were off-track. But they proved to have under-estimated the extent of economic growth. According to the new data, GDP grew by a handsome 3.9 per cent in the July-to-September period. The news must have made sad reading in the White House, where Bush's chief spokesman said valiantly that the 'Bush recovery' was under way. But for President-elect Clinton, the growing economy is a double-edged sword. It might make his job easier next year, but delivering the substantial fiscal-stimulus package he promised voters during the campaign becomes a riskier proposition. The last thing the US and its markets need next year, and in 1994, is an overheated economy.  ------------------------------------- Monday        3223.04   -    4.32 Tuesday        3248.7   +   25.66 Wednesday     3266.26   +   17.56 Thursday      Holiday Friday        3282.20   +   15.94  -------------------------------------</p>

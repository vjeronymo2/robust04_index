			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LONDON THEATERS HIT BY JINX  </P> <P> Falling scenery, curtains that won't go up and revolving stages that refuse to  turn have caused a series of mishaps in London theaters in the last 10 days,  prompting a safety investigation.  </P> <P> The latest incident occurred Thursday night at a gala opening at the Royalty  Theater of "A Clockwork Orange."  </P> <P> The curtain refused to go up for the second half of the Royal Shakespeare  Company production.  </P> <P> The star-studded audience downed free drinks offered by the embarrassed  management as stage staff struggled for 15 minutes before getting the curtain  to go up.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Stephen Sondheim musical "Sunday in the Park with George" at the  Lyttelton Theater was halted in mid-performance when a wooden tree, part of the  scenery, fell from a hook as it was being carried off the stage, narrowly  missing an actor.  </P> <P> On April 24, a hydraulic jack at the Olivier Theater broke down, preventing the  revolving stage from turning. The play "The School for Scandal" was canceled in  mid-performance.  </P></p>

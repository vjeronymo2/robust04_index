			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLES OF LIGHT  </P> <P> The art of Joseph Shuldiner proves that sometimes the best form does follow  function. He created his first translucent lighting sculptures when he needed  lamps himself.  </P> <P> "I had moved into a house where there were no fixtures, so I took one of my  sculptures and stuck a bulb in it."  </P> <P> At first glance, the sculptures are reminiscent of world-renowned Isamu  Noguchi's paper lights. But Shuldiner credits other inspirational sources as  well, namely the 1919 silent film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." "I've been  inspired ever since by bizarre angles," he says; "Caligari" is the name of his  newest lamp. Shuldiner uses rice paper and willow branches, indigenous to the  area, to create his sculptures in his Los Angeles studio. Each takes a day to  assemble, and his father -- a retired sheet-metal worker who never thought of  himself as an artist -- helps devise the hardware that holds the bulbs. "A  small piece of sculpture in itself," Shuldiner says proudly.  </P> <P> When his graceful fixtures stand side-by-side, they resemble a glimmering,  surreal city skyline. "My work is about the juxtaposition of the organic and  industrial," Shuldiner explains, "a modern metropolis realized in primitive,  organic materials."  </P> <P> The sculptures are so popular that Shuldiner is still in the same predicament  as when he began. "Right now," he says," I don't have any lamps in my own  house: Somehow I always end up selling them." BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

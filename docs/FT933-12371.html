			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The scrutiny of a most unlikely alliance - Medeva's future following a tough week on the stock market FEW CORPORATE bosses could be more grateful that this weekend has arrived than Mr Bernard Taylor and Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, respectively chairman and managing director of Medeva. Within the space of a week, they have watched the stock market value of their rapidly growing drug company halve from Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m, following what looked like a modest profits warning on Monday. Worst of all, investors have deserted the company in droves, apparently no longer prepared to believe that Medeva can manage its novel strategy of building a pharmaceuticals company by acquisition rather than through research and development. The company that has attracted suspicion and excitement in equal measure, but was gathering support thanks to the persuasive efforts of Mr Taylor and Mr Gowrie-Smith, has stopped dead in its tracks. Medeva's share price collapse was triggered by loss of operating control at two subsidiaries in the US. IMS, in California, which supplies hospitals with drug delivery systems, discovered its sales were lower than reported because stocks had doubled at its wholesalers' warehouses. More seriously, MD Pharmaceutical, which makes the Federal controlled amphetamine, methylphenidate, had been told by the Food and Drug Administration that it had 'serious deviations' from good manufacturing practice which were causing drugs to be 'adulterated'. Closed briefly, MD is operating again but awaiting the FDA's judgment on whether changes it has implemented are adequate. While profits are now forecast to fall Pounds 10m below expectations to about Pounds 45m in 1993 - still a 25 per cent increase on the year but a fall in earnings per share - the real damage has been done to management credibility . Not surprisingly, shareholders who provided Pounds 320m in rights issues and placings to fund this growth are putting the partnership between Mr Gowrie-Smith and Mr Taylor under intense scrutiny. It was always a most unlikely alliance: Mr Gowrie-Smith, the deal-maker from a stockbroking and corporate finance background in Australia; Mr Taylor, corporation climber who rose to chief executive of Glaxo, one of the UK's most successful companies in the 1980s, before being ruthlessly removed in a boardroom coup. Mr Gowrie-Smith's path is the most colourful. He made his seed money in the 1980s in what he once described as 'hectic market trading' in Sydney. A true entrepreneur, he once registered The Frozen Yoghurt Company name in case a fashion in the US at the time took off in Australia. The company never traded but it was the kind of venture that gave Mr Gowrie-Smith a more racy profile than he might have wanted a decade later as the head of an international pharmaceuticals concern. His breakthrough came when he found a stock market vehicle, Griffiths Bros, a tea company into which he backed a number of investments including a greatly under-valued natural resources company. But outflanked by a partner in 1986, he was forced to sell his stake. Cash rich but without a vehicle, Mr Gowrie-Smith was skiing in Aspen, Colorado, six months ahead of the 1987 crash, when he realised the world stock markets were overheating. He moved to London, and with the help of stockbrokers TC Coombes floated Medirace to exploit research into cancer and Aids treatments being developed by scientists at London's Hammersmith Hospital. The story of Contracan, the compound developed by Medirace, is controversial. The scientists claimed that Contracan in animal tests had 'inhibited the spread of cancer and progression of Aids infection.' Contracan's scientific pedigree was also endorsed by Mr Taylor two years later when, to an excited buzz in the City, he emerged as a possible head of Medirace after leaving Glaxo. This view was not universally held. According to one of the most respected drug sector analysts - and now a fan of Medeva which Medirace was to become  -the claims for Contracan were never likely to stand up to scrutiny. Contracan, indeed, sank without trace when Mr Taylor stopped the research programme six months after coming on board. The transformation from a speculative company developing a single drug to today's Medeva, with sales of Pounds 157m last year, depended on Mr Taylor coming on board. After a long career in Glaxo's marketing department, Mr Taylor had risen by 1985 to the chief executive slot under the chairmanship of Sir Paul Girolami. Years of development had preceded him, but Mr Taylor is credited with having overseen the period of Glaxo's growth when Zantac became the world's largest selling drug. While Mr Gowrie-Smith was raising Pounds 1.2m to float Medirace in 1987, Mr Taylor was publicly proclaiming that Glaxo would join Merck, Hoechst and Ciba-Geigy among the world's top drug companies. Then, out of the blue in 1989, Mr Taylor resigned. In a legendary meeting at the Venice home of Sir Paul Mr Taylor was replaced by Mr Ernest Mario, considered then and until he too departed in March, as better suited to be heir-apparent at Glaxo. The next day Mr Gowrie-Smith asked Mr Taylor to join Medirace. After hesitating, Mr Taylor said he would join on condition that Medirace went ahead with an Pounds 87m deal to buy Evans Medical, a maker of cheap generic drugs. It was a marriage of convenience. For Mr Taylor, it was a way back and a chance to make a serious amount of money. For Mr Gowrie-Smith, Glaxo's ex-chief executive lent Medirace the credibility it clearly lacked; Medirace's new advisers, Laing and Cruickshank, who underwrote the rights issue with Mr Gowrie-Smith also knew that Mr Taylor had sold Evans to its management three years earlier when he was at Glaxo and knew the business backwards. That first acquisition led to 15 other deals. While Mr Taylor grew accustomed to his strategy being questioned in a manner he never faced at Glaxo, Mr Gowrie-Smith progressed from just putting the deals together to presenting them to analysts, experts who three years ago would have run rings around him. For the moment, however, the wheels have come off. Mr Taylor says the IMS and MD mishaps resulted from weak management control. But while Mr Taylor says that responsibility for this management problem 'lies at one place and that is on my desk', it is the deal-making Mr Gowrie-Smith, if anyone, who looks most exposed. Only when confidence in management is restored will Medeva be able to resume the acquisition-led policy Mr Taylor says investors backed management to do. By Mr Taylor's measure, confidence will have been restored when Medeva's price earnings ratio is back in line with the sector average, implying the share price needs to almost double from the 108p close yesterday. And in the meantime, what role will Mr Gowrie-Smith assume? Mr Taylor says he needs a little time to respond to that. While he sees no reason why Medeva's path can not resume, 'the consequences of it (the acquisition freeze) are still to be fully identified.'</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Yeltsin softens rouble blow: Widespread chaos and anger as Russian central bank cancels old notes MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday watered down the central bank's abrupt cancellation of pre-1993 rouble notes, following a wave of protests by the public, in parliament and from within his own cabinet. After returning early from a two-week holiday, Mr Yeltsin issued a decree which moderates but leaves in place Saturday's central bank move to withdraw all Soviet and Russian notes printed between 1961 and 1992 in Russia and other former Soviet republics. The decree raises the amount of cash individuals can exchange from Rbs35,000 (Pounds 23) to Rbs100,000 and extends the period in which this can be done from August 7 to August 31. It also allows the free exchange of the 10,000 rouble note, even if it bears the 1992 date. But his decision partially to back the central bank gravely disappointed reformists in the government, who had earlier in the day hoped that he would simply annul the ruling. Mr Yeltsin's move, which failed to heal the widening rift within his own government, came amid scenes of anger and confusion in the country's streets. Russians - many elderly - queued at the doors of the savings banks which had been told to exchange their old roubles. However, many of the banks stayed closed for the day. At shops and kiosks, old notes were refused but few had a supply of new notes. Holidaymakers in Sochi and other Black Sea resorts found themselves unable to pay hotel bills and fares home, while businesses, both Russian and foreign, tried unsuccessfully to convert large balances drawn out to meet their end-of-the-month bills. There were widespread complaints at the ill-explained, unexpected and confiscatory measure. Western officials inside and outside Russia also expressed concern at the growing disarray within the government and its possible impact on Russia's fragile economic reforms. There is also concern over the future of the reforms among officials in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. The G7 earlier this year agreed a Dollars 44bn package to assist the Russian economy. Officials expressed a loss of confidence in a process which had appeared promising over the past two months, and said there were growing difficulties about agreeing further tranches of assistance to the authorities in Moscow. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the adviser to the Russian government, said that the central bank's move was 'inexcusable' and reflected a 'Communist mentality in the leadership'. The action might be 'designed to cover up corruption'. It 'fundamentally contravenes the trust needed in a nation's legal tender to achieve macroeconomic stability and to end capital flight'. Parliament's conservative chairman Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov threatened to recall parliament to sack any official responsible for the plan unless it were amended. Reflecting the deep divisions in the government over the measure, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance, demanded yesterday from Washington that it be annulled. Earlier he called the move a 'Stalinist, socialist' measure. The bank's move was backed by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and brusquely announced to his senior ministers on Friday night. There was no consultation with any finance minister, nor with Mr Yeltsin, nor with the leaderships of the former Soviet republics which remain within the rouble zone. Mr Fyodorov, who returns to Moscow today, faces a critical choice whether to live with the compromise announced by Mr Yeltsin or continue his fight for annulment.

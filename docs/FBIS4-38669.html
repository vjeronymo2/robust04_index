			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 31 May 31 (SNARK) -- "There prepared 33  agreements in previous seven rounds of the Russian-Georgian  negotiations," said to the journalists at his today's press  conference the Georgian Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandr  Chikvaidze.    "Practically, we created the legislative basis for  development of the relations between two states."    Aleksandr Chikvaidze denied the reports, some mass media  spread, on the fact that there, at the negotiations, were  determined the terms of the Russian troops' existence on the  territory of Georgia -- 50 years. Aleksandr Chikvaidze said,  "no terms were discussed at the negotiations."    Speaking on the Russian military bases creation on the  territory of Georgia, Mr. Chikvaidze said, "If only Georgia  offers her territory for Russian military bases, she should get  something in exchange. This question couldn't be solved without  referendum, without Parliament's content. Yet some more rounds  of negotiations are being expected." The eighth round of  negotiations is expected by the end of June.</p>

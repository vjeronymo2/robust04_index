			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Yokohama Rubber slips in first half YOKOHAMA Rubber, the Japanese tyremaker, yesterday said the downturn in the domestic car market had led to a decline in pre-tax profit for the first half to between Y4.5bn (Dollars 36m) and Y5bn, down from the Y5.6bn of a year ago. Sales for the half-year to the end of June had been forecast at Y150bn, but that figure was revised to Y140bn, as the company reported slower demand for new car tyres and for replacement tyres. Reductions in capital spending by Japanese industry also slowed sales of industrial rubber products, which account for about 21 per cent of Yokohama's total sales. For the full year, the company revised its sales forecast from Y305bn to Y300bn, still slightly higher than the Y295bn of last year, and left its pre-tax profit forecast at Y12.3bn, down from Y12.7bn. An increasing number of Japanese companies are having to revise profit and sales forecasts as the hoped-for recovery has not yet materialised and there are signs the economy will remain weak until early next year. Suppliers to the leading carmakers are under particular pressure as domestic auto sales have been in decline for the past year, though Toyota Motor, the leading maker, this week said the market appeared to have touched bottom. The strengthening of the yen in recent weeks is also likely to bruise second-half profits at manufacturers such as Yokohama, which relies on exports for about 23 per cent of sales.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Insas to control Power in IPounds 50m deal Malaysia's Insas group will take control of Power Corporation, the Republic of Ireland-based property development group, under the terms of a memorandum of understanding agreed by the two companies. Insas, an investment holding company quoted on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange since 1969, has conditionally agreed to subscribe IPounds 50m (Pounds 49m) for new ordinary shares in Power as part of a complex capital reconstruction involving a placing and open offer. The investment is subject to a number of conditions including the completion of discussions between Power and its bankers over the proposed capital reconstruction and the rescheduling of a portion of Power's debts. The proposed reconstruction also includes reducing the par value of Power's 116m shares from 10p to 5p. Following this, about 1bn of new ordinary shares with 200m detachable warrants will be issued to Insas as part of a placing and open offer at a price 'that would not differ materially from the current market price.' Power's shares closed unchanged at 5 1/2 p on Friday. Each warrant will entitle the holder to subscribe to one new Power share until September 30, 2004. Power plans to raise up to a further IPounds 50m through a simultaneous placing and open offer of a similar number of shares and warrants, which will be underwritten by Credit Lyonnais. Insas recently disclosed that it held a 4 per cent stake in Liberty, the upmarket fabric and fashion group, and confirmed that it was acting in concert with Mr Brian Myerson's family vehicle - Concerto Capital Corporation - which holds a 12.8 per cent in Liberty. Under the terms of the memorandum Insas' 900,000 share stake in Liberty will be sold to Power in exchange for new ordinary shares with warrants worth about Pounds 4m. Once completed, Insas, which plans to use part of a planned MDollars 600m (Pounds 150m) rights issue to finance its investment in Power, will hold just less than a 50 per cent stake in the Irish group and will gain control of the board. Insas' managing director, Mr Thong Kok Khee, will become Power's chief executive. Power intends to use the remaining cash from Insas' subscription and the placing and open offer, totalling about IPounds 70m, to acquire and develop more shopping centres.</p>

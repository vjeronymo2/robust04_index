Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna:    [Begin recording] According to a report to be submitted to a  special Board of Governors' meeting on the result of the North's  nuclear facilities inspections, it has been revealed for the  first time that the IAEA conducted a non-destructive analysis,  involving neutron and gamma measurement to grasp the substance  and replacement timing of the spent fuel rods of the 5-megawatt  reactor's spent fuel storage.    Regarding this, nuclear experts analyzed that when things  are  taken together from the recent inspection results, North Korea  has replaced some nuclear fuel rods since last February. North  Korea had maintained that it has not replaced the 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor's fuel rods. They said the result of the  analysis of the nuclear fuel rod counter [kyesugi] which watches  the movement of the spent nuclear fuel will prove this.    The report stressed that the continuity of the inspection  can  be maintained only when inspections of the 5-megawatt nuclear  reactor are resumed after six weeks.    The report also revealed that an IAEA inspection team was  restricted from making inspections -- such as extracting samples  and wastes of nuclear materials, and measuring radioactivity --  from the six major facilities -- including a plutonium refinery  facility inside the radiochemical laboratory, a nuclear waste  storage, a reprocessing facility, and a radioactivity gas  filtering device [kicheyogwasisol], thus hinting that North  Korea has supplemented the indoor facilities of the reprocessing  facility for the last year.

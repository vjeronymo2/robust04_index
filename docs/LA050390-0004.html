			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINDING COMMON GROUND TO END MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS  </P> <P> The article by Cynthia Ozick on the story of two Jewish cousins who will never  meet makes me sad (Op-Ed Page, April 17). She tells of anti-Semitism in Russia  and by the Arabs.  </P> <P> It sounds hopeless. Then I think about a Beyond War Award ceremony I attended  last fall. One of the recipients was a village in Israel. In this village  Palestinians and Jews are living together, working together, cooperating and  relating to each other as very good friends. It was astounding to see how the  Jewish and the Arab representatives of the village spoke of their respect and  love for each other.  </P> <P> If people are given half a chance they will work together. They will solve  their mutual problems. I think that the best way that we can help people to  work together is to provide the framework for nations to work together. We now  try to solve things unilaterally. We should instead work to strengthen the  United Nations. Then problems that cannot be resolved by individual people and  nations would at least have a legal framework for doing so.  </P> <P> RICHARD FOY  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Health officials are working on a plan to increase the number of patients San  Francisco General Hospital can accept, especially poor and uninsured patients  who are apparently being diverted in an attempt to placate community hospitals  threatening to drop out of the 911 emergency ambulance system. Dr. David  Werdegar, public health director, said the new city budget would enable the  hospital to staff 40 to 60 more beds with nurses compared to the past year,  which would help curb the number of diversions. Lynn Baskett, spokeswoman for  the Hospital Council of Northern California, said the diversion practice has,  during a busy month, cost the nine private hospitals participating in the 911  system up to $200,000 each. "It's felt like the city was solving its budget  problems by being on (ambulance) diversion," she said. "And there was no  incentive not to divert. It saved the city money. And the patients got cared  for."  </P></p>

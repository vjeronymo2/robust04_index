			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP share peak challenge British Petroleum came within a whisker of breaching its all-time peak of 411 1/2 p, eventually closing the session a net 15 1/2 higher at 406 1/2 p. Turnover in BP was a heavy 15m shares. Driving the stock price ahead was some determined and sizeable buying interest from both sides of the Atlantic, with US institutions said to have been big buyers towards the close of business. Dealers said that a US Energy Department paper on the export of Alaskan oil is scheduled to go to the White House for approval by President Clinton. An approval of the export of Alaskan oil by the US authorities is thought by oil analysts to be worth in excess of Dollars 100m a year to BP's bottom line earnings. The US buying interest also focused on Shell Transport, which moved up 9 to 713p.</p>

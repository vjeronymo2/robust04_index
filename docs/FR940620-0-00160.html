			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed a sequential series of exceptions for public sidewalk curb ramps based upon right-of-way width. Many commenters recommended additional types of public sidewalk curb ramps, such as combinations of parallel and perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps. Individuals with disabilities and groups representing them strongly favored a requirement for a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp in all cases where a landing could be provided. Where a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp could not be provided with a landing because of narrow public sidewalks, these commenters preferred a requirement for a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp. Several jurisdictions submitted standard curb ramp specifications that were also based upon differences in right-of-way width. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule permits a sequential series of public sidewalk curb ramps, including diagonal and built-up public sidewalk curb ramps, to facilitate accessibility in constrained public rights-of-way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few municipalities in Texas have noted that their existing public sidewalks are elevated 18 to 27 inches above the level of the surrounding streets. Street crossings are reached by steps that may have risers of nine inches or more. The municipalities were concerned about means of providing ramped access under such conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  New construction and alterations provisions are based upon a curb height of six inches, the common public works standard. However, newly constructed curb heights may range between 2-1/2 inches for a combination rolled curb and gutter section to as much as nine inches on bridge and overpass construction, where future resurfacing may have to be taken into account when establishing finished grades. Alterations involving changes in level that exceed commonly-specified curb heights cannot be accommodated by typical public sidewalk curb ramp designs. In such cases it may be possible to provide access with ramps complying with ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps) within the width of the public sidewalk. Where public sidewalk levels diverge, a railing or other edge protection is advisable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters, including persons with disabilities, supported a requirement for public sidewalk curb ramps even when existing site conditions would require a steeply sloped or very narrow parallel public sidewalk curb ramp. Most commenters supported a requirement for a 36 inch continuous passage by a public sidewalk curb ramp but did not support a 36 inch landing at the top of the public sidewalk curb ramp because it was too narrow to make a turn. These commenters also supported cross slope limitations at 1:50. Most State and local governments, however, recommended that exceptions be provided for narrow rights-of-way and existing public sidewalks with excessive cross slope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule permits a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp in a public sidewalk that is less than 36 inches wide. It also permits a minimum 36 inch landing in alterations to maximize the usability of perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps constructed in existing developed rights-of-way. A 36 inch landing will accommodate the wheelbase of most wheelchairs and additional maneuvering space for a footrest may be available adjacent to public sidewalks to facilitate a turn at the top landing. Consistent with ADAAG 4.7 (Curb Ramps), the slope of side flares at public sidewalk curb ramps with landings less than 48 inches in length has been limited to 1:12. Landing slopes may be measured perpendicular to the curb face when a level landing cannot be provided. When site constraints preclude a 1:50 slope, the minimum feasible slope must be provided in both directions across a landing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed an alternate means of measuring public sidewalk curb ramp slope in existing public sidewalks. Although commenters supported this exception, they requested clarification of how it was to be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule permits public sidewalk curb ramps to be steeper than permitted by 14.3.2(2)(d) (i) and (ii) if a ramp complying with those provisions would extend more than 72 inches in length. To simplify field application, the alternative form of measurement has been eliminated and replaced by a straightforward limitation on the length that might be required as a result of the application of the maximum slope. Where the running slopes permitted in the special technical provisions could result in a public sidewalk curb ramp more than 72 inches long when measured from a level plane, the public sidewalk curb ramp need not extend more than 72 inches in length. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters requested clarification of whether special technical provisions in ADAAG 4.1.6(3)(a) (Ramps) apply to public rights-of-way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed above, ADAAG 14.3 no longer explicitly references ADAAG 4.1.6 (Accessible Buildings: Alterations). Instead, the interim final rule includes special technical provisions derived from ADAAG 4.1.6(3)(a) (Ramps) that permit public sidewalk curb ramps to have be steeper than 1:12 under specified conditions in alterations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters recommended that public sidewalk curb ramps be crowned or projected (built-up) beyond the curb face where existing gutter counter slope exceeds 1:20. This recommendation is also included in the APWA/AGC Standard Plans for Public Works Construction. This may avoid major alterations to adjacent gutters and curbs when a public sidewalk curb ramp is installed in an existing public sidewalk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule permits the installation of public sidewalk curb ramps with crowned or projected surfaces where gutter slopes exceed 1:20 in developed rights-of-way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.3.2(3)&blank;On-Street Parking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (3) permits accessible on-street parking to use public sidewalk curb ramps at intersections if motorists exiting their vehicles do not have to cross into perpendicular traffic lanes to gain access to a public sidewalk curb ramp.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM included an appendix note describing on-street parallel parking spaces without access aisles that utilize adjacent public sidewalk curb ramps. Several commenters from public works agencies discouraged on-street parallel parking adjacent to intersections, where sight distance may be limited, because of the danger from turning vehicles to persons transferring from parked cars into wheelchairs. However, persons with disabilities noted that even though such spaces did not have access aisles, they were preferable to none at all. Many municipalities indicated that they had provided such spaces with a positive response from persons with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In existing developed rights-of-way, on-street parallel parking spaces without access aisles may be the only spaces some jurisdictions can provide. While such spaces do not provide a high degree of accessible features, they are usable by many persons with disabilities. The interim final rule includes the proposed appendix note as a special technical provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 14.4&blank;Temporary Work [14.6 in the NPRM] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that construction and repair work in the public right-of-way that affects pedestrian facilities comply with ADAAG 4.1.1(4) (Temporary Structures). It further requires that construction sites be protected with barriers against hazards along the pedestrian circulation network and that temporary alternate circulation paths, where provided, be accessible and clearly marked. Appendix notes clarify accessibility requirements along temporary circulation paths. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

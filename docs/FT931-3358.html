			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (17): Why glorious Glaxo fails to interest GLAXO: A HISTORY TO 1962 by R P T Davenport-Hines and Judy Slinn Cambridge Pounds 55, 406 pages WHAT PURPOSE do corporate histories serve? Should they be used to create a tradition, offering a heritage that can provide an inspiration for employees and managers alike? Should they be used to lift the company's confidence by underlining the importance of the corporation in society? Should they offer historians a means of examining larger themes within society - say, economic imperialism, or the industrial decline of the UK? Or is their role merely to serve as presents for company guests, and employment for historians unable to find positions in the UK's shrinking university system? Certainly, corporate histories should entertain and inform. Unfortunately, this volume - a history of Glaxo until 1962 - fails on the whole to entertain, and provides little information of interest to either the historian or the general reader. Yet a history of Glaxo should be riveting. Its origins were humble. A small family firm, founded by Joseph Nathan, the sixth son of an East End wholesale tailor with considerable charm and very little brain, eventually became Europe's biggest drugs group and is now vying for the world's number one position. The early days of the company are effectively chronicled. Joseph Nathan was forced to leave London because of asthma and travelled to Australia and eventually New Zealand to make his fortune. While in Wellington he became involved in the butter trade. A chance encounter in 1903 at Debenham's department store by one of Joseph Nathan's sons led the family firm into the dried milk industry. The Nathans spotted an opportunity for drying surplus skimmed milk in New Zealand and then exporting it to the UK. The potential market for dried milk was enormous - a decline in breast-feeding during the late 19th century and the poor nutritional value of condensed milk had led to an increase in infant mortality - if the Nathans could solve the technical problems in drying the milk. They bought a patented drying process for Pounds 10,000 which at first proved troublesome. Initial sales were high, so they geared up production. But the repeat business was limited and they ended up with a stock of unsaleable product. The family wanted to register their new product's name as 'Lacto', but this was refused by the Trade Marks office; they played with the name until they came up with 'Glaxo'. But the technical problems nearly led the family to abandon a product which eventually overwhelmed the company. Alec Nathan, Joseph's sixth son, had completed a correspondence course in advertising and marketing and wrote much of the first promotional material himself. His innovative ideas included sending circulars to parents of babies whose births were announced in newspapers. During the first three months of 1909, the company achieved a 19.6 per cent reply rate. Those looking for indications of the importance of clinical trials should look at the impact of the Glaxo milk in Sheffield. In 1907, 445 babies were given dried milk. Of these 35 died - an infant mortality rate of 7.9 per cent, compared with the city's normal 14.5 per cent. Glaxo milk's losses of Pounds 2,191 in 1910 were turned around by 1912 into a profit of Pounds 2,028. Turnover increased from Pounds 50,000 in 1913 to Pounds 550,000 by 1918. However, on events after the first world war the authors appear merely to be going through the motions and the book loses its way. There is little drive in the narrative and the analysis of the group's transformation from a family trading company into a pharmaceuticals concern is poor. Problems such as the collapse of the dried milk market after the war are mentioned, but how the company reacted is not explained. The impact of the collapse of penicillin prices after the second world war is not examined. No full explanation is given for the fall in profits during the early 1950s, nor the static results during the rest of the decade. During the later period, some figures stand out. Alfred Bacharach, a former Cambridge Fabian, Independent Labour Party activist, rock-climber and expert in French gastronomy, eventually became Glaxo's chief scientific officer. He was passionate about syntax and listed 'punctuation' as a recreation in Who's Who. But the book finishes before the most interesting part of the story has begun. No explanation is given of why the volume ends in 1962, before the Beecham bid in the 1970s and the extraordinary expansion during the 1980s. The authors may be partly excused by the destruction of some archives during the last war. But they appear to have made no use of oral testimony. A poor index, mostly of names, products and countries, rounds off a poor volume.</p>

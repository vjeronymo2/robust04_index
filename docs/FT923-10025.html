			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Income rescue delay EFFORTS to compensate investors who lost money on home income plans have hit a second, potentially embarrassing, delay with a conflict between insurance companies and the insurance ombudsman. Delay is especially significant, because most investors were already over pension age when they bought the plans, which used a remortgage to buy an investment bond, with the aim of earning a sizeable income. Many unwittingly reached the brink of losing their homes when house prices fell crashed, interest rates rose rocketed and the investment bonds failed to perform as expected. Some insurance companies tried to head off complaints by approaching all plan-holders with offers of compensation, but tended to make up only the loss on the investment bond, and not the loss on mortgage payments or money withdrawn for capital spending. The insurance ombudsman's view is that these payments were often too low. His own and Lautro's guidelines say that investors should be put back where they were financially before buying the plan and that payments to cover distress and the cost of legal advice would be considered. An investor's acceptance of money 'in full and final settlement' would not preclude examination, since investors might have accepted an offer through desperation and might not have been told they could go to the ombudsman. The insurance companies are unhappy about this. One refused point blank when the ombudsman asked - as a matter of form - for permission to review a case where compensation had been paid, according to Peter Tyldesley of the ombudsman's bureau. However, Tyldesley said this would not stop Dr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, dealing with the case. Insurance companies must comply with his decisions and pay awards worth up to Pounds 100,000 unless they leave the voluntary scheme, after giving six months' notice. One of the companies most heavily involved in home income plans was Guardian Royal Exchange, where marketing manager Ken Franklin said the company was concerned at being asked to overturn something already agreed. GRE paid sums of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 3,000 to each of 490 investors who bought home income plans from Intercity, a GRE-appointed representative. GRE offered the money, making up losses on investment bonds only, after cancelling Intercity's agency on discovering some 'probably perfectly innocent' irregularities with holding of clients' money, said Franklin. The insurance ombudsman is currently reviewing 12 of these cases. 'They were not told about the ombudsman because they were not complaining,' said Franklin, 'We were writing to those customers out of the blue saying we have looked at these schemes and we are going to make an offer to you.' 'We were one of the first companies to actually get off our butts and do something,' said Franklin, 'We are not happy to have it looked at again.' He said GRE was hopeful its discussions with the ombudsman would reach an amicable solution.</p>

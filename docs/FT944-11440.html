			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Rough times for cashmere - Lucia van der Post explains why prices of the luxurious fabric will rise The relationship between the supply and demand of cashmere, that softest, lightest, warmest, most delectable of fibres, has always been a delicate one. When the two are in harmony the knitwear manufacturers and we, the customers, can enjoy stable prices and steady supplies. When they are out of kilter, then there is trouble - or, more precisely, there is expense. In Scotland, where the combination of pure water, finest yarns and know-how produce the best knitwear, there is considerable agitation. The tranquil years of stable prices seem to have to come an end. The Chinese, who have been the sole suppliers of that ineffably soft down from under the neck of the cashmere goat, have finally become highly successful competitors in the textile market. The Chinese economy is booming and refined, luxurious shops such as Ermenegildo Zenga are opening in Beijing at quite a pace. Private enterprise is being encourage and there is now a very efficient, very hungry textile business. Hong Kong has invested heavily in mainland China and now that Hong Kong itself has become an expensive place to manufacturer, more manufacturing is being done in China. There is not enough raw material to go round and most suppliers have already put their prices up by 15 per cent. It seems certain they will rise further. The big players - companies such as Dawson and Johnstons of Elgin - which do everything from treating the fleeces to designing, manufacturing and retailing, can absorb some of the extra costs along the way. The smaller producers who are involved in only one or two processes have to make a return at every level. James Sugden of Johnstons says that: 'Until supply and demand come into balance this nonsense will go on.' Ultimately, he believes, Chinese wages and costs will rise, making their own costs nearer those of Scotland. 'In the meantime we have to look at margins, efficient distribution, service and design if we are going to have a chance of competing.' To keep costs down many companies are looking at mixing cashmere with other materials - Pringle has had a particular success with its cashmere and silk and cashmere and cotton mixes. Mail order has also grown in the wake of pressure on margins and there is a host of companies now selling classic designs by post. Meanwhile in Scotland, some farmers are experimenting with farming their own cashmere-producing goats. The first garments made from Scottish cashmere are already on the shelves of top stores in Tokyo, Edinburgh, Paris and New York. Belinda Robertson, for instance, has used it for a special limited edition. All should bear a swing ticket saying they are made of Scottish cashmere. Even so, if you fancy some cashmere this winter, the message is: hurry. There is nowhere for prices to go but up. The Cashmere Store, 2, Saint Giles Street, Edinburgh EH1 (Tel: 031-225 5178) sells classic cashmere knitwear - cardigans, V-necked jumpers, that sort of thing, by mail order at good prices. Pounds 149 for a two-ply cashmere cardigan, Pounds 99 for a V-necked sweater. Brora, 7a Filmer Road Studios, 75 Filmer Road, London SW6, sells classic knitwear, jumpers and V or high-necked cardigans at the best prices around, Pounds 110 each. Men's cardigans are Pounds 145, waistcoats Pounds 135. There is a mail order service. Elizabeth Stanbury of 7, Bridge Street, Hungerford, Berkshire and 37, Upper Brook Street (first floor, just ring the bell), London W1 offers a charming personal service. Her two shops have sofas, a warm welcome and a willingness to make any design in any colour the customer fancies. There are easy country styles and sophisticated town ones. You could spend a little (for cashmere]), for example Pounds 60 on a small scarf, or a lot, up to Pounds 1,750 for a silk-bordered king-size 100 per cent cashmere blanket. Madeleine Trehearne, of whom I wrote in the summer, has just come back from India with another batch of her exquisitely soft and luxurious Shahtoosh, Toosh, and Pashmina shawls. In fashionable shops they start at Pounds 1,600 and go on up to Pounds 2,500 a time but Madeleine, because she sells them from her own home and has only her own and her partner's travelling costs to cover, sells items from Pounds 600, for the Pashmina, to Pounds 1,200, for the finest of them all, the Shahtoosh. There are lots of colours and designs but I think much the nicest are the plain caramel coloured ones. Ring her on 071-435 6310 for an appointment to view and buy.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Zeneca's birth pangs Zeneca starts life as an independent company amid an unhealthy degree of uncertainty. The grey market share price suggests the company is treading a fine line between the success and failure of its Pounds 1.3bn rights issue. Since most investment institutions have been either unwilling or unable to deal in the grey market, Friday's 632p unofficial closing price is by no means a full picture of the balance of supply and demand. The share price might recover as the big guns join in. By the same token, though, those with a vested interest in the success of the deal will have found the grey market easily led. Pricing Zeneca is not made any easier by the wide range of profits forecasts at large in the City. BZW and Warburg, among the lead advisers to the deal, estimate 1993 profits of Pounds 567m and Pounds 654m respectively. Some range of forecasts might be expected, not least because the performance of Zeneca's agrochemicals business turns on the weather. But such a wide divergence of opinion is surprising. The main comfort is that the rights issue was successfully underwritten at 600p. That suggests at least a grudging consensus among the large UK institutions. With sentiment towards the pharmaceutical sector fragile, though, the underwriters are exposed to a large degree of risk between now and June 21, when the rights issue closes. A hostile pronouncement from President Clinton's healthcare team, for example, could yet upset the apple cart. If the issue proves a success it will be in spite of, rather than because of, the company's sense of timing.</p>

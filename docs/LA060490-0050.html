			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS VIEW THE SUMMIT  </P> <P> In the wake of the Washington summit, what are the key issues that remain  unresolved?  </P> <P>  "The most important issue concerns the problems of Germany and the shape of  European security.  </P> <P> It is not just the question of Germany in NATO; in the rush toward German  reunification, little thought has been given by either side to the reshaping of  Europe. It has suddenly dawned on the Soviet leadership that they're faced with  a situation in which the new Germany will emerge in the next decade as the  dominant power in Eastern Europe and probably Western Europe as well.  </P> <P> "Among the summit meetings with Gorbachev, this has probably been the most  productive. But neither side is really prepared to think about what kind of a  security structure is feasible. Both will have to settle for interim,  transitional solutions."  </P> <P> Marshall Shulman  </P> <P> Professor emeritus of political science, Columbia University  </P> <P> "The most dicey issues that lie ahead may have to do with the breakup of a  Soviet Union armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons. However, I'm not sure  that this situation is susceptible to resolution through the leaders' own  efforts.  </P> <P> "This summit has sort of brought old-fashioned summitry to a new plateau. In  the past the most important issue was avoiding nuclear war; therefore, meetings  of presidential minds were crucial. But the world the leaders face and the  problems that loom -- especially the potential breakup of the USSR and the  reunification of Germany -- may be less susceptible to their influence.  Although this summit is historic, it may be that this kind of summitry itself  is less relevant to the problems of the age."  </P> <P> William Taubman  </P> <P> Professor of political science, Amherst College  </P></p>

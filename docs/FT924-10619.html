			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Bush narrows the gap, but the college rules ONE POLL does not a US presidential election make, but it can certainly set the cat among the pigeons. The opinion polls were flying in all directions at 4.30 on Wednesday afternoon, when CNN announced that its latest 'tracking' poll, conducted for it and USA Today by the Gallup organisation, had Governor Bill Clinton leading President George Bush by a mere two points (40:38), to all intents and purposes a deadheat. Not since early July had the president been so close to the Democratic challenger. He seized on the news with joy, claiming the opposition could now see victory 'slipping away.' Mr Clinton went on a television talk show that night to question the changed methodology of this particular poll. By yesterday morning, Mr Clinton could breathe a little more easily, while conceding that the race was, as he expected, narrowing. A Washington Post poll of likely voters, published yesterday, had him still up by 10 points, with 44 per cent, to Mr Bush's 34 per cent and Mr Ross Perot's 19 per cent, almost identical figures to those in a Los Angeles Times survey out on Wednesday. The NBC/Wall Street Journal survey put the score at 43:36:15 among likely voters (but 44:33:17 among those registered). ABC's version had it 41:34:21. Mr Clinton's own pollster estimated his lead at 7-9 points, and Mr Bush's expert conceded a deficit of 4-7 points. Both the polls and their takers agreed that Mr Perot's support seemed to have peaked. National polls may be misleading, since the election is determined by the electoral college in which each state delegation awards all its votes to whoever has carried that state (except for Maine and Nebraska, which apportion their votes by Congressional district). A total of 270 in the college is needed for victory. Here Mr Clinton's edge remains very large, though with increased volatility in the critical mid-western states. An NBC-TV estimate yesterday had the Democratic incontestably leading in states with 245 college votes, with Mr Bush sure of only about 140, including Texas and Florida. It concluded that the president would have to win all but one of the 15 competitive states to retain office. The latest electoral scoreboard of state polls compiled yesterday by The Hotline, a political newsletter, puts Mr Clinton ahead in 37 states with 392 votes, Mr Bush in 12 with 106, with ties in two states (Texas and Oklahoma) worth 40 votes. In 25 states, worth 274 votes, Mr Clinton's edge was outside the standard polling margins of error, with Mr Bush only enjoying such comfort in two states (South Carolina and Utah) with ten votes. But, the newsletter noted, 32 of these state polls were taken a week or more ago and therefore may lag behind the national tracking polls. This seems to be reflected in Mr Perot's standing if, indeed, it is now on the wane. In 17 states he was accorded 20 per cent or more, up from only three a week ago, and in two states (Idaho and Massachusetts) he had moved into second place. All the national polls give Mr Clinton a bigger lead among registered voters than among likely voters (six points in the controversial CNN survey). The nub of Mr Clinton's criticism was that new screening methods had been adopted by Gallup to identify 'likely' voters, which tilted the survey in favour of older white males and against the young first-time voter and working people. Without these two categories, he conceded the race would be much closer. But, he argued, citing independent surveys of increased registration, that voter turn-out this year would reverse a 30-year decline in the US, mostly because of greater participation by the young and the economically disadvantaged. Mr Frank Newport, Gallup's polling editor, disputed yesterday that its methodology had been much changed and said that his organisation historically switched from registered to likely voters for its 'tracking' polls in the final days of a campaign. A tracking poll involves a rolling sample of daily interviews, with results combined and released every day or two. They tend, as Mr Newport acknowledged, to be liable to bigger swings. This approach was contested by the NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters - one a Republican, one a Democrat - who wrote: 'There is no accurate way to predict whether people who voted in the past will vote this time, or whether people who don't habitually vote will decide that this election is important and so will turn out.' The volatility of recent polls also reflects when they were taken and the size of the sample. Gallup's poll for CNN was taken on Monday and Tuesday, and covered 1,217 likely voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 per cent. ABC's sample, also taken on the first two days of this week, was smaller at 898 with a 4 per cent margin of error. NBC/Wall Street Journal surveyed 576 likely voters on Tuesday and gives its findings a five-point variability. All reflect some impact of the controversy surrounding Mr Perot's charges of dirty tricks against the Bush campaign, levelled on Sunday. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times polls, taken with bigger samples on Friday-Tuesday and Saturday-Monday respectively, were probably less influenced by this new factor. Both carry 3 per cent margins of error. Polls are, of course, a snapshot of opinion on the move - and opinion is moving, for whatever reasons, in Mr Bush's direction. But, as Mr Newport repeated yesterday, it would even now be 'unprecedented' for him to catch up and win. Precedent, of course, is not an infallible guide.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Sergeyev: "Russian Ministry for Emergencies </F> Rushes to the Aid of Countrymen"]    [Text] This morning another humanitarian convoy set out for  the Republic of Georgia from the city of Noginsk, near Moscow.  It was organized by the Ministry of the Russian Federation for  Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Natural Disasters.    This time the assistance is intended for a Russian community  of dukhobortsy [a religious sect which opposed the  Orthodox Church] which settled in the south of Georgia more than  150 years ago. To carry out agricultural work, they will be  supplied with 200 tons of gasoline and diesel fuel carried on 50  trucks. In the opinion of the First Deputy Ministry for  Emergencies Yuriy Vorobyev, this action must raise the morale of  all of our countrymen who find themselves in difficult economic  conditions outside the borders of Russia.</p>

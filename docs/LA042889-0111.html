			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AQUATIC PROJECT WILL GET $1 MILLION MORE  </P> <P> Pasadena is clearing the way for construction of one of the nation's largest  swimming complexes near the Rose Bowl, voting to more than double its  contribution to the project to $1 million.  </P> <P> Project officials said that ground will be broken within a few weeks for the  Rose Bowl Aquatics Center -- a complex of swimming pools and a clubhouse at the  southern end of Brookside Park -- and that the facility should be open by the  summer of 1990.  </P> <P> The city's Board of Directors has agreed to provide construction financing by  issuing certificates of participation and to pay about 20% of the project's  $4.9-million cost.  </P> <P> City Manager Donald F. McIntyre recommended that the board approve the  financial assistance in light of the aquatic center's success in attracting  private donations.  </P></p>

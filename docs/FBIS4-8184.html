			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F> republic, by unidentified correspondent in Pale on 11 April --  recorded, monitored in progress]    [Text] [Karadzic] ...at the time of the London Conference  we lifted the blockade of Gorazde. The Muslims abused this. We  now still have Serbs in Gorazde. For a whole two years the cries  of Serbs could be heard from Gorazde. Our troops on the  surrounding mountain peaks could hear them and it was not easy  for them. If the attacks continue, we will employ the measures  that all peoples and armies employ in self-defense. If we deem  it necessary, we shall proclaim a state of war. It is clear  then, that we have to name the aggressor and all the structures  that belong to this aggressor are not welcome on our territory,  but we are convinced that incidents will not happen, with the  exception of what we command and the orders issued from the  level of the General Staff and the Interior Ministry. In any  case, our army showed restraint, and that is why the effects of  the bombings were not worrying. Moreover, we have our objective  and that is the breaking of the Muslim offensive. If the  attacks should continue, I am convinced that an escalation is  unavoidable, but everyone needs to know that we will not become  frightened. Our people have a goal, they know precisely that  they are right. Our army is ready and raring to go, and we have  no reason to be afraid. There is no air force that can deter us  from realizing our goals, nor can it turn the war luck. On the  contrary, it can plunge the entire region into a crisis, and, as  I said, the West will be the first to plunge into a crisis  because of what it has done. We believe that the international  community is pushing us precisely in the direction that it  wanted to divert us from. It is pushing us toward creating a  unified state. If the Serbian people continue to be exposed to  our enemies' attacks and to the international community's  benevolence toward our enemies, it may decide to go ahead with  unification. We want everything to progress in phases, and we  want everything to progress in accordance with the international  community. However, if the international community continues  with such behavior, we may decide to take a different course.  And then the international community will find itself facing a  fait accompli.    [Correspondent] What is the Serbian side's position in the  war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina regarding a political  solution to the war, the crisis in these areas, that is, and  tell us frankly what is the Serb side's position regarding the  partition of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Karadzic] Well, look at it this way. We did not want this  war, we did not want the (?disintegration) of Yugoslavia, or if  you want to put it this way, we are still in Yugoslavia because  we never agreed to leave it. We were forced to create our  republic in order to be able to defend ourselves and to  legitimate all our efforts. The essential interest of the  Serbian people is to live in one state. Our priority is  unification with Serbia. We are even ready to consign the  Srpska republic to memory, and to unite with Serbia as a whole  [sentence as heard]. If this proves impossible, we will accept  the status of some kind of Serbian federation for as long as we  want it, and then later we will go ahead with unification. If,  however, this too proves impossible, we will nevertheless not  give up on independence. Whether we are going to link up with  someone after recognition, and who this will be, this remains  [changes thought] this is a political issue.    As far as territory is concerned, let me put it this way: If  Serbs are dying for their village, then they are not giving it  up. Knowing the concessions the Serbs would have made, it is  completely unclear why the Muslims are attacking certain areas  that could have been theirs without any struggle. Since they  are fighting, and the Serbs are dying for these areas, they will  not get anything. The Muslims are at a great risk of losing  everything. We hold (?64 percent) of the territory as our own,  and we live on (?65 percent) of the territory as a majority  people. We control 72 percent of the territory. We will  probably have to give back at least the percentage from 72 to 64  percent [sentence as heard]. Perhaps -- in the name of  communications and [word indistinct] and so forth -- we could  go a little below (?64 percent). However, 50 percent or below  50 percent....    [Correspondent, interrupting] Forty-nine, which is [words  indistinct]    [Karadzic] That is out of the question. That was a variant  in which the Muslims would get 33 and the Croats 17 or 17.5  percent had peace been signed that day. At the same time, there  is a calculation that, I admit, (?has been calculated) by Mr.  Krajisnik, which is correct. We should actually get 60 percent  and the Muslims and Croats should get 50 percent.    This means, that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina has 110  percent, naturally. This is actually so, as the Muslims and the  Croats have some territories that overlap, that is, the  territories that [word indistinct] to the Muslims and the Croats  alike. Therefore, the Muslims and the Croats can satisfy their  appetites in this respect. However, if a war solution takes  place, we will most definitely keep everything. For this reason  it is much better for the opposite side to immediately agree on  restoration of peace and political talks.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, in place of my last question,  would you like to send a message to our nation, which probably  expects you to say something regarding the latest events?    [Karadzic] I can say that all the Serbs worldwide are proud  of the way in which we, here, have faced the threats of bombing.  Now, the bombing has materialized and we have seen what it  looks like. Simply as if the people would say, fire away and we  will see what next, what you want. The people feel as strong as  Antaeus, they feel strong because they are on their own soil.    I would like to send a message to our people not to worry,  as  it will be the way the people have decided. The authorities,  the army, and the police will do what constitutes the tendency  and aspiration of our nation. We know this aspiration from  several referendums, from the first elections, and finally also  from daily contacts.</p>

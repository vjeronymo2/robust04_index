			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Several recent Czech periodical articles  have provided information on developments in the Czech defense  industry.  <H5>  New Military Jet </H5>   Victor Kucera, research and development director of the  Czech  aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody, provided details on his  company's new L-159 multipurpose light combat aircraft in an  interview published in the 19 April issue of the military  journal A REPORT. Kucera said that the L-159 will come in one-  and two-seat versions, both with good fuel economy, advanced  avionics, and the capability of operating over chemically  contaminated terrain. The L-159 prototype is slated for  production in 1996, and the aircraft is scheduled to be  available for delivery by the end of 1998. The initial  manufacturing run is estimated to be about 100 aircraft, most of  which will be acquired by the Czech Air Force. The plane will  meet international criteria, including NATO compatibility, and  will be available for export. Its maintenance and operational  procedures, weapon systems, and ammunition will correspond fully  to Western standards.    Kucera noted that the L-159 is a substantial upgrade of Aero  Vodochody's proven L-59 series. Even though the L-159 will  reach a maximum speed of only Mach 0.82, due to construction  techniques and a wing design that facilitate cheap and rapid  production, the new plane, according to Kucera, should perform  better than the MiG-21 and the MiG-23. The L-159 will not be  very well suited to dogfights, but it will have strong defensive  capabilities, including multipurpose radar and the most modern  passive and active defense protection available. Kucera  described the L-159 as being very similar to the British HAWK  aircraft. He said that four L-159's will cost no more than one  U.S. F-16.  <H5>  Defense Procurement Contracts </H5>   The efforts of the Czech armed forces to modernize and  achieve NATO compatibility have led the Czech Defense Ministry  to seek bids by suppliers of various types of military hardware.  According to the 19 May issue of the Prague daily LIDOVE  NOVINY, approximately 40 companies are currently competing for  contracts. Requests for proposals have been issued for an  all-terrain vehicle (for which Mercedes is competing with the  U.S. Jeep Corporation and Prague-based Avia), a new combat  aircraft (for which the Czech company Aero Vodochody is  developing a prototype), guided missiles (for which the French  firm Matra is seen as the primary bidder), infantry weapons  (pitting the Czech Arms Plants [Ceska Zbrojovka] against the  Swiss firm SIG), tractors (which may be obtained from Tatra),  and communications systems (which Italy's Marconi and Germany's  Dornier would like to provide).    LIDOVE NOVINY notes that the big sums involved in  large-scale  defense procurement have raised the issue of potential bribery.  The paper writes that, while some Defense ministry officials  dismiss this possibility, other ministry employees claim that  the first signs have already appeared in the form of expensive  restaurant-bill payments by representatives of defense  contractors. The new chief of Army logistics, Frantisek Veprek,  told LIDOVE NOVINY that even such behavior by procurement  officials is unacceptable. As an example of measures that have  been taken to forestall bribery attempts, Veprek pointed to the  division of labor among three offices that work on contract  bids: one prepares contracts for bids, another evaluates bids,  and a third approves proposals.  <H5>  Foreign Training Approved </H5>   The Czech parliament has approved a government proposal that  would allow Czech Army units to be sent to foreign countries for  training and, conversely, allow foreign military units to train  with the Czech armed forces in the Czech Republic, according to  the 30 April RUDE PRAVO. The liaison training will be limited  to 30 days and 700 troops for Czech units traveling to foreign  countries, and foreign units in the Czech Republic are to be  limited to a stay of 21 days and are not to exceed 5,000 troops  at any one time.  <H5>  New Generals </H5>   SVOBODNE SLOVO of 9 May reported that President Vaclav Havel  has promoted three Army officers to the rank of general.  Ladislav Kozler, chief of the Defense Ministry Foreign  Relations Department, and Josef Dufek, commander of the 4th Air  Defense Corps, were named major generals, while Colonel  Rostislav til, the commander of Czech troops detailed to the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia, was given  the brevet rank of major general for the duration of his service  with UNPROFOR.</p>

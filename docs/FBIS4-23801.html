			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo by </F> Shaun Johnson and Kaizer Nyatsumba]    [Text]  <H5>  On being Minister Without Portfolio. </H5>   The RDP [Reconstruction and Development Programme] had to be  driven by the president, to be made a major flagship of the GNU  [Government of National Unity]. The president had to be  assisted by someone of ministerial status to ensure the  programme was implemented -- that's what I wanted to do.  <H5>  On the Reconstruction and Development Programme. </H5>   The RDP is an integrated and coherent growth and  developmental strategy that spans different ministries. My  function is really to be the back-up for the president in terms  of making sure that the goals of the RDP are implemented.  <H5>  On the RDP and the Cabinet. </H5>   You have a government that has accepted the RDP -- all  parties in the GNU. We are in the process of finalising an RDP  Special Committee of Cabinet, which will look at how to ensure  that we build co-operation in an integrated way.  <H5>  On the RDP as an ANC policy. </H5>   The RDP is a programme. The document as it developed is not  a Bible. What the ANC agreed was a framework: a million houses  over five years; two-and-a-half million jobs through a public  works programme; 10 years of basic, high-quality education; and  so on. The Government has adopted that.  <H5>  On Inputs to the RDP. </H5>   We are looking at inputs from all government departments,  parastatals, State institutions, provincial and local  government, civil society, the private sector, trade union  movement, etcetera. That process has now started.  <H5>  On whether he is the RDP's `policeman'. </H5>   I never wanted to be a policeman in my life, and the way I  approach my work is that whether you are a National Party person  or IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] person or ANC, you have been  elected, so that you deliver the goods and services to the  people. The only coherent vehicle through which you can deliver  goods and services is the RDP.  <H5>  On the RDP and the rest of government. </H5>   The RDP is not just something located in this office, in  isolation from what is going on in the rest of Government. Take  the RDP fund. It has two objectives. One is to leverage within  government departments the ability of those departments to  allocate resources to new priorities, and the second is to  kick-start an RDP programme. Ministers must start defining a  five-year strategy linked to RDP priorities. I work with a  number of key Ministers who present on a regular basis reports  to Cabinet that measure the goals we have set.  <H5>  On provincial involvement. </H5>   I am in regular contact with all the premiers. There are  meetings that I attend with the regional premiers that involve  provincial affairs and local government, together with Public  Administration and with Finance (Ministers). The core of the  RDP is driven by a very tight working together of (the  ministries of) Public Administration, Finance and State  Expenditure, the RDP office here and Provincial and Local  Government Affairs. We include as well the Public Works  Minister.  <H5>  On longer-term change. </H5>   In terms of infrastructural programmes, that requires more  time (than the 100-day programme). You can't make an ad hoc  decision about whether you start at Orange Farm or at Tokoza.  We are ready to put into place a major project and are sitting  down with local government MECs [member executive council] to  try and work out some programme. Not all provinces have the  same priorities.  <H5>  On whether regular RDP updates will be issued. </H5>   Absolutely. Part of our duties is communication strategy. I  am very keen (to see) that there is a public way in which the  RDP gets assessed.  <H5>  On the cost of implementing the RDP. </H5>   People did not understand how we approached this issue. When  we (the ANC) talked about funding the RDP, remember, we argued  consistently that the major source of funding must come from the  way you reorganise government expenditure towards new  priorities. We are wanting to get away from the idea of the RDP  being an add-on programme.  <H5>  On others' role in implementing the RDP: </H5>   The RDP is not just a Government programme. When it is  driven by people and centred around people's needs, it will  succeed. Government needs to build a genuine partnership with  the trade union movement, organised business, civic movements,  rural-based movements, women's movements, etc.  <H5>  On private sector involvement in the RDP. </H5>   I think we have achieved a great deal of (consensus) that  the  RDP represents a coherent and stable strategy towards rebuilding  the country. The next issue is to put your money where your  mouth is. The one important area is to get private sector  investment in the economy. Because the following investment is  going to come in from overseas (only once) private sector  investment is coming from South Africa. It really needs to be  brought to the public's awareness. There is potential for a  major housing boom, linked to infrastructural development, and  the private sector really needs to get involved.  <H5>  On his new lifestyle and position as Cabinet Minister. </H5>   My current lifestyle is very much like my old lifestyle. I  spend my time meeting with trade union representatives, civil  organisations, the different Ministers, etcetera, around issues  which have always interested me -- developmental issues. In a  sense it has been quite a smooth transition from running Cosatu  [Congress of South African Trade Unions], where my major role  was co-ordination and development programmes, to being involved  in reconstruction programmes.  <H5>  On sitting in the Union Buildings. </H5>   How do I feel about sitting in the Union Building? I feel  phenomenal. It is an amazing feeling to sit here and think that  not so long ago there used to be a government that plotted  against us. It's a really ironic twist of fate. It's an amazing  feeling that we can now actually do things that Government needs  to do, and in a way that is democratic.  <H5>  On his personal relationships with De Klerk and Keys. </H5>   Obviously my relationship with the Deputy President (De  Klerk) in the past has been a turbulent one. We were  protagonists in a battle where we sought to establish democracy.  But we fought an election and we have agreed on a GNU. And we  have agreed now on the RDP. At a personal level, I never hold  grudges against anyone. In fact, among the people I respect  most are those that have been among my foes. In terms of Derek  Keys, I never locked horns with him; I locked horns with his  predecessor (Barend du Plessis).</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: More showers are feared before the sun returns - Jane Fuller considers the problems at Spring Ram MR Bill Rooney, chairman of Spring Ram Corporation, has needed every ounce of his considerable marketing skills recently. He has been trying to convince nearly 40 institutional investors that his kitchens and bathrooms company has stumbled, not fallen, over the Balterley Bathrooms affair. 'We are still the same company that we were five weeks ago' before the news that false accounting at Balterley could cost a total of Pounds 5.6m and before the share price fell from 156p to 89p. With investors giving the company credit for its explanation of what happened, the share price has recovered to 120p. One institutional representative described Mr Rooney and his colleagues as apologetic. 'No attempt was made to cover up what had been a badly handled situation.' Another commented: 'We are happy that the episode is isolated. To some extent it was bad luck and to some extent looser management than we would have hoped for.' Spring Ram does, however, continue to trade at a discount to the market. It used to command a premium, having multiplied pre-tax profit 12-fold between 1984 and 1991. To allay the fears raised by Balterley, Mr Rooney and Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director, came to the City armed with a breakdown of the Balterley losses, a timetable of the problem's discovery and belated revelation, and fighting talk about the 'reality' of the group's profits. 'It has not been done by Mickey Mouse creative accounting,' said Mr Greenwood. The Balterley explanation was to some extent familiar. The subsidiary's finance director, since sacked, had inflated profits by altering the numbers for stock - to the tune of Pounds 3.9m over three years - sales, debtors and creditors. Other Balterley board members were exonerated. Head office, which did without a finance director until Mr Greenwood's arrival in March last year, was partly to blame for ordering the stock build-up and then simply accepting the numbers it had wanted to see. Mr Greenwood said he should have spotted the seriousness of the problem sooner. Blame was deflected from Mr David Riley, who has been the board member responsible for bathrooms since March 1989. The affair has added urgency to the calls for Spring Ram to be more accountable. Shareholders are developing what one described as 'a wish list' of things they would like to see now that the company is being more open. Mr Rooney said that at least one non-executive director, its first, would be announced by next March. He also seemed amenable to providing a divisional breakdown of profits and sales for the first time in the 1992 accounts. This will indicate that well over half the profits come from kitchens, driven by rising volumes at the huge Scunthorpe factory, and from Astracast sinks. Spring Ram has shown an increasing willingness to admit that the bathrooms side has succumbed to the UK recession. For the first time the group has had to make redundancies - at Spring Bathrooms as well as at Balterley. The group has also been subject to profit-forecast downgrades for the first time. The latest consensus is that the growth in pre-tax profit will slow to 6.5 per cent this year, giving Pounds 40m before exceptionals. Expectations for 1993 have been shaded down to between Pounds 47m and Pounds 48m. Mr Rooney admits that the pressure has been on this year. The bulge in capital spending - Pounds 40m compared with only Pounds 3m in 1990 - was not supposed to coincide with recession. It is, however, to the group's credit that it had saved cash for the purpose. The two start-up factories, doors and tiles, have made losses this year, albeit eased by Pounds 2m in grants. 'We have put down 800,000 sq ft this year. That takes courage in a depression and we will spend a similar amount next year because we are planing for the next eight years.' After delivering the presentation to the institutions, Mr Rooney will have to go through it all again as analysts file up to Yorkshire. Their questions are likely to go beyond Balterley to issues concerning the 1992 accounts such as the profits breakdown, stock levels, depreciation and deferred tax. They are also concerned about Spring Ram's 1993 prospects. Has the company gone ex-growth in its core markets? Why has it acquired Stag Furniture? Will it make much money out of door production? But the question of credibility may come back to Balterley, especially as the questions the directors stonewalled on this summer were not so wide of the mark.</p>

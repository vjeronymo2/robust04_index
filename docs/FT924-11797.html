			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: Prosperity must be earned, and interest rates used realistically Sir, Your various correspondents who have put forward proposals for reform of the UK economy have, with respect, missed the fundamental point: economic conditions are by and large the result of individual decisions not government decisions. National prosperity is simply the sum of the prosperity of that nation's citizens. Our earning ability, as an individual, is determined by our skill, knowledge, and motivation. If most of us, as individuals, can honestly say that we are as productive, pound for pound or dollar for dollar, as our opposite number in France, Germany, Japan, Taiwan or the US, or wherever, then our long-term prosperity as a person or as a nation is assured. The fundamental, long-term problem with the UK economy is that, taken as a whole, our aspirations as consumers outstrip our earning capacity as producers when compared with the citizens of many other leading economies. Government may temporarily change the relative costs of home-produced and foreign goods, or the benefits of borrowing rather than lending, but no short-term measure will transform us into a nation of highly-skilled, highly-motivated, high-earning (and I do mean earning) people. Similarly, trade unions or industry pressure-groups may all too easily be tempted to try to stem the tide of change rather than accept and plan for a different and more difficult future. However, the nature of the problem and the time-scale for recovery demand far greater levels of maturity and honesty than are usually credited by the electorate to politicians or politicians to the electorate. Gaze firmly fixed on the next election (or party conference) the politician pretends to have all the answers, thus conveniently relieving the rest of us of responsibility for the inevitable failure of palliatives. The truth is that if we (yes, all of us) do not have the commitment and the strategy to improve our economic capacity relative to that of our trading partners, our decline will continue inexorably, the associated pain alleviated only briefly by those periodic bouts of inflationary euphoria to which we, in all probability, are yet again condemned.

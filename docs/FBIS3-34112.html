			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--An Arab League official has  emphasized the importance of achieving Yemeni reconciliation to  strengthen Arab solidarity and the Arab nation's objectives.    The official made this statement while commenting on reports  that the Yemeni leadership has refused the Arab League's offer  to sign the document of "the Yemeni accord agreement" at the  Arab League headquarters in Cairo and prefers to have it signed  in the Jordanian capital of Amman.    The official said: The place where the document will be  signed is not important. The important thing is to have  reconciliation between the Yemeni leaders in the interest of  that country's people.    Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid had  telephoned Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid offering to host the signing of the  accord agreement between them. The Yemeni leadership declined  the offer in favor of Amman, as Jordan's King Husayn was the  mediator in the reconciliation between the Yemeni president and  his deputy before the offer was made by the Arab League  secretary general.</p>

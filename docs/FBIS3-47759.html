The communique, issued by the All Burma Students Democratic  Front (ABSDF), said the 12 had been detained Sunday in  Mannerplaw, the headquarters of the ethnic Karen insurrection,  located on the Thai border.    It also accused the KNU of handing down an ultimatum to all  students in the area to hand over their weapons to the KNU. The  ultimatum reportedly expired at dawn Monday.    An official with the KNU said he was unable to confirm or  deny the report.    The ABSDF said the 12 had been detained "without any  apparent  reason" and demanded their release. The KNU is the oldest and  most powerful opposition group battling the ruling junta, or  State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which holds  power in Rangoon. Other opposition groups came together last  week to support the KNU in opening peace talks with the SLORC.    The KNU has around 1,500 and 1,700 students in its ranks.    Sources in the Burmese opposition in Bangkok said the  arrests  were aimed at blocking these students from leaving with their  weapons and teaming up with the remnants of the Burmese  Communist Party (BCP).    The BCP disbanded in 1989 after an internal squabble.</p>

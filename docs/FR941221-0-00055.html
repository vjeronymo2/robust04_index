			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the May 3, 1994 interim rule provided a detailed summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the provisions of subtitle D, and readers are referred to the May 3, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule for a more complete discussion of the provisions of subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following, however, provides a review of which section 8 housing projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are covered by subtitle D, and therefore eligible for the election of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy preferences authorized by subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 651 of the HCD Act of 1992 provides in relevant part,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an owner of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> covered section 8 housing project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> may in selecting tenants for units in the project that become available for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy, give preference to elderly families who have applied for occupancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the housing *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Emphasis added.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the phrase ``designed primarily for occupancy by elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families,'' HUD believes that in using the term ``primarily,'' the Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to limit the applicability of subtitle D to either the section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in those covered projects in which a majority of the section 8 units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE> ), or to the section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in covered projects where a distinct portion of the project (e.g., a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tower or a wing of a project, but not just a floor) exists in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of section 8 units were restricted to seniors only. Thus, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 651 may apply to the section 8 units in an entire project originally designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily for occupancy by elderly families (``covered section 8 housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project''), or section 651 may apply to the section 8 units in a portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such project, but only where the section 8 units in this project or portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the project were designed primarily for seniors. The preamble, at times, uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term ``covered section 8 units'' to recognize that there are partially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assisted projects whose section 8 units will be covered by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the term ``non-elderly disabled families'' is used to refer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used in this preamble, the term ``seniors'' refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD points out that the statutory system of preferences authorized by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D is only available to projects which qualify as ``covered section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.'' HUD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emphasizes that many projects that have section 8 assistance are not ``covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 8 housing projects designed primarily for occupancy by elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families'' (as discussed in the following section), and may not elect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D statutory system of preferences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Covered Section 8 Housing Project: Section 659  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subtitle D and this final rule (and the May 3, 1994 interim rule) define  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``covered section 8 housing'' to mean housing that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Was constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance provided under section 8(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1937 (1937 Act), as in effect before October 1, 1983;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is assisted under a contract for assistance under such section; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Projects that are Newly Constructed or Substantially Rehabilitated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Assistance Provided Under Section 8(b)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effect Before October 1, 1983  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD administers six section 8 programs that involve newly constructed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially rehabilitated housing. However, the system of preferences under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D does not apply to all these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The programs to which subtitle D applies are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Section 8 New Construction Program, 24 CFR part 880;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Section 8 Substantial Rehabilitation Program, 24 CFR part 881;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The State Housing Agencies program (insofar as it involves new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction and substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR part 883;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The New Construction Set-Aside for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects Program, 24 CFR part 884; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD-Owned Projects (insofar as it involves substantial rehabilitation), 24 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 886. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Additional Assistance Program for Projects with HUD-Insured and HUD-Held Mortgages'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart A) involves only existing housing. However, the ``Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the Disposition of HUD-owned Projects'' (see 24 CFR part 886, subpart C) involves substantially rehabilitated housing, in addition to existing housing. Accordingly, this rule would amend subpart C of 24 CFR part 886, but only for projects involving substantially rehabilitated housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other programs which may involve section 8 new construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial rehabilitation assistance, but which are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences in subtitle D are identified in section 658 of the HCD Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992. Under section 658 of the HCD Act of 1992, an owner of a project (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of a project) that was originally designed for occupancy by elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families, and assisted under the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (BMIR) program, the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payment for Rental Projects program, or the Section 202 Loans for Housing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Elderly or Handicapped Program, may continue to restrict occupancy in such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects (or portion of such projects) to elderly families in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules, standards and agreements in effect when the housing project was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed. Accordingly, under this rule, the subtitle D statutory system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences does not apply to newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 8 projects with HUD insurance or assistance under any of these three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  HUD emphasizes that it is critical that a project owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understand the type of assistance a project receives to determine eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under subtitle D and these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although in this regard, the Department is aware of no Section 221(d)(3) BMIR projects or Section 236 projects with Section 8 new construction or substantial rehabilitation assistance. As such, by its terms, ``covered section 8 housing'' does not seem to encompass the Section 236 Mortgage Insurance and Interest Reduction Payment for Rental Projects program or the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

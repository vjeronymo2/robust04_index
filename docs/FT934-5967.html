			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drinks alert Strong suggestions that PepsiCo, the US soft drinks giant, was considering buying Britvic were heard, although company sources later denied the story. In spite of this, analysts said they expected a shake-up to Britvic's unusual shareholdings in the near future. PepsiCo already has a 10 per cent stake in Britvic, the other holders being Bass (45 per cent), and Allied-Lyons and Whitbread (22.5 per cent each). With such a diversity of owners, Britvic's development has been held back, with some suggestions from brokers that a flotation - which would value the group at around Pounds 300m - may be the best option. In a strong drinks sector, Allied rose 8 to 583p, Whitbread 2 to 518p and Bass 5 to 477p. BPB shares were among the market's best performers, climbing 21, or more than 8 per cent, to 278p in turnover of 6.6m, after the group delivered much better than expected interim profits and a higher dividend. The BPB figures, coupled with reports of an 8.5 per cent year-on-year jump in German housing starts and increasing hopes of another cut in German interest rates, triggered a flurry of heavy buying interest throughout the building sectors. Redland and RMC were the big beneficiaries of the German stories, RMC climbing 26 to 878p, and the former 22 to 563p on heavy volume of 6.9m. There was further switching out of PowerGen and into National Power as institutions continued to view the price differential between the two stock prices as unsustainable. NatPower closed a shade firmer at 399 1/2 p on 5.2m traded and the former shed 8 to 449p on 3.9m. Respectable results but a gloomy statement sent Hazlewood Foods into retreat and prompted a raft of downgrades and change of stance from several of the stock's former supporters. The shares fell 7 to 141p, with analysts predicting a dull time for the immediate future. Revisions of forecasts for the full year came in around Pounds 52m, a fall of some 10 per cent. A trade of 7.5m shares at 335p in United Biscuits - more than 1.5 per cent of the equity - threw the company's brokers, financial PR and countless food manufacturing analysts into confusion; the report should have read '750,000'. The Stock Exchange later admitted to a mistake, but said the error would not be posted until today. UB lost 2 at 335p in turnover of 4.3m. Better than expected results from Direct Line, Royal Bank of Scotland's hugely successful telephone insurance business, produced a strong rise in Royal Bank's shares of 22 to a record closing high of 375p. Turnover was a heavy 8.9m. Dealers said the market was impressed with Direct Line's figures, but was even more impressed with the decision of Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line's founder, to take a share stake in RBOS instead of a royalty payment. 'The institutions take the view that if Mr Wood prefers to have RBOS shares, then so do they,' said one marketmaker. Commercial Union moved up 6 to 605p, with buying said to have been stimulated by a presentation in Paris hosted by Strauss Turnbull. Glaxo was up 16 at 651p, but the City said this was part of a general recovery in the sector, which has been lagging behind the market in recent weeks. Ruberoid's return to the market, after being demerged from Tarmac, saw the shares heavily traded and they moved up from an opening 161p to touch 165p before closing at 163p. The stock was issued at 150p a share. Turnover of 12m shares was the fourth heaviest in the market yesterday. The day's other debut stock was Biotrace, the biotechnology company, which traded up to 145p after 7.2m shares were placed at 130p. Volume was just under 1m shares.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES STREET NAMES  </P> <P> The names of many Los Angeles streets have changed repeatedly over the years,  reflecting the city's transformation from a tiny Mexican colonial town to a  booming metropolis. Some streets, predictably, honor war heroes and explorers.  But others have been named for trees, actors, land developers and -- in one  case -- the proximity of a bullfighting ring.  </P> <P>  These days, it is not easy to change the name of a street. You must submit  petitions signed by the majority of landowners along the route to the Land  Development and Mapping Division of the Bureau of Engineering. After other  residents get a chance to object, a name-change ordinance is drafted and sent  to the local City Council member, the council's Public Works Committee and,  finally, the full council for approval.  </P> <P>  People living along private thoroughfares may have to pay up to $1,000 to  alter street signs. There is no charge, however, with a public street. It cost  the city about $70,000 for new signs when Santa Barbara Avenue became Martin  Luther King Jr. Boulevard in 1982.  </P> <P>  At last count there were 953 private and 8,845 public streets in Los Angeles.  Since the mid-1930s, ordinances have required that the ones running north-south  be called avenues and those running east-west be called streets.  </P> <P>  Listed below are the current names of some of the city's streets, the dates  they were dedicated and some of their history.  </P> <P> Aliso Street: 1854 When early settlers arrived at the Los Angeles River (El Rio  de Nuestra Senora de Los Angeles de Porcinucula) by way of Mission Road, they  picked as a nearby gathering point a huge sycamore that gave them shelter and  became a landmark, "El Aliso." That Spanish word for sycamore was later used to  name the road carved out near the river, which then was not a concrete channel.  </P> <P> Alpine Street: 1887 Before it was named for one of California's 58 counties, it  had been known as the Street of the Virgins, a place where the young ladies of  the pueblo strolled with their duenas (chaperones) past admiring caballeros  (gentlemen).  </P> <P> Alvarado Street: 1855 Named after Gov. Juan Bautista Alvarado, who in 1836  became the first governor to promote public education.  </P> <P> Arcadia Street: 1872 Arcadia Bandini, born in 1823, was the daughter of  prominent ranchero Juan Bandini. She came to be regarded as one of the most  beautiful belles of Los Angeles and was just 14 when she married 40-year-old  Abel Stearns, who had come west from Massachusetts and acquired Southern  California's largest land-cattle empire. Stearns built a home for his bride one  block south of the Plaza -- the community's central gathering area -- and the  house, called El Palacio, became the social hot spot. In 1858, Stearns  constructed a two-story business block on Los Angeles Street nearby and called  it Arcadia Block. The street was officially dedicated one year after Stearns'  death in 1871.  </P> <P> Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Street: 1988 Running diagonally from 1st Street to  the corner of 2nd and San Pedro streets in Little Tokyo, it was renamed from  Weller Street last year to honor the Japanese-American astronaut killed in the  1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. A century ago, it was used as a  shortcut by stagecoaches carrying passengers from San Pedro to the Bella Union  Hotel.  </P> <P> Beverly Boulevard: 1921 Beverly Farms, Mass. 25 miles north of Boston (Farms  has since been dropped from its name) was where President William Howard Taft  vacationed in 1900. Burton Green, founder of Beverly Hills, decided that a good  way to lure people to his city would be to name it after the resort of  Presidents. In 1906 Green had a street named after himself -- Burton Way.  </P> <P> Broadway: 1890 Part of it was first called Calle Fortin -- Fort Street --  because it passed through the hilltop Ft. Moore. Another section was known as  Eternity Street, because it led to a cemetery; Downey Avenue, after Gov. John  G. Downey, and Buena Vista Street, whose "good view," as legend has it, was the  view from the hillside of the women's bathing pools (where the senoritas wore  bathing dresses). City officials eventually decided to rename Fort Street  because the area's many German citizens had trouble with the pronunciation --  it would come out "Fourth Street," causing confusion with a thoroughfare by  that name. By 1910, all sections were dedicated under the one name, Broadway.  </P> <P> Crenshaw Boulevard: 1904 It was informally known as Crenshaw Boulevard as early  as 1889 after George L. Crenshaw, an importer who earned a reputation as the  "banana king."  </P> <P> Cahuenga Boulevard: 1887 An Indian settlement in the middle of the pass at the  lower end of the San Fernando Valley, Cahuenga was the site of the landmark  Battle of Cahuenga. The Jan. 13, 1847, Treaty of Cahuenga, signed by Gen.  Andres Pico and Col. John C. Fremont, ended the Mexican-American War in  California and declared as part of the United States all land west of the Rocky  Mountains, south of Oregon and north of Mexico. California officially joined  the Union on April 4, 1850.  </P> <P> Chandler Boulevard: 1926 One of the most prominent thoroughfares in the San  Fernando Valley, it was named for Harry Chandler, the partner and son-in-law of  Gen. Harrison Gray Otis of the Los Angeles Times. Chandler became publisher of  The Times in 1917.  </P> <P> Edward Everett Horton Lane: 1968 The Encino road was named for the late  character actor, who was considered the honorary mayor of the community. After  a successful film career, Horton's voice became familiar to children as the  narrator of the Saturday and Sunday morning Bullwinkle cartoon feature  "Fractured Fairy Tales."  </P> <P> Figueroa Street: 1855 North Figueroa was originally named Pearl Street and  South Figueroa was called Calle de las Chapules -- the Street of  </P> <P> Grasshoppers -- because pedestrians used to leap about while sour-faced  policemen whistled and chased the crowds from one corner to the other. From  1834 to 1845, Gov. Jose Figueroa, who was part Aztec Indian, directed the  beginning of secularization of the territory, which had been under the control  of its missions. After the padres lost their power, California experienced its  first land boom. Eight million acres were acquired by fewer than 800 men, who  created 500 ranchos.  </P> <P> Gen. Thaddeus Kosciuszko Way: 1978 The downtown route was named after a Polish  revolutionary war hero who was recognized as a Renaissance man -- a gifted  painter, architect, composer, scholar and philosopher -- whose scope of  interests was a match for that of Thomas Jefferson.  </P> <P> Gower Avenue: 1893 Named because it ran along the west side of the ranch  belonging to George T. Gower. California's first films were made on the corner  of Gower and Sunset Boulevard in 1911.  </P> <P> Grand Avenue: 1887 It originally was known as Calle de la Caritad -- Charity  Street -- but when the English version of the name became popular, wealthy  residents petitioned the City Council to change it. The problem was that,  though early Spaniards interpreted "Charity" to mean "Christian love" -- and  other streets nearby were named Faith and Hope -- to the prosperous residents  the suggestion of handouts was too much to take.  </P> <P> Hill Street: 1849 Part of it -- north of the Plaza -- was first called Calle  del Toro (Bull Street) because it ended at the ring where crowds gathered after  Sunday Mass to see bullfights and occasional battles pitting a bull against a  bear. But the ring eventually faded into oblivion and so did the name.  </P> <P> Hollywood Boulevard: 1910 Named by Horace Henderson Wilcox, who bought 120  acres in the foothills northwest of Los Angeles during the 1880s and called the  area Hollywood. Several decades later, a group of businessmen developed a  housing tract, Hollywoodland, and advertised it with a huge hillside sign, the  "land" of which was eventually dropped. Another street in Hollywood, Wilcox  Avenue, is named for the community's founder.  </P> <P> La Brea Avenue: 1869 Named with the Spanish word for tar, which was found in  nearby pits and used for waterproofing the sod roofs of the adobe houses in the  Plaza. The street was part of the 4,439-acre Rancho La Brea, which in 1860 was  purchased by Maj. Henry Hancock for $2.50 an acre.  </P> <P> La Cienega Boulevard: 1923 Cienega is Spanish for marshland. A section of the  route was in an area that was always damp, and its grass was green throughout  the year. Don Francisco Avila was given a grant to Rancho Las Cienegas in 1823.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Street: 1854 Before the first official survey of the area in 1849,  most of this thoroughfare was called Calle Principal (Main Street). Other  sections were known as Calle de la Zanja (Ditch Street), Calle de Los Vinas  (Vineyard Street) and -- much to the south -- Calle de los Huertos (Orchard  Street), which is now San Pedro Street. These formed the principal highway  running south to the Embarcadero of San Pedro. At its northern end, near the  Plaza, a 500-foot stretch was known as Calle de Los Negros, which had a  racially diverse population. It was543780384hanged by a mob after two policemen  and a policeman's brother were shot trying to break up a fight. The extension  of Los Angeles Street in 1886 eliminated the alley and today the site adjoins  the Hollywood Freeway.  </P> <P> Los Feliz Boulevard: 1888 Named after Rancho Los Feliz, a Spanish land grant  issued to Cpl. Jose Vicente Feliz, who led the first non-Indian expedition to  what became the Pueblo of Los Angeles. Feliz led 11 families here from Sonora,  Mexico, in 1781. Most of Feliz's land was the Silver Lake area and the higher  slopes of Griffith Park. Rancho Los Feliz sold in the 1850s for $1 an acre.  </P> <P> Main Street: 1849 The community's first Calle Principal connected the San  Gabriel Mission with the San Fernando Valley and many established ranchos. One  section near the Plaza was known as Bath Street after, legend has it, the  facilities featuring "scarlet women."  </P> <P> Melrose Avenue: 1887 Ranch owner E. A. McCarthy named the route after his  hometown of Melrose, Mass.  </P> <P> Olvera Street: 1858 Among the oldest streets of the city, it was named in honor  of Agustin Olvera, one of the commissioners who signed the Treaty of Cahuenga.  Olvera was the first judge of the County of Los Angeles and later was a county  supervisor.  </P> <P> Olympic Boulevard: 1929 Named in honor of the upcoming 1932 Olympics.  </P> <P> Ord Street: 1890 Originally called High Street, this route off the Plaza was  renamed after Lt. E.O.C. Ord, who conducted the 1849 official survey and drew  the first map of Los Angeles, all for a fee of $3,000.  </P> <P> Owensmouth Avenue: 1917 Running from the base of the foothills, through the  community of Owensmouth (known today as Canoga Park), it was named in  commemoration of the water brought over the mountains to the San Fernando  Valley from the Owens River. The river was named by one of California's  pathfinders, Maj. John C. Fremont, for a member of one of his expeditions,  Richard Owen.  </P> <P> Pico Boulevard: 1855 Named after the 14th and last governor of California under  Mexican rule, Don Pio Pico, whose grandfather and father had come to the area  with a 1776 expedition. Pio Pico, who was born in 1801 at Mission San Gabriel,  built the Pico House hotel, the first three-story building in Los Angeles,  which still stands.  </P> <P> Sepulveda Boulevard: 1925 Named for the family of Don Francisco and Ramona  Sepulveda, who had 11 children, all of whom inherited parts of their parents'  property and acquired more land through their marriages. The road was used by  the Sepulvedas to transport their cattle, which were often attacked by grizzly  bears.  </P> <P> Slauson Avenue: 1871 Extending from Whittier to West Los Angeles, it was named  after Jonathan Sayre Slauson, leader of a group that in 1885 bought about  15,000 acres of rocky land in the San Gabriel Valley, of which about 4,000  acres were developed into the city of Azusa. Slauson also owned about 29,000  acres of what would become the city of South Gate, land sold off by his heirs  in 1910 for $500 an acre. Slauson, who died in 1905, organized the Los Angeles  County Bank, was a founder and promoter of the Los Angeles &amp; Independence  Railroad, the first rail connection between Los Angeles and Santa Monica, and  helped organize the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Spring Street: 1849 As legend has it, it was named Calle Primavera by Lt. Ord  to honor his sweetheart in Santa Barbara, Trinidad Ortega, whom he called  "Primavera," Spanish for "Springtime." He never married Ortega, the  granddaughter of Jose Francisco Ortega, the Spanish explorer who "discovered"  San Francisco Bay.  </P> <P> Sunset Boulevard: 1888 Earlier called Bellevue Street -- and with some small  sections called Short, Bread and Marchessault streets (after Mayor Damien  Marchessault) -- it started on U.S. Sen. Cornelius Cole's hill in what is now  Hollywood, which afforded a fine view of the sunset over the Pacific. By 1937,  11 streets in Hollywood were named after the Cole family.  </P> <P> Temple Street: 1859 Named after John Temple, who opened the first store in Los  Angeles. He built a block of shops, lawyers' offices and a saloon at Main and  Temple streets, where Los Angeles City Hall stands today.  </P> <P> Vignes Street: 1874 Named for Louis Vignes, who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831  bringing cuttings from France that he used to found a 100-acre vineyard called  El Aliso, where Union Station now stands.  </P> <P> Winnetka Avenue: 1916 An egg farm owned by Charles Weeks was in the Northwest  San Fernando Valley during the 1920s and early '30s. Weeks modeled the poultry  business on one he founded in Winnetka, Ill., before moving to California.  </P> <P> Wilmington Avenue: 1870 Phineas Banning, seeking to improve transportation in  the area, bought some land near the ocean, which he called New San Pedro. He  created a channel and built a wharf, warehouse, soap and tallow factory, and a  blacksmith shop. In 1863, Banning changed the name of the community to  Wilmington, after his birthplace in Delaware.  </P> <P> Wilshire Boulevard: 1895 Serving as a pathway from the Indian Village Yang Na  (believed to have been where City Hall is today) to the Pacific Ocean, it  originally was called Calle de los Indios. In 1895, H. Gaylord Wilshire, a real  estate investor, subdivided a tract of land just west of downtown near  MacArthur Park and renamed the street after himself. In 1922, lots on Wilshire  Boulevard sold for $54,000.  </P> <P> SOURCES: El Pueblo de Los Angeles State Historic Park  </P> <P> Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering, Land Development and Mapping Division.  </P> <P> A Short History of Los Angeles, by Gordon DeMarco.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Business Journal, Founding Fortunes.  </P> <P> Historical and Biographical Record of Los Angeles and Vicinity, by J.M.

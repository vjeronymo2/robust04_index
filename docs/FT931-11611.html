			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on citizenship within European union MR Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, insisted in the Commons yesterday that citizenship of the European union as envisaged in the Maastricht treaty would involve no new duties for British citizens beyond the existing duty to comply with community law as it was enforced, where necessary, by the UK courts. As MPs embarked on the tenth day of the line-by-line committee stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, there were protests from some Euro-rebels that discussion of the Maastricht treaty had become irrelevant in the wake of the devaluation of the punt. Mr Tony Marlow, Tory MP for Northampton North, argued that the legislation had become 'manifest nonsense' while Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab, Bolsover) said it was 'crazy' to continue debating the bill when the exchange rate mechanism was in effect dead. But Mr Michael Morris, chairman of the committee of the whole House of Commons, ruled that the state of the ERM was not relevant to the citizenship provisions of the treaty under discussion. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the treaty did 'not mean that we scrap our own nationality or citizenship or that we subordinate it. It means that running alongside our rights and obligations as British citizens is European citizenship.' Mr Bryan Gould, Labour MP for Dagenham, whose opposition to Labour's support for the treaty sparked his resignation from the shadow cabinet last year, claimed Maastricht would impose a duty of European citizenship which was greater than the duty of citizenship of a single country. He called for a referendum before the treaty could be ratified by Britain. Leading Labour Euro-rebel Mr Peter Shore, MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney, accused his own front bench of having failed to rise to the 'intellectual level' required by the Treaty and of being 'lulled into acquiescent silence' on its provisions. Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat spokesman, won support from some Tories when he argued that the controversy over citizenship of the European union strengthened the case for allowing British voters to make their attitude clear through a referendum. Mrs Gwyneth Dunwoody (Lab, Crewe and Nantwich) said it was 'shaming' that Labour leaders were not prepared to vote for an amendment moved for 'probing' purposes by Mr Blair and which sought to delete the citizenship provisions from the bill. Some Tory opponents of the bill joined with Labour backbenchers in voting for the amendment, which was defeated by 280-75. Debate was adjourned until Thursday.</p>

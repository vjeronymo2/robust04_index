			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE LIGHT IN THE FOREST BY CONRAD RICHTER (BANTAM: $3.50)  </P> <P> "The Light in the Forest" has been considered a classic boy's book since it  originally was published in 1953.  </P> <P> Conrad Richter's tale of divided loyalties centers on John Butler, a boy raised  by the Lenni Lenapi Indians, then returned to his white family. Perhaps because  Richter intended the book for juveniles readers, the characters are  relentlessly one-note. The honest, dignified, nature-loving Indians are not  merely Noble, but Noblest Savages; the white settlers are petty, cruel and  deceitful. The bleak, somewhat abrupt ending is considerably stronger than the  happy conclusion tacked onto the popular Disney film.  </P></p>

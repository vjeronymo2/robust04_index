			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qie (STC not available) Jianwei (1696 0251) of </F> the National Economy Office, State Planning Commission:  "Socialist Market Economy Seen As Boost to Population Planning"]    [Excerpts]    1. Population planning as a method of managing human  reproduction. [passages omitted]    In setting population control goals, drawing up a population  plan, transmitting it to lower levels for implementation, and  supervising and inspecting its implementation, we must take into  full consideration China's level of economic development and  public thinking on reproduction, which is what all of this must  be based on. Remove this base and go beyond the threshold  defined by our level of economic development, and we would  achieve nothing. Drawing up a population plan divorced from  reality, setting overly ambitious population growth targets, and  trying to reach those targets through command planning are bound  to be counterproductive in the end. There may be some  short-term success, but it is certain that it will neither last  nor be consolidated. On the contrary, we may well end up with a  compensatory population growth after a certain period of time.    The principal inconsistency in population control in China  today is essentially one between population control and the  level of economic development, between relatively advanced  population control methods and a more backward level of economic  development. Fundamentally speaking, the difficulty China has  to date in adjusting human reproduction stems from the  backwardness of economic development and the low level of  productive forces, from the fact that we are trying to establish  a relatively advanced pattern of fertility on the basis of a  backward economy. What is in existence now, it must be said, is  only the rudiments of the condition needed for adjusting the  pattern of human reproduction and population control. Thus, our  population planning, adjustment and control must similarly be  preliminary. Population planning can only be broad and flexible  guidance planning. It is unrealistic to think that we can now  achieve overly ambitious population control objectives through  mandatory population planning.    Birth control work in China was born under the planning  system and inevitably therefore exhibits many of the latter's  characteristics. In its formulation, transmission to lower  level, implementation, and inspection, as well as in its format,  targets, and content, population planning in fact has borrowed  extensively from material reproduction planning. In particular,  like command planning, population planning sets mandatory  targets that must not be exceeded. Objectively speaking, for a  variety of reasons we were nowhere near managing the process of  material reproduction completely in accordance with a command  plan even during the era of economic planning. Moreover,  history has demonstrated that orchestrating material economic  construction beyond the level of economic development in any  specific stage through command planning militates against  mobilizing the initiative of all quarters, fostering the  development of multiple economies, raising the level of  productive forces, and improving the people's living standards.  If anything, the process of human reproduction is far more  complex than market reproduction. It is influenced by a host of  factors, including politics, society, history, even religion,  geography, climate, and local customs and habits, in addition to  economic development. Furthermore, the scope of application of  population planning is wider than that of material reproduction  planning. Material planning typically involves only the  sectors, industries, and enterprises concerned. In the case of  population planning broadly defined, in contrast, people's  governments at all levels, enterprises and institutions, as well  as all basic units are responsible for organizing and carrying  out population planning. And a substantial number of citizens  nationwide are the subjects of such planning; no other form of  economic and social development planning has this  characteristic. Just consider: Given this country's relatively  low level of economic development, its long history of  feudalism, its vast size, and the diversity of regional  conditions, how can it possibly manage the very complex process  of human reproduction through command planning? Planning is  ideological. It is a subjective reflection of the objective and  is based on our projection of how objective things will develop  in the future. If we try to carry out a command population plan  coercively in isolation from the reality in China, the  inevitable result will be a divorce between the subjective and  the objective in our guiding thought. Planning and reality will  then be completely out of step with each other and the real  effectiveness of population control will suffer.    2. To cite economic planning as the basic reason for the  adoption of birth control programs in China has no basis in  fact. On the other hand, it is also not objective to deny the  intimate interdependency between China's population control  program and its highly centralized form of economic planning.  This is precisely why the formulation, transmission, and  implementation of the population control plan, as well as its  methods, which was evolved under the system of economic  planning, will take a beating now since we have made the  establishment of a socialist market economy the objective of  economic structural reform.    2.1 Economic planning emphasizes administrative management  of  a highly centralized nature whereas the market economy stresses  the use of the law of value to bring about the optimal  allocation of resources. As reform deepens, administrative  tools will play a diminishing role in economic management, some  of them replaced by economic and legal tools. Administrative  measures are the principal tools for implementing the population  plan in China. For instance, individuals who violate the birth  control policy would be subject to disciplinary sanctions and  leading cadres are the target of "one-vote veto" for failing to  accomplish the population control plan. In a market economy,  enterprises operate as independent commodity producers and  traders which exercise decision-making authority in their  operations and take risk on their own. It is the enterprises'  own bottom line that will determine their behavior. Out of  economic self-interests, enterprise leaders are absolutely free  to cut back on the use of or stop using administrative tools in  dealing with violators of the family planning policy and other  matters not directly related to production. They may even relax  birth control management or scrap such management altogether.  After the hiring system is changed, the powers and obligations  of an employer vis-a-vis his employees and vice versa will be  laid down explicitly in a contract. It is not likely that  administrative sanctions can override this legal document and  become valid, particularly in birth control cases.    2.2 With a market economy, China will no longer feature just  one form of public ownership, namely public ownership. Instead,  there will be multiple ownership systems dominated by public  ownership. This will lead to the formation of a host of  distribution mechanisms led by distribution according to work,  with others playing a supplementary role. Price reform will  spell an end to the assorted defects caused by distorted price  signals and powerfully regulate the formation of personal  disposable income. The demise of egalitarianism and the  implementation of the policy of allowing some people to get rich  ahead of others will inevitably widen income gaps. All these  changes will deal a heavy blow to economic penalties as an  instrument of birth control management. The policy of fining  somebody for violating the population control plan does not work  when the violator is high-income. He will simply pay up and  have his child anyway. The rise in the incomes of rural and  urban households will render insignificant the material  incentives for having a one-child family. The government may  make the incentives more generous but how is it going to pay for  them? As for making compliance with the birth control policy a  criterion in reviewing and approving certain types of economic  activities, that too runs counter to certain tenets of the  market economy.    2.3 In a market economy China's labor market will mature  even  more rapidly. The market restraining mechanism for achieving the  optimal allocation of labor resources through the circulation of  manpower will become stronger and stronger. Driven by economic  interests, workers will migrate between urban and rural areas,  among sectors, from one ownership system to another, and between  enterprises, breaking down all barriers that have shackled them.  Labor mobility in turn will spawn the movement of population.  The fact of the matter is that already some of the underlying  conditions that have hampered population movement have been  reformed in recent years or are about to undergo some change.  So far 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  directly administered by the central government have revamped  their grain procurement and marketing system and many cities  have abolished grain rationing. In fact grain has been  circulating on the market like any other ordinary commodity.  The rules for transforming the enterprise mechanism are clear.  Enterprises are free to decide on their own how long they want  to keep an employee and the size of their staff. There are some  restrictions on the use of peasant workers; realistically  speaking, however, it would be difficult to prevent an  enterprise from choosing workers of a particular origin based on  need. Housing reform will provide an even easier solution to  the problem of housing people and workers on the move. Also in  the works is the reform of the permanent residency registration  system. As I see it, all these reforms mentioned above are a  boost to economic development and would help check population  growth in the long run. However, we must see that the current  system of population growth management to a large extent is  dependent on the system described above. The way a birth control  policy violator is handled, for instance, is tied in with the  various rules and regulations governing residency registration,  housing, grain rationing, and employment. The implementation of  the assorted reforms mentioned above and the consequent massive  increase in the floating population will also deal a heavy blow  to the territoriality principle of the present system of  population growth management.    In remunerating the ways in which the deepening of economic  structural reform and the continuous improvement of the market  mechanism will batter the mechanism and modes of operation of  the present system of population growth management, we are not  trying to link economic planning to family planning and  population control or suggesting that the latter is based on the  former. Instead what we are saying is that we must pragmatically  understand the dependency of the operating mechanism of  population planning on economic planning, appreciate the way in  which our current work would be affected by our choice of a  socialist market economy as the goal of economic reform, and  realize the need to come up with a new population control  mechanism and methods of management based on the principles of  the market economy. The aim is to change the reproductive  aspirations of society and alter its reproductive behavior, thus  further achieving the basic national policy of family planning  in the new era.    We should not feel pessimistic because family planning work  has come under heavy pressure. If we analyze the whole picture  and think long term, in fact, the establishment of a socialist  market economy would help change the public's thinking on  reproduction in a fundamental way, which would improve the  overall climate for family planning work and create a population  growth control mechanism where the macroeconomy meets the  micoreconomy, thereby giving an impetus to family planning work  in China. This is how it will work:    a) What has happened since reform got under way proves  conclusively that a highly centralized planned economy is not  compatible with the level of productive forces in China. The  fact that there is just one ownership system is not conducive to  mobilizing the initiative of all quarters and retards economic  development. In putting forward unequivocally the establishment  of a socialist market economy as the objective of economic  structural reform, our basic purpose is to further liberate and  develop productive forces, make China more powerful all around  and raise the people's living standards. Using a wealth of  facts from both China and the rest of the world, both past and  present, many demographers have proved a causal relationship  between economic development and fertility rates and identified  the ways in which economic conditions influence reproductive  aspirations. In China, it is economic backwardness that lies at  the root of a fairly high birthrate. For this reason achieving  fast economic growth and improving the people's living standards  are a basic precondition for checking population growth. The  relatively low natural population growth rates in the West are  primarily the result of its high level of economic development.  Here in China, we can also explain the fact that the overall  urban birth rate is much lower than its rural counterpart by  pointing to the higher living standard in cities, their  relatively comprehensive social security system, and their more  complete range of services. We have every reason to believe  that as the market economy becomes more and more comprehensive  and people's living standards keep going up, the basic  conditions for birth control work will improve substantially and  the reproductive aspirations of the people will change  fundamentally.    b. The perfection of the market economy will further blur  the  boundaries between the city and the countryside and spur the  movement of rural workers and the rural population, thus  dramatically accelerating urbanization in China. In the days of  highly centralized economic planning, we used administrative  methods to sever the links between the city and the countryside  artificially and prevented the movement of the rural population  in a variety of ways, using all our ingenuity to bind peasants  to the soil. As a result, not only did Chinese urbanization  suffer badly stunted growth and peasants' living standards  lagged, but the vast number of peasants remained shackled  ideologically with the philosophy of the small peasant economy  and wedded to backward production methods, thereby hindering  their acceptance of new concepts, new thinking, and new things.  This ideological base has also reduced their acceptance of  family planning propaganda and affected the implementation of  the population plan. The development of the market economy will  bring to fruition the realignment of elements of production.  Grain, price, and housing reforms will gradually break down the  assorted barriers to peasants entering a city to work, do  business, or start an enterprise. The massive migration of  peasants and the birth and growth of small and mid-sized cities  in large numbers have become irreversible trends. When large  numbers of peasants leave the land permanently or periodically,  ending the small-peasant-economy way of life, and enter the  cities to join forces with new capital goods and new production  methods, they will become that much more amenable to new ideas,  including ideas on reproduction. This will give a boost to the  launching of rural birth control work.    c. The reform of the employment system is an important  component of the development of a market economy. In the past,  the government took care of distribution in urban areas and gave  workers jobs for life, at the same time making sure that  peasants in the countryside were kept out of the cities. Now  that arrangement will be dealt a heavy blow by the market  economy. In accordance with the rules for transforming the  enterprise operating mechanism, the enterprise hiring system of  the future will be one of dual choice. The enterprise will  decide the duration of employment, how many people it will hire,  and the form of such employment. The employee, for his part,  will also get to choose which enterprise he wants to join and in  what capacity. Nowadays, enterprises particularly state  enterprises, are over-staffed with a large number of redundant  personnel. With hiring reform, this situation will become a  thing of the past. Meanwhile, the state will phase out the  practice of providing jobs to college and technical secondary  school graduates. When we consider also the large numbers of  peasants making their way into urban areas, we could see that  the problem of labor oversupply in China will become apparent.  For a while the employment market will come under enormous  pressure. With a new mechanism, employment pressures will no  longer be artificially masked. Not only will the government be  aware of such pressures but, thanks to the media, so will every  household and every individual. The awareness of employment  pressures will influence the thinking of every individual,  forcing him to modify his behavior, including reproductive  behavior.    d. The introduction of the market mechanism into the hiring  system and employment system will hasten the maturation of the  labor market and intensify the competition for jobs among  workers. More and more, whether or not a worker lands a job,  his working conditions, and the size of his paycheck will depend  on his quality. The result is a deeper understanding by the  public of the importance of a population's quality. There comes  a point in economic development when the main driving force  behind rising household incomes is no longer an increase in the  quantity of labor inputs but an improvement in their quality.  When that comes to pass, every family will naturally take  special pains to improve the physical and cultural quality of  its children by investing significantly more in their education.  Thus willingly or unwillingly people must practice birth  control. Moreover, young men and women in their prime  reproductive years find themselves in a fiercely competitive job  market. Their mission--raising their educational standard,  acquiring work skills, and making themselves more  competitive--will also force them to have fewer children.    e. Both the reform and improvement of the urban social  security system and the creation of a rural social security  system are the objective requirements of perfecting the  socialist market economy. In urban reform we should focus on  expanding the scope of social security, diversifying the sources  of insurance funds, and establishing a personal contribution  mechanism to put an end to the practice of having the state pay  for everything. These measures will consolidate the  achievements of family planning in cities. In the countryside,  we should concentrate on establishing a variety of social  security systems to suit the characteristics of a locality. For  starters, we need to provide for the elderly. In most rural  areas in China today the elderly remain dependent on their  children to provide for them, an arrangement that will come  under challenge from the development of the market economy, the  shift of rural manpower into non-agricultural sectors, the  breakdown of urban-rural barriers, and the migration of urban  and rural workers. It is objectively imperative that this  practice be reformed and social security be introduced. Thus  establishing a social security system in the countryside is  absolutely not just a matter of providing welfare for the  elderly, but has to do with the market economy. The creation of  a rural social security system will powerfully stimulate changes  in public thinking on reproduction. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities extend gains in late trade FAVOURABLE reports of the speech by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, to the House of Commons yesterday encouraged the London stock market, which was already benefiting from the calmer performance by the French currency. Led forward by the stock index futures, the FT-SE Index extended its earlier gain to finish 40.7 points ahead at 2,621.2. The first accounts of the parliamentary debate on the UK economy reached the City of London only towards the close of the stock market trading session. The rejection by the prime minister of the likelihood of early British re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism reinforced the market's confidence that domestic interest rates can be further reduced before the end of the year. The Footsie gained a final 10 points to close at the day's best level. The heavy support operation for the French franc fuelled a new round of speculation that the Bundesbank might yet agree to cut German interest rates. This sustained the support for interest rate-orientated stocks in London, inspiring further sharp gains in the leading store and retail issues. The US dollar rallied against the pound towards the close of trading, putting renewed support behind the overseas earning stocks. With Wall Street ahead by 11.62 Dow points in UK trading hours, some of London's nervousness ahead of the US presidential election was relieved. Although the influence of the poor trading results from British Aerospace continued to overhang the engineering and aerospace sectors, the broad range of the company reporting list was in better shape yesterday. In particular, good results from United Newspapers provided a boost for advertising-related and consumer issues. Trading volume subsided a little in early deals as the stock market waited to see how currency markets would contend with the continued activity surrounding the French currency. Business in equities improved as currencies settled down, however, and the day's Seaq total reached 671.2m shares, compared with 735.4m in the previous session. Wednesday's retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.4bn, the sixth consecutive day of Pounds 1bn-plus retail volume, bringing to Pounds 11.7bn the total of retail business in UK equities since Britain's withdrawal from the ERM set the stock market's pulse racing - and underlining the presence of the big institutions. The strategy team at Smith New Court commented yesterday that the UK government 'has been forced into a policy change that is very good for the stock market', and that the combination of a cheap market, low inflation and falling interest rates will be an explosive combination for equities. Mr Nick Knight at Nomura, re-affirming his updated Footsie year-end forecasts of 3,000 this year and 3,500 for 1993, said that takeover bids could now re-emerge significantly in the London market. He added that, with the bond/equity yield ratio back to around 1.9, the need on the part of fund managers to sell equities has largely evaporated.</p>

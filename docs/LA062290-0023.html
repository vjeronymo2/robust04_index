			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $332-MILLION EMERGENCY BILL BLOCKED  </P> <P> Assembly Republicans, balking at a series of unrelated expenditures, blocked  passage Thursday of a bill that state officials say is needed to resume funding  medical treatment for the poor and paying refunds to Californians who qualify  for the renter's tax credit.  </P> <P> The $332-million emergency appropriations measure was sent instead to a  two-house conference committee, where Republicans will try to split it up so  they can vote for programs that they want to fund and vote against payments  that they oppose.  </P> <P> The bill had been approved in the Assembly on Monday, but that action was  rescinded after GOP lawmakers complained that they hadn't realized what they  were voting on.  </P> <P> When they got another crack at the bill Thursday, the Republicans peeled off,  with many voting against the measure and some not voting at all. Various  members complained about a $16.3-million appropriation for abortions performed  under the Medi-Cal program, $12.8 million to support malathion spraying against  the Mediterranean fruit fly, and $798,000 to implement the state's ban on  assault weapons.  </P> <P> The final vote was 48 to 17, with 54 votes needed for passage.  </P> <P> Until the bill is passed and signed by Gov. George Deukmejian, refunds to about  150,000 taxpayers who qualify for the state renters credit will not be mailed,  said Jim Reber, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board. Reber said the fund  set aside for those refunds has been depleted and the checks cannot be sent  until the Legislature allocates another $34 million.  </P> <P> If the bill isn't passed by the time the fiscal year ends June 30, the checks  will be funded out of the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.  </P> <P> "Those returns have been processed and the money will be refunded as soon as  the appropriation is made to the renters credit fund," Reber said.  </P> <P> The delay in passing the emergency funding bill also jeopardizes about $95  million in payments to hospitals and nursing homes serving patients in the  state's $7.5-billion Medi-Cal program. Doctors treating Medi-Cal patients have  already seen their payments halted for the rest of the fiscal year because the  program has run out of money.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there were these developments during a two-house conference  committee seeking accord on a $56-billion budget for 1990-91:  </P> <P> The Deukmejian Administration disclosed that the temporary quarter-cent sales  tax increase enacted last year in response to the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake  will come up $200 million short of reconstruction and relief needs. Before it  expires Dec. 31, the tax is expected to raise about $800 million for temporary  housing, repair to public buildings and loans to small businesses, as well as  other earthquake-related costs.  </P> <P> Partisan fighting erupted as an Orange County flood-control project became the  first sizable budget reduction. Led by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa  Clara), Democrats on the committee voted to eliminate $32.9 million put into  the budget by Deukmejian to finance the first phase of Orange County's proposed  Santa Ana River flood-control project. Vasconcellos said the money could be  restored for the project with a bond, which would have to be approved by state  voters. Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) was livid. He argued that using bond  money would create budget problems down the line.  </P> <P> "This is like a family who is in over its head with money troubles but goes out  for one more consolidated loan so it can maintain its standard of living," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Niamey, 17 May (AFP) -- The 40,000 Niger civil  servants today resumed their strike, which will last four days  this time, in order to obtain a 30- to 50-percent salary  increase to compensate for the reduction in their purchasing  power following the CFA franc devaluation.    The workers are also demanding the abrogation of a law  adopted by the National Assembly regulating the right to strike.  Civil servants have already launched two strikes, from 12 to 14  April, and from 10 to 12 May for the same reasons. On 16 April,  government authorities decided on a 5- to 12-percent increase,  adding that they would not offer any more.    "Workers are determined to multiply strikes to obtain  complete satisfaction for their demands," Ibrahim Mayaki, the  secretary general of the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger.    Despite troubles due to sporadic power cuts, banks and  business were operating normally this morning in Niamey and  airport traffic was normal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Ukraine promised to pay a  part of its debt for the Russian fuel before the deadline set by  Gazprom, the major Russian gas supplier, expires.    Rem Vikharev, head of Gazprom, told ITAR-TASS on Thursday  that he had got a message from Ukraine saying 20 million U.S.  dollars would be transferred before March 5.    "This sum does not represent a complete solution," he said,  adding that Ukraine should conduct a better search for other  means to pay.    At 10.00 a.m. today, Russia started cutting gas supplies to  Ukraine by 50 million cubic metres a day, and threatened a  complete cut-off in three days unless Kiev pays its debts for  previous deliveries.    In the meantime, an official at Ukraine's Embassy in Moscow  said the effect of Russia decision to cut gas supplies to  Ukraine should not be over-dramatized.    Ranking diplomat Vladimir Fedorov told ITAR-TASS on Thursday  that for the past twelve months, Ukraine has accumulated "great  experience in settling payments-for-gas disputes."    "Similar situations occured in the past. But Ukraine has  never been completely deprived of Russian gas," he noted.    According to Fedorov Ukraine is searching for ways to pay  its  300 billion rouble debt, an estimate which contradicts with the  Russian Gazprom company's assessments. According to them,  Ukraine owes Russia not less than 1.5 trillion roubles.    Fedorov put forward a simple version explaining the current  delay of payments. It has been caused by the failure of a deal,  according to which the Ukrainian debt had to be paid with 14  fishing boats. Now Kiev is considering other options, including  swapping consumer goods for the debt, he said.    The Ukrainian diplomat stressed that the problem has nothing  to do with state politics. It is a purely economic question, to  be setttled by Russian gas producers and Ukrainian consumers, he  said.</p>

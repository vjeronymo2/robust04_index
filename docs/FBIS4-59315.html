			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, 11 May (WAKH)--Yemeni Minister of Oil and  Mineral Resources Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun has announced that  his visit to the United Arab Emirates [UAE] comes within a tour  that will also take him to Egypt and Syria. In a statement to  the Emirates News Agency, WAM, Bin-Husaynun said that during the  visit he will convey a message from Yemeni Vice President 'Ali  Salim al- Bid to His Highness UAE President Shaykh Zayid  Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan.    The Yemeni minister denied that the ongoing conflict in  Yemen  is over oil, noting that oil was discovered in northern and  southern Yemen before the unity and that there are big oil  reserves in the North and South. He added that oil production  projects are proceeding normally in the northern and southern  oil fields. However, he said, exploration and drilling stopped  at the beginning of the war operations.    Asked if it is possible to continue talks about merger in  light of the ongoing war between the North and South, the Yemeni  minister said that Aden is now speaking about unity and the  accord document [signed in Amman]. He said: What is required  is to implement the document in letter and spirit, otherwise  nothing else will be accepted by the Yemeni people.    Asked about Sanaa's call for an immediate cease-fire  provided  that Aden recognizes legitimacy, the Yemeni oil and mineral  resources minister said: Aden supports the cease-fire. It has  responded to cease-fire calls by some Arab brothers out of its  concern to stop Yemeni bloodshed.</p>

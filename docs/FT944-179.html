			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / US takes lead over Japan in vehicle output The US has overtaken Japan this year to become the world's top motor vehicle producing nation for the first time since 1979. According to data collated by Automotive News, the US weekly, vehicle production in the US has risen by 13 per cent this year to 12.28m from 10.87m in 1993. Vehicle output in Japan has fallen by 2 per cent to 11m from 11.23m in 1993. Production in Japan has fallen for four years in succession under heavy pressure from the domestic recession and from declining exports. New vehicle registrations in Japan have shown the first signs of recovery in recent months, but, for the full year, vehicle output has fallen to the lowest level for 12 years. Production peaked at 13.49m in 1990 after first overtaking the US in 1980. In the US, vehicle production has risen rapidly during the past three years, matching the expansion in the domestic market. Output dropped to 8.8m in 1991, the low point of the last recession. It has risen by 39 per cent in the past three years to reach this year's level, however, and is forecast to increase further next year to top the previous record level of 12.899m, set in 1978. The new ascendancy of the US as the world's leading vehicle producer owes much to the restructuring of the world automotive industry over the past decade. Japanese vehicle producers have contributed greatly to the shifting balance by transferring more production out of Japan during the past 10 years, first to North America, and more recently to Europe and south-east Asia. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the big three US car producers, have restructured drastically to regain world competitiveness and their fortunes have revived, but their domestic position is under challenge. About 15 per cent of US vehicle production is now coming from Japanese carmakers' plants - either wholly owned or in joint ventures - compared with nothing little more than a decade ago. Honda was the first Japanese vehicle maker to begin car assembly in the US in 1982. Japanese vehicle makers now operate 11 assembly plants and three engine plants in North America, and Honda is the leading US car exporter. Since the early 1980s, the Japanese have built in the US an auto industry larger than that of Britain or Italy or Spain. With its improved competitiveness, the North American auto industry is becoming a growing force in world auto markets, albeit from a small base.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / EC asks UN about trial for Saddam EC FOREIGN ministers yesterday decided to ask Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the United Nations secretary general, about the feasibility of bringing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to book for war crimes. Following up an emotional plea from Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, it was agreed to seek ways in which President Saddam 'could be called personally to account for his responsibility for invading two countries - Iran and then Kuwait, for mounting genocide against the Kurds and for the use of chemical weapons,' according to Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Britain's EC affairs minister. Later today Mr Jacques Poos, foreign minister of Luxembourg which holds the EC presidency, will see Mr Perez de Cuellar at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and ask him to examine under which legal instruments Mr Saddam might be brought to account. Mr Garel-Jones said it was for the UN, not for the EC, to decide how the Iraqi leader might be tried - by special UN tribunal, or the national courts of a signatory country of the UN genocide pact, or even in absentia. Iraqi-Kurdish issues are expected to figure at a meeting here tomorrow between EC foreign ministers, and their American counterpart, Mr James Baker, which will mainly focus on a possible EC role in the regional Arab-Israeli peace conference Washington is hoping to convene.</p>

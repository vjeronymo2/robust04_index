			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata by SANKEI </F> SHIMBUN; place and date not given]    [Text] [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The geopolitical environment in  the Asia-Pacific region is undergoing changes with events taking  place such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  summit meeting, which was held for the first time last autumn.  What is your view on this point?    [Hata] While attending the Seattle meeting, I truly realized  the Asia-Pacific region has entered a new era. Acknowledging  such reality, Japan must actively make contributions. It is a  fact that nations in the Asia-Pacific region are in various  stages of economic development. What is important is that Japan  should play the role of mediator in various aspects toward  helping developing countries, being attentive to their needs.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the East Asia Economic  Caucus (EAEC) project proposed by ASEAN?    [Hata] ASEAN has indicated that the EAEC would be a  consultative group within APEC. However, this is a sensitive  issue as the Asia-Pacific region draws much interest as the  center of global economic growth. I feel it is important that  Australia and New Zealand (both of which are currently excluded  from the EAEC) be included.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How does Japan plan to approach the ASEAN  Regional Forum which will be established this year?    [Hata] There is a tendency to compare this with the CSCE,  but  I doubt there is any need to rush it (setting up a framework).  However, it is very important to help gradually build such  projects by promoting a security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific  region with the PRC and Russia joining the effort. The world  trend is that nations in a certain region act together to settle  problems that occur there, and this idea is beginning to bud in  Asia, too.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] In consideration of security in Asia, the  issue of suspected nuclear development in the DPRK (North Korea)  cannot be avoided. What is your view on this point?    [Hata] It has become an unstable factor for all of Asia. If  North Korea should withdraw its decision to pull out of the  Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and agree to conduct  talks with the ROK, Japan and other neighboring countries would  be able to help it. The unstable factor would be removed if  North Korea opened up its door.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] There is still a noted tendency among Asian  nations to take up the issue of Japan's World War II  responsibilities. What is your view on this point?    [Hata] Following a series of speeches of apology by Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the atmosphere among Asian nations  has certainly changed. During the Liberal Democratic Party's  rule, Japanese words (of apology) were very difficult to  understand, failing to straightforwardly convey Japanese  feelings and consequently leaving the Asian people concerned  bitter. We must also realize that there are some people in the  United States who actually still feel Japan will eventually  develop nuclear weapons. I feel it is meaningful for us to once  again resolve to build peace in reflection of our past mistakes.</p>

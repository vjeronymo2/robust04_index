			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing session  of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) has received  12,352 letters from people throughout China since its opening on  March 10.    Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, has paid  attention to the letters and asked relevant leaders and  departments to handle them properly.    Compared with letters in the past, this year's letters show  greater concern on state affairs and people's livelihood, such  as inflation, anti-corruption, social order, reducing peasants'  burden, and the living standard of retired officials and workers.    The letters this year also express the hope that NPC and its  Standing Committee will accelerate economic legislation and  strengthen supervision over law enforcement.    The letters handling group of the current NPC session has  classified the letters, sending those involving state affairs to  top leaders, and asking relevant departments or localities to  handle specific issues raised by the letters.</p>

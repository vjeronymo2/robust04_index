Holovatyy, a coauthor of </F> the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements, by Kateryna  Kindras; place and date not given: "Things are Not That Simple"]    [Text] People are currently arguing in the lobby of the  Ukrainian parliament and not only there on whether the  tripartite agreement on the destruction of nuclear weapons may  be regarded as an international agreement. Our correspondent  met with people's deputy S. Holovatyy, one of the coauthors of  the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements. Here is his  opinion:    [Holovatyy] The presidential team has been trying, through  the mass media, to convince everybody that the tripartite  statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and  Russia is a document that further develops the Supreme Council  decree on the ratification of START-1. Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko  said that the statement does not need to be ratified because it  is not an agreement. By doing this consciously or  unconsciously, they mislead the people. The thing is that the  Law on Ukraine's International Agreements that was adopted last  December reads that any document signed by authorized state  figures is an international agreement. I reiterate: Any  document, irrespective of its type -- accord, agreement,  protocol, note, statement, declaration, and so forth. A  statement signed by heads of three states is undoubtedly an  international agreement. However, its content is not new and  applies to those nuclear weapons whose problem has been settled  by START I, which has been ratified by the Supreme Council with  a supplement of 13 reservations.    This statement refers to START I and should, therefore, be  regarded as a document relevant to the fulfillment of the  Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START I. However,  the parliament has every right to raise the question on whether  the signing of this statement by the Ukrainian president is in  full conformity with the requirements specified by the Supreme  Council during the ratification of START I. If it turns out  that there is no such conformity, the parliament may conclude  that Ukraine is not obliged to fulfill this statement. Our  state is only obliged to fulfill START I in that form that was  validated by the exchange of ratification documents.</p>

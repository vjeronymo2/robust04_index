			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Ghali pledges to fight for human rights: New UN chief takes over from Perez de Cuellar MR Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt formally took over from Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar yesterday as the sixth secretary-general of the United Nations and pledged to create a new momentum for peace-making and 'above all' defend human rights and democracy all over the world, Reuter reports from New York. The first secretary-general from Africa, Mr Ghali said he wanted to 'create a new momentum' that would help the UN play 'a more important role in peace-keeping, peace-building, economic and social co-operation and above all defending human rights and the democratic institutions all over the world.' Mr Ghali stayed away from the UN complex on New Year's Eve to allow his predecessor, Mr Perez de Cuellar of Peru, to crown his diplomatic career with a peace accord for El Salvador, which he worked on until the clock struck 12. While the new secretary greeted his cabinet and a host of under secretary-generals warmly, it is not clear which of them will survive an expected major reform of the bureaucracy. A group of diplomats, led by Australian ambassador Mr Peter Wilenski, has already given him a host of suggestions for trimming top posts and appointing four deputies in an effort to streamline the organisation. President George Bush in talks with Mr Ghali after his November election put his weight behind the Wilenski proposals and changes are expected next month. Mr Ghali comes to his UN job with impressive credentials. He was Egypt's deputy foreign minister for 14 years and recently its deputy prime minister. He also played a pivotal role in forging the 1979 Camp David peace accords between Egypt and Israel, although the Israelis criticised him as a hardliner. Mr Ghali is known as a technocrat who avoids the limelight despite considerable foreign policy achievements. As an Egyptian he can claim to be both Arab and African. He is also a Coptic Christian from a mainly Moslem country and married to an Egyptian Jew, who converted to his religion. Mr Ghali must pick up the pieces left over from the old order, as in Cambodia and Afghanistan, and deal with a new era of ethnic warfare in Yugoslavia and the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>

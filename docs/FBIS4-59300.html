			<p>BFN     [Text] Iranian Commerce Minister Yahya ol-Eshaq today  proposed that the Iranian Government explore grounds for the  establishment of extensive relations with the African states.    Speaking at a seminar on promotion of economic ties with  Africa, the commerce minister said: The government should  prepare the grounds for the establishment of extensive economic  ties with Africa by providing transport, banking, and insurance  facilities as well as export guarantees and information. He  said: The fact that there are 450 million Muslims living in the  African continent makes it imperative to broaden Iran's ties  with that continent on the basis of mutual interest. He added:  The Iranian airlines and shipping companies are ready to invest  in this field in an effort to promote economic relations between  Iran and the African countries. He told the seminar that in  1992 only 2.09 percent of Iran's total exports were supplied to  Africa and only 0.58 percent of the goods imported to the  country came from that continent.</p>

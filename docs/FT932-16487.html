			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / HK services follow industry's path to mainland: High inflation fuels migration in search of lower land and labour costs IN THE 1980s Hong Kong's manufacturing base moved wholesale to southern China in pursuit of cheap labour and land. Now its service industries are trying to do the same thing. The colony's manufacturers moved back to the mainland in the mid-1980s after Deng Xiaoping's move to open the Chinese economy to market forces and foreign investment. They now employ about 3m in southern China, mostly in neighbouring Guangdong, and as a result Hong Kong's entrepreneurs control twice the industry they did before the move back. Like their colleagues in manufacturing, the chiefs of the colony's service industries are seeking to take advantage of lower costs across the border. But the motivation is different; it has more to do with escaping Hong Kong's persistently high inflation than with vague feelings of nationalism or the sense of 'going home'. Prices in Hong Kong rose at an annual rate of 8.7 per cent in February, but underlying inflation - which excludes energy and food prices - is at an annual rate of about 11 per cent. According to Mr Keith Ferguson, regional economist at W I Carr, the stockbrokers, Hong Kong suffers from structural inflation. 'The two key constraints are land and labour and that shows up in two sub-indices of the consumer price index, services and housing, which have been growing at annual rates of 13 per cent and 15 per cent respectively,' he says. These constraints are compounded by the Hong Kong dollar's link to the dollar. For the past 10 years it has been fixed at a rate of HKDollars 7.8. This means that Hong Kong is unable to run a monetary policy independent of the US. Interest rates track US rates, which have been designed to stimulate growth in a mature economy. In high-growth Hong Kong, low interest rates have fuelled stock and property market speculation, promoting asset price inflation. An expansionary budget, introduced by Hong Kong's governor Mr Chris Pattern in February, is also seen as promoting inflation. The Hong Kong government's fiscal balance moved from a surplus of more than HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.8bn) last year to a forecast deficit of HKDollars 3.5bn in 1993-94 - a change equivalent to nearly 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product. It is unlikely that banking, aviation and telecommunications will be able to relocate their operations with as much ease as manufacturers found. One estimate, by Hang Seng Bank, puts the potential relocation at less than 10 per cent of the services work force in Hong Kong, or about 120,000 jobs. But, as Mr Rod Edd-ington, managing director of Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's international airline, says: 'Inflation is forcing Hong Kong business to rethink the way they do things. Either capital moves to labour or labour moves to capital.' For Cathay, and its related companies, this had meant a bit of both. Cathay has relocated 200 'back office' accounts jobs to Guangzhou (Canton) for a salaries bill 25 per cent of what it was paying in Hong Kong. It has also established a back-up computer centre in Sydney; and it is encouraging its pilots to opt for 'home basing', that is, for Australian, Canadian and European pilots, to live in their home country rather than Hong Kong. 'Cathay has much of its cost base in Hong Kong,' says Mr Eddington. 'Inflation has had a significant negative effect on our business. Our product is sold in an international market place where competitive pressures are truly international.' In a related development, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company, Haeco, recently signed a joint venture agreement with the Xiamen special economic zone in Fujian province to build a USDollars 63m (Pounds 44m) aircraft maintenance facility in the zone. The facility - which is expected to be operational in 1996 - will consist of a hangar capable of accommodating two Boeing 747s, together with supporting workshops. Again high costs of both labour and land is the motive for moving out of Hong Kong. Haeco has been employing and training mainland workers who will staff the Xiamen facility when it is completed. The Hong Kong government recently gave Hongkong Bank approval to recruit up to 350 workers from southern China to help it overcome branch network staff shortages. Says Mr Paul Selway-Swift, head of the bank in Hong Kong: 'I can not recruit enough tellers. I think there has got to be a move to try to take advantage of the pool of labour that exists across the border.' The importation of labour will not produce cost savings per se - the bank will house the people it recruits and that, together with salary, will equal the cost of a local hire - but it may help relieve the labour shortage. 'What has happened in the last few years is the growth in demand for service sector employees, especially in hotels and department stores. The new entrants have to pay more than us and when we raise pay so do they. Once we have trained someone it does not take much more training for them to adapt to another job.' There is an added benefit for Hongkong Bank - similar to that for Haeco - from the importation of labour. It has ambitions to conduct full service banking in China, and a trained-in-Hong-Kong mainland staff would be a useful resource to staff such an operation. 'In the back of our mind we are aware that they could be useful to us in China, but that is not the reason we are doing it,' says Mr Selway-Swift.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] After a comprehensive test and inspection, all the  F-104 fighters which had been grounded due to their long service  life joined once again the ranks of the Air Force's fighters  safeguarding the territorial space over the Taiwan Strait. It  is estimated that the F-104 fighters will continue their service  for three to four more years to make up for the inadequacy of  combat effectiveness during this period before the F-16 and  Mirage-2000 fighters purchased from the United States and  France, respectively, are delivered. The following is a report  filed by Liu Yu-mei:    [Begin recording] [Liu Yu-mei] Separated by a distance of  merely 70 plus miles from the mainland, the Air Base in Hsinchu  occupies an important strategic position. While undertaking the  all-weather air defense mission, fighters at the base are  standing by for immediate takeoff within 3, 5, or 15 minutes  after orders are received to intercept intruding enemy aircraft,  because it will take three to four more years before the F-16  fighters purchased from the United States and the Mirage-2000  fighters purchased from France can be successively delivered.  All the F-104 fighters had been grounded due to their long  service life but, after their control system's hydraulic pipes  and electronic circuits were completely replaced with new ones  and after improvements were made in their fuselages, the Air  Force has by now completed the inspection and repair of some of  the fighers to let them undertake the necessary mission of being  on the alert and intercepting any intruding enemy aircraft. The  499th Wing of the Air Force recently conducted a Spring Festival  combat readiness exercise at the Hsinchu Air Base. The F-104  fighter squadron under the 2d Wing sent four F-104 fighters  whose test and inspection had just been completed plus four  (?F-5E/F) and four AT-3 trainers and fighters to conduct combat  exercises. Lieutenant General Sun An-kuo, director of the Air  Force's General Political Warfare Department, said that Air  Force flyers deem it their highest honor to be able to sacrifice  their holidays to undertake the air patrol mission.    [Sun An-kuo] All Air Force officers and men will make great  efforts, such as undertaking the missions of being on the alert,  on patrol, and so forth, to protect the safety of the treasured  island [Taiwan] during the Spring Festival every year. We wish  all the civilians of the country a very good time during the  Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. Though we sacrifice our  holidays, we feel it is our greatest honor.    [Liu] Due to the important strategic position occupied by  the Hsinchu Air Base, most of the Mirage-2000 fighters will be  deployed there after they are delivered in the future. At  present, the Air Force already selected more than a dozen  language and technical experts and sent them to France for  training to become certified instructors. It is estimated that  overall equipment replacement [of the fighters] will be  completed by the end of the century. [end recording]    The above report was filed by Liu Yu-mei, reporter of the  Broadcasting Corporation of China, at the Hsinchu Air Base.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Long View: Negative equity trap THOSE waggish building society statisticians are teasing us once again: Halifax told us this week that house prices rose in September and are up 1 per cent year-on-year, while Nationwide claimed they fell and are still running 2.5 per cent lower than in September last year. The difference of view might reflect the fragmentation of the housing market as well as the low volume of transactions and the building societies' loss of mortgage market share, which make the figures more erratic. Nationwide claims that the average house price is Pounds 53,000, while the Halifax says Pounds 63,000. You could read into that obvious difference in sample structure that the more expensive end of the market is now doing rather better, which fits in with local gossip down my own street. This year's lower interest rates, and the prospect of a further fall to come, have improved the tone of the market, and the stabilisation of the unemployment numbers has helped as well. On the other hand, it is possible that the revenue-starved Kenneth Clarke will further nibble away at tax relief on mortgage interest in his first Budget next month. The long view of the British housing market, moreover, is that time may be running out for the generation that regarded a home as a prime money-making asset: the demographic crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, in the shape of a shortage of first-time buyers, looms ever closer. Whatever the minor quirks of the indices, the general picture is that house prices have stabilised and are now - nationally speaking - at reasonable levels. The ratio of the average house price to average earnings is squarely within the range of 3 to 3.5, which can be regarded as normal (compared with almost 5 at the national price peak in 1989). In terms of structure, however, the market cannot be said to have yet been normalised, at any rate in the south. There, the negative equity problem persists almost untouched. Perhaps 1.5m home owners - estimates range up to nearly 2m - owe more to banks and building societies than their home is worth. Such people, most of whom are first or second-time buyers dating from 1987 to 1990, are stuck in the same, probably inadequate, accommodation after five or six years, and they could continue to be trapped for at least as long into the future. They are certainly not going to be bailed out by earnings inflation, which has been the key long-term energiser of house prices in the past: it is running at only 3.5 per cent, and is unlikely to accelerate in the near future. True, it is possible to argue - as does John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS - that the problem will generate its own solution: because of the shortage of available property in the affected regions prices there will be forced up, perhaps by 20 per cent before a demand-supply balance will be restored. I find it hard to believe this, however, because these are now some of the British economy's most sluggish regions, precisely because of the loss of the injection of demand previously provided in the 1980s by a buoyant housing market, with all the attendant release of equity and confidence-boosting wealth effect. Instead of an excess share of movers and shakers Greater London now has a higher unemployment rate than Scotland or Wales. Why would anybody pay a premium price to live in a depressed region? It was because of my fears about a continuing freeze-up in the housing market that a year ago I suggested the launching of a lifeboat, a national household mortgage workout scheme to take over the troubled debt. This could at least have lubricated the market (recently transactions have only been running at half the rate of 2.15m recorded in 1988) and released young people from imprisonment in starter homes, although they would still have Pounds 10bn or more of residual debt hanging over them indefinitely. In the circumstances any recovery in the housing market could now prove patchy and distorted. Yet the upper end of the market, where the mortgage problem scarcely applies, could respond to economic growth and the ready availability of reasonably cheap loans. In the north and Scotland, too, there is scope for business as usual: prices in Scotland are now a fifth higher than in 1989. The trouble is, people are less willing than they were to take on huge debts. On average, a house purchase requires a 75 per cent advance, worth approaching Pounds 50,000. Since 1989 the total of mortgage debt has gone up from Pounds 250bn to Pounds 350bn, and it surely cannot rise very far in the future. We may have entered a period of low interest rates but the personal sector is much more indebted than it was before the previous house price booms in the early 1970s and the late 1980s. And it may well be that 250,000 repossessions in the past five years have left their mark on attitudes in Acacia Avenue. So although I would expect house prices to rise over the next year, I would be surprised if the average increase were more than 5 per cent. Looking further ahead, moreover, there is the problem of the baby slumpers. The number of 17-year-olds is about 30 per cent less than the population of 25-year-olds who are now entering their prime first-home buying years. In the immediate future first-time demand should remain fairly healthy because it is likely to be supplemented by buyers who have been waiting for the market to stabilise. Last year's 400,000 first-time purchases compared with the potential 'normal' figure of perhaps 550,000, so there is pent-up demand out there. Between 1995 and 2000, however, the adverse demographic trend will become noticeable. Come the new millennium, I suspect, the rival building society house price indices will no longer be divergent but will be telling much the same dreary story.</p>

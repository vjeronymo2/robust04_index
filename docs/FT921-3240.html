			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Earthquake toll reaches 320 as more help arrives THE death toll in the Turkish earthquake disaster reached 320 yesterday, with another 150 feared dead. Fears that the toll might reach 1,000 were discounted, Reuter reports from Erzincan. More international rescue teams joined increasingly desperate efforts to find survivors amid the rubble of Erzincan. Hundreds spent the night in tents or under blankets, prompting protests to the governor's office yesterday demanding extra help with food and shelter. Villagers from outlying areas expressed anger about lack of help. Erzincan's deputy governor, Mr Mehmet Unal, said US, Swiss and Turkish teams helped by more than 2,700 troops were digging for people buried under collapsed multi-storey buildings. Teams from Russia and France were expected to join rescue efforts yesterday. Last night the Council of Europe, which is co-ordinating aid efforts, said there were enough doctors at the scene but more medicines were needed.</p>

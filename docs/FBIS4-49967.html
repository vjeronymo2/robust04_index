			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- The domestic investment  willingness of local small- and medium-sized business has  rebounded, an indication that the overseas relocation fever  among Taiwan industries has been easing, the Ministry of  Economic Affairs reported Wednesday [11 May].    Citing a recent survey on 1993-1994 investment willingness  of  local industries, Vice Minister S.J. Li said 64 percent of the  manufacturers and companies surveyed -- up from last year's 57  percent -- said they had plans to invest at home this year while  those who said they did not dropped by 6.4 percent to 36 percent.    Those manufacturers and companies who are planning to invest  at home will mainly boost purchases of machinery and expand  facilities, Li said, adding that only 25 percent of the  companies plan to pour more than NT$20 million (about  US$800,000) into new investment projects this year, noticeably  down from last year's 35.7 percent. Some 33 percent will invest  from NT$1 million to NT$5 million, Li noted.    Meanwhile, Mainland China remains the favored site for  Taiwan  industries when choosing overseas production bases, with 64  percent of the respondents saying they preferred the mainland to  other countries because of the cheap cost of labor there.    The survey also found that most local manufacturers hope the  government will allow more foreign workers into Taiwan and  provide more land for industrial use as well as more financial  assistance. They also want the government to step up efforts to  shut down illegal factories and increase the pace of developing  more small-scale industrial zones, according to the survey.</p>

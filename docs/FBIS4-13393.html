			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman--The U.S.-led naval force patrolling the  Red Sea has denied entry to another al-'Aqabah-bound vessel on  grounds that it was carrying "unauthorised" spare parts for  Iraq, shipping officials said Tuesday [19 April].    They said the Polish-flag Moniufzko, which had among its  Jordan-bound cargo 30 tonnes of spare parts for tractors  imported by the Iraqi government, headed for Port Suez to unload  the consignment.    "The inspectors ruled that the U.N. approval for the spare  parts dated back to November 1993, and as such it was no longer  valid," said one of the officials.    The parameters that the inspectors apply to determine the  validity of U.N. approvals were not immediately known. But,  according to U.N. diplomats, there is little coordination if any  at all between the inspectors and the U.N. Sanctions Committee.    U.N. Security Copuncil Resolution 687 of April 1991 exempts  food and medicine as well as items related to food and medicine  from the sanctions the world body imposed on Iraq in August 1990  following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    As such, spare parts for tractors are exempt since they are  used in the agriculture sector to produce food. Exemption  certificates are issued by the Sanctions Committee, which  comprises 15 members of the Security Council itself.    The absence of coordination between the inspectors and the  sanctions committee became apparent in several instances when  the inspectors rejected the committee's certification saying  they were forgeries.    The authenticity of the documents was established in all  cases, but not before ships carrying cargo covered by them were  turned away from al-'Aqabah, leading to severe losses to  importers.    The Moniufzko, which is carrying nearly 500 tonnes of  general  cargo, most of it in 30 full containers, would return to  al-'Aqabah after the "suspect" cargo is off-loaded at Port Suez,  the officials said.    The Moniufzko, operated by a Chinese-Polish joint venture,  was the 14th ship to be intercepted and denied entry to  al-'Aqabah this year by the enforcers of the sanctions against  Iraq patrolling the Red Sea. In 1993, they turned away 20  ships. [passage omitted]</p>

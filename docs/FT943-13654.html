			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Nabisco and Pfizer launch fat substitute Nabisco Foods Group and Pfizer Food Science yesterday announced the launch of a fat substitute, Salatrim, to be used in low-fat chocolate bars, ice cream and cheeses. Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco, hopes to launch the product in chocolate bars by mid-1995, breathing new life into the faltering fat substitutes industry. Satisfactory fat substitutes have been difficult to develop without destroying the taste of products, as fat carries taste to the mouth. Those that have been developed have also experienced difficulty in gaining Food and Drug Administration approval. Procter &amp; Gamble's Olestra has been mired in the approval process for years. However, Salatrim is unlikely to get delayed by the FDA, according to Mr Hank Sandbach, a spokesman for Nabisco Foods Group, because it is made from natural substances. It has also solved the problem of taste, its makers claim, by combining fat substitutes with fat. Derived from short-chain acids found in vinegar and cheeses, and steric acids found in vegetable oils, Salatrim contains fewer calories than traditional fats because it contains more large molecules, which are not so easily digested. Salatrim contains five molecules of fat per gram - more than competing fat substitutes, but less than traditional fat. The market for low-fat products in the US is potentially great, with Americans showing increasing concern about their weight, as evidenced by the explosion of the diet industry. Americans also seem to be fighting a losing battle with fat. The number of obese adults in the US has surged dramatically over the last ten years, according to a recent study by the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between 1960 and 1980, a quarter of all American adults were judged obese. By 1991, that had jumped to one third. 'The government and health organisations have been pushing Americans to lower their fat intake for years,' said Lyn Nabors, executive director of the Calorie Control Council in Atlanta. 'But the message is not really getting through. Consumers don't seem to want to sacrifice taste at all, which is why a good-tasting fat substitute is so important.' Pfizer Food Science says it hopes to launch ice creams, cheeses, and baked goods made with Salatrim soon. Margarines and spreads will be introduced later. So far, the company has not found a way to use the product for frying.</p>

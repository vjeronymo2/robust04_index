			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "With the Election Program for the </F> Family and Public Safety, the National Democratic Federation  Proposes To Reinstate the Death Penalty"]    [Text] Yesterday's news conference by the National  Democratic Forum focused on the family because this issue is an  organic part of the election program of the National Democratic  Federation [NDSZ]. According to NDSZ Chairman Imre Pozsgay, this  is all the more timely because the United Nations has declared  1994 the year of the family.    Analyzing this subject, the NDSZ issued a separate  information booklet and NDSZ spokesman Karoly Lorant summed up  the content of this booklet. Among other things, he pointed out  that while the European countries with the smallest demographic  increase showed an average of 0.5 percent increase in population  annually in the past decade, the population of Hungary is  dropping at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. The role of the  family is constantly weakening and the percentage of one-parent  families is increasing. In addition, the number of births is  decreasing and the health condition of the population is  constantly deteriorating. It is probably the result of all  these factors that we are witnessing a worldwide unique  phenomenon here, namely a decrease in the number of the  population in peace time. The NDSZ is convinced that one can  and must change this trend, and the key to this is an increase  in the role of the family and return to its former social rank.    The NDSZ election program wants to find long-term solutions  by taking all this into consideration, Karoly Lorant pointed  out. The NDSZ is in favor of coexistence of several generations  and of support for families with children and for starting a  family. The NDSZ wants equal opportunities in education and a  job for every person starting his career. In addition, the NDSZ  finds it necessary to carry out a thorough modernization of the  pension system, with particular emphasis on preserving the real  value of the pensions.    In the second half of the news conference, Imre Pozsgay and  parliament Deputy Zoltan Varga answered questions regarding the  elections. Imre Pozsgay said that the NDSZ would probably have  a candidate in every individual election district, as well as a  list in all the counties and in Budapest. However, Imre Pozsgay  declined to say anything about the nominees because the list  must first be accepted by the national committee at its meeting  scheduled for the middle of February. Imre Pozsgay and Zoltan  Biro have not yet decided on whether to run as individual  candidates. At the same time, Imre Pozsgay's words allow us to  speculate that he would not reject such a development.    Zoltan Varga announced at this news conference that together  with his colleague Peter Szell, they intend to present a legal  amendment proposal to parliament regarding the restoration of  the death penalty. Their decision came in the wake of the  tragedies in their election district and in Szeged and the  ensuing panic mood.</p>

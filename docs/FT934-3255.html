			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Brazil cancels PQU privatisation auction The privatisation auction of Petroquimica Uniao, the Brazilian petrochemical company, has been cancelled because less than 7 per cent of the shares on offer were bought. The last time a privatisation auction was cancelled was in 1991, for Enasa, a small river transportation company. The PQU auction had been postponed five times and there are doubts whether the company will be offered for sale again under the present administration, which leaves office in early 1995. The government valued the company at Dollars 559m. The cancellation was expected after Monday's auction when only 3.07m shares of the 50m on offer were bought. In a second session on Tuesday, only 378,000 more shares were bought and the auction was declared invalid by the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange. PQU's main prospective buyer, a consortium of petrochemical-related companies including Union Carbide and Shell Brasil, decided not to take part because of a dispute with the government over a new pricing formula for petrochemical naphtha, PQU's main raw material. The government's proposed formula, which it has still not officially announced, will link naphtha prices to a basket of imported crude oils and imported naphtha. The cancellation leaves PQU controlled by Petroquisa, a subsidiary of Petrobras, the government-owned oil company.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Congress leaders outline tax cut scheme Leading Republicans yesterday outlined an aggressive programme to cut both US government and taxes, promising to move swiftly in January to reduce spending before moving on to tax relief measures. 'We will do more in the first 100 days than has been done in the last 10 years in this town,' Mr Dick Armey, the incoming House majority leader, said on television. He and Congressman John Kasich, incoming House budget committee chairman, again attempted to seize the initiative from President Bill Clinton, who offered a tax reduction scheme on Thursday. They said the House, immediately after convening, would create an 'American tax relief savings account' which would hold the savings from programme cuts to pay for tax reductions. 'Nobody on Main Street and no-one on Wall Street is going to think we're going to give out the goodies without cutting government first,' Mr Kasich said. They would move immediately to lower previous budget caps and force appropriation subcommittees to make spending reductions. Those savings would go into the special 'bank', Mr Kasich said. 'Whenever we pass any of these incentives, like the family tax relief programme, we'll draw down the bank.' Republican Senator Bob Packwood, incoming chairman of the finance committee, predicted Congress would pass a 'balanced budget' amendment to the US constitution by April. He forecast this would win approval by the state legislatures next summer. Various versions of the amendment would require a balanced budget in five to seven years. Senator Pete Domenici, incoming budget committee chairman, said there would be 'a revolution in this country', with scores of programmes eliminated or cut. 'I've got the longest list in town,' said Mr Armey, suggesting the Departments of Energy and Education could be eliminated and the Commerce Department and the Environmental Protection Agency severely reduced. The Republicans - who said they had two or three budgets already prepared - indicated a willingness to work with Mr Clinton. His tax cut plan would be considered, said Mr Bill Archer, a Texas Republican. 'He came late to the dance, but he's on the dance floor and we welcome that.' They would back a temporary line item veto, for perhaps four to six years, to enable the president to cut individual items of 'fat' from the budget. Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

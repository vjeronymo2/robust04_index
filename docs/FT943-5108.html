			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / County review defies guidelines Derbyshire's two-tier system of local government should stay intact, the Local Government Commission announced yesterday, in defiance of the government, which favours replacing two-tier counties and districts with all-purpose unitary authorities. While the commission recommends Derby becomes a separate all-purpose unitary authority, it says the rest of Derbyshire, which is traditionally Labour-dominated, should continue to be administered by a county council and eight district councils. It has withdrawn its earlier proposal to form a separate unitary authority by merging the districts of Bolsover, Chesterfield and North East Derbyshire. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, rejected that proposal for the county because he thought it possible to find a unitary solution for the rest of the county. The commission now favours creating just the Derby unitary authority. It said: 'During the last nine months, support for a new unitary council in the north-east of the county has eroded. At the same time, the county council and five district councils have proposed ways to make the two-tier system work more effectively.' It said a unitary Derby would cost between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m to set up but was unsure of the effect on annual costs, which it believes could be either Pounds 2m greater or Pounds 2m less as a result of the change. The alternative of setting up a separate 'north-east Derbyshire' as well as unitary Derby, which the commission described as 'viable', would cost between Pounds 8m and Pounds 10m, with possible further annual costs of Pounds 1m. The Association of County Councils, which supports the new proposal, said the commission had 'sent a clear signal to the government that it will not be bullied into finding a unitary solution just for the sake of it'.</p>

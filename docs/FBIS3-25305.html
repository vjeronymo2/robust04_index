			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gert van der Westhuizen] </F>   [Text] Most right wing leaders yesterday rejected a  proposal providing for a right-wing homeland.    However, Koos Botha, Independent MP for Wonderboom, said  that  Afrikaners must grab this opportunity because they will not get  a "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] any other way.    Some time ago, the government and the ANC [African National  Congress] proposed to the Afrikaner National Front [AVF] that  self-determination, with the possibility of a homeland, could be  added as a 34th principle of the new constitution.    Botha reckons that this proposal offers the only sensible  solution. "Afrikaners who are really serious about a volkstaat  would then be able to indicate in the election exactly how  strongly they feel about this idea."    He said that a volkstaat cannot be attained through a war.  "How are Afrikaners going to make war in a country where in any  given region they are in the minority?"    The chairman of the Afrikaner Freedom Foundation [AFF],  Professor Carel Boshoff, said that the AFF believed from the  start that a volkstaat had to be entrenched in the constitution.  However, according to Boshoff, Afrikaners' participation in the  election on the basis of this proposal is linked to further  negotiations relating the minimum demands of the Freedom  Alliance [FA].    "If the principle of a volkstaat is acceptable to the  constitution, then there is no reason why the FA's minimum  demands can also not be part of it."    Boshoff said it would be of no use trying to determine the  geographic region for a volkstaat through a referendum as the  vote of the Afrikaner will be in the minority throughout the  whole country.    HNP [Reformed National Party] leader Jaap Marais rejected  the  proposal. According to him it is a cunning trick by the  government and the ANC to get the Afrikaner to go to the ballot  box.    "This is the one thing that we must not do. By doing so we  will be lending legitimacy to the election and deprive ourselves  of the moral right to any future civil uprising." He says it is  ridiculous to expect the Afrikaner to go and live in a volkstaat  while the whole country belongs to him.    Boer State Party leader Robert van Tonder said the Afrikaner  could not win anything by participating in the election. "We can  only lose everything. Participation will cause dissension in  right-wing ranks."    Boer Resistance Movement leader Andrew Ford branded the  proposal a "farce" that was part of the "communist strategy."</p>

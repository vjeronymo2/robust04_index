			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 30 (CTK) -- "Murderer, where are our  brothers?" reads the banner unfolded today by Jan Chladek and  Marek Mamon outside the Chilean Embassy. A Chilean military  delegation arrived today in Prague, but the arrival of Chilean  Ground Forces Chief Commander Augusto Pinochet has not been  confirmed although it had been notified.    Chladek said that Pinochet's visit had a special meaning for  him. He said he was born in Chile to a Czech father and Chilean  mother whose family had suffered a great deal under Pinochet's  regime, losing several of its members. After a calm  intervention by the Czech Police, the demonstrators removed the  banner.</p>

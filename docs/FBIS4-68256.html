			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Poroskov: "Fall Draft Ends in March; </F> What Will Spring Draft be Like?"]    [Excerpt] Yesterday's issue of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published  the edict of the Russian Federation President "On Drafting  Citizens of the Russian Federation for Military Service in  April-June 1994, and on Discharging Privates, Seamen, NCOs,  Petty Officers and Military Construction Workers Having Served  the Established Term of Military Service." On 15 April of this  year the defense minister signed the corresponding order. These  documents will evoke joy in some, and anxiety over a son's  soldierly fate in others. For workers of mobilization offices  and military commissariats they mean the beginning of another  period of hard work, full of worries and, sometimes, unresolved  problems.    In recent years the draft has become a painful point for the  country, a point of intersection of often diametrically opposed  interests of different people and departments. And the main  purpose of this matter of statehood--providing for the country's  defense--has faded somewhere back into second or third priority.    The fall draft of last year essentially dragged on into  February and March of this year. Of course in the official  terminology of military commissariats the draft ended on 31  December 1993, followed by a period of assignment of the  recruits to the forces. But for practical purposes this has all  obviously been a single continuous period.    The causes of this unprecedented phenomenon are known:  Almost  80 percent of draftees received deferments from service--50 to  continue their studies, 23 for health reasons, 4 for work in the  arts, education and public health, and 3 because of their family  situation. Seventy thousand potential draftees are on the run.  Consequently last year less than 22 percent of persons on the  draft rolls were drafted. For comparison, in neighboring Finland  this figure is equal to 90.    Through the efforts of the Main Organizational and  Mobilizational Directorate of the Main Staff, of workers of the  military commissariats and draft boards, and of representatives  of the heads of local administrations, at the beginning of this  year we were able to achieve a turning point in this negative  trend: Eighty percent of the planned number of draftees were  already in the army and navy. By the end of March, the figure  increased. [passage omitted]</p>

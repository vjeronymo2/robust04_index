			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society  has recently issued a statement in connection with the fact that  the Seoul authorities have attempted to take Koreans residing in  Sakhalin to the ROK. Regarding this, Mr. (Yi Genari), chairman  of the Russian Branch of the Pomminnyon International Committee  to Promote Korean Reunification, came today to our Moscow radio  station and spoke as follows:    [Begin (Yi Genari) recording, in Russian with simultaneous  translation into Korean] First of all, I would like to remind  you that there are approximately 500,000 Koreans in the  territory of the former USSR. Among them, over 120,000 Koreans  -- including scholars, artists, well-educated doctors,  technicians, and agricultural officials -- live in Russia. All  of them are now living and working in and greatly contributing  to the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the CIS  countries. All of them are deeply rooted in this land.    Speaking of the Koreans living in Sakhalin, all of them are  workers who were forcibly taken into Sakhalin by the then  Japanese imperialist aggressors from North and South Korea  between 1938 and 1945. After the Japanese imperialists were  defeated during WW II, the Japanese people who lived in Sakhalin  were the only ones able to return to their home, but the Koreans  had to stay there without their jobs. According to data provided  by the Korean Association in Sakhalin, there are 1,700 Korean  households in Sakhalin whose members were forced to live there  before 1945. They are separated from their family members.    After receiving the statement issued by the Central  Committee  of the DPRK Red Cross Society, I have come to believe that the  problems of Koreans in Sakhalin should be jointly solved by  Russia and the DPRK, only after the Japanese Government makes an  official apology for its past act of forcibly taking them into  Sakhalin and makes compensations for it. Therefore, the issue of  Korean immigration from Sakhalin is not a matter of  humanitarianism as demanded by Seoul, but rather has emerged as  a political matter.    In conclusion, I would like to express my deep appreciation  to the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society for the  protection of the interest of all Koreans, those who live in  North and South Korea, as well as in foreign countries,  including the CIS countries.

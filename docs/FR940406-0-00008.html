			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department does not believe the interim rule conflicts with any on-line system presently in operation. In the final rulemaking implementing categorical eligibility and application provisions of the Leland Act, published at 56 FR 63611 on December 4, 1991, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)(3) to give FNS authority to review and approve deviations from the FNS-designed application form, including the use of on-line application forms. The Department believes this oversight authority will ensure that on-line application forms contain the mandatory information required by law. The Department is therefore adopting the interim provision in 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(iv) as final without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also received a general comment which recommended the final rule specifically indicate when the term ``applications'' refers to the applicant's initial request for certification only, and when it refers to recertification. For food stamp purposes, the Department does not differentiate between certification and recertification. In both situations, a household must complete and submit a food stamp application form, provide verification of information and participate in an interview with an eligibility worker. Therefore, the term ``applications'' in the interim rule and in this final rule refers to both initial certification and subsequent recertifications. The Department is, however, considering differentiating between initial certification and subsequent recertification. The Department is currently developing a proposed rule to consider means to simplify program requirements, including simplifying recertification procedures. In that rule, the Department may propose introducing differences in processing initial applications for certification and applications for recertification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Joint Processing of Applications_7 CFR 273.2(j) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 352 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 reinstated joint application practices that were previously required under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as originally enacted, but subsequently were made optional by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;253, 96 Stat. 763, Sept. 8, 1982). Accordingly, the interim rule, published June 7, 1989, amended 7 CFR 273.2 (j) and (j)(1)(i) to require State agencies to join the application for food stamps with the application for public assistance (PA) and general assistance (GA) and to notify AFDC applicants of their right to file a joint application. The interim rule also amended 7 CFR 273.2(j)(1) to add a new paragraph (j)(1)(v) which specified that households whose PA/GA eligibility was terminated shall not be required to file a new application, but shall have their food stamp eligibility and benefits determined by available information from the PA/GA casefile provided the information is sufficient for food stamp purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments on the mandate for joint processing of applications were nearly evenly split between opponents and proponents. One commenter recommended the final rule mandate development of a single, universal application for all needs-based assistance programs. Another commenter focused on the issue of whether the interim rule exceeded the legislative intent of section 352 by requiring a single ``application'' for both food stamps and AFDC when only a single ``interview'' is necessary. The commenter felt the interim rule should be amended to mandate only a joint interview for food stamp/AFDC applicants, not a joint application. Another commenter disagreed with the requirement to include the application for food stamps in the application for GA benefits because GA is a State-run program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to the first comment recommending the development of a single, universal application, the Department has found that many State agencies have already developed ``multi-program'' forms, i.e., one form is used for food stamps, PA and GA, and medical assistance. The Department feels State agencies are in a better position to design application forms that enhance the administration of their benefit assistance programs. For this reason, the Department believes mandating a single, universal application form is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department disagrees with the premise of the second comment, which stated that the interim rule exceeded legislative intent by mandating a joint application for both food stamps and AFDC rather than just a joint interview. Section 11(i) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(i)), as amended by section 352 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, requires that households in which all members are included in a federally aided public assistance grant (such as AFDC) have their application for food stamps contained in the public assistance application form. The Department believes the law is clear in requiring a joint application for food stamps and PA (as used here, PA is defined at 7 CFR 271.2).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

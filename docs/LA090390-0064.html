			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> R.S.V.P.;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL KICKS OFF WITH FEAST OF MIXTURES  </P> <P> The first day of the Los Angeles Festival concluded with Japanese theater and  American jazz -- an eclectic mix that seemed to fit what the festival's all  about.  </P> <P> The "Legend of the Water Flame," a contemporary piece drawn from an old  Japanese legend, premiered Saturday night at the Japan America Theater.  Afterwards, guests strolled the plaza in the cool night air, queued for a rich  dessert buffet and listened to the Red Callendar trio play jazz classics.  </P> <P> "It was exquisite," said festival director Peter Sellars of "Legend." "I know  it's going to haunt me for the next couple of days, it's going to come back to  me."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Sellars and thousands of others had gone south to San Pedro  for opening-day ceremonies, launching 16 days of theater, music, dance, video,  ethnic rituals and performance-art pieces featuring artists from the Pacific  Rim.  </P> <P> That day's ceremonies "moved some people to tears," said Sellars at the  reception.  </P> <P> "It's so shocking and moving to see these people perform. Audiences were again  and again moved. The performers are so open and emotionally direct and American  audiences hunger for that pure humanity. There's nothing synthetic there --  it's all completely authentic."  </P> <P> The diminutive Sellars, his spikey dark-blond hair standing at attention like  new-mown grass, wore a baggy gold plaid tunic and pants he said he had bought  that day from the African Marketplace at one of the festival sites.  </P> <P> "I bought, like, three of these," he said. "It's the only place I'm going to  shop from now on."  </P> <P> Although the audience responded warmly to "Legend" (performed in Japanese with  some English translation projected on a backdrop), others were caught napping  through parts, only to be awakened by loud percussion.  </P> <P> Performance artist Rachel Rosenthal was enthusiastic about the piece, saying:  "I was particularly moved by the actress." Rosenthal seemed pleased that her  Los Angeles Festival shows were almost sold out, adding that she hoped the  festival would broaden her audience.  </P> <P> Guests were presented with festival pins, which some immediately affixed to  lapels. They also received navy-and-white Japanese head wraps, which some tied  around their heads or turned into kerchiefs, shawls or handbag accessories.  </P> <P> Among the speech-givers at the reception were AT&amp;T vice president Jerry  Arca, festival board chairman Maureen Kindel, Mayor Tom Bradley, Japanese  American Cultural and Community Center executive director Gerald Yoshitomi and  film director James Bridges.  </P></p>

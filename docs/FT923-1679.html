			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The gilts market is responding with curious ambivalence to the possibility of lower UK base rates. The short end continues to discount a rather aggressive cut: the yield on the 12 per cent stock due 1995 has fallen by nearly 2 percentage points to 8.6 per cent since last Wednesday night. The long end appears relatively unruffled by the inflationary consequences of easier money. Over the same period, the yield on 25 year paper has risen by only 0.4 points to 9.2 per cent. Perhaps the actual rate cuts will be less than the markets were originally expecting. Mr Major again yesterday stressed his commitment to the fight against inflation. If he is to be believed, the price pressures unleashed by the devaluation will be held in check. Still, the long end of the gilts market may be too sanguine. The borrowing requirement will remain large over the next few years and foreign investors can no longer be so easily counted on to fund it. Last week's intervention has taken care of immediate funding needs, but even with some pick-up in growth next year, the PSBR could still be in the Pounds 35bn range. The trouble is that foreigners may blow hot and cold on gilts, depending on their perception of the exchange rate, while domestic institutions are again enthused by equities. Two conclusions follow. First, funding constraints point to sharply tighter fiscal policy - a point which, incidentally, should not be lost on contractors and other companies dependent on public sector business. Second, the gilt/equity yield ratio, still just under two, may return to its more normal range of two to 2.5 after the devaluation. But it may be more a question of higher real yields on gilts than lower ones on equities.</p>
